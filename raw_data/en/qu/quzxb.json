The Department of Health and Social Care is consulting on removing vaccination against Covid-19 as a condition of deployment for health and social care professionals in England. The GCC Code requires registrants to maintain the highest standards of professional and personal conduct, protecting patients and colleagues from harm. We have consistently emphasised the importance of vaccination in protecting yourself, patients and the public. In the early rollout we supported many registrants to access vaccination as a registered healthcare professional. The GCC does not make Covid-19 vaccination status a condition of registration, nor do we consider turning down the Covid-19 vaccination to be a fitness to practise matter. However, as a valued healthcare professional and registrant of the GCC, you are a leader and have special responsibilities, including a professional responsibility to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection to others, as far as possible. Being vaccinated to prevent transmission of Covid-19 in healthcare settings, as the great majority of health and social care workers are, is part of that responsibility. Since January 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has authorised the use of Covid-19 vaccines in the UK, following a rigorous review of their safety, quality and efficacy. The clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines have shown them to be effective and acceptably safe. We all know that protection from infection is not absolute. Getting vaccinated against Covid-19 reduces the risks of infection and serious illness. If you are not infected, you cannot pass on the virus. If you are concerned about vaccination, please do seek advice and support, for example from your GP or employer. The GCC urges registrants across all parts of the United Kingdom to get the Covid-19 vaccination. We hope those of you who have not, will consider doing so now. "}
