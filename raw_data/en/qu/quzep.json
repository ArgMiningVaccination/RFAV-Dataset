Or have you been in pain for a while and want to get better? Adding dietary supplements to your diet might be just what you need for overall wellness.

Common dietary supplements include: - Vitamins and minerals like B12, vitamin A, calcium, and iron - Herbs and botanicals like peppermint, chamomile, rosemary, and lavender - Enzymes like lactase, which helps in the digestion of milk What Are the Benefits of Dietary Supplements? Adding dietary supplements to your regular dietary routine can help: - Improve bone health - Improve your health during pregnancy - Improve sleep - Reduce chronic pain - Boost immunity - Improve cognitive function - Reduce the risk of heart disease What to Expect During a Dietary Supplement Appointment While you do not need a prescription to obtain dietary supplements, it's best to speak to your doctor or nutritionist before you start adding them to your diet. A certified practitioner at Holistic Chiropractic & Healing Arts Center will begin your appointment by asking you a series of comprehensive questions to determine your current health status, including whether you're currently on any medications that may negatively react with any dietary supplements you may be prescribed. You may have side effects from certain dietary supplements, especially if taken in high doses, combined with certain medicines, or taken before surgery. Some dietary supplements like herbal supplements can also be toxic. An accurate evaluation by a certified practitioner can help you avoid this.
