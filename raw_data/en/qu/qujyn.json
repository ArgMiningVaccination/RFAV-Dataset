Sickle cell Anaemia It is one of the rarest and the most severe blood disorders that can happen. The sickle cells in the body can block the blood flow, which is harmful and can lead to severe conditions. The sickle cell is in an abnormal shape which makes it different from the other cells. 3. Aplastic anaemia It is the kind of anaemia that is caused when there are not enough red blood cells in the body. Within every 120 days, red blood cells are produced in the body, and if the bone marrow fails to produce enough red blood cells, then it leads to anemia. 4. Hemolytic anaemia It is the kind of anaemia that is caused because of the red blood cells getting destroyed before the normal lifespan is over. The bone marrow is not able to produce new red blood cells when the body needs it, and it causes issues in the body. 5. Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia The body needs enough vitamin B12 for the proper production of hemoglobin. There are mainly animal products that are rich in vitamin B12, so if you're a vegetarian, then chances are that you might have Vitamin B12 deficiency in your body, and it can also hamper the production of hemoglobin in your body which can further result in anemia.
