Gentle Chiropractic provides maximum benefit from minimal visits. Chiropractic care can - reduce pain, - increase movement - improve performance. This may allow you to avoid unnecessary drugs or surgery. Gentle chiropractic is a relatively new form of chiropractic care. It's different than traditional chiropractic care. Traditional chiropractic treatments use twisting, cracking, and popping. These treatments can be helpful because they can loosen tight muscles and joints. After a traditional adjustment, you might be sore. This can happen because your muscles and joints are not used to that kind of stress. Many devoted fans of chiropractic think the benefits are well worth the temporary discomfort. There are some patients for whom traditional spinal and joint manipulations are not recommended. Traditional high-velocity chiropractic adjustments are not recommended for patients with advanced osteoporosis, and certain types of inflammatory arthritis. Gentle chiropractic is different. It's a subset of the over 150 different techniques chiropractors use to manually adjust the spine, joints and muscles. Gentle chiropractic techniques replace high-velocity adjustments with low-velocity, low amplitude manipulations. It is performed with a gentle touch, targeting a specific area. Advanced Wellness Solutions can effectively treat pain in your neck, back, wrists, shoulders, hips and knees. Gentle chiropractic includes the gentle manipulation of soft tissue. This helps stop muscle spasms and tenderness. Manual traction can help slowly stretch your joints. It also increases your range of motion. If appropriate, you may be given exercises to perform at home.
