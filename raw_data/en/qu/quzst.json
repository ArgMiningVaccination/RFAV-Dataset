We cannot refill schedule 1 or 2 medications; this means Dr. Tais cannot prescribe any narcotic pain medication or ADHD medication, but can recommend natural alternative or refer you to a psychiatrist or pain specialist. Dr. Tais also cannot complete any state disability or employment forms that specifically require a signature from an MD or DO. At this time our office does not carry any vaccines but we are planning to add vaccines in the near future. "}
