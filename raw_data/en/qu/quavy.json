At the time of your visit, your healthcare provider will determine which vaccines are needed. The choice of vaccines depends on where and when you are traveling, your past vaccination history and your health history. We will review your routine vaccine record and update your vaccines as needed. Additional vaccines may include one or more of the following: - Hepatitis A - Hepatitis B - Influenza - Japanese encephalitis - Meningococcus - Polio - Pneumococcus - Rabies - Typhoid fever - Yellow fever - Standard adult/children vaccinations including: Tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis and MMR How soon before my trip should I see you? Ideally, schedule your appointment at least 4 to 6 weeks in advance of your trip. While it is possible to receive most of the vaccines within 2-4 weeks of your trip, a few vaccines (including rabies and Japanese encephalitis) require you to get multiple doses within a 4 week span. Where is the Travel Clinic located? The Adult Travel Clinic is located in the Shapiro Ambulatory Care Center at 725 Albany Street, 9th Floor. The Pediatric Travel Clinic is located in the Yawkey Ambulatory Care Center at 850 Harrison Ave, 6th Floor. The nearest parking garage is located at 710 Albany Street.

Please check with your primary care doctor first to see if you need a referral. Also, please be aware that some insurance companies may NOT cover all services. Please check with your insurance company regarding what services will be covered, prior to your appointment. All uncovered services will be the responsibility of the traveler. If your insurance company does not cover the specialized services that we offer or if you do not have health insurance, then you will be responsible for paying all charges at the end of your travel clinic appointment. Should I bring anything with me to my appointment? Please bring your vaccine records, your WHO International Certificate of Immunization (yellow book) if you have one and a list of medications you are taking. "}
