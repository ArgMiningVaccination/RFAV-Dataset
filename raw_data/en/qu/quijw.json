The bigger challenge, getting those doses to the people who need them most as soon as possible. Both Pfizer and Moderna appear to be on track to have their vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration on an emergency basis within weeks. Both companies recently released statements saying their vaccines were more than 90% effective in clinical trials. It's a promising development at a time when the United States is seeing its most severe outbreak of COVID-19 infections. The average number of new cases exceeded 140,000 per day last week and hospitals around the country are beginning to get overwhelmed. Leaders of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's program to fast-track vaccines and therapeutics, are hopeful. Gen. Gus Perna, the Army logistics commander overseeing vaccine logistics, confirmed that the government will begin shipping vaccines to ZIP codes across the country within 24 hours of FDA approval. By the end of December, roughly 20 million people could be vaccinated against the coronavirus, Moncef Slaoui, co-lead of Operation Warp Speed, said Friday. Another 25 to 30 million people will likely get the vaccine in each of the following months until more vaccine candidates are approved. That could mean up to a quarter of the U.S. population inoculated by the spring. Among the vaccines most likely to get approved in the coming weeks, Pfizer is projected to have 50 million doses available worldwide by the end of 2020 and Moderna will produce 20 million. Both vaccines require two shots, so altogether, they will produce enough to cover 35 million people. DISTRIBUTION CHALLENGES FOR STATES Once the manufacturers start shipping doses, states will be facing a vaccination effort larger than anything they have faced before. In an average year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention helps distribute about 80 million vaccinations around the country. Now, states are tasked with delivering hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses in a matter of months. According to Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), states are [developing effective distribution plans](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/covid19-vaccination-guidance.html) but they could soon be overwhelmed with new demands on their health care systems. \"This is a huge scale to vaccinate hundreds of millions of people,\" Plescia told C-SPAN Monday. \"We don't have the capacity to do that.\" According to ASTHO, states need another $8.3 billion from Congress to cover the costs of vaccine distribution. They will need to hire and train additional health care workers, store vaccine doses, expand information technology to track recipients and wage an information campaign to encourage people to take the vaccine. Vaccine skepticism is a [lingering threat](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/overcoming-resistance-to-covid-19-vaccine-adoption-how-affective-dispositions-shape-views-of-science-and-medicine/) to community health. A STAT Harris [poll ](https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/10/19/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-racial-disparities/)indicated 42% of Americans said they would not take the coronavirus vaccine, including 67% of Black Americans. The politics around the vaccine and perceptions that the process was rushed made the situation worse. There are hopes the 90% efficacy of the vaccines will overcome some concerns but public health experts have acknowledged the need to educate the public and address their concerns directly. \"All of that is going to cost money,\" Plescia said. So far, Congress has allocated $10 billion for Operation Warp Speed. The CDC has sent $340 million to states for COVID-19 and flu vaccine planning and distribution. The federal government is also covering the costs to transport the vaccine from the manufacturers to the administration site and is sending enough vaccine kits with needles, syringes, alcohol pads and PPE to support 660 million shots. Once the vaccines are distributed, there are serious concerns about states' cold storage capacity. The Pfizer vaccine must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) and will [reportedly ](the deep-freeze suitcases only hold their cool for 10 days)last just five days in a regular refrigerator. The company plans to ship the doses in a special suitcase which will preserve the vaccine for up to ten days. According to an HHS spokesperson, most sites will not have to worry about long term cold storage during the first phase of distribution. \"The intent is to distribute vaccines to state-identified locations when vaccine administration can quickly follow,\" the spokesperson explained. \"Meaning that frequently, the vaccines will be administered before needing to use storage other than the containers the vaccines are shipped in.\" LOST IN TRANSITION There are also mounting concerns that the [presidential transition](/news/coronavirus/biden-advisers-to-meet-vaccine-firms-as-trump-stalls-handoff) could impact vaccine distribution. Based on Operation Warp Speed timelines, the Biden administration will be taking office during the first phase of nationwide vaccine distribution. In an [ economic address Monday](/news/beyond-the-podium/biden-vows-to-strengthen-economy-despite-exploding-pandemic), presumptive president-elect Joe Biden warned, \"More people may die if we don't coordinate.\" According to reports, members of Biden's team are not getting briefed by President Donald Trump's team on matters like Operation Warp Speed and vaccine distribution plans. Biden said his team could be a month and a half behind if President Trump does not grant access to the federal planning process. \"So, it's important...that there be coordination now or as rapidly as we can get that done,\" Biden said. Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci also voiced concerns about a rocky transition between the Trump and Biden administrations in an interview on NBC's \"TODAY\" show. \"Transitions are important,\" said Fauci, who has served under six different administrations. He compared the process to a relay race where the runner wants to pass the baton without stopping. \"We want a smooth process for that and the way you do that is by essentially having the two groups speak to each other and exchange information.\" This weekend, Ron Klain, Biden's incoming chief of staff, warned the lack of coordination would leave the Biden administration unprepared for the enormous task of distributing hundreds of millions of vaccine doses. \"There are people at HHS making plans to implement that vaccine. Our experts need to talk to those people as soon as possible so nothing drops in this change of power we're going to have on January 20th,\" Klain [told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"](/news/coronavirus/biden-advisers-to-meet-vaccine-firms-as-trump-stalls-handoff) He continued, \"It's great to have a vaccine, but vaccines don't save lives: vaccinations save lives. And that means you've got to get that vaccine into people's arms all over this country. It's a giant logistical project.\" Multiple members of President Trump's coronavirus task force have [voiced support for coordinating ](/news/coronavirus/biden-advisers-to-meet-vaccine-firms-as-trump-stalls-handoff)with the incoming Biden administration, despite the contentious political environment and Trump's refusal to concede the election. EQUAL ACCESS, EQUITABLE ALLOCATION With a limited supply of vaccine doses in the first few months of distribution, not everyone who wants or needs a vaccine will get one. That has raised questions around the equitable allocation of the shots. Over the weekend, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened to sue the Trump administration claiming its vaccination program was inequitable, that it \"intentionally burdens\" communities of color and hinders their access. The suit was based on the Trump administration's plan to distribute the vaccine through existing health infrastructure including hospitals, pharmacies and clinics. \"That is the same infrastructure that doesn't exist in the communities we're talking about,\" Cuomo said. \"It's the same infrastructure that was lacking that caused the health care disparities in the first place,\" he continued, referring to the higher infection and mortality rates among Black and brown Americans. The governor demanded federal funding to allow the state to get the vaccine into those communities through churches, community centers and other local facilities. \"If the Trump administration does not change this plan and does not provide an equitable vaccine process, we will enforce our legal rights,\" Cuomo said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services noted that it's the responsibility of a state to direct the federal government to deliver vaccines to whatever facility they deem fit. \"Once the allocation is made, our distributor will deliver doses to wherever that jurisdiction directs us,\" the spokesperson said, adding that governors, not the federal government, would be able to prioritize which citizens receive the vaccine first. States outlined who would get the first vaccine doses in plans they submitted to the CDC last month. Most states identified frontline health care workers and other critical workers as the ones who should be first in line. The CDC and National Academies of Sciences [recommended ](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/10/national-academies-release-framework-for-equitable-allocation-of-a-covid-19-vaccine-for-adoption-by-hhs-state-tribal-local-and-territorial-authorities)older Americans, individuals with underlying health conditions and high-risk minorities should be among the first to receive the vaccine. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will issue a final recommendations for identifying the most vulnerable citizens. As more vaccines become available, states are expected to scale up distribution capacities through public and private partners like health clinics, pharmacies and mobile vaccination sites. Additionally, the Trump administration announced a partnership last week to distribute the vaccine through large pharmacy chains that can effectively store and distribute the doses. The partners include CVS, Walgreens, Rite-Aid, and Costco and account for roughly 60% of all U.S. pharmacies. "}
