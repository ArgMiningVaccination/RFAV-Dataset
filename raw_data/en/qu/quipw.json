If your body is out of balance and doesn't produce the things you need to stay healthy, there will be problems. Hormone imbalances are a common problem that many people don't even know they have and yet they can wreak havoc on the body. This includes a common condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which arises when female hormones are out of balance. The effects of this issue can be devastating, which is why it's important to discuss vitamins for polycystic ovary syndrome as well as other natural remedies that will help you take charge of your hormone levels. When the hormones progesterone and estrogen become so unbalanced that PCOS takes hold, it can be dangerous. PCOS can cause a range of issues involving everything from menstruation to fertility, cardiac concerns, and your appearance. About one in ten American women suffer from PCOS and it can cause symptoms such as: If you experience any or all of these symptoms, it's time to take notice and try natural remedies such as vitamins for polycystic ovary syndrome. There are several changes you should make to your diet to improve PCOS. In fact, maintaining a healthy weight is one of the most effective strategies for regulating your period, correcting insulin resistance and reducing the problems associated with PCOS. You can do this by making the following changes: Another important change you should make is to limit or avoid are food products that contain high levels of soy or soy derivatives. Excess soy intake will not only cause inflammation - which is unhealthy - but it will also cause your estrogen levels to spike. When [levels of estrogen compared to progesterone](/blog/estrogen-dominance-symptoms/) are not symbiotic, complications can quickly arise. It is interesting to note that estrogen can be both anti-inflammatory as well as pro-inflammatory depending on the condition the body is in. Increased inflammation in the body may lead to a wide variety of symptoms and exacerbate PCOS. As such, it is vital to be prudent and monitor inflammation in the body. Get out there and start moving around. You don't have to look at exercise as something that you have to do or want to avoid. It can also be fun. Just taking a walk through a park or around your block will have untold effects on your PCOS and hormone balance. You'll want to be careful when considering exercise as a PCOS natural remedy because if you already have hormone imbalances then [heavy exercise can make things worse](/adrenal-fatigue/lifestyle/adrenal-fatigue-and-over-exercising/). Try to focus on light activities like walking and enjoy spending some time outdoors. Getting enough good quality sleep is incredibly important. If you struggle with this, then start by relaxing and calming your mind before bed and in your daily routine. This will not only help reduce stress and encourage better sleeping patterns but it will also help lower levels of harmful hormones like cortisol. It's no secret that everyone feels worn down when they're under stress. Stress has a very strong effect on PCOS and the NeuroEndoMetabolic (NEM) Stress Response is [a large contributor to hormone imbalances](/blog/neuroendometabolic-symptoms-of-stress/) when it is overworked. This can all be a part of Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome (AFS), an often neglected disorder that can occur as a result of negative and highly stressful aspects of today's busy modern lifestyle. When you're under stress, it sets off important reactions in your body. Starting in the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, the thyroid, pituitary, adrenal glands, and several other organs are all called into action. Hormone production spikes along with a suppression of the immune system. Normally, these changes would go back to normal once the source of the stress was gone. But when you experience chronic stress, the continued overactivity of the adrenal glands can cause major imbalances throughout the body. The Ovarian Adrenal Thyroid (OAT) axis often experiences imbalances, the three organs becoming dysregulated and starting to struggle with their roles. This can lead to a variety of symptoms and problems, including PCOS. The high levels of cortisol produced during stressful times also naturally slows progesterone production. This has an effect on hormonal balance and can be a trigger for PCOS. This combination can be devastating to the health of your ovaries, which is why It's so important to focus on yourself and do what you can to lower your stress levels. Meditation, reading, and taking care of yourself in general will also work as PCOS natural remedies. You don't have to think of everything in a clinical perspective. Sometimes an out of balance lifestyle that is full of negativity and stress can be as harmful as a poor diet. When you begin to consider yourself and how you can manage your PCOS or prevent it altogether, think about the types of emotions and worry that you're carrying around. Learning to change these kinds of negative patterns could be one of the keys to unlocking your better health and potential to recover. Some conditions of stress are due to psychological issues and genetics and in these situations the involvement of a third party professional may be beneficial. If [you are suffering from high anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/mental-health-anxiety-disorders) and need to seek assistance, remember that you don't have to do it on your own, there are people who can help. Hormone imbalances can be the result of or result in AFS. These two disorders can be tightly interlinked and there's no real point trying to correct one without addressing and correcting the other. The ovaries and the adrenals are both part of the hormonal circuit, and it's only by addressing the poor health of each part of this circuit that you can achieve better health overall. So, if you have AFS, then you will need to correct the adrenal fatigue and thyroid imbalances at the same time that you work on ovarian health in order for your efforts to succeed. These are chemicals that interfere with your body's hormone reactions in a variety of ways and increase your risk of PCOS. They're most often found in soaps, makeup, and canned foods and include: There are certain herbs that can help to balance androgens in your body. These are male sex hormones that can build up as a result of poor insulin regulation. Some of these herbs may also help to directly relieve PCOS symptoms: Taking vitamins for polycystic ovary syndrome can help fill nutritional gaps and ensure that your body is getting what it needs to function correctly. However, you need to be very careful with supplements when you have AFS as paradoxical reactions are common and you don't want to make your condition worse.
