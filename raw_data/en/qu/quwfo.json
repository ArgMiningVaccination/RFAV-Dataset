She traveled to Jacksonville, Florida two years ago seeking platelet therapy. Almost every year she goes to TrueNorth Health Center in Santa Rosa, Calif. to undergo medically supervised water fasting. She once went to the Napiers Clinic in Edinburgh, Scotland to try herbal and alternative fertility treatments. She also raves about her three week visit to Kerala, India, the birthplace of Ayurvedic medicine, where she experienced the ancient body purification process of panchakarma. Condon, a retired 67-year-old teacher, is among the growing number of Americans embracing integrative medicine, an approach to well-being that combines conventional medicine (including treatments such as pharmacology and surgery) and alternative or complementary medicine (including a variety of treatments, such as acupuncture, chiropathy, and dietary management). In addition to seeing a conventional doctor for certain health concerns, (for instance, skin cancer screenings) Condon uses a variety of alternative practices and specialists in her overall approach to wellbeing. \"It feels like many times those standard, you know, everyday kind of things that doctors recommend don't really cure the problem, it just masks it,\" she said. \"So over the years I've done a number of different modalities.\" For Condon, these modalities have included chirotherapy, massage, lymphatic drainage, acupuncture, and craniosacral work. Condon is not alone. According to a Pew Research study, about half of Americans have used at least one form of alternative medicine- such as herbal remedies, acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, for example- in their lifetimes. The study also found that, of these Americans, 29% have used alternative medicine in conjunction with conventional medical treatments. Dr. Csilla Veress is a naturopathic doctor and licensed acupuncturist at [TrueNorth Health Center](https://www.healthpromoting.com/), one of the integrative health centers that Condon visits. She describes the integrative medicine approach as one that examines the root causes of illnesses and aims to heal holistically through a variety of means, such as diet, exercise, or stress management. She notes that traditional medicine and drugs are used when needed. \"It's just that it's always usually combined with multiple treatment modalities that really focus on the person and the body as a whole,\" she said. Veress explains that integrative health centers such as TrueNorth, which focuses specifically on nutrition, with chiropathy and acupuncture also often provided, offer therapies based on solid scientific research. Integrative assessments or consults vary based on the health center, but, in general, according to [Sutter Health](https://www.sutterhealth.org/services/holistic-integrative-medicine/integrative-physician-assessments#%3A~%3Atext%3DYou%20and%20your%20practitioner%20will%20then%20create%20a%20plan%20that%2Cas%20meditation%20or%20guided%20imagery), the process begins with an in-depth assessment of medical history and lifestyle factors (such as stress, sleep, family life) and sometimes also lab tests. The integrative medicine practitioner will then craft a personal, holistic treatment plan that may include a variety of modalities, such as diet and exercise, supplements, medicine, and chiropathy. HOW EFFECTIVE IS INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE? In recent years, researchers have examined the effectiveness of integrative medicine and similar healthcare models. For instance, a [2019 study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2753520?utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&utm_source=articlePDF&utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2019.14017) by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic and the Institute for Functional Medicine compared the outcomes of patients at a functional medicine center and patients at a family health center. They found that after six months, the functional medicine patients showed significantly larger improvements in patient reported outcomes. In a [\"Community Checkup Overview\"](https://www.wacommunitycheckup.org/media/47164/2018-patient-experience-survey-report.pdf) of 41 medical offices in the Pacific Northwest, the sole integrative medical clinic was ranked first, based on polling of over 90,000 patients. The office was one of three healthcare clinics to score in the 90th percentile on all four measures of patients' overall experience. Similar findings are seen in studies conducted in Europe, where complementary and alternative medicine is [more commonly integrated](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/act.2017.29149.jha) into healthcare and widely covered by insurance. A six-year [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25164536/) of 1.6 million Dutch patients found that individuals whose doctors were trained in both conventional and CAM (complementary alternative medicine) had better health outcomes and lower costs when compared to patients whose doctors were trained in only conventional medicine. THE ROLE OF NUTRITIONAL TRAINING Nutrition is a large focus of integrative medicine, with providers such as Dr. Veress emphasizing food as being \"central\" to the approach. Integrative medical approaches may be less common amongst traditional doctors because of a lack of nutritional training in medical schools. A [2019 systematic review](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(19)30171-8/fulltext) of studies on nutrition training in medical education concluded that medical students are not equipped to provide quality nutritional care. One study featured in the review, for instance, found that in a survey of first and second year American medical school students, the average nutrition knowledge score was 70% , with only 12% of participants aware of current dietary reference intakes (a well-known set of nutritional guidelines). Dr. Christopher Gardner, director of the Nutrition Studies Research Group at Stanford Medicine, said that the goal for most medical schools is to provide 25 total hours of nutritional instruction for each student, with many schools falling short of this target. He said that a solution could be medical board exams adding more questions about nutrition. \"Until that happens, unfortunately, the focus of the teaching is on preparing med students for the questions they will get in cardiology, oncology, pharmacology, endocrinology, etcetera,\" he said. \"All important and necessary questions, but nutrition should also be considered important and necessary, and currently it is not.\" THE COSTS OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Patients like Condon often pay out of pocket for integrative medicine treatments. While a few treatments are covered by her insurance, the majority are not. Dr. Reed Mangels, a dietitian and retired professor in the Department of Nutrition at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, notes that nutrition services that can help patients to holistically treat illnesses are typically not covered by insurance. She says that medical nutrition therapy by a registered nutritionist is only reimbursed for a limited number of conditions, including diabetes or chronic kidney disease. While statistics on the average cost of an integrative healthcare visit are not readily available, a Google search of integrative health centers shows that a consultation (usually lasting for an hour) will typically range anywhere from $150 to $500 and may or may not be covered by the patient's insurance. Political factors may play a role in the lack of insurance coverage for integrative healthcare and its somewhat small presence in the mainstream. Lisa Books Williams, a nutritional coach and chef who helped Kaiser in developing its plant-based nutrition program, says that the expansion of integrative medicine approaches to healthcare have been stalled by pharmaceutical interests. \"The basics is, and my belief is that, there's no money to be made or corporate interests in having people eat healthier,\" she said. \"There is a lot of money to be made in healthcare, which I like to say is 'wealthcare' and keeping people sick.\" According to the non-profit organization [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries/summary?cycle=2021&id=H04), the pharmaceutical industry spent over $350 million on lobbying in 2021, making it the country's largest lobbying spender. Many have criticized this spending, with a high-profile [protest](https://peoplesaction.org/2021/09/peoples-action-rally-at-phrma-hq-in-d-c-demands-end-to-corporate-greed/) against \"drug companies' relentless pursuit of profits at the expense of everyday people\" at PhRMA's (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America) D.C. headquarters in September 2021. A BALANCING ACT Experts say that it's vital to practice balance when utilizing integrative medicine. \"You can be vegan, but then be in a really horrible, chaotic situation, and it's not going to be as ideal for you as combining the other wellness tools with it as well, for optimal well-being,'' said Williams. Varess emphasizes balance in stressing that utilizing integrative medicine does not require one to swear off surgery, pharmacology, and the like, but rather that it means care providers simply have \"more tools in the toolbox\". \"It's not one or the other. In my practice it's not that I'm not using antibiotics,\" she said. \"I'm also asking, does this person need this? Or do they need to literally just have less salt in their diet?\" The future of integrative medicine appears to be one of continued, but slow growth, given issues with accessibility and physician training. Dr. Varess explains that medical schools often take decades to match curriculum with trends and demands. Doctors interested in integrative medicine, she said, usually have to take the initiative to find training outside of medical school. Still, there are some promising signs about the future of this healthcare approach. LOOKING FORWARD A [2018 document](https://transamericainstitute.org/docs/default-source/tchs-research-reports/tchsmillennialwhitepaper2019_final.pdf?sfvrsn=8ef25e9b_2) from the TransAmerica Center for Health Studies found that millennials are more reflective upon their overall health than previous generations. The document states that millennials are more likely to pursue integrative medicine treatments, as well. The rise of social media has also provided a new avenue for people to be exposed to new models of healthcare, such as integrative medicine. Condon, for instance, follows alternative practitioners and health influencers on her social media. She mentioned holistic nutritionist and health coach Anthony Vita's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/thevitalblend) as an example. She sometimes takes the information she's learned and asks her doctor for an opinion. A [2021 study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355951599_How_is_Social_Media_Used_in_the_Context_of_Complementary_and_Alternative_Medicine_A_Scoping_Review) by researchers at McMaster University examining the usage of social media relating to complementary and alternative medicine concluded that social media has generally become a useful, accessible, and viable tool for sharing user and practitioner beliefs and experiences regarding these forms of medicine. In addition, the growing number of traditional medical centers that have begun to embrace integrative medicine- such Health](https://osher.ucsf.edu/)- have increased awareness of and respect for this unique healthcare model. \"I think people are looking to find integrative medical practitioners,\" said Veress.\"Even more so, I think that you're definitely seeing people rising up to that need.\" About the author: Nina Lehr is a graduate of Santa Clara University in communication, with an interest in journalism.
