Pet Acupuncture for Healing & Recovery Support In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is used as a way to promote the healing process for pets by renewing the balance of energy throughout their body. This ancient form of medicine is based on the philosophy that illness is caused by an imbalance of vital energies in the body. In modern terms, acupuncture can help by improving blood flow, which boosts oxygenation in tissues. At Pittsboro Animal Hospital, we feel that we can obtain the best results by using acupuncture as a supplement to medical therapy to help restore your pet's health and vitality. Meet Our Veterinary Acupuncturist Dr. Laurie Weiser was certified in veterinary acupuncture at the Chi Institute in 2008 with advanced studies through 2014. Common Pet Acupuncture Uses Our vets often recommend the use of acupuncture or other types of Chinese medicine for a number of issues, including: [Musculoskeletal Issues](#) Acupuncture can often be used for injury rehabilitation. Conditions such as arthritis, nerve injuries, and hip dysplasia also tend to respond well to acupuncture.
