This technique allows more control over those (typically) involuntary functions. So, what exactly is biofeedback therapy and how does it work? Well, the answer is far from simple, but in this article, we break it down so that it's easier to understand. Keep reading to find out how this therapy technique is changing people's lives, for the better. Biofeedback therapy What exactly is it? In the simplest form, biofeedback therapy is the process of gaining a greater awareness of what is going on inside the body. Medical instruments are used during each session to provide information about what is going on within the mind and body. The goal is to have complete control of one's health through the manipulation of the mind and body. Gaining more control over the involuntary functions such as blood pressure or sweating is the biofeedback part. The therapy part comes into play when trying to prevent or treat medical conditions such as chronic pain or a spike in blood pressure. How does biofeedback therapy work? During a therapy session, a medical professional connects a patient to electrodes and/or finger sensors, and they send signals back to a monitor that translates the data. The monitor will reflect several lights, sounds, or images based on how the person's heart, breathing and blood pressure is reacting to the electrodes and sensors. As a person's blood pressure lowers or their heartbeat slows down, the monitor will pick up any signals given from the body. The therapist can then help determine how to maintain those signals during the involuntary functions that occur. Over time, the goal is for the person to control those functions without any monitoring equipment. The biofeedback therapy session will likely take place in a therapist's office, but there are some programs that patients can connect to their personal computer so that they can undergo therapy treatments on their own as well. The therapist will also help determine relaxation techniques during each session which help to control different functions that occur throughout each person's body. An example of one of these techniques would be for someone who has migraines frequently. During their session, they may explore ways to turn down the brainwaves that activate during the pain. Other relaxation techniques that biofeedback therapists use are guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation. Reach out to our office today!
