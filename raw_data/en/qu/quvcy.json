That said, many of them will turn to natural remedies first. What makes naturopaths unique is that they draw on nutrition, herbal medicine, vitamins and minerals, acupuncture, homeopathy, bodywork, bioidentical hormones, nutritional IVs, counselling, and other complementary modalities to fix the root cause of your problem in order to help you heal. They also have much more time to spend with you than doctors do. That means they can better understand your full health picture. So if you're looking for a cure, conventional medicine is often the way to go. If you're looking to heal a disease or otherwise improve your mental, emotional or physical health, naturopathic medicine is often the way to go. If you're looking for both, you can go see both to get the benefits of their different education and experience. "}
