We invite you on this journey to establish NIH as the national scientific workforce diversity leader by widening and deepening our ways of thinking and practice. As a nation, we can reach new levels of inquiry by encouraging innovative, science-driven thinking made possible by broadening the diversity of thought that comes with a diverse scientific workforce.", "sitename": "diversity.nih.gov", "date": "2022-05-27", "cleaned_text": "The following is from the [Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity (NOT-OD-20-031)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html) released in 2019 regarding Underrepresented Populations in the U.S. Biomedical, Clinical, Behavioral and Social Sciences Research Enterprise. In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, education, and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences, such as: - Individuals from racial and ethnic groups that have been shown by the National Science Foundation to be underrepresented in health-related sciences on a national basis (visit nsf.gov to see [data](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf21321/report)and the report [\"Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering\"](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/women/)). The following racial and ethnic groups have been shown to be underrepresented in biomedical research: Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders. In addition, it is recognized that underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting; individuals from racial or ethnic groups that can be demonstrated convincingly to be underrepresented by the grantee institution should be encouraged to participate in NIH programs to enhance diversity. For more information on racial and ethnic categories and definitions, see the [Explanation of Data Standards for Race, Ethnicity, Sex, Primary Language, and Disability](https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=3&lvlid=54). - Individuals with disabilities, who are defined as those with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, as described in the [Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/titles-i-and-v-americans-disabilities-act-1990-ada). See NSF data [here](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/assets/data/tables/wmpd19-sr-tab07-005.pdf). Individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, defined as those who meet two or more of the following criteria: - Were or currently are homeless, as defined by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (Definition: [https://nche.ed.gov/mckinney-vento/](https://nche.ed.gov/mckinney-vento/)); - Were or currently are in the foster care system, as defined by the Administration for Children and Families (Definition: [https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/focus-areas/foster-care](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/focus-areas/foster-care)); - Were eligible for the Federal Free and Reduced Lunch Program for two or more years (Definition: [https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/income-eligibility-guidelines](https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/income-eligibility-guidelines)); - Have/had no parents or legal guardians who completed a bachelor's degree (see [https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018009.pdf](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018009.pdf)); - Were or currently are eligible for Federal Pell grants (Definition: [https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/eligibility.html](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/eligibility.html)); - Received support from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) as a parent or child (Definition: [https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-eligibility-requirements](https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-eligibility-requirements)). - Grew up in one of the following areas: a) a U.S. rural area, as designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) [Rural Health Grants Eligibility Analyzer](https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/rural-health), or b) a [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-designated Low-Income and Health Professional Shortage Areas](https://www.qhpcertification.cms.gov/s/LowIncomeandHPSAZipCodeListingPY2020.xlsx?v=1)(qualifying zipcodes are included in the file). Only one of the two possibilities listed can be used as a criterion for the disadvantaged background definition. Students from low socioeconomic (SES) status backgrounds have been shown to obtain bachelor's and advanced degrees at significantly lower rates than students from middle and high SES groups (see [https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp)), and are subsequently less likely to be represented in biomedical research. For background see Department of Education data at, [https://nces.ed.gov/](https://nces.ed.gov/); [https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_tva.asp); [https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdf](https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdf). Literature shows that women from the above backgrounds face particular challenges at the graduate level and beyond in scientific fields. (See, e.g., \" [From the NIH: A Systems Approach to Increasing the Diversity of Biomedical Research Workforce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5008902/)\") Women have been shown to be underrepresented in doctorate-granting research institutions at senior faculty levels in most biomedical-relevant disciplines, and may also be underrepresented at other faculty levels in some scientific disciplines (See data from the [National Science Foundation National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics: Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/women)). Upon review of NSF data, and scientific discipline or field related data, NIH encourages institutions to consider women for faculty-level, diversity-targeted programs to address faculty recruitment, appointment, retention or advancement.
