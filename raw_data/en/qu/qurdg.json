ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 1.21 The Committee thanks everyone who participated in, or otherwise assisted, this Inquiry. These include, among others, representatives of ACT co mmunity and industry groups, ACT Government Ministers, Members of the Legislative Assembly, Members' staff, Statutory Office -Holders, Officers of the Legislative Assembly, ACT Government officials, and staff of the Office of the Legislative Assembly. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 6 2 COMMU NITY AND INDUSTRY GROUPS 2.1 The Committee sought the views of over 200 community and industry representative groups on the 2019 -20 ACT Budget by inviting them to complete an online survey. The link to the survey was also circulated by press release, on the Le gislative Assembly website, and through the Legislative Assembly's social media presences. The Committee received 12 survey responses, and four detailed submissions, from a range of organisations. 2.2 On Friday, 14 June 2019, the Committee heard from 12 commun ity and industry representative groups regarding their views on the 2019 -20 ACT Budget during a public hearing. ACT COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SERVICE 2.3 The ACT Council of Social Service Inc. (ACTCOSS) is the peak organisation representing not -for- profit groups and social justice advocates operating within the Territory. ACTCOSS indicate that they actively work towards positive social change, to fulfil its vision of Canberra as a just, safe, and sustainable community.5 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.4 At the hearing, the following matters were discussed: investment in prevention and early intervention;6 community and affordable housing construction;7 whole -of-Territory investment in community development;8 impacts of current community sector funding;9 utilities concession eligibility;10 implementing the recommendations of the Moss Review;11 and free public transport access.12 5ACT Council of Social Service, About AC TCOSS , website, https://www.actcoss.org.au/about/about -actcoss , accessed 14 June 2019. 6 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 59. 7 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 59- 60. 8 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 60- 61. 9 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 62- 63. 10 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 63. 11 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 63- 64. 12 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 64- 66. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIV E ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 7 KEY ISSUES WHOLE -OF-TERRITORY INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY DEVELOP MENT 2.5 ACTCOSS expressed a desire to see greater investment in place- mak ing across the whole Territory, including local commerce and community facilities available to community groups in new residential development areas. They highlighted that place -making investment has particularly neglected the new communities, with the suburbs of Coombs and Wright highlighted as examples.13 2.6 The Committee were informed that there was a need for more community development officers to help identify needs, facilitate meeting those needs, and build communities' social capital across the Territ ory. ACTCOSS recommended the inclusion of needs -based precinct - level planning in the Territory Plan to help facilitate the realisation of these communities' needs. 14 UTILITIES CONCESSION ELIGIBILITY 2.7 ACTCOSS made reference to extending utilities concessions , particularly to those who may not be on low enough incomes to qualify under current schemes but have insecure work or insufficient hours of work that puts them in financial hardship.15 2.8 ACTCOSS acknowledged that introducing concession mechanisms for such a cohort was 'tricky', stating : I guess it is about having a mechanism for assessing hardship. There is some quite good practice in the utilities sectors, in the telecommunications sector and in the financial sector around assessing hardship and then provid ing different arrangements for people in those circumstances.16 2.9 ACTCOSS then suggested: Yarra Valley Water is an organisation that has been seen to have some of the best hardship recognition and response practices. They have been working for 20 years with a financial counselling service to continually evolve their program and they have been seen as an industry leader. 17 13 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 60- 61. 14 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 61. 15 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 63. 16 Ms Helyar, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 63. 17 Ms Helyar, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 63. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 8 Recommendation 1 2.10 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government learn from the experiences of other entities, in particular Yarra Valley Wa ter, to expand our concession scheme to low income households who are not currently eligible. IMPACTS OF CURRENT COMMUNITY SECTOR FUNDING 2.11 The Committee heard from ACTCOSS that the current funding for the community sector is inadequate, based off the 2012 Federal Equal Remuneration Order (ERO) supplementation, as it neither reflects the growth and diversification of programs run within the sector nor the considerable upskilling of the sector's workforce since then. They claimed that increases under the ERO have created a funding gap in the sector country -wide. 18 2.12 ACTCOSS explained that about the trade -offs the community sector is having to face in light of the continued funding gaps: Frankly, services do not want to cut service delivery, so what has been cut is access to workforce development; what has been cut is improvement in ICT infrastructure; and people have often tried to cut back on the other major expense, which is their facilities, so they have squished more people into smaller spaces or given pe ople not as much shared space in the office. 19 2.13 ACTCOSS also highlighted that the impacts of this funding gap are further amplified by the continued rise of base expenses, particularly utilities such as electricity, gas, and water, which can often match if n ot outstrip funding increases. 20 FREE PUBLIC TRANSPORT ACCESS 2.14 ACTCOSS encouraged the ACT Government to investigate the business case for making public transport free. They noted the benefits of such a system could include an uptick in economic and social participation. 21 2.15 ACTCOSS added that: The business case around free access to public transport needs to think about public transport beyond the mass transit bus and light rail networks.

(Gifted Families) provides support for gifted children, their families, teachers, and professionals working with gifted children and their families to ensure gifted and ta lented children's needs are met and they are developed to their fullest potential. Gifted Families also acts as a conduit between the gifted and talented community and research professionals in the field.24 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.18 At the hearing, the following matters were discussed: gifted and talented development and training opportunities for education professionals;25 schools' gifted and talented children policies;26 opportunities and support for gifted and talented children;27 communication lines with the Education Directorate;28 identification of gifted and talented children;29 and make -up, accessibility, and appropriateness of H courses.30 KEY ISSUES IDENTIFICATION OF GIF TED AND TALENTED CHI LDREN 2.19 The Committee heard about the importance of pre- service training for teachers in identifying and supporting gifted and talented children. They were informed that research has shown that 22 Mr Wallace, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 65. 23 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 14 June 2019, p. 86. 24 ACT Gifted Families Support Group, About us , website, http://actgifted.com.au/?page_id=2 , accessed 14 June 2019. 25 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p . 17. 26 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 18. 27 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p p. 16; 18. 28 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p p. 20- 21. 29 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p p. 16; 18-19. 30 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 18. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 10 teachers who have been through this training can correctly identify 9 out of every 10 gifted children and those teachers who have no training correctly identity only 3 out of 10, with those children missing often being from lower socio -economic or non -English speaking household s. 31 2.20 Gifted Families noted that such training is not currently available at any university or higher education institution in the ACT.32 2.21 Gifted Families also brought to the Committee's attention the use of graded parental survey used in several states, which has proven an affordable, highly effective meth od for helping identify gifted and talented children. 33 AUSTRALIAN BREASTFEEDING ASSOCIATION 2.22 The Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA) is the national authority on breastfeeding, providing support to breastfeeding mothers, offering training and resourc es to the community, and advocating the importance of breastfeeding as a cultural norm . 34 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.23 At the hearing, the following matters were discussed: implementation of the National Breastfeeding Strategy;35 maternity health referrals to ABA services;36 progress on establishing a human milk bank;37 availability of professional lactation advice;38 and current funding.39 31 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 17. 32 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 17. 33 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 19. 34 Australian Breastfeeding Association, V ision & Mission , website, https://www.breastfeeding .asn.au/aboutaba/purpose , accessed 14 June 2019. 35 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 9, 14. 36 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 9- 11. 37 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 9. 38 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 12. 39 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 10. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 11 KEY ISSUES MATERNITY HEALTH REFE RRALS TO ABA SERVICES 2.24 The Committee heard that the referral of women to ABA services was occurring i nconsistently: Within the breastfeeding -friendly hospitals initiative, which some of our hospitals in Canberra belong to, step 10 is linking women with the community supports to breastfeeding. That is inconsistently done. It often depends on who is actuall y providing you with your maternity services. Often their personal experience will dictate whether they refer or not.40 2.25 ABA acknowledged that they have experienced some success in improving the referral process during the past 12 months, with their written material being included in all first home visit packages for new mothers. However, they noted these visits occur seven to ten days after birth, and that antenatal referrals would be better.41 2.26 The Committee was informed that there was no evidence of funding in the Budget for the National Breastfeeding Strategy and asked what the involvement of the ABA was in the development of the Strategy. The ABA indicated that: ... the national breastfeeding strategy is from the federal Department of Health. My understanding is that it has been through COAG health and there is in principle support from all states to implement that. There was a previous strategy that was from 2010 to 2015, which expired. The intent with this one is that it will be an enduring brea stfeeding strategy. The Australian Breastfeeding Association sat on the stakeholder engagement component of that and the expert advice committee to the national breastfeeding strategy. We understand that it is imminent to be released. It is going through final approvals.42 Recommendation 2 2.27 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government invites the Australian Breastfeeding Association to have a greater role in ACT hospitals, including peer to peer mentoring, to increase the success of breastfeeding . 40 Ms Fox, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 10. 41 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 10. 42 Ms Fox, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 14. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 12 Recommendation 3 2.28 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government seek to advance the completion of the update to the expired N ational Breastfeeding Strategy. AVAILABILITY OF PROFESSIONAL LACTATION ADVICE 2.29 The Committee heard that due to waiting times to see the limited number of professional lactation experts in the Territory's hospitals, some women are having to turn to an even more limited number of privat ely paid lactation consultants to be seen in a timely manner. The Committee also heard this was creating an inequity in access to services .43 2.30 ABA advised that one such solution to this is to: ...have more of the maternal health nurses trained as internationally board -certified lactation consultants and have them available; ideally having every midwife in the hospitals actually trained to that level ...44 2.31 ABA then explained that its process for training volu nteer breastfeeding consultants requires a person to: ... have breastfed a child for six months. It is then about a 12 month process to complete the Certifi cate IV . Then we have a commitment on the end of that certificate, because we operate it as a traineeship so it is at no cost to the counsellors to actually participate.45 BELCONNEN COMMUNITY COUNCIL 2.32 The Belconnen Community Council (BCC) is a volunteer -led community organisation focussed on fostering Belconnen's community identity and providing a representative voice for the area's residential and business communities.46 As part of providing this voice, BCC act as advocates for the Belconnen com munity to government.47 43 Proof Transcr ipt of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 12. 44 Ms Fox, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 12. 45 Ms Fox, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 14 June 2019, p. 13. 46 Belconnen Community Council, About Us, website, http://www.belcouncil.org.au/about -us/, accessed 14 June 2019. 47 Belconnen Community Council, Survey 1, p. 1. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 13 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.33 At the hearing, the following matters were discussed: transport connections to Belconnen;48 impact of Federal decentralisation ;49 community facility creation in areas of property development ;50 road infrastructure funding;51 and proposed name change of William Slim Drive.52 KEY ISSUES TRANSPORT CONNECTIONS TO BELCONNEN 2.34 The Committee heard about the importance of the proposed light rail extension into Belconnen, and BCC's encouragement that the extension be brought forward to best service the area.53 2.35 BCC also shared its concerns about the current bus network's capacity to service the rapidly growing West Belconnen suburbs effectively enough to reduce the reliance on private motor vehicles and emphasised th e necessity to better develop the east- west corridor between Belconnen (out to Holt) and Canberra Airport's surrounding business parks. 54 IMPACT OF FEDERAL DECENTRALISATION 2.36 The Committee heard of the impact that Australian Public Service pay and employment uncertainty has had on businesses in Belconnen, and the BCC's concerns about what may happen as the Federal decentralisation process progresses. 55 48 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 35. 49 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 33. 50 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 33- 34. 51 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 36- 37. 52 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 37- 38. 53 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 31- 32. 54 Proof Transc ript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 32, 34- 35. 55 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 33. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 14 PROPOSED NAME CHANGE OF WILLIAM SLIM DRIVE 2.37 During discussion of the budgeted duplications of arterial roads in the Belconnen a rea, focus turned to William Slim Drive and proposals to rename it following allegations of historical child sexual abuse committed by the road's namesake during the 1950s.56 2.38 Regarding community sentiment on the proposed change, BCC explain ed: People are generally respectful of ensuring that people with questionable pasts are held to account for it whilst they are still alive. Once they have passed it makes it a little more difficult and it then becomes a process beyond people's control. I t hink the message that has come from people that I have spoken to directly is that they are watching what government does on this one. If there is an opportunity for people to comment and to be involved, they want to know about it, and they want to hear abo ut it.57 2.39 When asked about alternate names for William Slim Drive, BCC voice their preference for the Names and Places Committee to be the arbiter over the renaming process.58 KINGSTON AND BARTON RESIDENTS ' GROUP 2.40 The Kingston and Barton Residents' Group (KBRG ) is a community representative organisation providing residents a forum to raise concerns and acting as an advocate for these views to government and industry. The group's primary focus is planning and heritage, particularly the preservation and enhanceme nt of the Kingston -Barton area's unique historical qualities and amenities. 59 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.41 At the hearing, the following matters were considered: rates increases in the Kingston and Barton areas;60 investment in infrastructure and community facilities in the Kingston and Barton areas (also discussed under Urban Renewal and SLA) ;61 56 See: Proof Transcript of Evidence, 14 June 2019, p. 36; Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Minutes of Proceedings No. 81, 2 8 November 2018, pp. 1161- 1162. 57 Mr Hyde, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 38. 58 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 37- 38. 59 Kingston Barton Residents Group, What is the Kingston and Barton Residents' Association , website, http://www.kingstonandbarton.net/about -the-kbra/ , accessed 14 June 2019. 60 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 39- 40. 61 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 39.

These are two of the top four increases in Canberra. It is particularly concerning for our downsizers, those new to the housing market an d our renters. The 10 per cent increase in housing [rates] also has an impact.66 2.43 KBRG added that they are not aware about what impact the rates increase will have on commercial tenants operating within the area, however noted that local businesses were \"struggling a bit\" before the increase.67 ACT GOVERNMENT GRANTS PRO CESS 2.44 KBRG expressed its concerns with the current administration -heavy application process required when applying for ACT Government grants, noting: What we were thinking is that it would be gre at if there was one that had less red tape all around. So working in the grant space you have to be accountable for taxpayers' money but when you are looking at people asking for grants of say $5,000 you are still looking at 20 to 30 hours to prepare that grant and you are looking at the ACT government officials' time to acquit and double check that grant...

So you are competing against a billion -dollar industry that has dedicated staff where we have volunteer hours going into it.69 2.46 KBRG also spoke about its two pen ding grant applications, one requesting $60,000 to support a street art project to activate Highgate Lane at the Kingston shops, the other requesting support to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Forrest Fire Station.70 Speaking specifically of the Highgate Lane application, KBRG noted: One of our frustrations is that there is a lot of activation money going to other suburbs and we have been asking for years to be able to activate Highgate Lane .71 2.47 The Committee also heard from Landcare ACT and People with Disability ACT about their concerns at the current state of ACT Government grant applicants and the impacts they are having on their and other community organisations. 72 KINGSTON SHOPPING AREA 2.48 KBRG also made reference to the difficulty with issues such as lighting and parking at the Kingston shops but they also spoke of the way they have been able to speak with the traders and communicate as a collective with the government: We had a meeting earlier in the year with Kingston traders and KBRG, just to talk ab out this very issue. We have sent some of our ideas to Minister Stephen -Smith as our local Labor MLA. The issues are universal. The main concerns include parking. I know that that is not uncommon across Canberra, but the Kingston shops have been quite imp acted, because for a long time people were waiting for the supermarket to come online, waiting to see what was going to happen with the master plan. A lot of parking is impacted at the moment by the building and construction work that is going on. We have worked very closely with that development and that owner to try to address those issues. He has listened and has tried to help where he can, which has been good. Parking is an issue. There are a lot of empty buildings, which does not make it attractive to come into. There are even simple things. We have those garden beds out the front in Kingston. We said, \"Can we go and plant some herbs?\" It is not clear who is responsible for 69 Ms Scouller, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2029, p. 43. 70 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 42- 44. 71 Ms Scouller , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 43. 72 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 14 June 2019, pp. 5- 6, 75- 76. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 17 maintaining some of those things. We requested the ACT government to have lights in the trees on Kennedy Street, because it is quite dark. That was rejected. We were told we would have to fund that ourselves, that we would have to be careful of tree health because that was really important, and that we would have to pay the ongoing p ower bills. That would have to be between the traders and ourselves. That is frustrating. When you walk around other suburbs and you see lots of tree lighting, I do not necessarily know how they all fund it, but it was a simple request to try to bring some night -time activity in: to make people feel safer walking down that street at night, make it a bit prettier. We cannot get that. I do not even know if there would be a grant we could apply for to do that. Businesses just are struggling. They do not have t he money to put aside for that either. We are trying to work really closely with the traders. There was Green Square with the re-grassing. There was the parking. We talk regularly. We have a really strong relationship. We probably will not always agree on the same things, but we are pretty sure we are on the same page for what we want. 73 Recommendation 4 2.49 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government work with traders at the Kingston shops to improve overall lighting and facilitate the installation of feature lighting in appropriate areas, including trees. LANDCARE ACT 2.50 Landcare ACT is the peak body for land care in the ACT which helps support and pr omote the over 60 organisations who care for the Territory's urban parklands, countryside, reserves, and waterways. Its primary members are the three catchment groups - Molonglo, Ginninderra, and Southern ACT - along with the Rural Landholders Association and Buru Ngunnawal Aboriginal Corporation . 74 2.51 Landcare ACT was joined by the Convenor of the Ginninderra Catchment Group and Executive Officer of the Southern ACT Catchment Group, as members of and lead bodies within Landcare ACT. MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.52 At the hearing, the following matters were considered: 73 Ms Scouller , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 46. 74 Landcare ACT, Who we are , website, https://landcareact.org.au/who -we-are/ , accessed 14 June 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 18 structure and makeup of Landcare ACT (also discussed under Environment) ;75 and current (including core and project) funding. KEY ISSUES CURRENT FUNDING 2.53 The Committee heard that funding from the ACT Government for Landcare ACT's projects and core operating costs are allocated for the financial year only, with no longer- term commitments.76 2.54 Landcare ACT expressed its concern that the cessation of Commonwealth funding and inconsistent and short -term commitments fr om ACT Government entities are eroding its funding base. One such example included: ... Icon Water, who have paid for us to do water education. That has now been lost. Water education was also being provided by the ACT government in the past, and we understa nd that there is no foreseeable future for water education activities in our organisations.77 It is concerned that further erosion will threaten the continuation of community investment in its projects.78 2.55 Landcare ACT acknowledged that most of their administrative time is spent applying for individual grants, and although they often enjoy success in these applications, grants and Government funding are increasingly not funding for this core administrative work.79 2.56 Landcare ACT acknowledged that though t he practice of funding land care groups varies across states, some states have begun to provide consistent funding in recognition of land care as a local as opposed to a Commonwealth priority. These states include Victoria and New South Wales.80 Recommendat ion 5 2.57 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide core funding to Landcare ACT with a five -year commitment. 75 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 5. 76 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 2. 77 Ms Franco, Proof Tran script of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 3. 78 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 2- 4. 79 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 14 June 2019, pp. 5- 7. 80 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 7.

MASTER BUILDERS ASSOCIATION OF THE ACT 2.59 The Master Builders Association of the ACT (MBA) is the Territory branch of the national peak building and construction industry representative group.81 Its members are predominantly small businesses and are collectively responsible for a significant portion of ACT Government and private construction work in the Territory.82 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.60 At the hearing, the following matters were discussed: development application processing;83 lease variation charges (LVC) (also discussed under Property Council Of Australia and Economic Management) ;84 stamp duty reform;85 Capital Works Programme and long -term infrastructure planning;86 land release program;87 and demand for skilled tradespeople in the building and construction industry.88 81 Master Builders Association of the ACT, About MBA , website, https://www.mba.org.au/about -mba/ , accessed 14 June 2019. 82 Master Builders Association of the ACT, Survey 3 , p. 5. 83 Proof Transcript of Evidenc e, 14 June 2019, pp. 48- 50. 84 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 14 June 2019, pp. 51- 52. 85 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 50, 55. 86 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 52- 55. 87 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 56. 88 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 50- 51. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 20 KEY ISSUES DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION PROCESSING 2.61 The Committee heard that there have been significant delays in the processing of development applications, with only 39 per cent of applications being processed and responded to within the statutorily -defined 30 or 45 days, with an estimated processing time of 72 working days. MBA highlighted this year's budget includes a target of 75 per cent of development applications p rocessed within their statutorily defined periods, however the estimated median processing time is 60 days.89 2.62 The MBA expressed their support for the budgeting of six new development assessment staff in the 2019 -20 Budget and encouraged the continued growth of development assessment staffing numbers to match the growth rate of the city. 2.63 The MBA went on to add that: We note that [the new assessment officers are] being funded through an increase in development assessment fees. For applications that are over $ 1 million in value, there is a 20 per cent increase in fees, which is quite substantial. But the feedback we have from our members is that they would be prepared to pay that increase if it means faster assessment times. 90 LEASE VARIATION CHARG ES (LVC) 2.64 The M BA explained to the Committee that the current complexities and lack of transparency in the LVC system, which cause significant uncertainty in the industry, could be rectified by shifting towards greater codification, including the introduction of a regulated schedule of charges.91 2.65 In response to a question from the Committee, the MBA reaffirmed its support for continued LVC concessions supporting specific government policy outcomes, such as affordable housing development.92 2.66 In this context the Committee also heard from the Property Council - ACT about their support for greater codification of LVCs, including concerns over the unpredictability and lack of transparency of the current charge scheme. 93 89 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 48- 49. 90 Mr Hopkins, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 14 June 2019, pp. 49- 50. 91 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 51- 52. 92 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 51- 52. 93 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp 93- 94; 96- 97. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 21 STAMP DUTY REFORM 2.67 The MBA shared its support for the first hom ebuyers stamp duty rebate, which brings the Territory into line with a number of other states and territories' practices and indicated that they are hopeful it will reinvigorate the first homebuyer segment of the ACT property market. 94 2.68 The MBA went on to a dd: In some cases we are seeing some of the benefits of some of the stamp duty reductions being offset by other charges or other issues in the budget. The increase in development assessment costs and the extra holding costs will offset some of that benefit of the stamp duty relief. 95 2.69 Speaking broadly about what they referred to as wider residential real estate tax reform, the MBA observed that currently such tax as a percentage of total tax revenue (49.5 per cent ) is higher than other states and territories, which has had impacts on businesses and has seen residential development increase across the border.96 CAPITAL WORKS AND LONG -TERM INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING 2.70 The MBA expressed their concern at the projected decline in capital works infrastructure investment in what is still a fast -growing Territory, noting that it had dropped from almost $1 billion in 2016 -17 to $581 million by 2022- 23. 97 2.71 The MBA reiterated thei r call for a long -term investment plan for the ACT, one which they began calling for in 2013. They articulated their preference for a broad 30 -year plan, which would allow the building and construction industries to train qualified professionals in anticip ation of planned projects. They also indicated that such an approach would hold greater weight when seeking federal support for major projects, drawing a comparison with long -term plans for Southeast Queensland and the Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan are as. 98 COMMITTEE COMMENT 2.72 The Committee notes that it has been reported that the ACT Government intends on releasing a 10 -year infrastructure program in September this year. 99 94 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 50. 95 Mr Hopkins, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 55. 96 Proof Transcript of Ev idence , 14 June 2019, p. 55. 97 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 52. 98 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 52- 54. 99 Jervis- Bardy, Daniel. \"Major Projects Canberra Aims to Deliver ACT Government's Infrastructure Wish List.\" Canberr a Times , June 17, 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 22 LAND RELEASE PROGRAM 2.73 The Committee heard that, despite struggling to meet the demand for build -ready land, the Territory now has a healthy stock of build -ready land available (400 blocks) which is welcomed by the building and construction industries. The MBA expressed its surprise at plans to decrease land release from 17,000 to 15,600 blocks over the following four years and suggested that current stock could be increased to facilitate an anticipated upswing in the development market.100 PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY ACT 2.74 People with Disability ACT Inc. (PWDACT) is the peak advocacy organisation for people with disabilities in the ACT, representing, promoting, and supporting the collective interests of the Territory's 65,000 people with disabilities in order to bring about an inclusive society.101 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.75 At the hearing, the following matters were considered: public housing accessibility;102 public transport and physical infrastructure accessibility;103 ACT Government grants process (also discussed under Landcare ACT, KBRG and CMTEDD and Environment) ;104 access reference group;105 employment of people with disabilities in the ACT Public Service;106 and support for young people with disabilities at risk of entering the justice and corrective systems.107 100 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 56. 101 See: Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 77; People with Disability ACT , https://pwdact.org.au/about/ , accessed 14 June 2019. 102 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 79- 80. 103 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 75- 78. 104 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 75- 76. 105 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 77. 106 See: Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 79- 80; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19-5, answered 25 June 2019. 107 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 76. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 23 KEY ISSUES PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ACCESSIBILITY 2.76 The Committee h eard about common issues experienced by people with disabilities navigating the Territory's physical infrastructure. Of particular note was the cracked, poorly designed, or non-existent footpaths and kerbs lips which are too high or steep.108 PWDACT stated: We note that the physical environment will be addressed as part of this budget but we think that more attention needs to be paid to accessible and safe footpaths, for example. We know that there is a report- your -street mechanism. We would like a report -your-footpath mechanism. It is just impossible if a) there is no footpath or b) it is awful. How can people possibly use it? That is why we believe that taxes are paid. 109 2.77 PWDACT also spoke of the importance of accessibility dots at crossings and kerb sides for the visually -impaired community and highlighted Gungahlin as a prime example of the accessible public infrastructure :110 I recently had to lead two blind people to and from an event in Gungahlin, while pushing a pram. I must say that I appreciated the roads , I appreciated the footpaths there and my two blind colleagues appreciated those accessibility dots. That was a good case study. If all of Canberra were like that, it would be nice. I am not saying that was an easy thing but the infrastructure made it eas ier. 111 2.78 PWDACT supported suggestions that Transport Canberra ensure its entire bus fleet is fully wheelchair accessible, observing that having government infrastructure accessible to all \"should be a no -brainer.\"112 Recommendation 7 2.79 The Committee recommends th at the ACT Government ensures, to the greatest extent possible, that the Territory's footpath network is accessible.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 24 2.80 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government installs suitable ramps and edge markings (raised dots) on ACT foot paths in new and existing town and group centres . ACCESS REFERENCE GROUP 2.81 PWDACT spoke of an access reference group but expressed concerns at where it actually was situated: We are pleased about that. This means that people with disabilities are able to be consulted properly by government. But at the moment\u2014 this is also mentioned in the parliamentary agreement \u2014this access reference group does not belong anywhere; nobody owns it. What we would like to see is that it sits in, perhaps, the Chief Minister's directorate, and that it has appropriate funding for people in this group to spend time consulting. We do a lot of consulting to government at the moment and a lot of it we do not get funding for.113 COMMITTEE COMMENT 2.82 The Committee notes that there is an ACT Disability Reference Group114 but the re is no record of an ACT Access Advisory Council/Disability Advisory Council in existence post 2013. The two bodies appear to have provided or curr ently provide advice to the ACT Government on issues affecting people with disabilities in the ACT, including inclusive and accessible communities. Recommendation 9 2.83 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government re-establish an Access Advisory Council under the auspices of the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate. Recommendation 10 2.84 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government publicise the recommendations of the ACT Disability Reference Group and encourage discussion on to promote awareness and support for them. 113 Ms Sirr, Proof Transcri pt of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 74- 76. 114 ACT Disability Reference Group, https://www.communityservices.act.gov.au/disability_act/disability -reference - group/terms -of-reference , accessed 7 July 2019.

She was 11. She had been put in Quamby [Youth Detention Centre] three times. She was 11. She is just one small case study of what is happening in wider Canberra. These kids often do have disabilities. They might have cognitive impairments; they might have autism.116 ACT GOVERNMENT GRANTS P ROCESS 2.87 In a similar way to KBRG the PWDAC T also referred to the difficulties and time consuming nature of grants: We do appreciate the ACT government's active support i n terms of giving out grants to community organisations to include more people to close the gap, but what we would like to see is that process made easier. To apply for a grant is not an easy, quick process. Often it is almost not even worth applying becau se you spend so much time on the administration of it that you have only got so much time to do it. I have been told by ministers in the ACT that you should just apply, that it is quick and easy. Well, it is not. What I would like to see is that they streamline that process for all community organisations. It will be worthwhile. You can trust those organisations to make that dollar go really far, put their hearts on the line and work really hard to include people to close those gaps, to care for those peop le in the community that most need it.117 PROPERTY COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA - ACT 2.88 The Property Council of Australia is the leading advocacy group for the Australia n property industry, represented in the Territory by its ACT Office.

SELECT COMM ITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 26 comprises of more than 2,000 companies, representing those across the industry spectrum including investors, owners, managers, and developers.118 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.89 At the hearing, the following matters were discussed: land release program;119 encouraging affordable housing;120 encouraging age -friendly property development;121 impacts of tax reform on businesses;122 cross -border tax leakage;123and lease variation charges (LVC) (also discussed under MBA and Economic Management) .124 KEY ISSUES IMPACTS OF TAX REFORM ON BUSINE SSES 2.90 The Committee heard about the impact that the first 4 -year stage of the ACT Government's 20-year tax reform program is having on ACT businesses and commercial members of the Property Council, with the impacts of commercial rates an d stamp duty of significant note. 2.91 The Council expressed its members' concerns that the Territory's rates system - including proposed increases - lacks transparency and spoke of the unexpectedness of the 6 per cent increase in commercial rates for the 2019 -20 financial year.125 2.92 Speaking of the impact these commercial rates increases were having on property owners, the Council explained that property owners are trying to distribute the increases across tenants who can afford the increase out of fear that their smaller business tenants will be unable to absorb them.126 118 Property Council of Australia, Our Story , website, https://www. propertycouncil.com.au/Web/About_Us/Our_Story/Web/About_us/Key_info/Key_information_Overview.a spx, accessed 14 June 2019. 119 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 94; 97- 98. 120 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 94, 97- 101 121 Proof Tr anscript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 94, 97- 101. 122 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 93- 97. 123 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 97- 99. 124 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 93; 96- 97. 125 Proof Transcript of Evidenc e, 14 June 2019, pp. 93- 94. 126 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 94- 96. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 27 2.93 Although they reaffirmed their support of tax reform in the Territory, the Council advised that their members feel reform has happened too quickly, leading to bill shock and a feeling that further c ommercial rates increases will become crippling. 127 ENCOURAGING AFFORDABL E HOUSING 2.94 The Council told the Committee that they had been talking to government about delivering affordable housing: The Property Council made it very clear to government 18 months ago that we were aware that, with affordable housing, the policy settings needed to be changed, that affordable dwellings were not getting to the people who needed it. In fact we reported directly to government a couple of concerning stories that we had heard so that they could be addressed and picked up. We certainly are very supportive of change, which is why we engaged in the consultative forum. The bones are in the housing strategy. It is about how we now roll that out, and we acknowledge that we have to make sure that the dwellings are getting to the people who need them. The Suburban Land Agency is currently talking to us about an expression of interest around seeking people who can deliv er affordable housing against those greenfield areas. We want to actually see more of that done in the urban infill space which is actually where those key workers, the most vulnerable in our community, actually need to be located: close to transport and h ealth facilities and work. 128 2.95 The Council emphasised that they were ' very keen to continue to have a conversation with the Suburban Land Agency about how our members can deliver more affordable housing, in partnership with government and the community sector ' 129 and that they are 'looking at opportunities for expressions of interest for affordable housing providers but unless we have their willingness and the desire to be able to use the land price as a lever we will be spinning our wheels.'130 2.96 Noting land price and planning constraints were the biggest obstacles tofor their members to develop more affordable housing, the Council reiterated that there needs to be a willingness of the ACT Government to partner with industry and to avoid instance s of rorting - where the land purchased at lower cost for affordable housing is on -sold, with or without housing on it, several years later at considerable gain to the developer.131 127 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 95. 128 Ms Cirson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 99- 100. 129 Ms Cirson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 94. 130 Mr Doherty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 100. 131 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 99- 101. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 28 2.97 In this context the Council explained their perspective on the housing strategy and affordable housing targets: I sat on the consultative group, the housing affordability consultative group that Minister Berry convened. We sit on that with community housing providers. We had some input into the development of the housing strategy which was released l ast year. I will say that we have been long calling for a formal ministerial council to be established to oversee the implementation of that housing strategy. We believe the bones are there but how you then implement that and what recommendations come fro m that group to government when they are determining their budget year on year on how to get that affordability mix right is something that we are very keen to see. 132 2.98 The Council further stated that: There needs to be some greater skin in the game by the go vernment in terms of what price it is prepared to take for its land. It arguably has the greatest ability of any jurisdiction to make some difference on housing affordability because of the way our leasehold system is structured. There is a statutory requirement on the SLA to sell land at market rate, and forever that will stay true until the government decides to amend that act. We are certainly saying let us do it together. The government could take a lower price and developers will deliver the product. I n fact, we spend a lot of time at the Property Council through our committees discussing housing affordability. 133 Recommendation 11 2.99 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government create a steering committee or ministerial council to guide the implementati on of the housing strategy. Recommendation 12 2.100 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government review affordable housing on- sale arrangements to prevent rorting. 132 Ms Cirson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 97- 98. 133 Ms Cirson, Proof Transcript of E vidence , 14 June 2019, p. 98.

(PTCBR) is a public transit advocacy gro up which promotes improved access to public transport and better passenger experiences within the Territory. PTCBR is the successor of the ACT Light Rail lobby group, now focussing on the expansion and continued integration of non -private motor vehicle tra nsportation.135 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.103 At the hearing, the following matters were discussed: expansion of the ACT public transport system;136 ticketing system innovations;137 techniques to encourage public transport use;138 free public transport and transport poverty;139 park and ride facilities;140and signage and interchange design.141 134 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 95. 135 Public Transport Association of Canberra, About , website, https://ptcbr.org/about/ , accessed 14 June 2019. 136 Proof Transcript of E vidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 82, 86- 89. 137 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 82- 93. 138 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 83- 85. 139 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 86. 140 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 84-85. 141 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 90- 92. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 30 KEY ISSUES EXPANSION OF THE ACT PUBLIC TRANSPORT SY STEM 2.104 The PTCBR encouraged further expansion of the ACT public transport network, underpinned by greater cooperation between the ACT, New South Wales, and local cross -border councils. They emphasised the potential to create a trans -border rapid bus between Queanbeyan and Civic, a cross -border integrated ticketing system for the ACT and surrounding region and extending light rail to include Queanbeyan.142 2.105 The PTCBR also reaffirmed its support for the development of light rail stages two and three, encouraging them to be bought forward where possible. 143 TICKETING SYSTEM INNO VATIONS 2.106 The Committee heard from the PTCBR about new innovations in ticketing systems and the capacity it has to remove barriers to using public transport. The PTCBR specifically highlighted a system which allows users to charge their far e using the pay -wave feature of their bank or credit cards being trialled in New South Wales, and its potential to encourage infrequent users and overseas visitors to use the Territory's public transport system. 144 2.107 However, the PTCBR warned against any shifts to the Victorian ticketing model, which abandoned single tickets in f avour of a pre -paid transit card system, which made infrequent or tourist use of the public transport network difficult.145 SIGNAGE AND INTERCHANGE DESIGN 2.108 The PTCBR recommended the roll -out of clearer, more prominent signage across the whole public transport network, to allow people to best take advantage of the redesigned transit network.146 2.109 In discussion about the design of public transport interchanges, the PTCBR added that: I like to look at Dickson interchange as a good example of a well- designed bus interchange. The Westfield Belconnen, the way it works, not necessarily the cover that is there but the way that it operates services, is good. I think that when you look at an upgrade to Woden you have got to remember that it is going to be an 142 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 82. 143 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 86- 89. 144 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 14 June 2019, pp. 82- 83. 145 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 83. 146 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 91.

I guess there will be a combination of the way Dickson works and Gungahlin works.147 PARK AND RIDE FACILITIES 2.110 When asked as to their views on Park and Ride the PTCBR noted that P ark and Ride is 'quite interesting' and noted that i ts effectiveness was very dependent on where it was located: When it comes to providing park -and-ride facilities, there is also the added cost of the land that they are used on. So we would not necessarily encourage the construction of park and rides at th e town centres, for instance. That land is very valuable. That land could be used for a much higher purpose. It could be used for office, retail or residential accommodation. But there are instances of park and rides that you could put along your transport corridors. The Wanniassa park and ride is very popular, and that land is also a very good place to do it, because it is not likely to be utilised for a higher purpose any time soon. Likewise the park and ride at the top of the hill on Cotter Road is a very good example of where you can place a park and ride where you are essentially saying we are not going to use this land for anything else and it has not, at the moment at least, reached its capacity. So park and rides are, I think, appropriate but it depe nds where you put them. Do not sterilise large sections of your town centres by putting in surface car parks. Canberra has had enough of that. It is time for that to end. If you must, make sure that you put them underground when you put a new development o n there, but we should not be encouraging further park and rides in our town or group centres. 148 2.111 Further to this , the PTCBR also noted in relation to P ark and Ride that: Every tool has its purpose. Park and Ride is a tool that can be used well and that it d oes not work as people imagine it does in some instances. As I think we mentioned earlier, you could put a park and ride out near Harman and Queanbeyan people, New South Wales people, could take advantage of that. They could then free themselves from havin g to pay $10 to $14 a day parking in the ACT. So I think there are instances where park and ride can work and also instances where it is probably not the best use of that space. 149 Recommendation 13 2.112 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide additional Park and Ride facilities in locations away from town centres . 147 Mr Haas, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 91- 92. 148 Mr Hemsley, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 84- 85. 149 Mr Haas, Proof Trans cript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 85. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 32 YOUTH COALITION OF THE ACT 2.113 The Youth Coalition of the ACT is the Territory's peak youth affairs body, responsible for representing the interests, rights, and wellbeing of the estimated 78,000 Canberrans aged between 12 and 15 and those who work with them. The Coalition's primary fun ction is to develop and analyse Territory policy and program decisions which affect young people and facilitate collaboration between its community and government to ensure better outcomes for young Canberrans.150 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.114 At the hearing, the following matters were discussed: Budget 2019 -20 funding for youth initiatives;151 homelessness among children and young people;152 investment in child protection and out -of-home care, including the Therapeutic Care Court;153 domestic violen ce response, including rehousing and parent -child separation;154 eating disorders treatment (also discussed under Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Disorders) ;155 and early intervention in education.156 KEY ISSUES HOMELESSNESS AMONG CHILDREN AN D YOUNG PEOPLE 2.115 The Committee heard about the Youth Coalition's action plan for addressing homelessness among children and young people, which it indicated was focussed around practice -based collaborative delivery of services and underpinned by empirical sc oping of services available and needed in the Territory.157 150 Youth Coalition of the ACT, About , website, https://youthcoalition.net/about/ , accessed 15 June 2019. 151 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 67- 69. 152 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 69, 72. 153 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 67- 68, 71- 72. 154 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 72. 155 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 72- 73. 156 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 68, 70. 157 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 69. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISL ATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 33 2.116 The Youth Coalition identified two pre -existing children and young people homelessness services - one in South Australia and another in New South Wales - worth replicating in the ACT, emphasising th ose services are: ...what is needed to keep young people in families where safe and appropriate, provide respite when they need that, instead of having them sleep on the street or couch surf or do something else unsafe that helps them trickle into long- term adverse outcomes and, for that limited few for whom it is unsafe, to think about what the other alternatives are long term.158 COMMITTEE COMMENT 2.117 The Committee notes that since the hearing on the Friday 14 June 2019, it has been reported that the ACT Government has allocated $480,000 to partner with the Youth Coalition and other community service providers in scoping what is required to introduce a dedicated child and young person homelessness service in the Territory. 159 EATING DISORDERS TREATMENT 2.118 The Youth Coa lition explained to the Committee that certain types of therapeutic support for eating disorders require travelling interstate to Sydney, and that access to private psychiatric and psychological support in Canberra continues to experience long wait times. It was also highlighted that psychiatric units in the Territory's health system currently do not understand how to treat people with eating disorders.160 2.119 The Youth Coalition suggested that the above issues could be significantly improved by upskilling psychi atric/psychology and nursing staff to deal appropriately with eating disorders and through coordinating a specialised response to eating disorders in the community in conjunction with parents and families members . YOUNG WOMEN 'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION (YWCA) 2.120 The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Canberra is a feminist, secular, non -profit organisation which provides community services and represents women's issues in the Territory. It provides essential quality services for women, girls, and familie s in the Territory 158 Dr Barker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 69- 70. 159 Grouch, Sherryn. \"Homeless Kids in Canberra to Get $480k Funding Boost This Year. \" Canberra Times , 25 June 2019. 160 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 73. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 34 and surrounding regions, including: children and youth services, community development, housing, women's leadership training, and advocacy.161 MATTERS CONSIDERED 2.121 At the hearing, the following matters were discussed: affordable housing and homelessness among women (also discussed under Revenue Management) ;162 justice housing and post -release support;163 the ACT Government Family Safety Hub;164 respectful relationships programs in schools (also discussed under Education) ;165 and gender -responsive budgeting (also discussed under Inclusion and Participation ).166 KEY ISSUES AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AMONG WOMEN 2.122 The Committee heard from YWCA that older women systematically experiencing h ousing- stress and homelessness: We have seen firsthand how older women structurally disadvantaged due to decades of time spent out of work raising families and without a job to return to have become the fastest growing cohort of those experiencing housing stress and homelessness in Canberra. 167 2.123 The YWCA welcomed the steps taken to support community housing suppliers in providing their highly -demanded services. They noted the passage of the Revenue Amendme nt Act (ACT) 2019 by the Legislative Assembly in May and the prioritisation of investigating land tax concessions to encourage property owners to provide more affordable rents. 168 161 YWCA Canberra, About Us, website, https://ywca -canberra.org.au/about -us/, accessed 15 June 2019. 162 Proof Transcri pt of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 22- 23. 163 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp.23- 24. 164 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 24- 25, 29. 165 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 24-25, 27- 28. 166 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 25-26. 167 Ms Crimmins, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 23. 168 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 23. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (OFFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 35 2.124 The YWCA noted, however, that interest in affordable housing schemes - such as the YWCA's RentWell program - is indi cative of an urgent need to increase the stock of affordable properties in the Territory.169 2.125 Speaking of their RentWell program, YWCA also informed the Committee that: ... this measure has significant capacity to contribute to the ACT housing strategy objectiv e of lifting the supply of affordable rental properties and building capacity in the community housing sector. We therefore urge the government to expand or continue the two -year trial period for this initiative and remove the arbitrary cap of 100 places, which is limiting the success of the measure and the number of potential tenant s who could potentially benefit.170 Recommendation 14 2.126 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government extend the trial period and remove the cap on the number of dwellings under the land tax exemption. RESPECTFUL RELATIONSHIPS PROGRAMS IN SCHO OLS 2.127 The YWCA repeated its calls for the ACT to introduce a respectful relationships programme in schools across the Territory, echoing their submission to the Select Committee on Estimates 2018-19 the previous year. 171 COMMITTEE COMMENT 2.128 The Committee notes that during a hearing on 24 June 2019 the Minister for Education and Early Childhood Development , explained that respectful relationships is being taught in schools as required, with each school tailoring delivery to reflect students' ages and development levels.172 GENDER -RESPONSIVE BUDGETING 2.129 In its discussion on gender -responsive budgeting the YWCA indicated that : ... we do not consider that what was released on Friday, 8 June constitute s a women's budget statement. Rather, this document repackages initiatives announced as part of a broader budget, some of which appear to be otherwise mainstream measures. For 169 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 23. 170 Ms Crimmins, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 J une 2019, p. 23. 171 Report of the Select Committee on Estimates 2018 -19 on the Appropriation Bill 2018 -19 and Appropriation (Office of the Legislative Assembly) Bill 2018 -19, 2018, p. 39. 172 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 672- 673. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 36 example, initiatives such as the bail support program and the justice health ser vice have been included, and while efforts to reduce recidivism are supported, there are no gender analyses of this package. As women represent roughly 7.5 per cent of the population at the Alexander Maconochie Centre, it is difficult to understand the ext ent to which this measure will be applied to women who come into contact with the justice system and its impact on their future wellbeing. 173 YWCA Canberra stresses that there is real opportunity for the ACT to become a national and international leader in achieving gender equality for women. The launch of the ACT women's plan for 2016 -26, the valuable work of the family safety hub, the great representation of women among members of the Legislative Assembly and a move toward a wellbeing budget: these steps ar e meaningful steps that can deliver real outcomes for women and girls in the community. In a similar vein, a robust and genuine women's budget statement would provide the ACT government with a strong policy instrument to measure progress against the priorities of the women's plan: health and wellbeing; housing and homelessness; safety; economic security; and leadership.174 2.130 When asked by the Committee what they would like to see in a Women's budget statement the YWCA replied: Previous women's budget statements released by the ACT government, noting that there has not been one for about a decade, outlined the measures which the then - government believed were delivering progress against key themes of the ACT women's plan. So this is not aligned to that. Those key themes, which are not dissimilar to the themes today, formed the framework of how policies and budget measures were developed and coordinated. The budget statement outlined initiatives, governance -based decisions relating to advisory councils, statutory o fficers and directorates, and the narrative provided policy justifications and some data on the predicted impact of the noteworthy measurements. 175 2.131 In this context the YWCA also acknowledged it still wanted to see the Office for Women in the Chief Minister's Directorate: I think that if the Office for Women were relocated there, at the time of the budget being prepared it probably would have enabled, and had more resources for, a proper gender analysis of the budget in the first place. I think it does need a holistic response. It has been described to me as a niche group, but it is not: 52 per cent of the population is not niche. We need the strategies to do that. We have to make sure that 173 Ms Crimmins, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 25. 174 Ms Crimmins, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 25. 175 Ms Crimmins, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 26. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 37 we do not fall into the trap, when doing a gendered analysis policy, of saying that it is everybody's business but it becomes nobody's. We would then also recommend that there is a gender policy analysis to support each of the directorates that is fed back into the Chief Minister's office. 176 At the federal level, the Office for Women is in Prime Minister and Cabinet. We now have a woman, who is not the Prime Minister \u2014it is the foreign affairs minister\u2014 who is the Minister for Women; so it is possible. I think the main thing is having it in the central agency because it is across the whole of government. We need oversight across the whole of government and for this to be resourced. I think that there is perhaps a good oppo rtunity to look at a whole gender equality team \u2014maybe the LGBTIQ could also be placed there \u2014and have a whole gender equality strategy for the ACT that picks up the diversity of genders across the spectrum as we are seeing them emerge in our community. 177 COMMITTEE COMMENT 2.132 The Committee notes that during a hearing on 24 June 2019 the Minister for Women spoke in relation to the women's budget statement and addressed some of the of the YWCA's concerns as well as speaking about the ACT Women's Action Plan. 2.133 The Co mmittee also wishes to note that in the Community Services Directorate chapter the responsibilities under the Minster for Women are discussed in more detail and the majority of the Committee's recommendations in relation to gender -responsive budgeting have been made in that chapter. Recommendation 15 2.134 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government move the Office for Women into the Chief Minister , Treasury and Economic Development Directorate . 176 Ms Crimmins, Proof Transcr ipt of Evidence , 14 June 2019, pp. 29-30. 177 Ms Crimmins, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 30. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 38 3 OFFICERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ACT INTEGRITY COMMISSION 3.1 The ACT Budget 2019 -20, Budget Statements A, states that The ACT Integrity Commission (the Commission) is established by the Integrity Commission Act 2018 and provides a statutory basis for its independence. Under Section 23 of the Act, the Comm ission's functions primarily are to: investigate conduct that is alleged to be corrupt conduct; refer suspected instances of criminality or wrongdoing to the appropriate authority for further investigation and action; prevent corruption, including by: researching corrupt practices; and mitigating the risks of corruption. publish information about investigations conducted by the commission, including lessons learned; provide education programs about the operation of this Act and the commission, including p roviding advice, training and education services to: the Legislative Assembly and the public sector to increase capacity to prevent corrupt conduct; people who are required to report corrupt conduct under this Act; and the community about the detrimental effects of corruption on public administration and ways in which to assist in preventing corrupt conduct. foster public confidence in the Legislative Assembly and public sector. 178 MATTERS CONSIDERED 3.2 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Integrity Commissioner included: commencement date of Commissioner ;179 difference between ACT Integrity Commission and the Commonwealth proposal ;180 inclusion of ACT Policing in Integrity Commission ambit ;181 178 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements A , ACT Executive, ACT Integrity Commission, Auditor -General , Office of the Legislative Assembly , p. 9. 179 Proof of Transcript of Evidence, 18 June 2019, pp. 236- 237. 180 Proof of Transcript of Evidence, 18 June 2019, pp. 238- 240. 181 Proof of Transcript of Evidence, 18 June 2019, pp. 238- 239.

That is what the instrument does. I believe that he has written to the Speaker, the Chief Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, Minister Rattenbury and the Standing Committee on the Integrity Commission about how he then will go about lifting up the commission, a ppointing a CEO and so on . 188 ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY BEFORE 1 JULY 2019 3.5 The Committee made queries as to the work that was being undertaken by the OLA prior to the commencement date of 1 July 2019. The Committee were informed that: The role of the Assembly was effectively to be a fund -holder until the establishment of the commission, and to oversee the recruitment process. That is as for other officer positions, the ACT Electoral Commissioner and the Auditor- General. Similarly the OLA and the Speaker are responsible for that recruitment .189 3.6 The Committee was further informed that: 182 Proof of Transcript of Evidence, 18 June 2019, p. 240. 183 Proof of Transc ript of Evidence, 18 June 2019, p. 240. 184 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1072- 1073. 185 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1073. 186 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1074- 1076. 187 Ms Whitten, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 237. 188 Mr Skinner, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1073. 189 Ms J Burch, Speaker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1072. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 40 The role that the office has played has been an unusual role to say the least, given that there was an appropriation made to the office to assist the Speaker in the appointment of a commissioner and there is no statutory function that the office has in respect of the commission's functions. But there was a recognition that that funding needed to end up in somebody's budget and, rather than its ending up in an exe cutive directorate's budget, there was a feeling that the office would be a more appropriate place for that to go. The office does have a statutory function to provide advice and support to the Speaker in acquitting the Speaker's functions under the Integr ity Commission Act, as we do in relation to the Auditor- General Act and the Electoral Commission Act, which is the basis of our advice and support. A number of the things that the office has undertaken are to appoint what was called a transition support ma nager to assist in managing the sorts of correspondence and administrative tasks that would arise in terms of the appointment. There is also the engagement of a recruitment consultant to undertake executive search and to assist what was called an appointme nt advisory panel to provide advice to the Speaker about who might be appointed. That process was commenced and concluded. As you would be aware, there is now a disallowable instrument that Dennis Cowdroy will be appointed. I understand that there was some questioning last week around this. 190 ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY AFTER 1 JULY 2019 3.7 Following the confirmation of the Commissioner 's start date the Committee asked what role the OLA would have after 1 July 2019 and were informed that: We regard, I think, from 1 July our role as stepping back quite considerably from that assistance, although there will be a memorandum of understanding between the office and the incoming commissioner to provide some basic -level support services arou nd payroll, accounting and certain other matters until they have a CEO. We are quite conscious that until they actually have a CEO they are not going to have the sort of administrative capacity that you would hope they would have . 191 3.8 The Committee were furth er advised that: The commissioner will start and he is very much aware, and I think it is articulated in the letter Mr Skinner referred to which I tabled in the Assembly, that his primary first task is really to get a CEO on board. Then between the CEO and the commissioner they will determine what the commission looks like, whether it uses Shared Services and where its accommodation would be. In the immediate short term there will be room made available for the commissioner when he is in Canberra, but the d ecisions for their 190 Mr Skinner, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 July 2019, pp. 1072- 1073. 191 Mr Skinner, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 July 2019, p. 1073. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 41 short, medium or longer term accommodation we absolutely see as for the commissioner and the CEO.192 ... we have been very cautious and careful in making sure that decisions that are for the commissioner will be left to the commissioner and we have restricted our advice to what options might be available and not prompting or pushing him in any particular direction. We think it is very important, given his statutory independence, that these are matters he will consider and reflect on . 193 INCLUSION OF ACT POLICING IN INTEGRITY COMMISSION AMBIT 3.9 The Committee was informed that the C ommonwealth had refused to allow for ACT Policing to be covered by the ACT Integrity Commission , despite the Legislative Assembly's wishes, and the Chief Minister stated that they would 'continue to advocate on that question.'194 3.10 When asked by the Committee if bringing ACT Policing under the ACT Government would be possible and if it had been considered as an option, the Chief Minister stated: No. I do not think it would wor k in practice to have the Australian Federal Police policing national areas of the territory and a different police force also operating within the territory. The only practical way I believe to undertake policing is through the arrangements that are in th e self- government act. But the question of oversight through an integrity commission, I think, is an appropriate mechanism .195 3.11 In further discussion on why ACT Policing should be covered by the ACT Integrity Commission, the Chief Minister stated: I think the Assembly has reached that conclusion through multiple committee inquiries and I believe it to be the unanimous view of all Assembly members that obviously police perform a very important role within our community and our society. The intent of our integrity commission is to have appropriate oversight of public officials performing their duties. In every other state or territory where an integrity commission is in operation, in whatever form, it would appear to have coverage of their police force. 196 AUDITOR -GENERAL 3.12 The ACT Budget 2019 -20, Budget Statements A, states that 192 Ms J Burch, Speaker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 July 2019, p. 1073. 193 Mr Skinner, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 July 2019, pp. 1073- 1074. 194 Chief Minister Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcri pt of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 238. 195 Chief Minister Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 239. 196 Chief Minister Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 239. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 42 The ACT Auditor -General (Auditor- General) is an Independent Officer of the Legislative Assembly. The ACT Audit Office (Audit Office) supports the Auditor -General in carrying out its activities. The Audit Office aims to promote public accountability for the effective and efficient provision of ACT public services by providing independent, evidence -based audit reports to the ACT Legislative Assembly and ACT community. The Auditor -Genera l Act 1996 provides the Auditor -General with complete discretion in selecting audit topics and performing audits. The Auditor- General makes recommendations to ACT -Government agencies and ACT Legislative Assembly committees on how improvements could be made to services and programs provided by the ACT public sector.

In response the Auditor -General stated that they had started discussions with the Ombudsman and that : We will engage with the Integrity Commi ssioner as soon as we get the opportunity to do so. The review of the PID legislation which is just commencing is the first step in that process. That will form part of the way in which we talk to each other about how we deal with public interest disclosur es and other representations that are made to us, and how we allocate them between us .205 PUBLIC INTEREST DISCLOSURES 3.15 The Committee made a number of queries in relation to Public Interest Disclosures (PIDs), firstly querying the number of PIDs that had been received by the Auditor -General that they would contemplate referring to the Integrity Commission: I do not have any at the moment; we do not have any outstanding PIDs at the moment. We have a couple of representations that we are dealing with, but I woul d not classify them as public interest disclosures under the act at the present time. 206 3.16 The Auditor -General also stated that none had been referred to the Public Sector Standards Commission207 3.17 In further questioning the Committee asked the Auditor -General to supply the number of PIDs received in the last two year s and how many had been referred to another body and were informed that for the current financial year there had not been any received by the Auditor-General 208 and in an Answer to a Question Taken on No tice also indicated that 'in 2017 -18 and 2018- 19 no public interest disclosures were received by the ACT Audit Office. '209 PERFORMANCE AUDIT PROCESS 3.18 The Committee asked about how the Audit Office decides to pursue performance audits of ACT d irectorates and a gencies and were informed that: Every year we go through a planning process. We more or less commence that process towards the end of a calendar year or early in the new calendar year.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 44 external stakeholders and agencies, we commence that with an initial letter seeking calls or comments on the current performance audit program, which is a three -year program. With any ideas that any of the stakeholders might have, through other performance audits that might be considered by the Audit Office, we consult with members of the Assem bly, directors -general, chief executives and other agencies and stakeholders. We do that early in the calendar year. We take that information on board, and we add that to what is already going on in the Audit Office in terms of our own processes for identifying potential performance audit topics. We put those together and we apply some criteria to that list. It can be quite a lengthy list of potential performance audit topics. We apply the criteria to that list, and then we develop a draft performance audit program which we issue for comment. 210 ACT ELECTORAL COMMISSIONER 3.19 The ACT Budget 2019 -20, Budget Statements A, states that: The Electoral Commissioner is an independent statutory office holder under the Electoral Act 1992. The Electoral Commissioner is a me mber of the ACT Electoral Commission, which consists of three statutory office holders - The Chairperson, the Electoral Commissioner and one other Member. The Electoral Commissioner is assisted by officers employed under the Public Sector Management Act 19 94 and the Electoral Act. The Electoral Commissioner is the chief executive officer off the Commission. The ACT Electoral Commission is responsible for: The conduct of elections and referendums for the ACT Legislative Assembly The determination of electora l boundaries for the ACT; and The provision of electoral information, education, advice and services to a wide range of clients. 211 MATTERS CONSIDERED 3.20 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the ACT Electoral Commissioner included: electoral redistribution ;212 polling booths ;213and 210 Mr Stanton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 655- 656. 211 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements A , ACT Executive, ACT Integrity Commission, Auditor -General , Office of the Legislative Assembly , p. 27. 212 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p. 1146. 213 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p p. 1146- 1147. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 45 count -back process - when a sitting member resigns.214 KEY ISSUES COUNT -BACK PROCESS - WHEN A SITTING MEMB ER RESIGNS 3.21 The Committee queried with the ACT Electoral Commission as to how long it takes from when a sitting member resigns to the new successful candidate being announced. The Committee were informed that: The formal process is initiated by the Speaker writing to me, as the commissioner. Having seen that requirement coming along in the next few days, we wil l do our best to forewarn the Canberra Times and secure an opportunity to put the official public notification in the Canberra Times, as well as publishing online and on our website that the casual vacancy has arisen and the countback process is required t o be put in place. Ten days after that public notification, the nominations for that countback process close. As soon as the public notification is made, I also endeavour by every means practicable to contact those candidates who contested for the seat, i n this case of Yerrabi, at that time, in the 2016 elections, and invite them to recontest. At the 10 -day juncture, midday on that day, the opportunity to nominate closes. I shortly thereafter announce those candidates. The process of the electronic countback is very quick, given its electronic nature, and we will know the outcome of that very quickly thereafter. But I officially notify that normally 24 to 48 hours after it is known to us in an official capacity. The intent of that is to give the successfu l candidate, before he or she becomes an MLA, the opportunity to resign from any public position or other position which would compromise his or her capacity to be an MLA. So, in answer to your question, I think you could allow two weeks from start to fin ish, including the time that might be taken for the Speaker to put together a formal notification to me. That is a comfortable time line. 215 ACT OMBUDSMAN 3.22 The ACT Ombudsman's role is to resolve complaints and monitor the actions of government agencies and th e police under the Ombudsman Act 1989 and other legislation.

The ACT Ombudsman indicated that: The new act is now well and truly up and running. I am aware that there has been some consideration in the Assembly around amendments to the act, but it has been up and running since January 2018. We are seeing, I think, a growing understanding of how the act is intended to work amongst ACT directorates and members of the public \u2014and, indeed, in some cases, members of the Assembly who have availed themselves of their right to seek reviews and things of that ilk through the act. 222 3.25 In addition , the ACT Ombudsman also stated that his office undertook a 'series of statutory activities' in relation to the FOI Act which included: ... review applications; that is, review applications for reviews of decisions that agencies take. An agency says to a person, \"We do not want you to have document X.\" People come to us to seek review of that. We had 37 of those in 2018 -19, up to 31 216 ACT Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.act.gov.au/abo ut-us/what -we-do/ombudsmans -role, accessed 10 June 2019. 217 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 658- 659. 218 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 659- 660. 219 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 659. 220 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 660. 221 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 660- 661. 222 Mr Manthorpe, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 658.

We h ave had 12 deemed decision notices. That is where an agency cannot or does not meet the prescribed time frames for dealing with an FOI request; they are required to notify us, and indeed the Assembly, of that, for extension of time requests. We currently h ave 11 review applications on hold, and we are churning through those as quickly as we can. 223 3.26 When speaking about increasing the understanding of the A ct the Committee asked the ACT Ombudsman about the training provided to staff. The ACT Ombudsman indicated that: It is not so much a training program. What we have done is stand up a community of practice forum with all the FOI practitioners across the directorates. They have all been invited. We have had one of those already, and we have another one coming up in the second half of this year. We are continuing at an individual level with directorates and with the practitioners to engage with them. They can call my team at any time and speak about issues that they are grappling with. The intent is that they can learn from one another, identifying areas of best practice. And there is our work around developing guidelines. The two guidelines that we have currently got out for consultation, on open access and how to deal with informal requests, are borne out of the practitioners themselves saying, \"We would like more information and guidance on this from the Ombudsman.\" So that is what we have done.224 COORDINATION WITH INTEGRITY COMMISSIONER 3.27 The Committee asked about matters before the ACT Ombudsman that could be ref erred to the Integrity Commission and were informed that: At this moment in time, I do not think I would have any matter in front of me \u2014 certainly nothing that is top of mind \u2014that we would have in mind to refer to the integrity commission because it raised matters of serious corruption, criminality, fraud and the like. It is probably important to note that we will have a role with respect to the integrity commission .225 3.28 The Committee then acknowledged that the ACT Ombudsman would be fulfilling the role of inspector under the Act and asked how they had been preparing resources to make the role effective and were informed that: To start the work in the financial year we are in now, 2018 -19, we have got $41,000 from the ACT government. For 2019 -20, we have been allocated $96,000 ... It is 223 Mr Manthorpe, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 658. 224 Ms MacLeod, P roof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 659. 225 Mr Manthorpe, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 659.

During a discussion on entities covered by the scheme the ACT Ombudsman indicated that although there is no definitive list there: are in the order of 800 enti ties that we know of that are covered by the scheme. That includes a single school as a single entity, even though that might be part of a system, if you get the idea. Anyhow, there are 800 entities. With that many, we have sought to reach out to them all. We have sought to engage them all. Many have engaged. More and more are engaging, but \u2014227 3.30 The Committee went on to ask how many reports had been received by the ACT Ombudsman under the scheme and were advised that: Comparing apples and apples: 121 in 2017 1 8 and 159 in 2018- 19. But by the time we got to the end of financial year 2017 18 it was about 140. It is in our annual report. It has gone up a bit in the second financial year, which reflects the fact that the religious organisations are now covered by t he scheme. We have had a relatively small number of reports there. I suppose it reflects the fact that there is, again, growing awareness, growing engagement with the scheme. 228 226 Mr Manthorpe, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 660. 227 Mr Manthorpe, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 661. 228 Mr Manthorpe, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 661.

Under Section 6 of the Act, the Office's function is to provide impartial advice and support to the Legislative Assembly and committees and members of the Assembly, including: providing advice on parliamentary practice and procedure, and the functions of the Assembly and committees; reporting proceedings of the Assembly and meetings of committees; maintaining an official record of proceedings of the Assembly; providing library and information facilities and services for members; providing staff to enable the Assembly and committee to operate efficiently; providing business support functions, including administering the entitlements of members who are not part of the Executive; and maintaining the Assembly precincts; and providing public education about the function of the Assembly and committees.229 MATTERS CONSIDERED 4.2 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Office of the Legislative Assembly included: redesign of entrances to Legislative Assembly ;230 double -glazing project ;231 searchable Questions on Support Office ;234 committee structure benchmarking report ;235 229 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements A , ACT Executive, ACT Integrity Commission, Auditor -General , Office of the Legislative Assembly , p. 37. 230 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1062- 1063. 231 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1063- 1064. 232 Proof Transcript Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1064- 1067. 233 Proof Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1066- 1067. 234 Proof Transcript o f Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1067- 1070. 235 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1069- 1070.

The Committee was informed that: At the moment we have 10 standing committees, including the administration and procedure committee and the scrutiny committee, and we have a secretary assigned to each of those. But that includes the Clerk who is the secretary of administration and procedure.241 4.4 When pressed further as to the number of individual personnel , the OLA stat ed: If we take administration and procedure and scrutiny out of it, we have got eight standing commit tees and seven committee secretaries. The double- up is where we have the new committee on integrity .242 4.5 The Committee then questioned the assigning of responsibilities to secretaries when there were additional select committees and were informed that aside from one secretary having two Standing Committees there were 'two individuals with both a s tanding committee and a select committee.' 243 4.6 In terms of administrative assistance the Committee was informed that the Committee Support Office has 'two research offic ers for the whole committee office and there is one and a half staff for administrative assistance in the committee office.' 244 236 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1070- 1071. 237 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1071- 1072. 238 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1075- 1076 239 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1075- 1076. 240 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 236- 240; Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 654 -655, 659- 660. 241 Ms Agostino, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1068. 242 Ms Agostino, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1068. 243 Ms Agostino, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1068. 244 Mr Duncan, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, pp. 1069- 1070.

Recommendation 17 4.8 The Committee recommends that the Office of the Legislative Assembly increase the level of administrative support provided to Committee Secretaries . ASPG CONFERENCE 4.9 The Committee asked a number of questions in relation to the Australasian Study of Parliament Group (ASPG) conference and how the Assembly was contributing to that. They were informed by the OLA that in terms of who was involved in the organisation: The of fice has been involved, along with the Department of the Senate, the Department of Parliamentary Services and the Department of the House of Representatives to pull together that conference this year in October. The theme is on disrupting parliaments. There is a whole range of subthemes around some of the challenges that are facing parliaments not only in Australia but also around the world. We are just going through the process of reviewing abstracts for presenters and looking at how the program will pan o ut. That is very much a cooperative venture with our commonwealth colleagues. The conference itself will be held at Parliament House on, I think 4, 5 and 6 October. I am going off my memory. 245 4.10 The Committee also asked about the financial commitment that was being made by the Legislative Assembly in relation to the conference and was informed that : There is a financial commitment but not one that is coming off the office of the Assembly's books. It is a membership -driven organisation and there is a fee for, essentially, service. It is a cost recovery arrangement where the fees will, all being well, meet the costs of the conference. So, other than any staff we choose to send to the conference, there should not be a net cost to the territory.246 245 Mr Skinner, P roof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1071. 246 Mr Skinner, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1071. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 52 4.11 The OLA further stated that there were OLA staff helping out but that it was effectively a 'resource in kind' and was not a significant cost: I do not think it is a significant cost. The Australasian Study of Parliament Group has been going since, I think, 1978. It is very much nurtured by the community of parliaments across Australia and the Pacific. It is a rotating conference arrangement where once every 10 years or nine years one of the jurisdictions will be the host. That relies on parliaments themselves and their suppo rt agencies to put the shoulder to the wheel to get that conference going.247 SEARCHABLE QUESTIONS ON NOTICE 4.12 In discussions on chamber matters , the Committee asked about the possibility of software being made available that would enable Questions on Notice ( QONs) to be searchable. In response , the OLA indicated that 'we got some funding last year in the budget to progress this'248 and went on to explain: The office received funding to look at some digitisation opportunities over a two -year period. We engaged a consulting firm to look at a number of processes. They are both parliamentary processes, things like the questions on notice options and submissions from the public coming into the Assembly. But also they looked at internal business processes like time sheets and invoice processing. We can see that opportunities might present to modernise a particular process in isolation, but we wanted to avoid endi ng up with six, seven or eight different systems that complicated our ICT management. We have had a report from those consultants who have said, \"Look, you do have a number of processes. Because they are heavily dependent on paper, you are going to have to look at transforming those into a digital platform.\" I think the questions on notice database is certainly one of\u2014 I will not call it one of the simpler ones; it is one of the less difficult processes \u2014 249 4.13 When questioned as to the current form of the QON database the OLA informed the Committee that there was a 'checklist that we monitor' but agreed that it was more like an index and that it was more 'just tracking numbers' as opposed to a database.250 4.14 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice the OLA explained the process and form of lodging and storing a QON : A question on notice (QN) is lodged with the Clerk in accordance with standing order 113(a) in both soft and hard copy format by the Member asking the QoN. The soft copy text for each QoN is manually tran sferred into a database along with relevant 247 Mr Skinner, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1072. 248 Ms J Burch MLA, Speaker, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1064. 249 Mr Duckworth, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1065. 250 Mr Duncan, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1066. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 53 information specific to that QoN. The database stores the following information for each QoN: the number; the Member asking the QoN; the subject; the Minister to which the QoN is directed; any approved transfer o f a QoN to another Minister; withdrawal of a QoN; date the QoN is placed on the Questions on Notice Paper; date the answer is received and the relevant Hansard page number (this is included at a later date); and a variety of statistics for all QoNs. On th e Friday of a sitting week, the Questions on Notice Paper is published on the public website at https://www.parliament.act.gov.au/in -the-assembly/ questions - paper. This paper contains the number and full text of each QoN, the Member who lodged the QoN and w hich Minister it is directed to, along with a date on which the QoN is due to be answered. A Minister has 30 days from the date the Questions on Notice Paper is published to provide an answer to the Member. Once a Minister has answered a QoN, their office provides four hard copies of the answer, including the original, and a soft copy to the Office of the Clerk The answer is then recorded as being received in the database on the date the original signed answer is provided. The database does not have the ca pacity to store the text of the answer to a QoN. The soft copy and a hard copy of the answer are then forwarded to Hansard for inclusion in a Weekly Hansard. If any attachments are included with the answer, unless they are brief and easily included, they d o not appear in the Weekly Hansard and a copy can be obtained from the Office of the Clerk (this advice appears with the answer in the Weekly Hansard). The original answer to a QoN, signed by the Minister, is stored in a hard copy file to be kept indefinit ely by the Office of the Clerk. A hard copy of an answer with a coversheet attached, is then delivered to the Member via hand delivery or internal mail. The fourth hardcopy is then stored on a temporary file for use when drafting future Notice Papers. There is currently no easily accessible function for Members to search for QoNs or answers. One of the 2019 -20 Budget priorities for the Office of the Legislative Assembly is to continue the digital transformation of the Assembly's business processes and the d igitisation of the Assembly's archived records. On the Tuesday of every sitting week (for double sitting weeks this occurs only on the first Tuesday), the text of all outstanding QoNs are placed on the Notice Paper, including any questions that may have be en redirected. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, only the numbers of the outstanding QoNs are listed on the Notice Paper. This information is extracted from the database . 251 4.15 The OLA further stated that the ' questions go into the Weekly Hansard. To search for a question, as the Speaker said, you would have to go into that week of Hansard and know the number .'252 251 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 361, answered 5 July 2019. 252 Ms Tancred, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 27 June 2019, p. 1067.

As a central agency, CMTEDD provides strategic advice and support to the Chief Ministe r, the Directorate's Ministers and the Cabinet on policy, economic and financial matters, service delivery, whole of government issues and intergovernmental relations. The Directorate facilitates the implementation of government priorities and drives many initiatives, including being an inclusive and welcoming city, strengthening relations with NSW, and the Reportable Conduct Scheme. The Directorate also leads the strategic direction for the ACT Public Service (ACTPS), to ensure that it is well positioned t o perform its role. 253 5.2 The Committee considered the following Output classes and outputs, Statements of Intent and Funds: Output Class 1: Government Strategy Output 1.1: Government Policy and Reform Output 1.2: Workforce Capability and Governance Output 1.3: Coordinated Communications and Community Engagement Output 1.4: Digital Strategy Output Class 2: Access Canberra Output 2.1: Access Canberra Output Class 3: Economic Development Output 3.1: Innovation, Industry and Investment Output 3.2: VisitCanberra Output 3.3: Sport and Recreation Output 3.4: Events Output 3.5: Arts Engagement Output 3.6 Higher Education, Training and Research Output Class 4: Financial and Economic Management 253 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 1.

Additional matters are detailed below. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 57 KEY ISSUES TONE OF THE BUDGET 5.4 The Committee and the budget adviser noted a political tone to certain sections of the budget. The following section of the budget is of particular note: The past six years have been characterised by a lack of investment in Canberra by the Coalition Government. The ACT has received just 0.8 per cent of national infrastructure funding during the Coalition's last two terms. This translates to around half what our per capita share w ould be, a shortfall of about $307 million since the Coalition took office. Public service job cuts, decentralisation and unequal funding deals in key areas like health and education have underlined the Coalition's disregard for Canberra. With the Coalitio n having recently been returned for a further term in government, there is little prospect of this situation changing in the next three years. But with Canberra growing by around 8,000 people a year, we cannot allow local services and infrastructure to fall behind as our community continues to grow. So just as we did five years ago in the face of Tony Abbott's cuts and the Mr Fluffy crisis, we will step up and invest in Canberra. 254 5.5 The budget advisers suggest that the 'political commentary in Budget Paper 3 is unbecoming for a small jurisdiction that wants to be taken seriously. ' 255 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.6 The Committee acknowledges that, as well as being an important planning and accountability document, the budget has a political element wherein it sets out how a government will go about fulfilling election pledges and responding to community concerns. Some of the Committee does not believe, however, that the budget documents are the appropriate forum for partisan commentary. ACCOUNTABILITY INDICATORS 5.7 Accoun tability indicators are a key way to measure government performance against the goals it establishes in its budget. The budget papers set out for each output 2018 -19 targets, 2018 - 19 estimated outcomes and 2019 -20 targets. Committees have, over the years, suggested various improvements that could be made to individual indicators to improve their usefulness and to make their measurement or target more meaningful. 254 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Paper 3 , p. 37. 255 Review of the ACT Budget 2019 -20, Pegasus Economics, June 2019, p. 3. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 58 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.8 The Committee acknowledges that a balance must be struck between the importanc e of having measurable targets to assess performance against and the resource required to gather that data. The Committee has made recommendations under some outputs where it believes that specific accountability indicators could be improved. Recommendatio n 19 5.9 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government include historical series of accountability indicators to demonstrate performance measures over time.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 60 WELLBEING INDICATORS 5.15 The Committee asked about the development of wellbeing indicators for the budget. The Chief Minister noted that he had announced in 2018 that the ACT Government would be developing a set of wellbeing indicators to measure progress beyond traditional econom ic metrics. Work , including community consultation, is underway developing these. The Chief Minister said that he: will announce the final indicators for the first phase on Canberra Day next year and they will then be part of the 2020 budget process. I wa nt to stress that this is the beginning. It will not be the end of the process. If you were to look at similar examples elsewhere in our region, particularly in New Zealand, whom we are working very closely with, they were very clear in their budget that was released a few weeks ago that that was the beginning of a process, not the be- all and end -all. It will be iterative. It will adapt over time. 270 5.16 The Chief Minister indicated that environmental indicators were likely but cautioned: we do not want a wellbe ing framework that has 4,000 indicators. We have to be sensible around how we approach this. In New Zealand they have dropped to about 12 domains and then a series of indicators within them. So we are not replicating the Australian government census here. But we are wanting to drill down to a set of meaningful indicators that the majority of Canberrans would agree are the ones we should be focusing on against an approach that saw thousands of indicators. 271 5.17 The Chief Minister agreed that this approach would go beyond triple bottom line reporting and eventually evolve to indicate priority areas for the budgeting process. Part of the intent is to encourage initiatives across government that focus not just on assessing fiscal impact but their 'capacity to positively improve wellbeing ' as measured against the chosen wellbeing indicators. 272 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.18 The Committee notes that a consultation process is underway to determine the wellbeing indicators. Recommendation 21 5.19 The Committee recommends that, by the last sitting day of 2019, the ACT Government, through the Chief Minister , report to the Legislative Assembly on the methodology being 270 Chief Minister, Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 228- 229. 271 Chief Minister, Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 230- 231. 272 Chief Minister, Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 231.

Recommendation 22 5.20 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government include all Members of the Legislative Assembly in the development of the wellbeing indicators. Recommendation 23 5.21 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government advise the Legislative Assembly of how the wellbeing indicators will interact with the current accountability indicators. SOCIAL INCLUSION STATEMENT AND MAKING AN AGE-FRIENDLY CITY 5.22 The Committee asked about creating an age -friendly city, noting that fewer than half of Canberra's suburbs were considered age -friendly and upgrades were limited to two suburbs a year. The Chief Minister replied that the city's demographics were changing and t hat this necessitates a change in service delivery in some areas. Regarding the speed of the program he said: There will always be a limit on resources. We cannot have upgrades for every suburb under the age -friendly program all at once. There would not be industry capacity to do so. Within that program there has been an emphasis on identifying areas with a greater population density of senior Canberrans, where the existing infrastructure needed that immediate upgrade. I will take on board the desire, if it becomes a recommendation of the committee, that the government look at speeding up that program in particular areas. We can certainly look at that. 273 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.23 The Committee notes the importance of public infrastructure in improving access and accessibility for senior citizens, a vital step in addressing social inclusion. The Committee 273 Chief Minister, Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 337. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 62 acknowledges the logic of targeting suburbs with larger numbers of senior Canberrans first but believes that the program needs to be rolled out more quickly, given t he increased number of older Canberrans. Recommendation 24 5.24 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government expand the age -friendly suburbs program to cover a greater number of suburbs each year. WORKFORCE CAPABILITY AND GOVERNANCE (1.2) 5.25 This output prov ides for the p rovision of 'an employment and policy framework to support a professional, skilled and accountable public service that is responsive to the ACT Government and the community; and management of whole of government capacity building programs .'274 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.26 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Workforce Capability and Governance included: insecure work ;275 use of labour hire firms;276 impact of short -term community grants (also discussed under Landcare ACT, PWDACT, KBRG and Environment) ;277 whole -of-government changes in bullying and harassment;278 professional standards unit;279 breaches of the Public Sector Management Act 1994 ;280 and Public Sector Commissioner resourcing and re sponse time.281 274 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 19. 275 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 224- 227. 276 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 225- 22; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 038, answered 26 June 2019. 277 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 226. 278 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 241- 243; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 039, answered 27 June 2019. 279 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 242. 280 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 242; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 040, answered 3 July 2019. 281 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 243- 244; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 060, answered 26 June 2019. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 63 KEY ISSUES INSECURE WORK 5.27 The Committee asked questions about insecure work in various parts of government throughout the Estimates hearings. Under this output the Committee asked about the approach across the whole -of-government. The Directo rate informed the Committee that in the budget there was a $471,000 initiative in 2019 -20 to support the insecure work taskforce and to conduct a classification review. These arose from enterprise bargaining negotiations. The first phase is to identify are as of employment that can be converted to permanency. Areas where there will be changes or closer examination include school cleaners, Access Canberra labour hire employees, ICT professionals, graduate nurses, casual teachers and library service casuals. 282 5.28 The Directorate confirmed that policy was to move away from labour hire firms but there would still be a need for them at unexpected peak times and particularly where there is a role requiring an unusual skill set not readily available in the service and t he Committee was informed that: You will always have a need for temporary casual and labour hire as that buffer, as that top-up, to be able to deliver in the service. When that becomes the norm is where insecure work becomes a problem. There is plenty of e vidence around to show that long- term, insecure work has a terrible effect on the employees concerned. It costs the employer through repeated recruitment processes, through our corporate knowledge walking out the door when every contract expires. There are a lot of good reasons to do this. The model that we have struck gives us a balance between allowing for buffers to fill needs where need be and the tendency towards permanency. 283 5.29 The Committee also asked about the impact short- term government grants have o n employment in community organisations. The Chief Minister noted that there were challenges where there was joint funding with the Commonwealth but that, broadly speaking moving to three to five year contractual arrangements is a sensible approach. 284 COMMI TTEE COMMENT 5.30 The Committee notes the value of permanent work for both employers and employees but also acknowledges that there will remain a need for casual staff. The Committee notes that government should make use of contractors and consultants in areas where it would not be 282 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 224- 225. 283 Mr Noud, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 226. 284 Chief Minister, Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 226. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 64 efficient to maintain expertise within the public service. However, s pending on consultants may at times indicate an area where government should build capacity. Recommendation 25 5.31 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government cont inue to create permanent positions where possible, focusing on what works best for both employer and employee. Recommendation 26 5.32 The Committee recommends that ACT Government preference secure work where possible, with other arrangements to be maintained when appropriate and in the best interests of both employer and employees. Recommendation 27 5.33 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure financial certainty for community organisations by offering grant funding for periods greater than one year , simplify the grant application process for community groups and streamline the process and paperwork for community grants of up to $5000. Recommendation 28 5.34 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government publish specific information about contractor and consultant numbers as well as spending on consultants and contractors for each directorate. Recommendation 29 5.35 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government include organisation charts showing full time equivalent and classification by area in Budget Papers.

Additionally it was stated that: We have not done formal evaluations of those projects so far, but we certainly have done a series of case studies, presentations, workshops and discussions that have been open to both the community, public sector, employees, practitioners and academics to discuss these processes and what we have learnt and the rich learnin gs that have come through these deliberative processes. 289 DIGITAL STRATEGY (1.4) 5.39 This output provides for p rovision of 'advice, support and project delivery for the digital transformation of government services ,'290 285 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 20. 286 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 244- 246. 287 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 246- 249. 288 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 249- 251. 289 Ms Perkins, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 245. 290 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 20.

ACCESS CANBERRA (2.1) 5.42 The budget papers state that: Access Canberra contributes to the economic growth and vibrancy of Canberra and provides protection to the community through complian ce, licencing and regulation. These activities are undertaken through a risk based framework which does not unnecessarily hinder businesses from flourishing. Access Canberra provides services and collects revenue on behalf of other Directorates, providin g customer services to businesses, community groups and individuals through a 'no wrong door' approach. 299 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.43 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Access Canberra included: 291 Proof Transcript of Evid ence , 18 June 2019, p. 232. 292 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 232, 235- 236. 293 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 233. 294 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 233. 295 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 233. 296 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 233- 234. 297 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 234. 298 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 235- 236. 299 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , p. 21.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 68 September 2018. Officials informed the Committee that the Register is one tool by which the regulator can guide people's decision -making to assist in driving poor quality builders out of the market. Access Canberra is increasing its focus on providing communication to industry and consumers about what quality looks like. Regarding ac tions taken under the Act: there is a natural justice process that needs to be followed. We cannot immediately move to put something up on the disciplinary register. The act itself [...] is prescriptive about what we can and cannot. We have taken some legal advice around that. We have had some discussions with the minister about what that might look like in the future. 316 5.45 The Directorate informed the Committee that the Register gets updated when a decision has been finalised, which includes the conclusion of an y possible appeal period. The Register does not record regulatory actions, but disciplinary action taken against a licenced entity.317 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.46 The Committee notes the advice that the Register deals with specific matters under the Construction Occupations (Licensing) Act 2004 and does not cover all regulatory action in the construction industry. The Committee believes, however, that consumers would be better served by having a clearer picture of the full range of regulatory action at the time when they select a builder. Recommendation 30 5.47 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government expand the Register of Disciplinary Actions or establish a separate register, to genuinely reflect the compliance and rectification work being done on building sites around Canberra and give clarity to consumers as they go through the process of choosing a builder . BUSINESS SATISFACTION WITH ACCESS CANBERRA 5.48 The Committee asked about the perception in the business community about the ease of engagement with Access Canberra. The Committee was informed that: A lot of this activity is driven by our desire to constantly improve the experience that people have when they engage with the organisation as they are attempting to perhaps license a new business or achiev e something, get something done. What we have is a very comprehensive process where following inspections, either for licensing - type arrangements or just general proactive inspections, we then have an officer who, 316 Mr Peffer, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 384- 385. 317 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 385. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 69 independent of the inspectorate teams, has a program of work of contacting literally thousands of businesses to seek feedback on whether the information that our inspectors provided at the time was simple, whether there was a level of helpfulness from our team members to ensure that, where busines ses were not compliant or were not sure what they needed to do, we were assisting them to achieve compliance. It is probably fair to say that there will be some entities where our engagement is a less than pleasant one. That might be for reasons of enforce ment activities that we are actually taking. For some businesses we accept that it is perhaps never going to be an engagement that you look back on and say, \"Wasn't that amazing!\" But for the vast majority we aim for having an experience where we constantly seek feedback to look at what is it that we need to do, what is it we need to improve in our activities to ensure that we drive towards that outcome of making this a good place to do business. 318 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.49 The Committee notes the importance of a po sitive business perception in assisting Access Canberra in perform its role. Recommendation 31 5.50 The Committee recommends that t hat the ACT Government raise the accountability indicator of businesses satisfaction rate with engaging with Access Canberra , given the increased funding of over $6 million to controlled recurrent payments of Access Canberra. FIX MY STREET CASE RESOLUTIO N 5.51 The Committee asked about notifying users when cases lodged in Fix My Street are concluded and were informed that Fix My Street c omplaints were accepted by Access Canberra and passed on to the relevant business unit, usually within Transport Canberra and City Service (TCCS). They were also told that: There have been a number of activities in the last year about closing that loop wit h customers to ensure that people are kept aware of what is occurring. One of the activities recently has been to refer calls when people are calling to follow up where their job is straight through to the business unit responsible for the piece of work rather than chasing it up second -hand. [...] There is also a project underway, which is in the TC CS system, which is about joining fix my street and the asset management system together. That will improve the 318 Mr Rynehart, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 394. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 70 automation and the way that the feedback goes strai ght back to the customers. That is expected to be delivered this year.319 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.52 The Committee notes that this issue has been raised repeatedly at Estimates and annual report hearings and is pleased to see that Access Canberra is making progress in this area. Recommendation 32 5.53 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensures Access Canberra take steps to 'close the loop' on Fix My Street service requests, so that customers are advised whether action will be taken to rectify their complaint. DIGITAL SERVICES , CUSTOMER CONTACT AND SATISFACTION 5.54 The Committee asked about Access Canberra's satisfaction survey and were informed that the satisfaction survey is published on the website. Satisfaction with Fix My Street is not measured separately but is part of the digital services satisfaction rate. Regarding the length of time taken to resolve a complaint the Committee was told: Customer satisfaction remains high when we focus on delivering the outcome for the customer. When we get for the customer the service that they are after or the outcome that they are after the satisfaction remains high. Time is an element of that but it is not the only element. One of the pressures or tensions for us is that we always attempt to get something resolved as quickly as we can. It is equally important for us to get the customer the right answer, so that they do not have to make multiple attempts or multiple visits to get the outcome that they are after. So we balance both of those against each other. 320 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.55 The Committee notes the work that goes into the satisfaction survey and believes that some additional indicators would assist Access Canberra in measuring its performance. Recommendation 33 5.56 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure Access Canberra undertake a breakdown of its digital services satisfaction survey so that the more 319 Mr Rynehart, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 404. 320 Mr Rynehart, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 405.

Recommendation 34 5.57 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure Access Canberra introduces a new accountability indicator to measure the call dropout rate in order to identify and reduce the number of abandoned calls. Recommendation 35 5.58 The Committee recommends that t he ACT Government ensure Access Canberra introduce s a separate measure for services only 'partially completed' online so as to not conflate the number of services fully completed online. Recommendation 36 5.59 The Committee recommends that ACT Government ensure Access Canberra introduce s an accountability indicator to reduce the waiting times for applications for a Working with Vulnerable People Card.

The Commissioner for International Engagement noted that the objective in establishing his office was to assist the diversification of the ACT economy. Sometimes there are quick outcomes, such as a meeting in Hong Kong with Ovolo leading to Ovolo running the former Hotel. Other results, such as the effect of making introductions on behalf of ACT firms, may take longer to materialise and are difficult to measure. Some outcomes can be measured through cooperation with Austrade and Tourism Au stralia, as they have metrics that can be isolated to the ACT level. 339 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.64 The Committee notes the difficulty of measuring outcomes in this area and believes that this applies to many aspects of this output. Recommendation 38 5.65 The Committee rec ommends that the ACT Government improve accountability indicators to track meaningful results for innovation initiatives, for example actual outcomes for businesses involved. VISITCANBERRA (3.2) 5.66 VisitCanberra creates and implements a range of innovative tourism marketing and development programs, in partnership with local industry, national bodies and institutions, which aim to support the Territory's economic development through increased visitation to the ACT and region. 340 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.67 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to VisitCanberra included: 338 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 318. 339 Mr Smyth, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 316- 317. 340 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 22.

The Directorate informed the Committee that in was launched earlier in 2019. It is intended to promote a whole -of- government approach to cycle tourism and includes a working group of relevant agencies. VisitCanberra told the Committee: One of the key advantages for the strategy and ho w it has been executed is about taking advantage of the diversity of experiences that people can participate in when they come to Canberra. One of the great things about cycling in Canberra is that you can access a really diverse range of experiences on a bike. The iconic route around the lake, the bridge to bridge ride, is something that cannot be done in many other cities around Australia. You can take in and immerse yourself in Australia's capital in that way. Stromlo Forest Park has a world -class mounta in bike facility that is a five to 10 - minute drive from a hotel in the city centre. The proximity of that venue to the city centre is one of the primary reasons why events come to Canberra. It is because of the proximity of that facility to other things, s uch as hotels and the things that people need to access when they are participating in an event. 348 5.69 The strategy leverages existing resources across government and has no separate funding. The strategy identifies three key markets: leisure or recreation users, special interest or niche markets which includes mountain biking, and elite sports users. 349 The leisure market is by far 341 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 342- 343. 342 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 344- 345. 343 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 345- 347. 344 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p p. 352- 354. 345 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 355- 357; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 064, answer ed 25 June 2019. 346 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 357- 358. 347 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 358- 359. 348 Mr Kobus, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 355. 349 CBR Cycle Tourism Strategy , https://tourism.act.gov.au/wp -content/uploads/2018/06/CBR_Cycle_strategy_WEB.pdf p. 7, accessed 16 July 2019.

Recommendation 39 5.71 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government invest in recreational road biking amenity and opportunities, as well consider expanding Stromlo Forest Park and other recreational mountain biking locations, to encourage participation and community health, and to take advantage of growing tourism opportunities . SPORT AND RECREATION (3.3) 5.72 Sport and Recreation supports Canberra's participation in organised sport and recreation through delivery of programs, facilities and pathways. As part of this it provides support services to local high p erformance athletes, administers grants and delivers education and training opportunities to maintain and enhance the capabilities of the community sport and recreation sector in the ACT. 351 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.73 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Sports and Recreation included: Stromlo Forest Part \u2014playing bus service to Stromlo Forest Park pool;355 provision of sporting facilities across the ACT;356 350 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 357. 351 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 22. 352 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 940- 941. 353 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 941- 943. 354 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 943- 944; 949. 355 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 944; Answer to a Question Taken on Notice E19- 321, answered 4 July 2019. 356 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 944- 947.

In response the Committee was informed that 'the 50 -metre pool is constructed'. The Directorate stated that 'they are water testing it at the moment. They are well underway with the rest of it. We are currently doing the splash pool. The gym is also being constructed as we speak'.361 5.75 The Committee asked how the pool will facilitate hydrotherapy. The Directorate indicated: That leisure pool itself will be heated to a temperature of 32 d egrees. Within that pool itself we will provide a number of hydrotherapy options. That will include exercise classes and some rehabilitation classes will be able to utilise that pool... What it will not do, though, is provide exclusive hydrotherapy service s. That is the issue. And it will not be able to get the water up to 34 degrees. 362 5.76 The Directorate explained that in order to heat up the pool to 34 degrees it would take eight hours and to cool it back down to 32 degrees would take two days. 363 Minister Berr y, Minister for Sports and Recreation (the Minister), added that the pool 'has never been designed to be at 34 degrees'.364 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.77 The Committee notes that most hydrotherapy activities require a pool heated between 34 and 36 degrees Celsius. Give n that the new pool at Stromlo forest Park is not designed to facilitate the full range of hydrotherapy activities, the Committee believes the Government should consider the construction of another pool for exclusively hydrotherapy use. 357 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 946- 947. 358 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p p. 947- 948. 359 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 948- 949. 360 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 949. 361 Mr Bailey, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 941. 362 Mr Bailey, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 942. 363 Mr Bailey , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 942. 364 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 942. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 77 THE OPENING OF SCHOOL SPORTS FACILITIE S TO THE COMMUNITY 5.78 In the context of a discussion on efforts by the ACT Government to ensure that ACT residents have access to appropriate sporting facilities across the community, the Minister noted plans to further open school sportin g facilities for community use. She explained that: Across in the education portfolio, with support from sport and recreation, we are looking at opportunities to open up school halls and gyms so that they can be used outside of school hours by different g roups. For example, the Woden Dodgers Basketball Club are now playing at, and have their home at, Alfred Deakin school. The Hedley Beare Centre is also opening up. There will be a new school in Denman Prospect as well. 365 5.79 The Minister further explained the m easures the Education Directroate and Sports and Recreation are taking in this space: They are working to make sure that they are accessible, that they take account of those sports like roller derby that need a bit of extra space, bigger than just a basket ball sized court. They need a bigger space around the outside. It is making sure that when we are building new schools, the gaps that are identified through sport and rec's conversations with the sports across the community are taken into account. If we ca n meet those needs in those developments, that will happen as well.366 5.80 The Committee asked if there is a central register of the school sporting facilities open to community use. The Minister responded that there was not.367 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.81 The Committee sup ports the action of the Government to open school sporting facilities to the wider community. It notes that in order to facilitate a conversation between the various community sporting groups and Government as to what types of facilities would be used by these groups, Government should provide a central point of contact that includes information on all available, and potentially available, facilities. Recommendation 40 5.82 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government collate a l ist of all sports facilities in ACT Government schools which are available for out -of-hours use by the community for organised sport and recreation activities, and that this list is made publicly available. 365 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 946. 366 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 946. 367 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 946.

The Directorate informed the Committee that engaging an outside provider, Visabel, allowed Events ACT to make use of a level of events expertise that was not present in -house due to a change in Events ACT's staffing profile. Visabel is under contract for Floriade 2019 and a tender has just closed for an event producer for Floriade and Enlighten 2020 onwards. Floriade 2018 attendance was over 480,000, just short of the 2014 record.

Minister Ramsay, Minister for the Arts and Cultural Events (the Minister), told the Committee that: What we are doing this year is looking through how it is that we would be able to best invest in the community. It is a matter of looking at budget initiatives over a period. There have been some significant expense initiatives in previous years. The concentration this year was on particular infrastructure upgrades, knowing that that sets a very solid foundation for arts practices. It obviously sits alongside the ongoing matters such as the events fund, the program, the activities funding an d the reworking of the way that we have done the grants funding over the last couple of years as well to make sure that that funding is probably more accessible than it has been in previous years. 391 5.91 The Minister further informed the Committee that there was funding for Kulture Break and the National Eisteddfod in the social inclusion fund. 385 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 366, 375. 386 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 366- 368. 387 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 368. 388 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 368- 370; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 068, answered 26 June 2019. 389 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 374- 375. 390 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 375. 391 Minister Ramsay MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 366.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 82 there have been two rounds of the grants program. The first round included $204,285 for three projects.399 5.97 The Committee heard more detail about the three projects: The first of those grants was won by the Australian Training Company. Their project was allocated $70,900. That project was to engage 15 Australian school- based apprentices. They commenced their training on 19 November last year and they have completed pre -employment training and commenced work placements. We have got a program for a 100 ASBAs in government, so a good number of those young people would be working in those programs too. The second program was Master Builders Association, so that program was awarded $64,485. Seven women completed a four week pre- apprenticeship program. The youngest of those women was 14 years old and the oldest was 44 years old. They also completed their white card, asbestos awareness training and additional training in workplace health and safety, and the use power tools. Each of those participants had two work placements over the course of the program and they als o received support from AusHealth and life coaches that was embedded in the pre -apprenticeship program. Outcomes of that are that those women were enabled to build their confidence to go on to further education and training and to develop networks. The th ird project funded in round one was the National Electrical and Communications Association project. That was funded for $68,900, 32 women have participated across all cohorts of that program, which exceeded our target of 30 participants. And the fourth coh ort is currently in training. During that program, the women also completed white card, asbestos awareness training, CPR and first aid and also received training towards some additional units of competency that can be recognised towards other qualification s in the electro -technology industry. They also were able to access personal development support through AusHealth. The outcomes of that course are that one of the program graduates has actually commenced an apprenticeship with the National Electrical and Communications Association and another has commenced an apprenticeship with a business in Newcastle. 400 5.98 The Committee understands that round two has just commenced with five projects selected for approximately $560,000. Those projects focus on improving advo cacy, engagement and information sharing. One of the projects is a pre -apprenticeship program run by LJS Constructions, which will support 20 women to enter the construction industry. The remainder of the projects are looking at reducing the barriers faced by women wanting to enter trades.401 399 Ms Anderson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 429- 430. 400 Ms Anderson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 430. 401 Ms Anderson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 430.

Once the advisory committee is established research and modelling will be commissioned to inform the committee's views. 5.102 The Committee asked about the public release of the research and the Treasurer told the Committee that the work would inform Cabinet decision -making around next year's budget.427 416 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 129- 131 417 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 133; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 021, answered 2 July 2019; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 022, answered 25 June 2019. 418 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 133- 135. 419 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 135- 139, 213- 214; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 036, answered 25 June 2019. 420 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 139- 142. 421 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 142- 146; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 023, answered 25 June 2019. 422 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 146- 149, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 314, Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 024, answered 25 June 2019. 423 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 149- 156; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 026, answered 26 June 2019; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 031, answered 2 July 2019. 424 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 156- 157. 425 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 157- 158. 426 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 158- 160; Answer to Question Taken on Notice 19-025, answered 25 June 2019. 427 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 106. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF TH E LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 85 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.103 The Committee believes it is important that the public can view research undertaken as part of the review of tax reform and notes that the earlier it is released the more the public can contribute to debate. Recommendation 42 5.104 The Commit tee recommends that the ACT Government release in full to the community, any research commissioned by, and findings of the tax reform advisory committee, as soon as they have been seen by Cabinet and prior to 2020 -21 budget papers , where possible. COMMONWEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN THE TERRITORY 5.105 The Committee asked about Commonwealth infrastructure investment in the ACT in recent years as compared to other jurisdictions. The Treasurer informed the Committee that the Territory had 'received well belo w our population share of national infrastructure investment ' with a cumulative effect of over $300 million. The Treasurer observed: The commonwealth can make infrastructure investments in a variety of ways internal to the territory. They do not necessaril y always need to make infrastructure investments in partnership with the territory government. They could, for example, invest in their own assets in the territory. There are ample opportunities for the commonwealth to do that with their own assets. That would be a capital expense for them. I am aware of a number of commonwealth assets that are in desperate need of further investment. There is a long list: national cultural institutions, the Australian Institute of Sport, the parliamentary triangle itself. Commonwealth Park would be another example. 428 5.106 The Committee was also informed that infrastructure projects where the Commonwealth and Territory governments are partnering are mainly roads.429 5.107 The Committee asked about investment in the National Capital Autho rity (NCA). The Treasurer observed that the NCA's breadth of responsibilities is broader than their financial means. While the NCA gets money for specific projects the assets created by the projects need to be maintained. The Territory is engaged in discus sions with the NCA about combined investment, including around Commonwealth Avenue Bridge infrastructure.430 428 Treasurer Andrew Bar MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 115 429 Treasurer Andrew Bar MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 115. 430 Treasurer Andrew Bar MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 116- 117. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 86 5.108 The Treasurer also noted calls from New South Wales for the commonwealth to restart the asset recycling initiative. The Treasurer indicated that this could provide an economic stimulus and that planning needed to begin shortly if projects were to replace the large number of east coast infrastructure projects that will start to taper off in the early to mid -2020s. 431 LEASE VARIATION CHARGE REVIEW 5.109 The Committee asked about the initiative to improve the Lease Variation Charge (LVC) . Treasury officials informed the Committee that the budget outlines the outcome of the Lease Variation Charge review. Changes agreed include introducing a remission for commun ity housing providers, increasing access to the deferred payment scheme and changes to simplify the scheme and improve the presentation of information.432 Possible changes to codified charges will be the subject of consultation with industry with the intent that recommendation will be put before government in time for consideration in the next budget.433 5.110 The Committee noted the concerns of developers about the variations in charges and the difficulty of knowing what they will be at the start of a project. The T reasurer and officials explained that they were seeking to make the charges more predictable but that improvements to the system had still fit within the existing system. COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.111 The Committee acknowledges that the government is attempting to imp rove the functionality of the system without significantly reducing revenue. The Committee notes the interest in the business community in improvements to the charge scheme and encourages the government to release information to assist in consultation. Recommendation 43 5.112 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government publicly release a summary of the analysis undertaken by, and findings of, the L ease Variation Charge review as soon as possible . Recommendation 44 431 Treasurer Andrew Bar MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 117- 118. 432 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Paper No. 3, p. 172. 433 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 139- 140. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRI ATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 87 5.113 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that further reforms made to the Lease Variation Charge, as listed on page 172 of Budget Paper 3 , be completed and in place for the 2020 -21 Budget . LARGE -SCALE GENERATION CER TIFICATES 5.114 Large -scale Generation Certificates (formerly called Renewable Energy Certificates) are credits received for the generation of renewable energy under the Commonwealth Government's large -scale renewable energy target. Once created and recognised the certificates can be surrendered with the price dete rmined through the open market.434 The Committee noted that the spot and forward prices for the certificates had dropped and asked why the ACT's certificates had not been sold before prices dropped. 5.115 Treasury officials informed the Committee that from an acco unting perspective revenue from the certificates is booked at the time they are received, and expense captured when they are surrendered. The certificates are an asset for the government when received and that asset is lost at surrender. The spot price of the certificates approximately halved between June 2018 and May 2019. 435 DIVERSITY IN ACT ECONOMY 5.116 The Committee asked about the claims in the budget papers that the ACT economy was diversifying. The Treasurer said that the principal measure was gross state p roduct (GSP). He said that most sectors outside of public administration are contributing to recent growth in GSP. Service exports have particularly grown with the ACT now the highest per capita service exporter in Australia. 436 5.117 When asked about possible tre nds in Commonwealth Government expenditure the Treasurer noted bipartisan commitments to defence and national security that would drive increased government expenditure in the ACT. Commonwealth spending on consultants and contractors is significant. Some p rivate sector agencies in the area of higher education and space industry may see growth driven by government decisions. While there was always a risk of reduced expenditure, the Senate was an obstacle to dramatic change. Overall the Treasurer thought the view of the Committee's budget advisers was 'unduly pessimistic ' and that the outlook was 'more benign .' 437 5.118 The Committee asked about the advice of the budget adviser that is no real diversification, such as the statement that there 'is no evidence to suggest there has been a dramatic shift in 434 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Paper No. 3, p. 431. 435 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 146. 436 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 146- 147. 437 Treasurer Andrew Bar MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 147- 148. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 88 the drivers of ACT final demand over recent years .'438 The Treasurer noted that there are a number of different industry sectors, so even if a percentage share were to remain the same there could be increased diversity w ithin it. It is not just about the relative share of commonwealth versus non -commonwealth activity in the ACT but the also the differing contributing factors to each share.439 5.119 At a later appearance the Treasurer noted: Real state gross product has been grow ing faster in the ACT than in any other state or territory. Our economy continues to diversify. Professional, scientific and technical services grew by 11.2 per cent in the 2017 -18 fiscal year; that was a contribution of 0.9 percentage points to the four p ercentage point growth. So around a quarter of the territory's GSP growth in 2017 -18 came through professional, scientific and technical services. We have also seen strong growth in health care and social assistance, by 8.5 per cent. That is tied in with the ramp -up of the NDIS scheme. Construction and information, media and telecommunications also grew, by 5.4 per cent and 9.5 per cent respectively. Interestingly, public administration and safety had no change; it did not grow. All of our GSP growth in 201 7-18 came from sectors outside of public administration and safety, which, though, remains our single largest contributing sector. But there could be no clearer evidence of diversification and change than the fact that public administration and safety did not grow and yet our economy grew at the fastest rate in the nation . It was all of the other industry sectors that contributed. That is why this data needs to feature. It is annual data, like and annual budget, and it needs to feature in an analysis of the territory economy. 440 5.120 Looking at ACT final demand Pegasus Economics observed: Household consumption now appears to have constituted the largest component of ACT final demand up until 2005 -06 when it was superseded by the Commonwealth Government. The contribution of the ACT Government to final demand has been hovering at around 9\u00bd per cent on average since 2009 -10, while private investment has been hovering at around 10\u00be per cent on average over the same period. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest there has been a dramatic shift in the drivers of ACT final demand over recent years, with the combined public sector (composed of both the Commonwealth Government and the ACT Government) still constituting in excess of 50 per cent of final demand.441 438 Review of the ACT Budget 2019 -20, Pegasus Economics, June 2019, p. 5. 439 Treasurer Andrew Bar MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 148- 149. 440 Treasurer Andrew Bar MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 314. 441 Review o f the ACT Budget 2019 -20, Pegasus Economics, June 2019, p. 5 APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 89 5.121 Turni ng to gross state product, Pegasus Economics noted that the way in which the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) produces the GSP figures does not isolate public sector involvement to the 'public administration and safety ' industry sector. Each of the se ctors mentioned by the Treasurer contains public sector involvement according to the ABS's commentary on the figures.442 In order to measure the extent of diversification within the ACT economy suing GSP you would need to unpack the public sector involvement in the various industry sectors. COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.122 The Committee notes the differing approaches of the Treasurer and Pegasus Economics to measuring diversification within the ACT economy. The Committee notes that the trend lines for ACT final demand and GSP mirror each other closely. 443 5.123 The Committee also notes Pegasus Economics' observation that GSP is the measure used by the ACT Government in the budget papers to discuss diversification within the ACT economy. 444 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT (4.2) 5.124 This output provides for analysis, monitoring and reporting on major projects, the financial performance of agencies and the Territory's budget, to assist the ACT Government to achieve its policy objectives. 445 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.125 Matters considered by the Committee in r elation to Financial Management included: treatment of public -private -partnerships (P PPs) under Australian Accounting Standards; 446 and disclosure of Key Accounting Policies.447 KEY ISSUES DISCLOSURE OF KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES 442 Review of the ACT Budget 2019 -20 Follow -up Issues , Pegasus Economics, July 2019, p. 5. 443 Review of the ACT Budget 2019 -20 Follow -up Issues , Pegasus Economics, July 2019, p. 4. 444 Review of the A CT Budget 2019- 20 Follow -up Issues , Pegasus Economics, July 2019, p. 6. 445 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 25. 446 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 123- 124; Answer to Qu estion Taken on Notice E19- 017, answered 26 June 2019. 447 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 132- 133, ;Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 020, answered 26 June 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 90 5.126 The report of the Committee's bu dget advisors noted that the Budget financial statements are titled \"GFS/GAAP HARMONISED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" and that suggests that they were prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standard AASB 1049. That standard requires compliance with all other applicable standards but the budget does not disclose the basis of accounting and key accounting practices. 448 5.127 The Directorate told the Committee that they followed the general accounting principles. Each agency documents their accounting principles in their own financial statements. Any significant variation is documented within the budget statements. The Committee was informed that not all governments put a full disclosure of their accounting standards in their budget papers. Differences between agencies can make it difficult to get a consistent standard for the overall government statements. 449 5.128 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice the Treasurer further informed the Committee that: The Readers Guide to the 2019 -20 Budget (page 23), provides detai ls of the context within which the ACT's budget estimates are produced, including their preparation in a manner consistent with the principles of the relevant Australian Accounting Standards. Detailed information on application of accounting treatment is also provided in annual quarterly whole -of-government financial statements . 450 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.129 The Committee notes the possible difficulties of consolidating different agencies accounting standards but believes that the budget papers could be clearer on the accounting principles adopted, even if simply to highlight that the budget consists of consolidated figures possibly derived from differing standards. A list of AASB standards that were applied to the budget are not included in the Readers Guide to the 20 19-20 Budget . Recommendation 45 5.130 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide clearer disclosure of key accounting principles in its budgets.

The review was finalised on 27 August 2018 and subsequently tabled in the ACT Legislative Assembly.471 5.135 Minister Stephen -Smith, Minister for Employment and Workplace Safety (the Minister), confirmed that as a result of that review, the Government has agreed to establish Work Safe as a separate entity to Access Canberra. 472 The Directorate also told the Committee that 'we have 459 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1027. 460 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1027- 1028. 461 Proof Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1028- 1029. 462 Proof Transcript Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1028- 1030. 463 Proof Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1030- 1032. 464 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1032. 465 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1032- 1034. 466 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1034. 467 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1035- 1036; 1038- 1039.

This is an area that has been of some concern to stakeholders for some time.478 5.139 Later in the hearing, the Committee asked if training relating to family violence would be provided to all ACT Public Service staff and it was clarified that training would be extended to all employees in a slow rollout approach.479 The Directorate told the Committee that 'the government is putting more effort and resources into the mental health of its workforce more generally, as a workers compensation and workforce participation and level workforce objective.'480 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.140 The Committee notes that although the new legislation has not yet been introduced, there was no discussion regarding plans for an evaluation of the reforms or mention of formal consultation process for local businesses, industry groups and unions to provide feedback on the impact of new legisl ation. The Committee agrees that this is an area that requires additional consideration.

SUBURBAN MECHANIC OPERATORS 5.142 The Committee asked if WorkSafe had inspected any workplaces where mechanics are not appropriately qualified but have received an ACT government certification to function, given that the certification does not ask any more for the qualifications of mechanics .481 5.143 The Committee was informed that this has not occurred, as audits are primarily focused on the safety and the operations within the workshop and equipment.482 The Directorate told the Committee that when inspecting backyard operators and residentially based workshops, the same safety checks and standards that are expected with a commercial operation is expected.483 The Minister also told the Commit tee that if there are safety concerns, members of the public can make a complaint or a notification to WorkSafe.484 5.144 The Committee was told that there have been businesses required to change their operations on residential premises due to other reasons and it was later clarified that WorkSafe proactively work with businesses, recognising that a lot of these are sole traders or microbusinesses in the suburbs who may need assistance with getting the right systems in place .485 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.145 The Committee appreciates that WorkSafe endeavours to work with small businesses to support compliance although remains concerned that the current audit system may not be considering elements that lead to unsafe practices.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 96 5.150 Treasury officials noted that they were still working thro ugh processes. One issue is how it is limited to the 100 places permitted by legislation. The scheme is a pilot to see what works and measure demand and determine whether the scheme is a cost -effective way of providing additional accommodation for vulnerab le groups.498 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.151 The Committee notes that this a two -year pilot scheme. The ACT Government has signalled a willingness to make decisions part way through the pilot in order to provide certainty to participants who may wish to continue after the end of the pilot should the scheme contin ue. Recommendation 48 5.152 The Committee recommends that the two year pilot of a land tax exemption scheme for affordable housing purposes be assessed after 12 months, so that decisions on any continuation of the scheme can be announced in time for participants to make appropriate plans. Recommendation 49 5.153 The Committee recommends that the ACT Revenue Office develop a process to manage the land tax exemption scheme that minimise s work for eligible landlords and community housing providers while maintaining appropriate scrutiny. In particular, the Committee recommends requiring only annual reporting by the community housing provider as to tenant eligibility, not quarterly reporting by the landlord. Recommendation 50 5.154 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government closely monitor the land tax exemption scheme for landlords who provide affordable housing through registered housing providers with a view to assessing: the number of affordable housing properties that have become available through this scheme; the cost to government for providing access to this scheme; and 498 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 169- 170.

The Directorate informed the Committee that relevan t staff have had two three -hour training sessions with community organisation Care Inc. There are suggestions that came from these workshops that the office is considering. The Under Treasurer told the Committee that work was underway but that: we have not got to the stage of deciding on any recommendations to the government in this area and I am also acutely conscious that the job of the revenue office is to raise revenue and enforce the laws that are passed, but it is clearly an issue that is on our priority list and that we are looking at . 499 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.156 The Committee acknowledges the primary function of the ACT Revenue Office but notes that placing those in financial hardship under further financial stress may be detrimental in ensuring payments of rates or land tax arrears and may have ongoing negative effects on these clients. Recommendation 51 5.157 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government require the ACT R evenue Office develop internal processes and guidelines for compassionately deal ing with people who have financial difficulties in paying rates and land tax so that these issues do not lead to greater financial hardship. SHARED SERVICES (7.1) 5.158 Shared Services provides a range of ICT and corporate services, including infrastructure, appl ications support and development, ICT project services and tactical and transactional human resource and finance services to directorates and agencies. 499 Mr Nicol, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 178. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 98 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.159 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Shared Services included: Human Resources (HR) information management system;500 security breaches of ACT Government IT infrastructure;501 Shared Services cost model review;502 tracking of directorate use of Shared Services;503 Shared Services and Health ICT capabilities and possible duplication;504 duplication of IT management functions;505 Shared Services' project management for Directorates;506 involvement of Shared Services with Courts' records system;507 and proportion of contractors in Shared Services.508 KEY ISSUES SHARED SERVICES COST MODEL REVIEW 5.160 The Committee asked about the Shared Services cost model review and were told Shared Services was established about 10 years ago and at that time the vast majority of services were fully cost recovered. The Committee was further advised that: Over time, as the maturity levels of Shared Services increased, a number of our functions, especially around HR, finance and some of the ICT elements, were considered to be, rather than a variable cost model, fixed in nature. We have a certain amount of headcount, and we have a certain amount of fixed costs around infrastructure and the like. The discussion then was in regard to why we were invoicing for those services when they really should be appropriated by government. A program of work was set up with the governance structure in order to look at it and have those discussions, and to say 500 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 240- 241. 501 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 319- 320. 502 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 321- 322. 503 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 322- 324; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 057, answered 26 June 2019. 504 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 327- 328, 330. 505 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 328. 506 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 328- 329. 507 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 329- 330. 508 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 330- 331.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 100 on-time project completion;520 infrastructure projects an nounced in the budget;521 public -private partnerships;522 commitment to Light Rail Stage 2;523 technology choices for Light Rail Stage 2;524and business case for Light Rail Stage 2;525 KEY ISSUES MAJOR PROJECTS CANBERRA 5.164 The Committee asked about the formation of Major Projects Canberra. The Chief Minister described it as 'an incremental change in the administrative arrangements for infrastructure project delivery'.526 There was already a central government focus on infrastructure projects through this o utput class as well as project -to-project engagements by some larger directorates. 5.165 The Committee was told that the change was intended to focus skills in one place rather than duplicating them across agencies. Additionally: During the work on light rail st age 1 we developed considerable expertise in delivering major infrastructure projects. We are about to embark on light rail stage 2. At the same time, the government has announced that we have a significant health infrastructure project in SPIRE. At the sa me time, we have a centralised infrastructure area in treasury. We could continue as we currently do and build the expertise in Transport Canberra and City Services for light rail stage 2, build new expertise in the Health Directorate for SPIRE and continu e to have an expertise in treasury. But this seemed like an opportunity to bring those together and to coalesce the expertise into what will be a small, expert team that will support the relevant directorates in the delivery of the social outcome that is t he reason why we are building the particular infrastructure. 527 520 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 262- 263; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 049, answered 26 June 2019. 521 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 263- 265. 522 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 267- 268. 523 Proof Transc ript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 268- 271. 524 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 271- 273. 525 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 273- 274. 526 Chief Minister, Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 251. 527 Ms L eigh, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 252. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 101 5.166 The Committee was also informed Light rail stage 2 and the SPIRE Centre are the initial projects the team will deliver. There is no new funding apart from that for those projects. It is expected that the unit will employ approximately 140 FTE. 528 There will be reporting to both the Treasurer and the line minister responsible for the project.529 CARBON EMISSIONS FROM PROJECTS 5.167 The Committee asked about carbon emissions from projects given the ACT Gover nment's commitment to zero net emissions by 2045 and were informed that: It is more a whole -of-government issue than a project by project issue. Individual projects do not tend to have zero net emissions. Certainly the energy efficiency requirements for a building are optimised, maximised. In the case of an acute services facility at a hospital, as you would be aware, it has to have full backup power supplies, on-site generation, et cetera. These things have to be looked at in the whole context, and the bui lt environment has to be balanced across the whole portfolio. 530 5.168 The Directorate also informed the Committee that SPIRE is still at the design phase and energy requirements are being looked at as part of whole -of-life efficiency.531 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.169 The Comm ittee notes that individual projects need to be assessed for climate change impacts, in order to minimise these impacts and advance the government's zero emissions target. 5.170 The Committee notes the Treasurer's A nswer to a Question on Notice regarding the ext ent to which climate change is considered in Budget decisions and in the assessment of projects that may have a negative impact on climate change. 532 It does not appear that climate change and emissions are explicitly factored into cost benefit analyses, and there is no reference to the Government's adopted target of zero net emissions by 2045 (or interim targets). Recommendation 52 5.171 The Committee recommends that, i n order to meet the Government's 'zero emissions by 2045 ' target, the ACT Government ensure that all its major projects are explicitly considered from a climate change perspective, are compatible with the trajectory to zero 528 Ms Leigh, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 252- 253. 529 Chief Minister, Andrew Barr MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 266. 530 Mr Esau, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 256. 531 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 257. 532 Answer to Question on Notice E19- 072, answered 4 July 2019 SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 102 emissions, and if they are not compatible or cannot be made compatible, that they only proceed under special consideration. Recommendation 53 5.172 The Committee recommends the ACT Government task a specific area of the ACT Government to engage closely with developers of large precincts , such as the University of Canberra , to ensure that they design and build their infrastructure , waste and energy systems in a way that best helps the ACT to become sustainable and a zero emissions jurisdiction. Recommendation 54 5.173 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure ACT infrastructure be planned and built to be re silient to the changing climate . Recommendation 55 5.174 The Committee reco mmends that the ACT Government ensure that Budget funding decisions are explicitly considered in the context of the zero emissions by 2045 target and associated interim targets, and the cost of carbon emissions (or 'the social cost of carbon') are factored into Treasury and directorate cost benefit analyses . IMPACT OF THE SECURE LOCAL JOBS CODE ON GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE 5.175 The Committee asked about the impact that the introduction of the Secure Local Jobs Code (the Code) has had on government infrastructure procurement. The Directorate advised the Committee th at any financial impact would 'be minimal because the cost of a contractor APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 103 complying with the code is minimal.'533 It was also noted that the Code sets a minimum benchmark and that tenderers will be compared above that benchmark. 5.176 Procurement ACT told the Co mmittee: There are two elements to the secure local jobs code implications on tender responses. The first is compliance, which is, as the Under Treasurer has just set out, pretty much a threshold question: either you are compliant, you are a certified enti ty, or you are not. There are other elements then, depending on the value of the procurement activity, as to the detail into which a plan for local employment and workplace training goes. That is all part of actual weighted assessment criteria of up to 10 per cent, combined with local industry participation policy consideration.534 5.177 The Directorate observed that there are two ways in which the Code affects tender responses. The first is compliance which is a threshold question as non -compliance prevents a tend erer from being considered. The second will vary depending on the size of the projects but looks at the details of plans for local employment and workplace training.535 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.178 The Committee notes the intent of the Code and believes that any assess ment of the effectiveness of the Code will require an understanding of its effect upon insecure work and cost of achieving that effect. Recommendation 56 5.179 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government undertake a review , within two years, into the impact of the Secure Local Jobs Code on Territory infrastructure projects . GOODS AND SERVICES PROCUREMENT (8.2) 5.180 Procurement ACT provides advice and assistance to government directorates and agencies in undertaking procurement activities for goods and services. It advises the Government on procurement and related industry policy, is responsible for the development and implementation of the Government's procurement related policies and establishes and manages whole of government contracts. 536 533 Mr Nicol, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 259. 534 Mr Bain, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 261. 535 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 261- 262. 536 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 29. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 104 MATTERS CONSI DERED 5.181 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Goods and Services Procurement included: procurement of human services, including value for money and insecure work considerations;537 and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander procurement policy.538 KEY ISSUES PROCUREMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES , INCLUDING VALUE FOR MONEY AND INSECURE WORK CONSIDERATIONS 5.182 The Committee asked about the procurement of human services and its move from a value for money model to a best investment model and was informed by Minister Steel, Minister for Community Services and Facilities that: We are not calling it best investment; we are calling it commissioning for outcomes. We discussed this in annual reports, Ms Le Couteur, if you remember. We are commissioning a strategic planning approach that embeds community needs analysis, ongoing strategic evaluation and increased transparency and accountability into investment and resource allocation. We are putting out a discussion paper on this very shortly. We want to engage with the community sector around this new model of commissioning to get their feedback. ACTCOSS has already been doing some thinking about what this might mean. 539 5.183 The Directorate went on to explain that: When we talk about commissioning for outcomes we are effec tively looking at the framework we need in place to formalise the processes to ensure that we are making really clear, informed decisions about where we need funding or what we might need to shift in the service system to achieve the best effectiveness fro m the money we already have in place. It defines different stages in the cycle. We are looking at good needs assessment and good local planning, including service users as well as service providers in that process and then taking that information to deter mine what that means for the types of models and services we need in different locations or across the ACT depending on the issue. All that information will then feed into the scope of work we want to procure and will inform that process and, more 537 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 320- 321; Proof Transcript , 28 June pp. 1140- 1142. 538 Proof Transcript Evidence 2019, pp. 324- 327, 333- 334. 539 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p. 1140. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 105 importan tly, afterwards when we are looking at our contracting arrangements not just for inputs and outputs but for the outcome we expect to receive. So rather than just asking about how many units of service delivery for families were achieved in a three -month p eriod we will be asking whether the case planning goals for particular families were met to ensure that they have the support and systems that they need as individuals. We will be able to track that at an individual and a cohort level via a new and improv ed monitoring review and access to the appropriate data we will need to baseline for service delivery going forward. We will then look at that as part of our ongoing cycle of informing our decisions to go forward. We will talk to the sector and other direc torates to flesh that out so we can then say for the ACT what our commissioning for outcomes framework will look like. 540 5.184 The Committee were also informed that the aim was to 'move away from just reporting on activity to reporting on what we are achieving an d changing in somebody's life trajectory' and that things like longevity of the existing service providers and the relationship they have with the community are primary areas the Directorate would be looking at, particularly as 'one of the things to put in place with any planning approach is how connected we are to being able to deliver on the needs of that community.' 541 5.185 In response to questions about re -basing contracts and possibly lengthening the term of contracts the Directorate indicated that 'looking a t the current situation as well as the projected situation' is a key part of informing their decision making processes.542 5.186 Minister Stephen -Smith, Minister for Government Services and Procurement, also stated in earlier evidence to the Committee that: The so rt of best practice in human services \u2014in commissioning for outcomes \u2014is really to say that we know that this trusted community partner has a track record. We are working with them in partnership to deliver outcomes for the community. So it is building flexibility around how we deliver those outcomes, but also building a longer -term relationship which then goes to your point about security of employment. 543 540 Ms Sabellico, Proof Tra nscript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, pp. 1140- 1141. 541 Ms Sabellico, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p. 1141. 542 Ms Sabellico, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, pp. 1141- 1142. 543 Minister Stephen -Smith, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 Jun e 2019, p. 321.

The Directorate informed the Committee that the budget contained capital works funding for fitting o ut in the next 18 months two office buildings to be leased by the ACT Government for 20 years: the Civic building next to the Legislative Assembly and a building in Dickson. The buildings are part of a hub and spoke model for government and a consolidation of existing leases to support an activity -based work (ABW) fit -out of both buildings.551 5.190 The ABW approach is intended to create an open and collaborative work environment. New teams will be able to form on an ad hoc basis and communication across directorat es should be improved.

The Committee believes there is an opportunity to monitor whether the changes are having the intended effect or not. Recommendation 57 5.192 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government report to the Legislative Assembly on the impact of the Dickson Office relocation on workplace practices, improvements in efficiencies and cultural changes. SMART MODERN STRATEGIC PROCUREMENT 5.193 The Committee asked about the Smart Modern Strategic Procurement program which was intended to provide cost savings by centralising non -specialised property services. The Directorate used the example of procurement of el ectricity and instead of having multiple contracts across multiple directorates forming a single contract. A proposal was put out to market to bring all property services and maintenance under a single contract but was not pursued. It was decided that ther e was a significant risk of it not achieving the intended efficiencies but tying the government to a single provider. There were also difficulties in timing across the various directorates due to the different terms of their existing contracts. 553 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.194 The Committee notes the reasoning behind the ACT Government decision not to move to a single provider for property services. The Committee believes that there needs to be an assessment of what savings the smarter government spending has achieved. Recommendation 58 5.195 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government undertake a review of the Smart Modern Procurement savings policy to assess its impact regarding property services management and savings achieved. 552 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 194. 553 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 198- 199. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 108 ACT PROPERTY UPGRADES 5.196 The Committee asked about the ACT Property upgrades. Officials informed the Committee that upgrades were based off condition assessments of each building. Property Services has a rolling program of works that are risk rated and funding is allocated to projects on that program each year. That project funding is based each year on project progress. There are various reasons why a project timeframe may slip and estimates are revised accordingly.554 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.197 The Committee recognises the need for the kind of upgrade fund described above but believes that the program requires greater structure and reporting. Recommendation 59 5.198 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government establish a set of accountability and completion indicators against year -by-year funding allocated under ACT Property u pgrades and clarify the maintenance works completed to ACT Government Properties using this funding.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 110 ongoing claims from 1 February 2020.567 KEY ISSUES PROFIT LEVEL FOR INSURERS 5.206 The Committee asked what level of profit insurers would be allowed under the new scheme. The Directorate informed the Committee that the legislation allowed the Act Government to put in place regulations around profit. The ACT Government has actuarial advice on what a reaso nable level of profit within the industry would be. The Directorate, asked whether regulation was required or an option, told the Committee: It is an option, I think we would be cautious about signalling too much of what we expected, because we might be a price setter. We would like some competition to work. Obviously we also want the industry to make a profit, because we want a sustainable market. We want insurers to be able to operate and continue to operate. So we are going to monitor the situation using benchmarks and other indicators of what we consider to be a reasonable profit level. If we find evidence that it is not operating at a reasonable profit level, that is when, I expect, the commissioner will advise me and the government as to what action sh ould be taken. 568 ACT GAMBLING AND RACING COMMISSION 5.207 As a result of the 2015 amendments to the Financial Management Act (FMA) the budget statement for the Commission is its Statement of Intent. 5.208 The Commission is an independent statutory authority establishe d under section 5 of the ACT Gambling and Racing Control Act 1999 (the Control Act) with the governing Board being established under section 11 of the Control Act. The Commission's members are appointed in accordance with sections 11 and 12 of the Control Act and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is appointed in accordance with section 80 of the FMA. 5.209 In December 2014 it was announced that a number of regulatory functions across the ACT Government, including gambling regulation, would be brought together to create Access Canberra. In August 2016 an agreement between Access Canberra and the Commission on \"the provision of services for the administration of the gaming laws including the control, supervision and regulation of gaming and racing in the ACT\" (the A greement) was executed. 567 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 166. 568 Mr Nicol, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 163.

The Commission also has additional responsibilities relating to the conduct of research on the social e ffects of gambling and of gambling harm, as well as community education relating to gambling activity. These functions inform the Commission's activities in protecting consumers and reducing the risks and costs to the community and individuals experiencing gambling harm. 569 5.212 The Committee considered the following Outputs, Output Classes and Statements of Intent: Output Class 1 : Gambling Regulation and Harm Minimisation Output Class 2 : Access Canberra [liquor, gaming and hospitality licensing] 5.213 Output 1 is the responsibility of JACS; Output 2 is the responsibility of CMTEDD (Access Canberra).

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 112 KEY ISSUES COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTIONS SCHEME (CCS) 5.215 The Gaming Machine Act 2004 outlines broad purposes that contributions must meet to be approved as community contributions and identifies some types of expenditure that would not be approved as community contributions. The associated Gaming Machine Regulation 2004 provide guidelines for approving contributions to further assist the Commission and licensees regarding the general criteria for each of the categories of community contributions. 5.216 Hotels and Taverns that are gaming machine licensees must report their community contributions but there is no minimum requirement. If no contributions are made in the reporting period, a nil report must be submitted.576 5.217 A re-examination of the CCS was announced by the Government in 2018 , and identified payments (mainly to sporting organisations) mad e from the CCS which may have been misdirected. Information on CCS payments and the link to community contributions was also the subject of Auditor -General comment. 5.218 Following the increase in the minimum required percentage of community contribution for clubs from eight per cent to 8.8 per cent of Net Gaming Machine Revenue (NGMR) in 2018 , a proportion of the CCS p ayments are now diverted to the Chief Ministers Charitable Fund. 5.219 The Committee discussed aspects of the CCS with Minister Ramsay, Attorney -General and Minister for Business and Regulatory Services (the Minister), and were informed that: ...the whole intention of this is to make sure that the issues raised in the Auditor - General's report are addressed, to make sure that there is a clear sense of confid ence from the community that the community contributions scheme is living up to its intent. As part of that, there has been very strong consultation across the community and also some very specific consultation with the industry. The changes have been flagged for quite some time now...It is a matter of making sure that the consultation happens, that the definitions and what is allowed are very clear, and that there are no unintended consequences from the drafting of any of the regulations. 577 5.220 In particular, the Committee was concerned to ascertain how changes to the CCS had been canvassed within the community - and particularly with licensees and sporting clubs and were informed that consultation had proceeded over the last year: At the end of last year we provi ded a draft regulation which provides a lot of the detail around what the community contributions scheme would look like and some of the 576 See: https://www.gamblingandracing.act.gov.au/industry/community -contributions 577 Minister Ramsay, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 19 Ju ne 2019, pp. 409- 410. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPR OPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 113 critical definitions that go around that. We have been having some very active and productive conversations on that wit h representatives of clubs , through that period and through the first half of this year....We have been having a positive level of engagement. We are now reaching a point where progressively we have been providing advice to government about what we have been hearing from industry. We are about to do so again with a view to being able to finalise the regulation in anticipation of the start date of the new scheme on 1 July. 578 5.221 Of particular interest to the Committee was the threshold definition of 'professional s port' in light of the stated aim to ensure CCS payments aren't directed to that category of recipient contrary to the aims of the CCS. 5.222 The Committee was advised that the changes to the definition were to avoid 'unintended consequences' such as the disbandi ng of teams and the exclusion of vulnerable men: The nuanced changes around the definition of professional sport are exactly what my officials have been working on with clubs right across the clubs industry to make sure that, when there is a definition tha t is chosen and agreed on, it flows through with the intent of maximising the benefit for the community. We have said all the way through that these changes to the community contributions scheme are there to make sure that more money gets to the community and to community purposes. That has always been the intent. As part of that, there has been some very effective consultation. Going to your first question, on why things are still being worked through, that is one of the reasons why things are still being working through: so we can make sure that that definition achieves the intent of government policy without having unintended consequences for the community as a whole. 579 5.223 The Directorate informed the Committee that professional sport is to be categorised as follows: There are essentially two thresholds in the definition that is being proposed at the moment. First, is the payment over and above reimbursement? There is a tax office ruling that goes to some of that. So $50, probably not. Reimburse ment for the cost of attending the game, travel, those sorts of things would not put someone into the professional payment space. Then the second threshold is that the majority of players on that team need to be going over that first threshold. You need to have payment at a professional rate. 580 5.224 In relation to CCS mon ies for ground maintenance, the Committee was told that: 578 Mr Glenn, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 19 June 2019, p. 410. 579 Minister Ramsay, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 19 June 2019, pp. 410- 411. 580 Mr Glenn, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 19 June 2019, p. 412. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 114 At one end of the spectrum is a closed oval which no member of the public can access on any basis. It is available only to a club and for that club's purposes. Expenditure on that facility is not going to be considered capable of being claimed as a community contribution in that situation because there is no member of the community, other than a member of the club or player for that club, w ho is able to access it. At the other end of the spectrum you might have an oval that is maintained by the club but it is not enclosed. It is available for any person to walk across at any time of day. It happens that the club also trains there but anyone could go on at the same time. That would be entirely claimable as a community contribution. Between those two extremes, there are gradations of facilities that a member of the public may use by booking but there might be times when people cannot book. So t here is a proportionality there as to what can be claimed as a community contribution. 581 COMMITTEE COMMENT 5.225 The Committee considers the several questions raised around the CCS and its future use are still to be resolved, particularly in clarification and finalisation of a definition of 'professional sport'. Recommendation 60 5.226 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment continue consulting with the club sector to determine a definition of 'professional sport' as it pertains to community contributions from clubs. ACT INSURANCE AUTHORITY 5.227 The ACT Insurance Authority (the Authority) is established under the Insurance Authority Act 2005. The Authority works to protect the assets and services of the Territory by providing risk management support and insurance services to all ACT Government directorates and statutory authorities. The Authority meets the insurable claims and losses of the ACT Government. 582 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.228 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Authority included: ACT Insurance Authority risk management plan and policy ;583 and 581 Mr Glenn, Proof Transcript o f Evidence, 19 June 2019, p. 414. 582 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 129. 583 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 331- 332.

As the Community Councils are not part of ACT Government, the ACT Insurance Authority (ACTIA) does not have the legal capacity to provide this insurance for them. Previously CMTEDD Communications and Engagement coordinated the provisi on of standardised insurance arrangements for Community Councils to cover activities funded under the Deed. That cover expired on 2 November 2018. The ACT Government decided in 2018 that is was no longer feasible to coordinate the combined policy for the Community Councils for the following reasons: over recent years many Community Councils have expanded the scope of activities they undertake beyond those funded under their Deed; several Community Councils have established associated incorporated and non - incorporated resident groups, while other Community Councils have not; the ACT Government has no formal agreement with these resident groups (which are often separate incorporated entities); and it is difficult to maintain equity in costs across all Community Councils when the structure of each Council and their operations vary significantly. 5.230 The answer concluded: CMTEDD Communications and Engagement have advised that while some Councils initially had concerns about obtaining their own insurance, all have in dicated that they were able to find insurance that was on par with the cost and cover that the ACT Government had previously coordinated. 585 CANBERRA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING CIT 584 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 332- 333, Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 059, answered 26 June 2019. 585 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 059, answered 25 June 2019.

The Committee heard that: 'the workforce at CIT is a mixture of both permanent and temporary contract work and that is primarily because the training packages that we deliver, which are dictated by industry, mandate particular qualifications and those qualifications are required to have industry currency. So there is a combination of different contractual arrangements and permanent arrangements within the staff.' 606 5.236 The Committee also learnt that: At the moment we are sitting at around 4 5 per cent of our staff being on contract staff. We are constantly \u2014every year, every semester, we look at the needs, the training needs, how long those courses are that students are enrolling into, the trend data to see whether we can project and see wheth er that industry is likely to change.

Minister Fitzharris, Minister for Higher Education (the Minister), confirmed that the government's intention is to make a major investment and renewal of the main campus, currently in Reid. This investment will be in Reid or in a Woden town centre site.608 5.238 The Committee heard that 2020 CIT Strategy outlined nine key projects to ensure that CIT was viable and relevant going into the future. One of those included considering the physic al infrastructure which CIT operates out of, and campus modernisation.609 5.239 CIT also confirmed that 'as a board, we are delighted with the opportunity to explore other sites for CIT to operate on.

Intensive work is currently underway on the business case, with the intend that the outcomes of the business case could feed into the next budget cycle. One of the issues being looked at is whether the proposed site is large enough and whether there would need to be changes to existing infrastructure. The integration of a new theatre with the existing Canberra Theatre Centre is also under consideration.620 5.244 The Committee was also told that: ...the pre -election commitment and the commitment to the parliamentary agreement contemplates a theatre with about 2,000 sea ts. That is the scale that we are looking at. With a theatre of that size, you need to look at the sorts of other facilities that would support a facility of that nature. That will dictate things like the size of the stage, the height of the fly tower. Ess entially, it would need to be comparable to other major venues on the touring circuit so that we can take shows from Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide and so that we can take major musicals, ballets and so forth. Those are the sorts of things that will dictat e the actual dimensions. 621 5.245 Additionally it was noted that the consultants on the concept design have considerable expertise in performing arts design.622 615 Proof Tr anscript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 363. 616 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 363- 364. 617 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 371- 374. 618 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 374. 619 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 374. 620 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 371- 374. 621 Ms Elvin, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 372. 622 Ms Elvin, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 372- 373.

'645 Icon water explained that: Overall in terms of the 2019 -20 move onwards from 2018 -19 you will see that the difference of $9.1 million is largely driven from our dividends from our energy investment, so from our investment into ActewAGL specifically and the components that factor there.

The second key piece is the outcome of the regulatory determinations for both electricity and gas. They are also feeding through into the forward forecast.646 5.249 When questioned as to whether shareholders still required a 100 per cent dividend p ayment, Icon Water further indicated that: The Icon Water dividend policy is 100 per cent of net profit after tax excluding gifted assets and capital contributions. In fact, the actual effective rate in terms of dividend policy is closer to 80 per cent of the effective rate because on an average year we have about $15 million to $20 million in terms of gifted assets .647 Recommendation 61 5.250 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government direct Icon Water to provide the Legislative Assembly with detail of the e xpenditure on the shared services agreement between Icon Water and ActewAGL for the last seven years, since the reintegration of the ActewAGL Water Division. Recommendation 62 5.251 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government direct Icon Water to provide information to the Legislative Assembly on how gifted assets are recorded and treated.

CURRENT WATER LEVELS AND POTENTIAL FOR RESTRICTIONS 5.254 During a discussion on water usage the Committee queried the current water situation for the ACT and were informed that: The current level of storage across the dams is at 57 per cent. The ACT government has set a level of service for Icon Water that we are able to meet unrestricted demand for water 95 per cent of the time. The inverse of that is that we manage and operate our water system to make sure that there is no more than a five per cent change of water restrictions in any given year. At the moment we are able to meet that service level for the budget period. We are currently foreshadowing that there is no more than a five per cent change of requiring water restrictions. 648 5.255 When queried as to when water restrictions would 'kick in' Icon Water indicated that: At the moment, as I said, we are at 57 per cent storage. We wo uld consider water restrictions, looking at other factors, when the storage levels got down to around about 40 per cent. ... The broadest answer I can give you is there is a possibility that we may require water restrictions in the summer of 2020 -2021.649 5.256 Icon Water further indicated that the water level figures included Corin, Bendora, Cotter and Googong dams.650 WATER CONSUMPTION 5.257 The Committee asked Icon Water whether water consumption was increasing and were informed that: ...during the millennium drought, the Ca nberra community reduced their water consumption by 40 per cent. That reduced consumption has remained consistent since the end of the millennium drought in about 2011. What we have seen in the past approximately two years is a slight increase in water con sumption but right now we believe that that is due to the dry conditions and the hotter conditions, not necessarily an increase in consumption patterns over time.651 648 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 275. 649 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 275; 276. 650 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 276. 651 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 276. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 124 In our forward forecast from 2019 -20 through to 2022 -23, overall, in terms of total volumes, we see a less than one per cent increase. In terms of the underlying drivers, it has primarily been driven from population growth; that is actually driving that. Per capita consumption is actually slightly decreasing over that sort of time.652 AUDIT PROGRAM 5.258 The Committee had a number of questions in relation to Icon Water's audit program and were informed that there was both an internal and external program. The Committee were initially informed about the internal audit program: We have an internal audit fun ction that conducts a series of audits each financial year. During the 2018 -19 financial year, the current financial year, the program included 14 audits. That program is approved by the audit committee of our board. Topics include things like looking at o perational controls in our water and sewerage network, ICT security management, and management of environmental impacts and aspects. We have recently had our water committee approve the program for next financial year, with similar sorts of topics, which include looking at operational controls in our business, so out in the business as well as corporate controls. 653 5.259 Icon Water then went on to inform the Committee about their external auditing which involved financial and other matters. In relation to financial matters the Committee was told that: Our financial auditor is appointed by the ACT Audit Office; the auditors currently are PwC. The interim audit findings were very good. There were no audit findings, which is good. We are now in the midst of the year -end audit coming up . 654 5.260 In relation to other matters the Committee was told that: We are certified to ISO 9001, which is our quality management system; ISO 14001, for our environmental management system; and AS 4801, for our safety management system. Each year, our compliance with those standards is externally audited. Usually there is a certification audit in year 1 and then a surveillance audit in years 2 and 3 .655 5.261 The Committee then asked about what was on the agenda for 2019 -20 in terms of the forward audit plan and were advised that: 652 Ms Yau, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 276. 653 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 278. 654 Ms Yau, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 278. 655 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 278. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 125 Some example topics for 2019 -20 include capital expenditure management, water quality and waste management, metering and billing, and compliance with work, health and safety regulations in relation to working at heights and e xcavation.656 5.262 In this context the Committee asked when these audits were decided upon and Icon Water indicated that they: ...have a three -year audit strategy, it is a rolling strategy. In year one we are able to say these are the audits we will do in the next financial year. We foreshadow some of the key risks and key controls we might look at in the subsequent financial year. Again, for the third financial year\u2014 because we get a little bit further out \u2014we just look at what might be the key controls that we look at. 657 5.263 When pressed further to whether the proposed audits were consistent with the previous year's Icon Water indicated that: Not necessarily, no. There are some key controls we will audit routinely whether or not we consider them to be a high risk, for example, payroll. It is really important that we get our payroll right. Even if we believe our controls ae right and the risk associated with payroll is low, we will routinely audit that every three to five years. 658 We also include in our audit program matters that are considered high risk, so we will have a look at our key risks. Then a very small component of the program will include key issues that arise at a much shorter time scale. 659 5.264 When asked about the frequency of exercises undertaken to test risk/crisi s management plans and capacity I con Water indicated that: We have an exercise schedule that is related to each financial year. There are roughly 12 to 14 exercises each year. Some of those are mandated by legislation. Some of the legislation says we have to test on a particular frequency every year or every five years, and some of those tests are things that we want to do, things that we want to test in our system. During the current financial year, we have completed all of the tests that have been schedul ed to date. 660 5.265 Within this discussion the Committee also asked who was on the Icon Water audit committee and were informed that: 656 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 287. 657 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 287. 658 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 287. 659 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 287. 660 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 278. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 126 Four members of our board are also sitting on our audit committee, including our board deputy chair, who is the chair of the audi t committee. The audit committee meets roughly every two months.661 Recommendation 65 5.266 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government direct Icon Water to provide the Legisaltive Assembly with information about the details of the independent auditing undertaken in the last year, including the auditor's summary of results, as well as the ongoing audit program. Recommendation 66 5.267 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government direct Icon Water to provide the Legislative Assembly with informat ion about how often it has undertaken exercises to test its risk/crisis management plan. FEED-IN TARIFFS 5.268 Following the revelation that repayments to customers, in addition to what had already been budgeted in previous years would be '$5 million dollars ac ross 2019 -20 and $5 million in 2020 - 21' the Committee questioned Icon Water in relation to the over -collection of feed -in tariffs and the timing of the payments.662 Icon Water explained that: On the feed -in tariff specifically, I should first of all clarify that this would not be for Icon Water. ActewAGL is the entity in relation to the feed -in tariff specifically. In terms of your question around how that feed -in tariff looks, it is actually the large -scale feed - in tariff which is the piece that we are talking about at the moment. It is a scheme that started in about 2012 -13 and specifically that scheme allows ACT government to essentially contract with large renewable energy entities to give a contract price which gives them certainty as they provide solar farms, wind farms et cetera. It gives that large energy supplier certainty in terms of price . What is actually happening underneath that is that when the wholesale market spot price moves, from a customer perspective the ACT government will essentially reim burse the suppliers to top them up for the difference between the wholesale price and the contracted price. That top -up cost is then shared amongst customer bills. Evoenergy essentially are the pass -through entity. Evoenergy work out the amount 661 Ms Breaden, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2 019, p. 287. 662 Ms Yau, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, p. 274. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 127 that they n eed to take into account for customer bills, collect on behalf of ACT government and pass those back to ACT government. Naturally in that process you are doing a lot in terms of crystal- ball gazing around what the wholesale market is going to do, what you think the actual price movement will be. ActewAGL typically are slightly more conservative as they forecast out, and essentially what has happened, in terms of the recent two years, is actually over- recovery onto customer bills. But what that means is simp ly that those are then passed back to customer bills in future bills. There is no profit margin being made on this exercise. It is a simple pass through. 663 5.269 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice Icon Water also indicated to the Committee that they have: ...been advised by Evoenergy the unexpected volatility in the wholesale electricity spot market in recent years has resulted in Evoenergy over recovering Large Scale Feed -in- Tariff Scheme revenue. At the time Evoenergy applied to the Act Government for its reasonable cost determination, the over -recover was $31.2 million. The Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability issues a reasonable cost determination on 29 January 2019. In 2019- 20 Evoenergy is forecast to pass on $11.6 million to customers though lower prices. Evoenergy will return the remaining over- recovery in future years in line with the ACT Government's reasonable cost determinations. Evoenergy is required to pay interest on the over -recovery back to customers at the rate of return set by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER). 664 CAPITAL WORKS PROGRAM 5.270 The Committee asked Icon Water to inform them about their capital works program and their budget for 2019 -20 capital works proposals. In response Icon Water indicated that their capital works program for 2018 -19 is $103 million and for 2019 -20 it is $105 million.665 5.271 In terms of the program for 2019 -20 Icon Water indicated that: I guess that in the past, in the lead up particularly in the last regulatory period for the vast majority of this financial year, our capital works program has been predominantly focused on upgrading major infrastructure, particularly at our lower Molonglo sewage treatment plant. As we move forward in the regulatory period, the focus is I guess weighted more towards the networks. What we are seeing in our capital program are things like the water mains renewals. We also have routine sewer mains renewals.

Icon Water, through the Treasurer, in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice stated that: ...the Icon Water Board agreed to the ter mination of the Tantangara Transfer Option deed at its meeting in April2018. Under the Territory -owned Corporations Act 1990 the prior approval of the Voting Shareholders was not required and, accordingly, although the Voting Shareholders were advised of t he termination, a business case was not provided to them. 669 Recommendation 68 5.276 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government direct Icon Water to provide the Legislative Assembly with details of the terminated Tantangara water transfer agreement with Snow y Hydro Ltd and a copy of the advice presented to the shareholders, justifying the decision to terminate what was described in the extensive community consultation process for the recommended water security measures during the Millennium Drought, as an 'insurance policy'. REMUNERATION 5.277 Although the Committee did not discuss the remuneration paid to or received by Icon Water management personnel during the hearings, Icon Water were asked in a Question on Notice about the benefits received by such personnel. 5.278 In an Answer to a Question on Notice the Committee was advised that The total amount paid to Icon Water's key management personnel has not been finalised for the year ended 30 June 2019. As is the case every year, Icon Water undertakes an extens ive review of the latest accounting requirements for the key management personnel note in the financial statements, prepares the disclosure accordingly and has the outcome audited. Icon Water intends tabling this information in the Legislative Assembly in October 2019, following approval of Icon Water's Annual Report by the Voting Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on Friday 20 September 2019. 670 Recommendation 69 669 Answer to Questio n Taken on No tice, E19- 50, answered 26 June 2019. 670 Answer to Question o n Notice E19- 189, answered 4 July 2019.

INDEPENDENT COMPE TITION AND REGULATORY COMMISSION 5.281 The Commission has responsibilities for a broad range of competition, regulation and consumer protection matters. The Commission is responsible under the Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission Act 1997 . 671 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.282 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission (ICRC) included: feed -in tariff scheme;672 energy pricing determination including jurisdictional comparison;673 Water Abstraction Charge (also discussed under the Office of the Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment );674 beverage container deposit scheme;675 and effect of Icon water's capital program on charges.676 671 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 219. 672 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 203; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 037, answered 25 June 2019. 673 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 203- 204, 208. 674 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 204- 206; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 035, answered 25 June 2019. 675 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 206- 208. 676 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 208- 210. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 131 KEY ISSUES WATER ABSTRACTION CHARGE (WAC) 5.283 The Committee asked about the Water Abstraction Charge and how to structure it so it created more incentive for lower water use. 5.284 The Committee was informed in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice, that the ACT Government set the abstraction charge and the ICRC factored it into calculating the charge for water. The first tier covers the first 200 kilolitres and is charged at up to $2.46. Above 200 kilolitres the range is $4.88 to $4.94. In 2017 -18 around 52,000 households (30 per cent) consumed more that 200Kl in total that year.677 5.285 The ICRC noted that it had considered changes to the two tiered structure of the charge but decided to remain at two tiers and not rebalance between the two as community feedback did not warrant it. 678 LIFETIME CARE AND SUPPORT FUND 5.286 The Lifetime Care and Support Fund was established under the Lifetime Care and Support (Catastrophic Injuries) Act 2014 and commenced operations on 1 July 2014. The LTCS fund reflects the financial operations of the Lifetime Care and Support Scheme (LT CS Scheme).679 5.287 The LTCS Scheme provides on going treatment and care on a no -fault basis to people who have been catastrophically injured as a result of a motor accident in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) or a workplace accident in the course of their private sector employment in the ACT. It is funded by two levies: a levy on compulsory third -party insurance policies and a levy on workers' compensation insurers and self- insurers.680 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.288 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Lifetime Care and Support Fund included: proportion of fund revenue that comes from motor vehicle registration;681 and 677 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 035, answered 25 June 2019. 678 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 204- 206. 679 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 235. 680 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 235. 681 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 166- 167.

Revenues on behalf of the Territory are transferred to the TBA and fortnightly appropriation disbursements are made to agencies from the TBA.688 MATTERS CONSIDERED 5.294 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Territory Banking Account included: new borrowings;689 probity and governance arrangements for investments;690 consolidation of Superannuation Provision Account and Territ ory Bank Account;691 and variations across years in estimated outcomes.692 KEY ISSUES CONSOLIDATION OF SUPERANNUATION PROVISION ACCOUNT AND TERRITORY BANK ACCOUNT 5.295 The Committee asked what the consolidation of the Superannuation Provision Account and Territory Bank Account meant in practice and were informed: Through the territory banking account, for as long as I can remember we have always had the arrangement where it has been the central investment pool, if you like, or structure. Agencies like ACTIA and Life time Care, where they have moneys to have invested, have come through our centralised pool. Historically the super provision account was always separate. It faced the market directly because it always had the scale. Over recent years we have suddenly seen these other pools of money build up \u2014 ACTIA and the new workers comp fund \u2014so we suddenly have a large amount over here. We thought it made sense to consolidate all of that money together. We have one ACT entity facing the market at all times. We have the sca le we can create through our custody and administration arrangements. There is, again, just that one entity. It is all about that scale and efficiency. We have a unit registry structure that sits in between. We have the territory bank account facing the ma rket and the underlying agency investors. SPA will have its $3.5 688 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements B , Chief Minister , Treasury and Economic Development Directorate , p. 267. 689 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 213- 214. 690 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 214- 216. 691 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 216- 218. 692 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, pp. 218- 221. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 134 billion with the TBA. We then invest that on the strategic asset allocation required by the SPA's investment plan. We get that exposure for them and then they get delivered back a unit price based on that investment with the TBA. And that applies against all the other agency investors. We can set up different investment strategies through them that way. They all have a different risk tolerance. We can set that up for them. The other thing is that we can have a consistent application of our investment policy as well. Prior to us doing this, if any agency that invested through the TBA structure needed equity exposure, we did not have the scale to get them directly invested into equities; we had t o go through a managed fund. Now if they come in and they want equity exposure under our responsible investment policy, all the rules can be applied equally across the board. 693 ACT BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TRAINING FUND AUTHORITY 5.296 The ACT Building and Construction Industry Training Fund Authority provides funding for the training of eligible workers, supports the entry of new people into the building and construction industry, and works to improve the culture and access to training. 694 MATTERS CONSIDE RED 5.297 Matters considered by the Committee under the ACT Building and Construction Industry Training Fund Authority included: variation in training program expenses;695 number of rebates paid for people completing training programs by the authority;696 number of applications denied;697 asbestos training responding to demand;698 and contract of service in place with the Construction and Training Council for audit services.699 693 Mr McAuliffe, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 17 June 2019, p. 216. 694 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Statement of Intent - ACT Building and Construction Industry Training Fund Authority, p. 2. 695 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 421- 422. 696 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 421. 697 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 421- 422. 698 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 422. 699 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 422.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 138 KEY ISSUES GREENHOUSE GASES 6.6 Noting that Canberra's hospitals are one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases across ACT Government's operations, the Committee i nquired as to what ACT Health is doing to address this issue , given the ACT Government has a carbon neutral government target.712 6.7 Minister Rattenbury, Minister for Climate Change and Sustainab ility and Minister for Mental Health, advised the Committee that: Obviously, as we move to 100 per cent renewable electricity, that will drop for Health. They still have gas. Certainly, with my climate change hat on, as part of the current development of the climate change strategy through to 2025, we have been engaging with ACT Health, and there will be some health -related initiatives in that strategy when it comes out. Obviously, with Health making a significant infrastructure investment as well, we need to make sure that those buildings are climate wise. For me, that means two things. One is making sure that they are producing as few emissions as possible; also, they should be thermally well designed so that they are prepared for Canberra's hotter future. 713 6.8 The Committee further enquired into additional environmental issues that ACT Health is addressing. The Committee was advised the ACT Health had recently won an innovation excellence award with Actsmart in the recycling space. Other environmental initiati ves adopted by ACT Health include the incorporation of more energy efficient boilers and chillers. Energy efficient boilers are online already, and energy efficient chillers are expected to come online later in the year. 714 6.9 The Committee asked if the ACT had considered joining the Global Green and Healthy Hospitals Alliance. ACT Health advised that it had not been on their radar but will take it under consideration.715 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.10 The Committee notes that the ACT Government announced that its electrici ty consumption will be 100 per cent renewable by 2020. The Committee further notes that ACT Health is a significant contributor to current energy consumptions. To ensure targets are met, the Committee believes further initiatives should be taken by ACT Health. 712 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 447. 713 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 447. 714 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 448. 715 Proof Transcript of Ev idence, 20 June 2019, p. 448.

CALVARY PUBLIC HOSPITAL UPGRADES 6.12 The Committee noted that 61 per cent of infrastructure at Calvary Public Hospital (CPH) had been identified as requiring rejuvenation or replacing.716 6.13 In response, Minister Fitzharris, Minister for Health and Wellbeing (the Minister), referred to a document referencing the level of planning and strategic thi nking that is informing the building health services committee.717 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.14 The Committee notes that several services and infrastructure within Canberra Health Services (CHS) and CPH could be nearing the end of their life. The Committee believes tha t access to such information will ensure transparency in health services. Recommendation 72 6.15 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government commission a detailed independent study of all assets in ACT Health and Canberra Health Services, including an asse ssment of their values and remaining useful life, and, before the 2020 -21 ACT Budget is delivered, table the report, including recommendations and the ACT Government's response. CANBERRA HEALTH SERVICES WORKPLACE CULTURE 6.16 Noting the I ndependent Review into Workplace Culture with ACT Public Health Services (Culture Review), the Committee enquired into the impact of high -level bullying i n Canberra Health Services (CHS). The Committee further asked what programs CHS has put in place to improve the m ental health of staff. 718 6.17 In terms of the impact of bullying, the Committee was advised that the Culture Review tried to measure and articulated the impact of bullying and harassment across the entire ACT health 716 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 474. 717 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 474. 718 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 489- 490. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 140 system. CHS also highlighted that several conversations have been init iated with staff to better understand the issues and what can be done to rectify them.719 6.18 In terms of programs that have been adopted by ACT Health the Committee was informed that restorative processes have begun in areas where clusters of behavioural issues have been identified.720 6.19 Additionally, CHS noted that: We have also started work on our vision, our role and our behaviours to get clarity and to get engagement of staff across the organisation about who Canberra Health Services is, how we want to behave, what the values of our organisation are and what the vision of the organisation is. That in and of itself has actually had a really positive effect to start bringing people together, to start people working more as a team and to be respectful of each other and to understand how we should be behaving with each other. We have also employed \u2014she is about to start on 1 July \u2014an employee advocate, to provide another person who is outside of our current people and culture team for staff to go to if they have any co ncerns. 721 6.20 With regards to the vison and role of ACT Health, it was noted that more than 5,000 conversations were had with staff to receive input on what they thought the role and vision of ACT Health should be. Additionally, workshops have been utilised, wi th more than 2,500 staff participating in the workshops. ACT Health also advised that a culture survey is planned for later in the year. 722 6.21 The Committee was further advised that the organisation had recently implemented a Human Resources (HR) business partn ership model. This model provides an avenue where senior HR managers collaborate with senior managers to provide assistance. T he implementation of a detailed consultation guideline for manages has also recently been implemented by the organisations, to ens ure unions and employees are appropriately consulted with regards to changes being implemented. 723 6.22 The Committee further enquired into disciplinary actions taken against staff who have contributed to the bullying culture. The Committee was subsequently advis ed that: Sanctions are applied after misconduct investigations take place and they range from things like counselling and warnings right through to termination. There are some 719 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 490. 720 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 490. 721 Ms Hammat, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 20 June 2019, p. 490. 722 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 491. 723 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 491- 492 APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 141 cases that result in termination. Some result in the resignation of the employee before termination, but we collect information on that.724 6.23 The Committee was further advised that data had started to be collected to evaluate the impacts of the bullying culture and whether the initiatives that are being implemented are assisting in the re duction of bullying in ACT Health services. In addition to this data collection, a culture survey will be disseminated later in the year.725 6.24 The Committee enquired further into the mechanisms of evaluating the effectiveness of initiatives through the culture survey. The Committee was advised that the provider of the culture survey is the same provider that has been used before. Additionally, the Culture Review had utilised a narrow survey tool. As a result of this, ACT Health believes that this information co uld be accessed to determine in the culture of the organisation has improved. 726 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.25 The Committee notes that a significant amount of work has been done to address workplace culture issues in the ACT Health system. The Committee further acknowl edges the work of the Independent Review of Workplace Culture in the ACT Health S ystem . The Committee believes that progress reports on the implementation of recommendations made in the Independent Review of Workplace Culture in the ACT Health System, will ensure an openness and transparency. Recommendation 73 6.26 The Committee recommends the ACT Government ensure that, by the end of each quarter, the Minister for Health reports to the Legislative Assembly on the progress made in implementing the Independent R eview of Workplace Culture in the ACT Health System . Recommendation 74 6.27 The Committee recommends the ACT Government ensure that, within one month of receiving the yearly report of the independent and external review of the extent of implementation of the recommendations of the Independent Review of Workplace Culture in the ACT Health System and the consequent impact on cultural changes within the ACT 724 Ms Hammat, Proof Transcript of Evidence t, 20 June 2019, p. 492. 725 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 491;493. 726 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 494- 495. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 142 Public Health System, the Minister for Health table in the Legislative Assembly the report and the Government's response. Recommendation 75 6.28 The Committee recommends the ACT Gove rnment ensure that, within one month after receiving the results of the 2019 health culture survey, and within one month after receiving the 2019 Calvary Public Hospital staff survey, the Minister for Health table in the Legislative Assembly the results of each survey and the ACT Government's response. SYSTEM -WIDE DATA REVIEW 6.29 The Committee enquired into the system -wide data review and requested a progress report on the implementation of the review and the development of the various initiatives under the scheme, as well as the implementation of recommendations in the Auditor -General's report.727 6.30 The Committee was advised that ACT Health is progressing through the Auditor- General's report findings. ACT Health has also adopted and published the project pro gram portfolio delivery frameworks that were used for the data repository. ACT Health is currently developing appropriate monitoring and oversight arrangements that were flagged. 728 6.31 The Committee was also advised that: [A]ll of the data we are producing has come from core systems, has gone through agreed business process transformation, and everything has been documented, assumptions have been tested and we are producing robust data.729 6.32 With specific reference to the data repository, the Committee enquired into the status of its completion and was advised t hat: The data repository work is ongoing. The first phase we developed is very much building the technical infrastructure, which was completed some time ago. What we are now in the process of doing is popula ting the tool, or populating the repository data from key systems. That is complete in many respects. We will continue to bring new systems on as they emerge, systems that we have not previously reported on, and will continue to develop reporting outputs from it. To be honest, I would suggest that it is a never -ending piece of work because business 727 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 499. 728 Proof T ranscript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 499. 729 Mr O'Halloran, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 20 June 2019, p. 500. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 143 process es are always changing, expectations and requirements are always changing. So the work will never be complete. However, we would certainly look at within less than 12 months to have completed the bulk of the population and extraction work. The repository is being used more and more every single day for reporting. I note that we have a number of further submissions being provided in the next two months for everything from annual reports to national submissions to the commonwealth which we are increasingly s ourcing from the repository. Every single day we are using it more and more . 730 EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS 6.33 Noting the recent shootings in Christchurch, the Committee enquired as to how prepared ACT hospitals are for mass injury scenarios. Specifically, the Committee asked ACT Health how often emergency exercises are undertaken and the type of exercises they are. 731 6.34 The Committee was advised that CHS, ACT Health and emergency management partners are in the process of organising a major incident training exercise lat er in the year. Additionally, the Committee was informed that key personnel are also receiving updated training.732 6.35 CHS also noted that several month ago, major water pipes had leaked and the opportunity was taken to enact a real exercise where the emergency coordination centre was activated. Following the emergency, the organisation was debriefed on how the emergency was handled, as well as identifying what could be learnt from the experience.733 6.36 With regards to procedures in place, the Committee was informed that: [E]ach of the facilities within the ACT, including Canberra Health Services as well as Calvary public, have their own incident management teams as well as their own emergency management plans. However, we also have an ACT Health management plan, whi ch provides us with a framework for providing a coordinated response to any emergency management situation. My position as the Chief Health Officer coordinates and manages that. Part of that is that we have a committee called the health sector emergency management committee where membership across the board, across the sector, all come together. We review our plans and ensure they are up to date every year; we touch base and have all of those discussions at that table. One of the important things that was mentioned is that a mass casualty incident exercise is planned for later this year. With a mass casualty incident, the key lead 730 Mr O'Halloran , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 20 June 2019, p. 500. 731 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 509. 732 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 510. 733 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 510. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 144 agency is the ambulance agency. They will be the ones that coordinate the entire response. They activate out from the activation centre; then I stand up a coordinated response, and each of the hospitals will have their own. Our job is to make sure that there is coordination across the board, moving people between hospitals as necessary or going outside our jurisdiction to see if we can get assistance if need be. 734 6.37 The Committee inquired into Emergency Services involvement in mass injury scenarios. The Committee was subsequently advised that, Emergency Services do take the lead in such scenarios, which are facilitated out of the Fairb airn office. However, the Committee was also advised that ACT Health does have an emergency coordination centre in Holder.735 6.38 Noting the two separate systems in Fairbairn and Holder, the Committee asked if there was continued communication and collaboration between the two sites. The Committee was subsequently informed that in the Fairbairn office, there is an ACT Health liaison officer. Additionally, it was noted that Webex connection is active all the time between the two sites. 736 6.39 With regards to regularity of emergency exercises, the Committee was advised that an extensive exercise would probably be undertaken at a maximum of once a year .737 6.40 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice, the Committee was informed that, over the past five years, ACT Health has co mpleted six emergency exercises.738 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.41 The Committee acknowledges the devasting impacts mass injury scenarios can have on the community, as well as the Territory's health system. The Committee believes that it is essential that the ACT is prep ared for all types of emergencies. Recommendation 76 6.42 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government, by the end of 2019, require Canberra Health Services and ACT Health give a confidential briefing to Members of the Legislative Assembly on preparedness for disasters in the ACT. 734 Dr Coleman, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 20 June 2019, pp. 510- 511. 735 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 511. 736 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 511. 737 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 512. 738 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 57, answered 28 June 2019. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 145 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 6.43 The Committee enquired about strategic objective four and five in the Wellbeing Index. In particular the Committee asked why they were based on how individuals perceive their health rather than objective measures. 739 6.44 The Minister advised the Committee that it was the first year ACT Health has included strategic objectives and indicators and assured the Committee that the strategic indicators across ACT Health, CHS and the local hospital network hav e an appropriate mix of both subjective and objective factors.740 6.45 The Committee asked why strategic objectives seven to 12, which were based on more objective indicators, had been removed, noting that these strategic objectives were reported on by the Austra lian Institute of Health and Wellbeing.741 6.46 In response, the Minister advised the Committee that: Because they are reported on by the Australian Institute of Health and Wellbeing. There has been quite a lot of work and movement in these, for the reasons that we are separating some things out. And there has been quite a bit of movement. What the footnotes will explain is: if they are not referenced in the budget papers \u2014these are budget papers and they also inform our annual reports \u2014they will be measured in othe r places and reported on publicly elsewhere. 742 6.47 Noting that the Wellbeing Index was a whole- of-government approach, the Committee asked if ACT Health would be developing a separate wellbeing index or continue to be part of the whole -of-government approach. T he Minister confirmed that the Wellbeing Index will continue to be a whole -of-government approach with significant input from ACT Health and CHS. 743 Recommendation 77 6.48 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government require ACT Health to use strategic indicators in the Budget Papers, based on both subjective and objective measures and that these indicators are reported against in quarterly performance reports. 739 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 514. 740 Minister Fitzharris MLA , Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 514. 741 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 514. 742 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 514. 743 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 514. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 146 PERFORMANCE MEASURES BETWEEN ACT HEALTH AND CHS 6.49 The Committee noted that in Budget Statements C there are performance measures which appear both in the ACT Health section, as well as the CHS section. Additionally, in one section is identified that the performance measure is discontinued and subsequently added to the other section. The C ommittee enquired into the allocation of the performance indicators. 744 6.50 CHS advised the Committee that some performance measures are not directly allocated to CHS because it is a measure of the systems performance. These measures include both CHS and CPH in terms of performance. However, performance measures such as elective surgery is still monitored by CHS even though the performance measure is allocated to ACT Health. 745 6.51 The Minister added: We have had quite a bit of a discussion about this given that this i s the first time picking this apart. We will keep a close eye on that. But also, as I mentioned earlier, the data is reported on publicly and through the quarterly performance reports. These figures are also recorded. This is the first year we have done th is; we will look to continue to refine that in terms of where the measures are and what the measures are in future years. It is a bit of a mapping exercise through these budget papers; there is not an easy way. Some people in the room have worked very hard to map these out and make sure that there are the right footnotes to reflect where it has been previously and where it is now. 746 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.52 The Committee notes that ACT Health and CHS are in a transitional period. The Committee acknowledges that due to this transitional period some performance measures may be difficult to identify. The Committee further acknowledges that future budgets are expected to be clearer. However, the Committee believes that current transition makes it difficult to determine responsibility. Recommendation 78 6.53 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government clarify who, ACT Health or Canberra Health Services, is responsible for achieving each performance measure and that reporting against indicators is consistent. 744 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 547. 745 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 547. 746 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 548.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 148 KEY ISSUES MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE 6.56 The Committee noted that there was a gov ernment commitment in the last election on Meningococcal B vaccinations for babies. The Committee requested an update on whether the commitment had been fulfilled.757 6.57 The Minister advised the Committee that Meningococcal B vaccinations for babies has not yet been fulfilled and that , as a result of the last budget, Meningococcal W was identified as the area with the greatest need. However, the Committee was informed that the ACT Government is continuing to do work with Meningococcal B and there have been discussions at the national level regarding the vaccine being identified on the national immunisation program. 758 6.58 However, it was noted that the Meningococcal W vaccine does vaccinate against strains ACW and Y, whereas the Meningococcal B vaccine only v accinated against the one strain.759 6.59 The Committee was also advised that impacts associat ed with the inclusion of a Meningococcal B vaccine at infancy was also being considered, noting that: whenever you add another immunisation to a childhood immunisation p rogram, there are a number of things that we want to consider just to make sure that we do not overcrowd that program and run the risk of undermining the really good work that we have done at the moment. When a men B is added, it is added at the two and fo ur- month value points as well as one year of age. Kids already get two or three vaccinations at those points, so when we add that in, we will need to really consider how that will work. Plus the Bexsero has an increased risk of fever above the other vaccin es. [A]nd at the under 12 months age, they are particularly at risk of those elevated fevers and seizures and those kinds of things. One of the recommendations is to take paracetamol before you get vaccinated, which is something that we do not currently do, so that is a significant change in healthcare worker behaviour. There are a few complications or challenges. 760 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.60 The Committee acknowledges the importance of ensuring children in the ACT community have access to vaccinations. The Committe e also acknowledges the challenges of providing 757 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 530. 758 Minister Fitzharris MLA , Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 530. 759 Dr Coleman , Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 531. 760 Dr Coleman , Proof Trans cript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 531- 532.

However, the Committee also notes that the Meningococcal B vaccinations for babies was an election commitment that has yet to be fulfilled. Recommendation 79 6.61 The Committ ee recommends that the ACT Government ensure, by the last day of the September 2019 sitting period, the Minister for Health report to the Legislative Assembly on the status of the ACT Government's 2016 election commitment to introduce a program of Meningoc occal B vaccinations for babies. FLU VACCINES 6.62 The Committee enquired into the current flu season. ACT Health officials confirmed with the Committee that the flu season had started two months earlier than last year. The Committee was further advised that: We have seen quite a steep rise, but if you look at the curves on the influenza summaries that we provide on the web, it is very much that the curve is happening at the same pace; it has just shifted to two months earlier. 761 6.63 The Committee was also advised t hat ACT Health has received 950 notifications and approximately 100 hospitalisations. However, it was advised that nationally it is not being considered a more severe seasons in terms of severity indicators. 762 6.64 Noting that the flu season had started two mont hs earlier, the Committee enquired into the uptake for vaccines. The Committee was informed that supply through the national immunisation program has continued uninterrupted. However, there have been supply restrictions at times in the private space. 763 COMM ITTEE COMMENT 6.65 The Committee notes that the flu season has started earlier this year, in comparison to last year. The Committee further notes that it is difficult to determine if the flu season will finish early due to the initial peak being experienced earlier.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 150 6.66 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure the Minister for Health report back to the Legislative Assembly after the 2019 flu season has ended on the effectiveness of preparations for the 2019 flu season, both in terms of public health and the impact on hospital and health services. MENTALLY HEALTH Y COMMUNITIES (1.3) 6.67 ACT Health delivers a cross -sector system that supports people with mental health concerns or illness, ensuring members of the community can access appropriate treatment and care. ACT Health also collaborates with stakeholders on service system planning and policy, to ensure funding is targeted to provide safe, quality programs and services.764 6.68 All matters relating to mental health are discussed in the Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services section of the report. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF THE ACT PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM (1.4) 6.69 ACT Health provides strategic direction through the development and a dministration of policies and legislation including: collaborating with stakeholders to develop territory -wide plans for health services, workforce and major capital investment; driving service improvement and innovation through a collaborative policy cycle ; providing responsive policy advice to government reflecting the changing nature of the health sector ; support delivery of high quality health services by building and maintaining intergovernmental partnerships ; and conducting research programs that translate research evidence into improved healthcare .765 MATTERS CONSIDERED 6.70 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Continuous Improvement of the ACT Public Health System, included: 764 ACT Budget 2018- 19, Budget Stateme nts C, ACT Health Directorate , p. 11. 765 ACT Budget 2018- 19, Budget Statements C, ACT Health Directorate , p. 12.

These enhancements include the ability for outpatient appointment check -ins, provisions for feedback, as well as the implementation of wayfinding kiosks that are being deployed across the community.771 6.73 Despite the introduction of advancements such as the ACT Health App, the Committee noted areas within ACT Health is still using outdated technology. In particular, the Committee advised the Minister of an event where an individual's General Practitioner faxed a request to an outpatient clinic, however, after several weeks w ithout contact the individual was advised that the clinic had not received the faxed request. This resulted in a delay in the scheduling of the appointments even though it was recommended that the individual see a health official within 30 days.772 6.74 Noting th e instability of fax machines, the Committee asked when the Canberra Hospital planned to stop using fax machines as a means of communication and making appointments.773 6.75 The Committee was advised that: In the past couple of years we have been slowly decreasin g the number of fax machines. We are also doing some work to replace some of the phone lines that 766 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 534- 537. 767 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 543- 546; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 94, answered 28 June 2019; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 95, answered 28 June 2019. 768 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 549- 552; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 97, answered 2 July 2019; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 98, answered 26 June 2019. 769 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 552- 555. 770 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 534. 771 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 534- 536. 772 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 536- 537. 773 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 536.

There is a project currently underway using some software \u2014the proof of concept will go live in the next few weeks \u2014looking at enabling GPs to refer patients for certain services to Canberra Health Services directly from their practice management software.774 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.76 The Committee notes that ACT Health still uses fax machines as a source of communication. The Committee further notes the instability and uncertainty surrounding such outdated technology. However, the Committee does acknowledge that ACT Health has made attempts to decrease the number of fax machines used. 6.77 The Committee requests that ACT H ealth , as part of this process, consult extensively with general practitioners and other medical professionals who are located outside of ACT Health as to their preferences for communication with ACT Health. Recommendation 81 6.78 The Committee recom mends that the ACT Government ensure Canberra Health Services and ACT Health develop a plan to transition away from the use of outmoded technology such as fax machines and that, by the last sitting day in 2019, the Minister for Health report to the Legisla tive Assembly on the progress of the transition. In undertaking this transition Canberra Health Services and ACT Health should consult with other medical professionals and address any privacy implications. UPGRADING AND MAINTAINING ACT HEALTH ASSETS (UMAH A) BUDGET AND PROJECTS 6.79 The Committee acknowledged that the initial budget for UMAHA was $95 million. The Committee also noted that several projects have been removed from UMAHA and other projects have been added. Noting the changes, the Committee enquired into the current budget for UMAHA and the projected timeframes for each project. 775 6.80 The Committee was informed that the current budget for the UMAHA program is approximately $91 million. Noting the $4 million decrease between the initial and current budget, the Committee enquired further into the apparent savings.776 774 Mr O'Halloran, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 536. 775 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 543. 776 Proof Tra nscript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 543- 544. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 153 6.81 The Committee was advised that some of the budget was repurposed for other projects, primarily Ward 14A and 14B, as well as contributions to the early stages of Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) planning. It was further noted that approximately $10 million had been removed from the original UMAHA budget, however, money has been moved back in through other mechanisms. 777 6.82 In terms of major projects under the UMAHA budget, the Committee was informed $42 million has been allocated to the electrical switchboard upgrade. The Committee enquired into where the remaining $52 million of the UMAHA budget was allocated.778 6.83 The Committee was advised that 583 items wer e identified in the AECOM Condition Audit Report. The 583 items have since been diluted down to 149 items, which have a cost assigned to them for design and contingencies. Each cost is accumulated into the UMAHA budget.779 6.84 In response to a Question Taken on Notice ACT Health provided the Committee with a breakdown of the cost contingencies for the UMAHA budget as follows: 780 Detail Cost Raw Costs $49,492,482 Project Planning $6,562,235 Preliminaries $8,467,400 Risk Weighted Contingency $13,595,892 Delivery Model Contingency $17,209,991 Total 2016/17 Appropriation $95,328,000 777 Mr Mooney, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 544. 778 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 545. 779 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 545. 780 Answer to Question Taken on Notic e E19- 85, answered 28 June 2019. SELECT COMM ITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 154 ICU INFRASTRUCTURE 6.85 Noting that the SPIRE centre is expected to be completed in 2023, the Committee enquired into the strategies being adopted to ensure there are enough ICU beds to meet the demand, whilst SPIRE is still being completed.781 6.86 The Committee was advised: In terms of our immediate short term, in terms of day -to-day capacity in the intensive care unit, we are doing well. We have funded the beds th at we have been running; we have been running a number of additional beds that traditionally are considered unfunded, because the demand has been there. We do have the physical capacity in ICU for 31 beds, so we can flex up and flex down as required in reg ard to demands. If we are full and we are requiring other ICU beds, there are a number of things that we do. First, we look at whether we can move patients out into private ICU beds. We will transfer people out. We also look at our demand. If we have a high emergency demand and we have elective category 1s who are booked to go into ICU, we will see if we can delay for a day or two and move those surgeries around in order to manage it. This is the immediate day to day, if we become extremely full. We monitor our ICU capacity on a daily basis. I have had, I think, one experience where we have had to move patients to National Capital. That was across the territory that we had real issues with ICU capacity, but that has been once in nine months that I have been here. In the medium term, we were already planning. We had designers and architects in giving us some service options for what we could do if we needed to expand the ICU physical capacity. They came up with five different options, and we found two preferred options to give us seven to eight additional intensive care beds. That now will be funded by the commonwealth, from the commonwealth funding. That will be our medium term, which should come online within the next two years. That will give us another se ven to eight intensive care beds, which we are forecasting will tide us over or give us enough capacity to get through to the SPIRE expansion. 782 6.87 In addition to the ICU beds identified by CHS, the Committee was advised in an Answer to a Question Taken on Not ice, that 10 ICU beds are available at Calvary Public Hospital and that 'Inpatient Critical care beds at Calvary Public Hospital are a mix of ICU and High Dependency Unit beds, depending on demand.'783 781 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 549. 782 Ms McDonald, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 20 June 2019, p. 547. 783 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19-97, answered 2 July 2019. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 155 6.88 In addition the Committee was advised that the Territory has physical capacity for 41 ICU beds.784 6.89 Under Commonwealth funding, the Minister advised that the ICU expansion in terms of capital was put forward as a priority under that funding. Noting the ICU expansion funding request, the Committee continued their questioning into the work that has been undertaken.785 6.90 In particular the Committee noted the capacity of ICU beds is expected to increase by six to eight beds, and sought advice on the staffing for the increased beds. The Committee was subsequently advised t hat recruitment strategies for intensive care nurses will be gin prior to the completion of the build.786 6.91 In a response to a Question Taken on Notice, the Committee was advised that 'each Intensive Care Unit Bed requires a minimum staffing of 1:1 over a 24/7 period. This equates to a recruitable 5.7 FTE which is inclusive of backfill and oncosts.787 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.92 The Committee notes that the SPIRE centre is not expected to be completed by 2023. Recommendation 82 6.93 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government, by the last sitting day of 2019, ensures the Minister for Health reports to the Legislative Assembly on plans to upgrade the Intensive Care Unit at the Canberra Hospital prior to the development of the Surg ical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency Centre . NEW LINEAR ACCELERATOR 6.94 The Committee asked when the new linear accelerator would be operational. The Committee was advised that: The new linear accelerator has been delivered. We have taken handover of that. The refurbishment of the bunker, as it is called \u2014the room that it goes in \u2014has also been completed. They are pretty significant pieces of machinery. Unfortunately, the commissioning time frame for them is quite lengthy.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 156 physics team are in there, working to make sure that the machines are safe. We expect to treat our first patients on them by September.788 6.95 The Committee also asked if accountability indicators for 2019 -20 will be met with the new machine. The Committe e was informed that the new machine will replace an existing machine, resulting in approximately 12 months where ACT Health will be with four machines.789 6.96 ACT Health did acknowledge that they are not currently meeting the target time lines. However, they ass ured the Committee that when all five linear accelerators are operating it will be sufficient for the medium term. It was also noted that restrictions on licences for linear accelerators are managed through the Commonwealth. As such, continual monitoring w ould need to be done by ACT Health and if the targets are still not being met, a bid for an additional linear accelerator will need to be made to the Commonwealth. 790 6.97 ACT Health also advised the Committee that Icon, a private provider situated on the grounds of the University of Canberra, has the fifth licence in the ACT for linear accelerators and Icon have been treating patients since December 2018. 791 6.98 Noting that Icon is provid ing services to ACT patients, the Committee sought advice to the financial impacts of these services. ACT Health Officials advised the Committee that services are not outsourced to Icon. As such, the services provided through Icon are further options for patients to access private radiation therapy. However, ACT Health did note that the service is bulk -billed with an out -of-pocket expense that is negotiated with each patient.792 6.99 The Committee enquired into the financial impact on patients accessing the private linear accelerator. The Committee was advised that if patients do not wish to ac cess private treatment they will be treated in the public system. Additionally, the Committee was informed that they have received positive feedback regarding the options available.793 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.100 The Committee acknowledges that whilst patients have the option to access radiation services through private and public options, ACT Health is not currently meeting its target timelines. 6.101 The Committee also notes that even with the new linear accelerator, ACT Health will only have four operational linear acce lerators for approximately 12 months when five linear accelerators are required to meet demand. 788 Proof Tr anscript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 552. 789 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 552. 790 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 552- 553. 791 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 552- 553. 792 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 552- 553. 793 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 552- 553.

ACT LOCAL HOSPITAL NETWORK (1.1) 6.103 The ACT Local Hospital Network will receive funding under the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) and purchase public hospital services from the Canberra Hospital, University of Canberra Hospital, Calvary Public Hospital, Clare Holland House and Queen Elizabeth II Family Centre.794 6.104 The NHRA commits to funding public hospitals using Activity Based Funding where practicable using the National Efficient Price (NEP) determined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority (IHPA). The NEP is based on the projected average cost of a National Weighted Activity Unit (NWAU).795 6.105 An NWAU is a measure of health service activity expressed as a common unit, against which the NEP is paid. It provides a way of comparing and valuing each public hospital service (whether it is an admission, emergency department presentations or outpatient episode), by weighing it for its clinical complexity. The average hospital service is worth one NWAU - the most intensive and expensive activities are worth multiple NWAU's, the simplest and least expensive are worth fractions of an NWAU. NWAU's are updated annually.796 6.106 The 2019 -20 National Efficient Price is $5,134 per NWAU .797 6.107 The ACT 2019 -20 Budget Statement s C states that the ACT Local Hospital Network was established under the Health Act 1953 and is administered by the Director- General of the ACT Health Directorate and supported by staff from the ACT Health Directorate.798 6.108 The ACT Local Hospital Network receives Activity Based Funding (ABF) from both the Commonwealth and the ACT governments, and block funding for teaching, training and research.

The Committee was advised that engagement with the facilities management is a key element from the outset. 804 6.112 With specific reference to engagement with facilities management, the Committee was informed that: We have generated, as part of the infrastructure and health support services group, facility management specifications for all aspects of building services at t he Canberra Hospital and, indeed, across our portfolio. We also have mandated, in conjunction with infrastructure, finance and capital works, the role of an independent commissioning agent, which essentially works to assist the project manager.805 799 ACT Budget 2018- 19, Budget Statements C, ACT Health Directorate , p. 64. 800 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 477- 480. 801 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 480- 484; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 84, answered 28 June 2019. 802 Proof Transcript of Evide nce, 20 June 2019, pp. 508- 509. 803 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 517- 519; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 89, answered 28 June 2019. 804 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 478. 805 Mr Mooney, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 478. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 159 6.113 The Commit tee was also advised that ACT Health has a Facilities Management Engagement document, which is a document that is written into all contracts. This obligates the successful contractor to engage with facilities management throughout the project, to ensure mi lestones are approved and fulfilled .806 6.114 In addition to facilities management, the Committee also noted that approximately $2.5 million of the budget had been allocated to the refurbishment of birthing suites damaged by water leaks. The Committee enquired int o the completion of this project. 807 6.115 CHS advised that the work will be completed by November 2019. The Committee was also advised that in conjunction with clinical services each birthing suite is taken offline to complete the work. 808 6.116 The Committee also asked if the issues were a building warranty issue. The Committee was subsequently advised that, in terms of the birthing suites, ACT Health and CHS are currently seeking advice from the Government Solicitor's Office to determine if it is a building warran ty issue.809 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.117 The Committee notes that ACT Health and CHS have continued to receive advice from the Government Solicitor's Office for more than a year. The Committee acknowledges the complexity of the issues; however, it also recognises the need to finalise such issues in a timely manner. Recommendation 84 6.118 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government resolve the legal issues associated with building defects in the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children and have the Minister for Health report to the Legislative Assembly on the status of the building defects and any associated warranty matters. PALLIATIVE CARE AND CLARE HOLLAND HOUSE 6.119 The Committee enquired into the services provided at Clare Holland House and what is being done to impro ve services. 810 806 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 479. 807 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 479. 808 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 479. 809 Proof Hansard, 20 June 2019, p. 480. 810 Proof Hansard, 20 June 2019, p. 480. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 160 6.120 The Minister advised the Committee that: We have funding which is combined funding from the commonwealth government and the Snow Foundation for a fairly significant expansion and upgrade of Clare Holland House. That work is underway. It is re flected in the budget papers this year. There is a lot of work in terms of territory -wide service planning about palliative care needs. That includes, obviously, funding the staff who will work in the expanded Clare Holland House in the future. But there h as been extensive work done on the palliative care plan. 811 6.121 CHS also advised the Committee that ACT Health is currently working on territory -wide palliative care project, which aims to bring together all palliative care providers across the ACT to provide a more seamless service to patients. A governance structure has also been implemented that brings together Clare Holland House, Calvary, ACT Palliative Care, Capital Health Network and Canberra Health Services.812 6.122 In addition to services provided by Clare Holland House, the Committee also asked about Geriatric Rapid Acute Evaluation (GRACE) nurses and other palliative care services. The Committee was advised that GRACE was expanded in the last budget, however the palliative care services, Inspired (integrating specialist palliative care into residential care for older people ), was expanded in this budget. Inspired has assisted in providing services in people's homes and residential facilities, which has reduced the need for individuals accessing acute hospital s ervices.813 6.123 The Minister also added that the end of life care is the focus for this year's Canberra Health Annual Research Meeting (CHARM) research symposium.814 Further information about the CHARM research symposium was provided, adding that: CHARM has been going for 25 years in the ACT. It is our showcasing of the research that is going on across the ACT and surrounding region. This particular year we are lookin g at a theme around end of life. Last year we looked at cardiovascular health. This year we are looking at end of life care because it is such an important area. We have talked to our academic partners; we have talked to our health services; we have looked across our primary healthcare partners et cetera. We see that end of life care is really important and is something that the ACT can do some really great research into and also bring that translation into improving the experience of people who are at the end of their life or in palliative care. CHARM brings those together and 811 Minister Fitzharris MLA , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 20 June 2019, p. 480. 812 Ms O'Neill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 481. 813 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 20 June 2019, p. 481. 814 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 482.

In this case we are focusing on end of life care.815 6.124 The Committee asked if there was a process for referring ideas dis cussed and presented at the CHARM research symposium for consideration and implementation into services. The Committee was subsequently assured that there was a process, which would be included in the end of life care research plan that has been developed by academics, health care and consumers. 816 UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA PUBLIC HOSPITAL 6.125 Noting that the University of Canberra Public Hospital had been open for approximately 12 months, the Committee enquired into its success thus far and any feedback that had been received. The Committee was informed that the utilisation and occupancy rate of the University of Canberra Public Hospital was high, which is a good indication of its success. 817 6.126 The Committee also heard that informal feedback received has been positive in terms of the facilities and how rehabilitation is undertaken. In terms of measures, it was noted that more compliments have been received than complaints. CHS also advised the Committee of the occupancy rate, stating that: From some figures we receive d to the middle of May, there have been something like 25,500 patient bed days at the hospital. Currently we have \u2014I might get this wrong; I am sorry \u201468 RAC beds open and 20 mental health rehab beds available. From the data and statistics we have, it has be en something like a 90 or 95 per cent occupancy rate over the year of it being opened.818 6.127 The Committee was advised that not all the beds as the University of Canberra Public Hospital are open at one time. CHS told the Committee they are looking at whether m ore beds need to be opened, as well as identifying patients at the Canberra Hospital who would be suitable for bed utilisation at the University of Canberra Public Hospital. The Committee was also told that this would also help the flow of more acute patie nts through the Canberra Hospital.819 COMMITTEE COMMENT 6.128 The Committee notes that evidence provided to the Committee advises that not all beds at the University of Canberra Public Hospital are open at one time. The Committee also notes that CHS is evaluating the need to open additional beds at the University of Canberra Public 815 Associate Professor Shadbolt, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 482- 483. 816 Associate Professor Shadbolt, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 483. 817 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 508. 818 Mr Kaye, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 508. 819 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 508.

However, beyond the election commitment, the Minister acknowledged that the scope of SPIRE has since expanded, resulting in commitments being made to do further work.835 7.7 With regards to continuity of SPIRE planning and impl ementation, the Committee enquired into any impacts the restructure of the ACT Health had on SPIRE. The Minister advised the Committee that the separation of the ACT Health Directorate into two separate organisations had no particular impact the delivery o f SPIRE.836 7.8 In addition to the discussions on timeframes, the Minister also noted that the election commitment did highlight that the project would be estimated at $500 million. However, noting the changes in the infrastructure market, both locally and natio nally, the Directorate has not published the SPIRE figures as they are still commercial- in-confidence. The Minister reassured the Committee that once a contractor had been identified for SPIRE, the numbers would be published. 837 7.9 The Committee also sought cl arity on the services delivered through SPIRE. CHS advised the Committee that: It will give us a brand -new emergency department. Alongside that emergency department, we will have medical imaging, which will have an MRI in it and, I think, three CT machines to service the emergency department and also the patients within the SPIRE building themselves. We will have new theatres, an increased number of operating theatres that will be in line with current guidelines and guidelines at the time in terms of space and size, and interventional procedures, and what we call a hybrid theatre. We will also have a new intensive care unit and an increase in our intensive care numbers. We will have paediatric intensive care beds in there as well. We will have some day case beds and spaces for day procedures, and also some overnight surgical beds to service SPIRE, 64 of those. There will be a coronary care unit \u2014our coronary care unit will be new \u2014along with some cardiology rooms for our interventional cardiologist. 838 7.10 Noting th e new facilities, the Committee enquired into the impacts on existing facilities. The Committee was subsequently advised that existing facilities will close, and services will be moved to the SPIRE location. With specific reference to existing theatres, CH S also noted that all nine theatres will be closed, and services will be relocated to SPIRE.

The existing medical imaging next to the emergency department will stay and a supplementary medical imaging unit wi ll be built in SPIRE.839 7.11 In addition to the services provided, the Committee also sought advice on the master plan and the boundaries included in this master plan. The Committee was informed that the master plan encompasses the site and the car parks on Yamb a Drive.840 7.12 Noting the boundaries of the master plan, the Committee asked if traffic issues including Garran Primary School had been taken into consideration. The Committee was informed that school crossing supervisors are working with Garran P rimary School around the construction of SPIRE.841 7.13 The Committee also enquired into the access to the hospital via the Woden bus interchange and accessibility concerns. The Committee particularly highlighted the old Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) as a possible SP IRE location.842 7.14 In response, the Minister stated that: As you know as well, with the old CIT Woden site and an expansion of the hospital per se for acute services, it is actually quite some way from the main hospital location. The parking there is very high ly utilised by both ACT Health and CHS staff. That question is one that I know we have spoken about. The Minister for Urban Renewal will have a conversation with the community about the best use of that site. Its proximity to the hospital would lend itself to becoming part of that conversation, but as to whether it is about an expansion of the hospital itself, I think we are looking at the current footprint of the hospital, on the other side of Yamba Drive. 843 7.15 The Minister also reassured the Committee that di scussions have been had with the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate and Transport Canberra, to ensure all matters are considered with the master plan of SPIRE.844 COMMITTEE COMMENT 7.16 The Committee acknowledges the enormity of the SP IRE project and wants to ensure appropriate services are provided in a timely fashion and within budget.

Recommendation 87 7.18 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government, by the last sitting day of 2019, ensures the Minister for Health, table in the Legislative Assembly a detailed list of historical and projected milestones and their status for the Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency project. HOMEBIRTH TRIAL 7.19 The Committee inquired into the homebirth trial, the number of participants in the homebirth trial, as well as evaluations of the trial. The Committee was advised that 28 babies have been born through the homebirth trial. Additionally, a mid -trial internal process review has bee n completed to evaluate the processes to ensure the systems were strong. 845 7.20 The Committee was further advised that a formal evaluation will be going to tender in the next few months to have an external, independent evaluation of the outcomes of the services and that the external evaluation will be completed towards the end of the year and into early 2020, when a sufficient number of babies have been born through the trial.846 7.21 Noting the impending external evaluation of the homebirth trail, the Committee asked i f the trial would continue during the evaluation. The Committee was advised that the trial was committed for approximately a three -year period. If families have been accepted into the trial, when the external evaluation commences, they will not be removed from the trial. However, the trial may not take additional women during the external review.847 7.22 Regarding the homebirth trial and external evaluation, the Minister added: I think that you could reasonably assume that this was quite a significant new service option, that you could safety assume that given that the trial was established around some very strict parameters, the government's intention is to continue that and we want the trial to be a success. The question will come about \u2014I know we have had 845 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 515. 846 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 516. 847 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 516- 517. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 168 represe ntations on where people live and how close they might live. I think that is the one area that we will need to look at through the evaluation. We do not yet know. So far it has gone really well. I believe that the feedback from the participants and the midwives is very strong. All of those things add to the government's strong interest in this. We need to do this work. As Katrina said, we cannot expand a trial at midpoint or at any time, otherwise we will compromise the potential future rollout of it. 848 COMMITTEE COMMENT 7.23 The Committee notes the importance of providing options to women wishing to birth at home. The Committee also acknowledges, that to ensure the safety of the mother and the child, appropriate measures should be in place. The Committee believe s that the homebirth trial has provided a safe process for families wishing to birth at home but believes it can be more inclusive. Recommendation 88 7.24 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government continue with the homebirth trial while the external eval uation is taking place. Recommendation 89 7.25 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government, subject to the external evaluation of the homebirth trial, increase availability of home birthing options for local women. OUTPATIENT WAIT TIMES 7.26 The Committee noted that some outpatient clinics have long wait times to get an appointment. The Committee inquired into what the ACT Government is doing to address outpatient wait times. The Committee was advised that a timely care strategy has been implemented, which includes outpatient services. The Committee was also advised that a working group was recently established. 849 7.27 The Committee was also informed of a number of strategies to manage demand and increase capacity: 848 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 J une 2019, p. 517. 849 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 538. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 169 Around managing demand, we are working with the services to identify the core service that that medical specialty is providing. We get a lot of referrals from GPs for conditions that probably do not really warrant tertiary specialist involvement. We are working closely with the Capital Health Network, particularly around the health pathways program, to ensure that GPs can better manage some of these patients in the primary healthcare centre before referral. We are also working on a range of strategies around capacity. We have implemented a number of clinics where, for example, advanced practice nurses or extended scope physios are screening patients and often undertaking some of that early intervention to avoid needing to see a specialist. We have also done quite a bi t of work around follow -up appointments, particularly after surgery. Particularly with the advent of keyhole surgery, you do not need to come back to get your stitches out like you used to. We are working with the surgical teams to change their practices s o that they only bring back patients for review if they really need to come back. We are also conducting a lot more phone clinics, just to check in on patients, again stop them physically having to come back. One of the areas that we are now really starting to focus on is increasing the number of new patient referrals as a percentage of the total appointment load. At the moment, we are probably bringing back patients far too often. I liken it to the idea that we get these people on the bus but we keep them on the bus, yet we have all these people waiting at the bus stop. It is about how we get the interventions that these patients require and then hand them back into the primary care setting where they can be adequately looked after rather than using up app ointments that we need to allocate to new patients. 850 7.28 The Committee noted that one of the performance indicators that had been incorporated to reduce outpatient wait times was the new- to-review appointment ratios. The Committee subsequently asked if the len gth of time it takes to get the first appointment was also a performance indicator. CHS confirmed that this was an indicator that was monitored. 851 COMMITTEE COMMENT 7.29 The Committee notes that there are a number of performance indicators that have been incor porated into the health system to assist in the reduction of outpatient wait times. The Committee believes that the publication of this information, as well as the changes to the indicators over time would assist in better understanding the impacts of wait times for outpatient services 850 Ms Neill, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 538- 539. 851 Ms McDonald, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 539- 540. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 170 Recommendation 90 7.30 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government publish data on wait times for appointments with specialist outpatient clinics in the ACT. PATIENT NAVIGATION SERVICES 7.31 The Committee noted that the Health Care Consumers Association have been asked to deliver a feasibility study into patient navigation services. The Committee asked if the feasibility study had been finalised.852 7.32 The Committee was advised that the feasibility study had been finalised las t year, however, the ACT Government is still finalising their response to the study.853 7.33 In addition to the feasibility study, the Committee noted the election commitment for 12 nurse navigators. The Committee subsequently asked what the difference was betwe en the patient navigation and nurse navigators.854 7.34 The Committee was informed in a Question Taken on Notice that: At Canberra Health Services (CHS), there are nurse navigators in several divisions. They are also called Care Coordinators. The roles vary betw een divisions, as they are tailored to the work of each division and the patients needs being served in each division. They perform duties to assist the flow of patients through the division from admission to discharge, including assisting with discharge p lanning, attending family meetings and providing clinical experience for support and advice to the patient care teams. (More broadly, patient navigation systems exist in different models, with the general aim of helping patients find their way through what has become an increasingly complex health care system. They are often focused on patients with chronic conditions. CHS has tailored the approach to best suit our organisation and our patients.855 7.35 In response to a Question Taken on Notice, the Committee was informed that the nurse navigators, who are located in the Divisions of Medicine, Critical Care and Rehabilitation, Aged and Community Services have been funded. 856 852 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 541. 853 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 541. 854 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 541. 855 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 92, answered 28 June 2019. 856 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 92, answered 28 June 2019. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 171 COMMITTEE COMMENT 7.36 The Committee notes that the Health Care Consumers Association had finalise d their feasibility study on patient navigation services last year. The Committee acknowledges the importance of aiding patients in navigating the health system. The Committee believes that the Government response to this study should be prioritised to ens ure appropriate services are provided. Recommendation 91 7.37 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government, following a report from the Health Care Consumers Association, prioritise work on developing a patient navigation service. Recommendation 92 7.38 The C ommittee recommends that the ACT Government, by the end of the last sitting day in October 2019, ensures that the Minister for Health report to the Legislative Assembly on the progress of th e work towards developing a patient navigation service. MENTAL HEALTH , JUSTICE HEALTH AND ALCOHOL AND DRUG SERVICES (1.2) 7.39 CHS provides a range of Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services through the public and community sectors in hospitals, community health centres and other community settin gs, adult and youth correctional facilities and people's homes across the Territory. These services work to provide integrated and responsive care to a range of services including hospital -based specialist services, therapeutic rehabilitation, counselling , supported accommodation services and other community -based services .857 MATTERS CONSIDERED 7.40 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Mental Health, Justice Health, and Alcohol and Drug Services: 857 ACT Budget 2018- 19, Budget Statement s C, ACT Health Directorate , p. 40. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 172 Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services (Winnunga Nimmityjah) at Alexander Maconochie Centre (AMC);858 eating disorders (also discussed under YWCA) ;859 mental illness and the justice system;860 mental health staff;861 opioid treatment at AMC;862 insecure work in mental health and justice health;863 seclusion and mental health;864 Ngunnawal Bush Healing ISSUES WINNUNGA NIMMITYJAH SERVICES AT AMC 7.41 Noting that the partnership between Winnun ga Nimmityjah , ACT Corrective Services and CHS was first announce in December 2017 but operations did not begin until January 2019, the Committee sought advice on the delay in starting services. 868 7.42 Minister Rattenbury, Minister for Corrections and Justice He alth and Minister for Mental Health (the Minister), stated that: There are a range of factors in doing something brand -new like this. There was quite a discussion about how the model of care would work. There was quite an extended period of negotiation. Wh ile I would not seek to speak for Ms. Tongs, the head of Winnunga, she and I had a couple of discussions about the fact that we needed to get it right, not get it done quickly. We probably all would have liked to see it happen a bit more quickly, but there was some back and forth. 858 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 443- 444; 448- 451; Answer to Ques tion Taken on Notice E19- 75, answered 1 July 2019. 859 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 444- 447. 860 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 451- 452. 861 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 452- 454. 862 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 454- 456. 863 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 456- 458. 864 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 458- 459. 865 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 521- 524; Answer to Question Tak en on Notice E19- 90, answered 9 July 2019. 866 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 460- 462. 867 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 542- 543; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 93, answered 28 June 2019. 868 Proof Transcript of Evidenc e, 20 June 2019, p. 443. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 173 We also needed to prepare a suitable space for Winnunga. As you may know, our health centre at the AMC is under considerable pressure \u2014we have just commissioned a contract for an expansion of space \u2014so we had to turn one of the pre vious health wards into a suitable space for Winnunga, at least for the short term, until we have the expansion of the health centre, so there was some physical work to be done as well.869 7.43 The Committee enquired further into the physical space provided to Winnunga Nimmityjah . The Minister advised the Committee that Winnunga Nimmityjah is operating out of what was formerly one of the health wards, which has been converted to provide the equip ment they need. The Minister did acknowledge that Winnunga Nimmityjah could do with a better space, which will be provided when AMC expanded the health centre.870 7.44 The Committee advised the Minister that they were aware of approximately 90 inmates in the AMC who identified as Aboriginal and identified that they would like to be transferred to Winnunga Nimmityjah for health services. However, since Winnunga Nimmityjah became operational in January 2019, only 16 or 17 people had transferred to that services. The Committee sought clarification on the transfer rate.871 7.45 In response, the Minister advised the Committee that from 7 January to 18 June 2019, there were 43 formal requests to transfer care to Winnunga Nimmityjah from Justice Services. Of the 43, 20 have been transferred and an additional three transfers with occur this week. 12 of the 43 were released prior to transfer. Eight of the 43 were not transferred and six are currently with Winnunga Nimmityjah for consideration. Two are also pending a Justice Health Services review for suitability of transfer. 872 7.46 Noting that services provided by Winnunga Nimmityjah are between particular hours, the Committee asked if consideration was given to the access and timing of medication for detainees needing medication at certain times.873 7.47 The Minister informed the Committee that there are structures in place that provide for resolutions of these issues. Additionally, if a resolution could not be found it is escalated to managers.874 7.48 With regards to possible longer hours of operation, CHS advised the Committee that: In the operation of Winnunga health service within the justice health system, we are working in partnership. We have an operational committee that meets on a regular 869 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p . 443. 870 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p p. 443- 444. 871 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p . 448. 872 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transc ript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p p. 448- 449. 873 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p . 449. 874 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p p. 449- 450. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 174 basis every week to try to address issues of the creation of the service and the transfer of patients across. As you understand, this is an evolving ser vice. It is a brand -new service. We are really happy to have Winnunga providing that health service within the AMC and to work in partnership with them. As issues arise in terms of access to Winnunga services, we are happy to work with Winnunga on increasi ng the hours of service. But, as you would understand, Winnunga have to provide the medical staff and the nursing staff to actually provide that service. 875 7.49 In addition to the hours of access to Winnunga Nimmityjah , the Committee also enquired into the trans fer of paper records between the justice health system and Winnunga Nimmityjah .876 7.50 In answer to a Question Taken on Notice, the Committee was advised that the medical records at the AMC are not paper based, they are electronic.877 7.51 Further this, in the same Ans wer to a Question Taken on Notice the Committee was advised that: In August 2017, the Mental Health, Alcohol and Drug Service, Justice Health Integrated Care eRecord (MAJICeR) was implemented into Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services . This electronic clinical record system replaced the Mental Health Assessment, Generation and Information Collection (MHAGIC) and the paper based clinical records that were used by Alcohol and Drug Service and the Justice Health primary health team at th e Alexander Maconochie Centre. When a detainee's health care is transferred to Winnunga from Justice Health Services, the Winnunga team is provided access to MAJICeR for that detainee and a hardcopy 'transfer summary' and medication chart, which is also c ontained in MAJICeR, is provided. The combination of access to MAJICeR and the transfer summary provides a comprehensive handover of clinical information to Winnunga.878 COMMITTEE COMMENT 7.52 The Committee acknowledges that access to appropriate health services should be afforded to every individual residing in the ACT. The Committee also acknowledges the importance of ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander inmates having access to Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services . 875 Ms McDonald, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 450- 451. 876 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p . 451. 877 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 75, answered 1 July 2019. 878 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 75, answered 1 July 2019. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 175 Recommendati on 93 7.53 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government, by the last sitting day in 2019, ensure the Minister for Corrections and Justice Health report to the Legislative Assembly on the progress to establish Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services at the Alexander Macono chie Centre. Recommendation 94 7.54 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government, by the last sitting day in 2019, ensures the Minister for Corrections and Justice Health report to the Legislative Assembly on the progress to improve health facilities in the Alexander Macono chie Centre. Recommendation 95 7.55 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government and Justice Health better engage with Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services in transitioni ng clients from Justice Health to Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services . Recommendation 96 7.56 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government improve the process for handing detainees over to Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services so that by the end of 2019 all detainees who have a preference for using that health service be cared for by that service. Recommendation 97 7.57 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that relevant paper based records be wholly handed over to Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 176 Services so that they have access to 100 per cent of a detainees health record, so that no information can be missing from or missed by them. EATING DISORDERS 7.58 The Committee enquired into budget initiatives allocated to addressing eating disorders in the ACT. The Minister advised that at the end of 2018 a petition was presented to the Legislative Assembly and subsequently referred to the Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Community Services. Following the petition, the ACT Government released an eating disorder strategy: This year the budget brings forward resources to start the implementation of that. It particularly focuses on establishing an eating disorder specialist clinical hub. One of the things that really came through in the eating disorder strategy was the need to build expertise in our medical community in the ACT, to try to identify those clinicians who have an interest and perhaps create a group of people that someone with an eating disorder can go to. You may recall the terrible story of a former ACT Health staffer who had sought medical help and had been told, \"Just go and have a steak and a beer and you'll be right, love.\" So, clearly, we have got some work to do to educate our own medical community about how to deal with it better. That is the broad direction of the strategy, and the budget this year starts to make that investment. As you might have seen, the commonwealth government has a lso, through the election campaign, committed additional funds to supporting eating disorders in the ACT. We have now commenced those conversations with the commonwealth. I am pleased that they have recognised the strategy we have put in place. We will now seek to align those resources to the strategy we are rolling out. 879 7.59 Noting the 2018 Eating Disorder Strategy, the Committee enquired into short- term initiatives the ACT Government is implementing from the Strategy. The Committee was advised that the ACT Go vernment will initially establish an eating disorder specialist clinical hub and partnership with non -government organisations .880 7.60 As the Minister had informed the Committee that the Commonwealth Government had committed capital investment for eating disord er services, the Committee asked if the eating disorder specialist clinical hub would be a physical hub.881 879 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 444- 445. 880 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p p. 444- 445. 881 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p . 445. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 177 7.61 The Minister advised the Committee that the is not intended to be a physical hub. However, he did note that there is a need for a step -up, step -down w here the capital investment from the Commonwealth could be used and indicated that: Our initial thinking is that, with the gap in ACT services, the best place to use the capital infrastructure would be in what might be broadly called a step -up, step -down f acility. I do not want to define it too clearly at this point. In thinking about the continuum of need for people with an eating disorder, some will need to go to hospital, but ideally that will be a very small group who are very unwell and need serious me dical intervention. We think the bigger gap is a step back from that point, and that an inpatient facility that is probably more in the step -up, step -down mode will be right. Whether that is where we would then base a whole lot of clinicians or whether it would be more residential in nature is the detailed work that needs to be done. It is not that we need physical space for expertise at this stage. That is my thinking at the moment, but we remain open on that. 882 7.62 In addition to availability of treatment in t he Territory, the Committee also asked about capturing data on people seeking treatment outside of the ACT. The Committee was informed that the ACT Government is collaborating with the InsideOut Institute in New South Wales (NSW) about NSW admissions, as w ell as collaborating with NSW Health to determine Canberran admissions. The Committee was subsequently advised that anecdotal evidence suggests that Canberran admissions in NSW are to private hospitals.883 7.63 The Committee noted that data is also not available about those seeking care in private hospitals. However , the Committee was advised that part of the budget commitment to the eating disorder clinical hub, is to obtain better data projections to develop future models of care. 884 COMMITTEE COMMENT 7.64 The Committee notes that the ACT Government has recently published an eating disorder strategy that outlines goals to be achieved. The Committee also notes that the Commonwealth has invested capital funding for eating disorders. Recommendation 98 7.65 The Committee recomm ends that, the ACT Government work with the Commonwealth Government on establishing a centre for eating disorders. 882 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p . 445. 883 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p . 446. 884 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p . 446. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMAT ES 2019- 2020 178 Recommendation 99 7.66 The Committee recommends that, the ACT Government, by the last sitting day of 2019, ensure the Minister for Mental Health report to the Legislative Assembly on the progress to establish a centre for eating disorders. MENTAL HEALTH STAFF 7.67 The Committee noted that there were 129 assaults on mental health staff between January 2017 and June 2018. The Committee subsequent ly enquired into programs that have been incorporated to enhance nurse safety in mental health wards. 885 7.68 The Committee was advised that each mental health facility has a strategy in place which is tailored to the patients that are being cared for at the time. A consultancy was also acquired to look at what is best practice both nationally and internationally in the management of occupational violence in health services. The consultation process will result in a strategy that has examined the right environment for patients and staff, the training across all services, information and expectations of consumers, patients and visitors, as well as access to the right risks assessments. 886 COMMITTEE COMMENT 7.69 The Committee notes that a number of incidences of occupation al violence have occurred in mental health services, as well as across health services generally. The Committee also acknowledges that a number of projects have commenced to implement strategies for dealing with and reducing occupational violence in health services. Recommendation 100 7.70 The Committee recommends that, the ACT Government, by the last sitting day of 2019, ensure the Minister for Health report to the Legislative Assembly about strategies for tackling occupational violence in ACT public health fac ilities and the progress, in measurable terms, against those strategies. 885 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p . 452. 886 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p p. 453- 454.

Services are provided in inpatient, outpatient and community settings .887 MATTERS CONSIDERED 7.72 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Cancer Services, included: cancer services - clinical research; 888 chemotherapy co -payments; and889 acute age care and cancer inpatient - infrastructure.890 KEY ISSUES CLINICAL RESEARCH 7.73 The Committee enquired into clinical research regarding cancer that will be undertaken in the coming years. The Committee was advised that the Centre for Health Medical Research within the ACT Health has been involved in several cancer projects. In particular, that Committee was informed that the Centre for Health Medical Research has ministerial interest in the MoST (Molecular Screening and Therapeutics) clinical trials, which is run out of the Garvan Institute and the National Hea lth and Medical Research Council's clinical control centre in Sydney. 891 7.74 The Committee was also advised of the palliative care research being led by Professor Chapman within the oncology area. This research is looking at cutting -edge ways of being able to im prove how people die with dignity, how to improve their experiences and how to listen to them in terms of the dying process.892 7.75 The Committee was also advised that within the John Curtin School of Medical Research , ACT Health has a targeted drug discovery program that is funded jointly, to some degree. This program provides an avenue to look at a single sample from a person and see whether there is a raft of different drugs that may lead to a response.893 887 ACT Budget 2018- 19, Budget Statemen ts C, ACT Health Directorate , p. 41. 888 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 495- 497. 889 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 498. 890 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 498. 891 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 496- 497. 892 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 496- 497. 893 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 497. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 180 7.76 Additionally the Committee was told that a memorandum of understanding has also been signed with the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, which allows ACT Health to share expertise and resources between the ACT and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Within the University of Canberra, work has commenced in breast cancer research. Preclinical research into brain cancer has also commenced at the John Curtin School of Medical Research . 894 7.77 The Committee noted that under the 'investing in medical health and research' budget line, one million has been allocated each y ear for three years. However, in 2022 -23, no money has been allocated. Minister Fitzharris, Minister for Health and Minister for Medical and Health Research (the Minister) informed the Committee that: That specific one will partly fund the work on the brain cancer mission that we have been involved with, but that particular initiative was an election commitment for $3 million. At this point we have spread that over three years. As the office establishes itself as we make more progress with ANU and UC in terms of partnerships, we will be looking to what we do in future years. It is establishing a really good system -wide approach to research across the territory. This great research has been outlined, but it is having that more strategic approach that gives us the opportunity to have a more strategic look at all of these things over the next year or so. 895 7.78 The Committee also enquired into research regarding melanoma. The Committee was informed that the new director of the John Curtin School of Medical Research is one of the leading melanoma researchers in the country, and is most likely to bring his research with him. 896 SUBACUTE AND COMMUNITY SERVICES (1.4) 7.79 Following illness, injury or surgery, subacute services enable individuals to safely transition to community living.

However, in 2018 -19 the target was six months with estimated outcomes of eight months. The Committee sought advice on the increased mean waiting time.902 7.82 The Committee was advised that: In the dental health progra m that initial target was set when the national partnership agreement funding came through from the commonwealth. In every other jurisdiction the target has always been 12 months. It was an ACT Health -initiated indicator to have a six -month target time. Th at was before my time, but historically there was an agreement that, when that indicator was changed from what was accepted nationally, if the national partnership agreement funding decreased then we would revert to the nationally accepted target, which was 12 months. For a long time we had a target of six months and we were meeting that target for a very long time. When the funding was decreased we petitioned the minister for the dental health program to review the target and bring it in line with every ot her jurisdiction in the country, which is 12 months. 903 7.83 The Committee enquired into the eligibility parameters of the denture program and were informed that applicants require a healthcare consumers card and must be over a certain age to access dentures. The Committee was also advised that dentures are made in house through the dental health program, but there is an external referral scheme as well. 904 898 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 498. 899 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 504- 507. 900 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 546- 547; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 96, answered 28 June 2019. 901 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, pp. 554- 555; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 99, answered 28 June 2019. 902 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 554. 903 Mr Wood, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 554. 904 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 20 June 2019, p. 555.

This is achieved through the objectives of: maintaining the rule of law and the Westminster style of democratic government; promoting the protection of human rights in the Territory; promoting a restorative approach to justice; providing effective offender management and opportunities for rehabilitation; protecting and preserving life, property and the environment; and providing for effective and cohesive emergency response and management.906 8.2 The Committee considered the following Outputs, Output Classes and Statements of Intent: Output Class1: Justice Services Output 1.1: Policy Advice and Justice Programs Output1.2: Legal Services to Government Output 1.3: Legislative Drafting and Publishing Services Output 1.4: Public Prosecution Output 1.5: Protection of Rights Output Class 2: Corrective Services: Output 2.1: Corre ctive Services Output Class 3: Courts and Tribunal Output 3.1: Courts and Tribunal Output Class 4: Emergency Services Output 4.1: Emergency Services EBT 1: ACT Policing 906 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements D , Justice and Community Safety Directorate , p. 1.

It also includes the administration of security coordination and emergency management policy, and innovative justice and crime prevention programs (including the Restorative Justice Program) across government and the community.907 MATTERS CONSIDERED 8.4 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Policy Advice and Justice Programs included: staffing profile for JACS and associated agencies;908and impact of changes to safer families levy (also discussed under Public Prosecutions, Legal Aid and Safer Families ).909 KEY ISSUES IMPACT OF CHANGE S TO SAFER FAMILIES LEVY 8.5 The Committee noted that the cessation of the safer families levy and asked why it had ceased. They were informed that: The ceasing of those elements of the safer families funding package was a budget decision this year, to refocus the funding package into new initiatives to address safer families issues. A range of measures have either decreased over this year or are being 907 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements D , Justice and Community Safety Directorate , p. 9. 908 Proof Transcript of Ev idence , 25 June 2019, p. 775. 909 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 777- 786.

It is then a question for government as to how to realign resourcing to be able to, if it chooses to, maintain those programs.910 8.6 The Committee then queried how cutting funding for positions equated to maintaining funding for positions: As with any budget measure that government might undertake, if there is funding reallocated from one area to another, we follow that. If there is a position that is n ot funded but is otherwise a priority to be maintained because a measure has changed, there are adjustments that are made within directorates.911 8.7 The Committee then asked for clarification on where this was in the budget papers: You are saying that there may be redistributions elsewhere in the budget to cover those positions? That is what we are here to do, to address this. In the budget papers, using these figures, there are probably seven or eight positions that I can see being cut. Is the funding coming from elsewhere for that? It is not identified in the budget.912 8.8 They were advised by the Directorate that: No, it would not be identified in the budget. How the directorate would deal with the funding envelope with which it is provided by government is not necessarily reflected in budget papers because they talk only about the new initiatives and the changed initiatives. There is a body of work that goes on all the time about trying to adjust your priorities. 913 8.9 In this context the Committee queried the loss of front -line services that would result from ceasing this funding and how this affected personnel in the courts. After some discussion the Committee was advised that 'the reduction in 2019 -20 is two FTEs across DPP and courts, and in futu re years it is 5.5 FTEs.' 914 8.10 The Committee noted that the removal of the levy would also affect other elements of the safer families package, including Policing and Legal Aid but were not advised as to how many personnel would be affected in these areas as it was not under the Directorate's ambit. However, the Committee did note in later discussions with Legal Aid there was concern that the '2.5 FTE' involved in providing the front -line domestic violence serve at the courts are not guaranteed from 2020 -21 915 and in Policing it was noted in discussions the following day that: 910 Mr Glenn, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 777- 778. 911 Mr Glenn, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 781. 912 Mr Hanson MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 781. 913 Mr Glenn, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 781. 914 Ms Cvetkovski, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 785. 915 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 785; Dr Boersig, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 804- 805. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 186 The stronger police responses to family violence initiative specifically funded some support liaison officers. So it supplemented the family violence unit in ACT Policing to work with peop le who are considering, or going through the process of, applying for family violence orders. 916 8.11 Minister Ramsay, the Attorney -General, went on to explain that one of the reasons personnel could decrease was because after the initial spike in cases there cou ld be a lowering in the number of cases: It may well be \u2014and it was talked about when the safer families levy was introduced \u2014 that with some of the work in the area of domestic and family violence prevention there would be likely to be some form of spike as the initial focus on it occurred. At the moment we are seeing whether, over this period of time, that is indeed a spike, and we can re -profile and redirect the attention of that funding. If not, if it is not a spike and the demand continues, the government will then reconsider how it will look at things in future budgets. 917 8.12 The Attorney -General then indicated that specific questions in relation to the collection and distribution of the overall monies for the safer families levy were probably best directed t o the Minister for Prevention of Domestic and Family Violence.918 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.13 The Committee remains concerned about potential loss of front line and support services and associated staff as funding from the Safer Families Levy is withdrawn. LEGAL SERVI CES TO GOVERNMENT (1.2) 8.14 Output 1.2, Legal Services to Government, includes the provision of high quality and timely legal advice and representation for the Attorney General and Government. 919 MATTERS CONSIDERED 8.15 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Legal Services to Government included: funding decrease for legal services - Solicitor- General ; 920 916 Ms Wood, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 951. 917 Minister Ramsay MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 783- 784. 918 Mr Ramsay MLA, Pro of Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 784. 919 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements D , Justice and Community Safety Directorate , p. 9. 920 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 796- 797.

Without reflecting on the advice that I have provided to government, there are a number of complex issues. The fact is that it is complex and there is a potential for conflict with commonwealth laws. The challenge in introduc ing the legislation is to frame it in such a fashion as to minimise the risk of such a conflict. It is made more difficult by the basis upon which the commonwealth laws are founded and, although not expressed as such, in fact have their constitutional powe r in international conventions. I addressed that at some length in the committee. The question is whether the ACT laws provide a relevant justification to provide an exemption under the commonwealth criminal laws. That is a matter that may be tested in du e course. One cannot provide any certainty about it. All one can do is ensure that the law is framed as effectively as possible and in such as fashion as to reduce the prospect of conflict with commonwealth laws. 923 8.18 He further stated that: It has also got to be appreciated that, when one looks at it, there are two issues in relation to the operation of the commonwealth law. The first is whether the commonwealth law applies at all, and there is an argument that the ACT law itself operates as an excluding provision. The second is whether the person who is charged has got a reasonable excuse, the reasonable excuse being compliance with the ACT law. If one is looking at legal argument around the operation of the commonwealth law and interaction with the ACT law \u2014those are the two areas where it will operate \u2014that can arise through an attempt by the commonwealth to prosecute.924 921 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 798- 801. 922 Proof Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 799- 802; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 297, answered 4 July 2019. 923 Mr Garrisson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 798- 799. 924 Mr Garrisson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 799. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 188 COSTS OF MATTERS INVO LVING THE ACT BEFORE THE HIGH COURT 8.19 In the context of the discussion about cannabis legislation the Committee asked about what would occur if a challenge to cannabis legislation were to proceed to the High Court. 8.20 The Committee was advised that likely costs in any matter brought before the High Court and or any other matter involving ACT and Commonwealth laws, are not po ssible to forecast, particularly as the legislation has not been finalised.925 In this instance, depending on how the legislation is framed, depending on the circumstances and how the matter might arise, it may be a relatively straightforward matter and may not take very long at all or it may involve an issue under the constitution, in which case notices have to be given to the other attorneys -general, which means that other jurisdictions may get interested. And that expands the scope of the case, expands its duration.926 8.21 As a comparison the Committee asked what it had cost to mount the same- sex marriage legal challenge and in an answer to a Question Taken on Notice it was indicated that: The ACT Government Solicitor and Solicitor- General provided legal services in relation to the litigation before the High Court. Existing resources were deployed for those activities. The cost of services provided by external Counsel engaged by the ACT Government Solicitor was $112,883.74. The Territory also paid the Commonwealth 's legal costs of $500,000.00. 927 LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING AND PUBLISHING SERVICES (1.3) 8.22 Output 1.3, Legislative Drafting and Publishing Services, includes the provision high quality and timely legislative drafting and publishing services for ACT legislation an d maintenance of the ACT legislation register. 928 MATTERS CONSIDERED 8.23 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Legislative Drafting and Publishing Services included: 925 Mr Garrisson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 800- 801. 926 Mr Garrisson, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 80 1. 927 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 297, answered 4 July 2019. 928 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget State ments D, Justice and Community Safety Directorate , p. 10.

There is a component for wage parameters, which is a normal technical adjustment every budget, Remuneration Tribunal increases for executives, and other net adjustments such as indexation. 930 8.25 The Committee was further informed that the pract ical use of the funding is to ' provide the ongoing legislative drafting services to government and MLAs'931 and that as the new legislation register comes on line 'the depreciation starts to come on to the balance sheets.'932 PUBLIC PROSECUTION (1.4) 8.26 Output 1. 4, Public Prosecution, includes the prosecution of summary and indictable matters, at first instance and on appeal, provision assistance to the Coroner, and provision of witness assistance services.933 MATTERS CONSIDERED 8.27 Matters considered by the Committee i n relation to Public Prosecution included: cessation of funding for implementation of law reform commission reports on family violence (also discussed under Policy Advice and Justice Programs, Legal Aid and Safer Families ); 934 funding to enable Courts to pro vide access to justice (safer families) for non -English speakers (also discussed under Policy Advice and Justice Programs, Legal Aid and Safer Families );935 929 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 797- 8. 930 Ms Cvetkovski, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 797. 931 Ms Toohey, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 798. 932 Mr Glenn, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 798. 933 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements D , Justice and Community Safety Directorate , p. 10. 934 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 777- 779. 935 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 779- 86.

The usual process is t hat we have conferencing offices if we cannot get agreement between the parties as to arrangements to be made for a protection order. Then it goes before the registrar to make an interim order. If the party is not happy with the ruling made by the registra r, it can be reviewed up to a magistrate.941 8.31 The Committee was also told that , in combination with legislative changes the work undertaken by these three personnel helped get things resolved at a lower level and helped deal with the steady increase of work: 'There is greater awareness of protection orders and the issues around family violence throughout the community and it was to deal with that workload.'942 8.32 The Directorate responded that: 936 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 790. 937 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 791- 793. 938 Ms Williams, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 777. 939 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 778- 779. 940 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 778. 941 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 778 942 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 778 APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 191 The funding will cease from 2021. The government has not taken a decision to cease the program or to not continue that process.943 SUPPORT FOR VULNERABLE WITNESSES - INTERMEDIARY SCHEMES 8.33 In the context of the Royal Commission into Institutional Response to Child Sexual Abuse the Committee asked the about the improved support fo r vulnerable witnesses. The Attorney - General indicated: That is primarily relating to the intermediary scheme. Obviously, there are a large number of matters that have come out of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The re were 307 recommendations that fell within the responsibility of the states and territories. We have endorsed, in principle, following through on all of those. A number of those are in areas of health and education, to make sure an appropriate culture is set. There are also a number of matters that sit within the criminal justice responsibility. We have legislated in a number of areas for those already. But in terms of the intermediary scheme, the work relates to vulnerable witnesses \u2014in this particular circumstance, survivors of child sexual abuse. Obviously, a court appearance or a criminal justice appearance with the police, prosecution and all the way through to the court can be a particularly traumatic time. It can be at times a re -traumatising time. One of the important things that have come out of the royal commission work is to make sure that when we are dealing with survivors we are doing so in a way that is tailored to their experience, knowing that people remember circumstances differently. They hear questions differently. They may use different language around matters. So it is important to try to make sure that the communication is aided and they are not asked to squeeze into, effectively, a criminal justice system that operates in its own way. Ms Greenland can probably fill that out further. But the intermediary scheme is about communications experts, to enable those people's testimony, information or evidence to be heard. 944 8.34 The Directorate continued indicating that: As the attorney has mentioned, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse acknowledged that there was a real need to support vulnerable witnesses, and children in particular, in the way that they are able to give their best evidence. That is whether they are interacting with police and giving witness statements or in appearances in court. The commission certainly looked quite closely at evidence from overseas and other jurisdictions in Australia that have implemented intermediary schemes. It pointed to 943 Mr Glenn, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 778 944 Minister Ramsay MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 790- 791. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 192 the benefit that has to achieving access to justice. It is achieved by allowing people to give their best evidence. The initiative that is in the budget is going to allow for an intermediary scheme to commence at the beginning of next year. It will be locat ed in the Victims of Crime Commissioner's office. That will be where it will be administered. Work has already commenced to recruit, train and have intermediaries available to be working from the beginning of next year in supporting children who are witnes ses in child sexual abuse matters and also witnesses in homicide matters who are children. 945 8.35 When asked how the funding helps police investigate child abuse the Directorate indicated that: It will support police, when they are taking witness statements, to get the best evidence from child witnesses. There is allocation within the budget for work to be undertaken with ACT Policing. It will enable them to understand how to ask questions in a way which, as I say, gets the best evidence from children. The eviden ce from the royal commission was that the statements that are provided by witnesses, if they are not able to communicate coherently and clearly, can have a significant impact on the prospect of a conviction and prosecution. 946 8.36 In response to the evidence beh ind such schemes the Committee was also told that such schemes have been operating in the UK for many years and that: There has also been work undertaken and schemes in place in New South Wales and Victoria. There have been evaluations of those schemes. Th ey have been very positive in terms of both the outcomes for the witnesses themselves and to some extent also the outcomes for the justice system in terms of providing a path through the justice system that allows for clear evidence to be given. My unders tanding is that, certainly in New South Wales, even from the point of view of defence lawyers, they could see benefits in this too for the clarity of evidence that witnesses were able to give, and assisting in some respects to manage how they prepare their cases for their defendants. 947 8.37 The Attorney -General also stated: The crimes commissioner held a forum on intermediaries here last year. It was on the concept of the scheme. We were privileged to have one of the judicial officers who works most closely with that in New South Wales come down and talk that through. I think that was quite a striking experience for all of those people who were here, 945 Ms Greenland, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 791. 946 Ms Greenland, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 792. 947 Ms Greenland, Proof Trans cript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 793.

It was quite powerful.948 8.38 When asked if the processes wi ll be trialled for other vulnerable witnesses the Directorate indicated that: Yes, certainly, the intention is to start with child witnesses in sexual abuse matters and witnesses to homicide. But there is also the scope, potentially, to expand this to a range of other vulnerable witnesses. We will be looking fairly closely initially at what the demand is for services for that group, but there is the potential then to expand to other vulnerable witnesses, which could include adult witnesses with communicatio n difficulties, for example. 949 PROTECTION OF RIGHTS (1.5) 8.39 Output 1.5, Protection of Rights, is the provision of advocacy, complaints handling, advice, community awareness raising and other services in connection with the promotion and protection of rights e specially for vulnerable members of society, through services provided by the ACT Human Rights Commission, including the Public Advocate of the ACT and Victim Support ACT. This output also includes services provided by the Privacy Commissioner. 950 MATTERS CONSIDERED 8.40 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Protection of Rights included: Victims of Crime Commissioner and Victims of Crime Charter of Rights(VOCCR);951and Privacy Commissioner's role and activities.952 KEY ISSUES VICTIMS OF CRIME CHARTER OF RIGHTS 8.41 The Committee sought advice from Minister Rattenbury, Minister for Justice, Consumer Affairs and Road Safety (the Minister), on the current status of the Victims of Crime Charter of Rights (VOCCR).

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 194 There has been a very active process of engagement with a range of community stakeholders, being led by the Victims of Crime Commissioner. For me, it has been really important to make sure that victims have a real say in how that charter is designed, what their expectations of it are and where they think things can be improved. 953 8.42 The Minister continued: .. as to your second question, yes, we would anticipate, subject to decision by government, that there would be legislation associated with the victims charter. At the moment there are governing principles for the treatment of victims of crime in the Victims of Crime Act. Those governing principles would be changed to accommodate the new descriptors in the victims charter. By way of timing, I would expect the charter to be coming for decision from government potentially later this year, with a view to having implementation in 2020. 954 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.43 The Committee notes that this matter was also raised in last year's Estimates report. Recommendation 101 8.44 The Committee recomm ends that the ACT Government ensure that, with the Human Rights Commission, a program for public consultation and input to the Victims of Crime Charter of Rights be fully developed and publicly promoted to ensure that the community (especially victims and those affected by crime) are given the best opportunity to make an input into the drafting of the final version of the Victims of Crime Charter of Rights .

We have recently undertaken further works to ensure security in the female detainees area, but the works we committed to doing have been completed.968 8.48 They were also informed that: 956 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 857- 858. 957 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, p p. 858- 859. 958 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 859. 959 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 859- 862. 960 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 862. 961 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 862- 65; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 315, answered 3 July 2019. 962 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 866- 7. 963 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 867- 8. 964 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 868- 9. 965 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 Jun e 2019, pp. 870- 1. 966 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 871- 2 967 Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 872- 3. 968 Mr Peach, Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 859. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 196 The exercise areas are accessible at the end of the unit all day. The area outside of the unit, which is the green area, at this moment in time they are getting access to that three hours per day. 969 ACCESS BY FEMALE DETAINEES AT AMC TO RESTRICTED AREA . 8.49 As a result of apparently ineffective uncertain physical access barriers, the Committee was advised of the circumstances surrounding access by three female inmates to the male area of the AMC. The exc hange between the committee and officials is quoted below: Mr Peach: On 29 April three female detainees did access a restricted area. They did not access the remand area of the prison; they accessed what we would consider an out- of-bounds area between the two different units. MRS JONES : It has been stated to me that two of those three came back fairly quickly and that one of them did not; is that correct? Mr Peach: It is correct, yes. MRS JONES : And during the period when the other detainee was out she alle gedly engaged in sexual activity with one of the male detainees; is that correct? Mr Peach: We have information that a male and a female detainee came into contact. We have nothing to support the allegation that there was sexual activity between the two. B oth detainees have been interviewed and both have refuted the claim that there was any sexual activity. We are currently finalising an internal management review of the incident to ascertain how the incident occurred and what we can do to prevent this from happening into the future. MRS JONES : While the detainees were in contact with each other, was there any period of time where they were not in view of security cameras? Mr Peach: They were not in view of the cameras for a period of approximately 14 minute s. MRS JONES : Since this issue, has a lock been put on the gate to the exercise area? Was it unlocked, or was there no lock? Mr Peach: The fence that we are talking about that the ladies scaled was nothing more than a demarcation fence. MRS JONES : They sca led it? Mr Peach: Yes. It was a pool fence, for want of better words. MRS JONES : A little fence. Mr Peach: Yes. It was purely there as a mark to stop them from accessing the area. It was never intended as a management fence. Previously they had been access ing the 969 Mr Peach, Proof Transcript of evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 859. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 197 area unsupervised. Since then, obviously, we do not allow the ladies out into the area unsupervised.970 8.50 The Committee was also told that management of AMC and Corrective Services are conducting a detailed inquiry and investigation of the circumstances and possible outcomes of any such contact, and the need to remedy problems suggested by the incident, including the placement of adequate barrier fencing, and CCTV with proper coverage.971 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.51 The Committee considers the situation and incident described to it during the hearings with Corrective Services raised two importance concerns: the need for proper fencing and barriers at AMC and the need to ensure that CCTV is adequately placed to ensure proper coverage of blind spots. Recom mendation 102 8.52 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment ensure a review is conducted by ACT Corrective Services of fencing and barriers at the Alexander Maconochie Centre to ensure compounds are safe and secure. Recommendation 103 8.53 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment ensure that provision of Close d Circuit Television cameras inside the Alexander Maconochie Centre is reviewed to identify how to ensure reduction of the current number of blind spots in the Alexander Maconochie Centre. NEW REINTEGRATION CENTRE 8.54 The Committee sought advice on the new Reintegration Centre (RC) at AMC, and was advised by Minister Rattenbury, Minister for Corrections and Justice Health (the Minister), that the RC had the following planned features: To go to the big picture, over the last couple of years we undertook a feasibility study on future accommodation needs at the AMC. As I have said publicly and as we spoke about in question time recently, through that the government made an explicit 970 Proof Transcript of E vidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 859- 60. 971 Proof Transcript of E vidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 859- 61. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 198 decisio n not to expand the high security element of the AMC but instead to put a greater emphasis on justice reinvestment. However, given how little spare capacity we have at the AMC but also the fact that at the moment everybody at the AMC is in a high security jail, we took the decision to commission the reintegration centre as an essentially low security facility. It is outside the wire. It will be built, if you know the site at all, where the transitional release centre is. It will be built in that part of the jail. 972 8.55 The Minister also indicated that: It will be 80 additional beds. We are about to commence more detailed design work whereby we will be engaging with a series of our stakeholders in workshops to talk through issues of both design and operational que stions to maximise the impact of that new facility. 973 8.56 The Committee noted the RC is costed at $35 million at present and Corrective Services further clarified that : The $35 million is actually the projected build cost. As you will be aware, we have received approximately $990,000 for the planning stage. The $35 million is the projected build cost. 974 8.57 They were also informed that the RC would include: ... an additional four units, some ancillary buildings to support the services that we will be providing, new ac commodation for administration workers there and also some refinements to the gate area there.975 8.58 When asked who would use it the Committee was informed by the Minister that: Our anticipation is that quite a few of the occupants of the new buildings would co me from within the existing AMC. We have a significant cohort of people who could well be classified as minimum security, who are either towards the end of their sentence or are at a point where the reintegration centre will work for them. Each person will be individually risk -assessed. We anticipate that a significant cohort would come from within the AMC.976 972 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 862. 973 Minister Rattenbury MLA , Proof Trans cript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 862. 974 Mr Peach, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 863. 975 Mr Peach, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 863. 976 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 863. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 199 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.59 The Committee considers that, at this planning stage, the RC should continue, given the proposed functions it will fulfil in ACT corrective services administration. It is important, however, that the Legislative Assembly be kept update d on its progress. Recommendation 104 8.60 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment , through the Minister, provide an update to the Legislative Assembly by the final sitting of 2019, on when and how the new Reintegration Centre is to operate in a location outside the perime ter of the Alexander Maconochie Centre. COURTS AND TRIBUNALS (3.1) 8.61 Output 3.1, Courts and Tribunal, provides high quality support to judicial officers and tribunal members in the ACT Courts and Tribunal and high quality services to the public using the courts and tribunal.977 8.62 The Committee heard evidence that outlined reasons for estimating and publishing timelines for determination of matters before ACT courts involving the following matters: ACT Civil and Administrative Appeals Tribunal (ACAT) workloads an d budget following 2016 review and changes;978 ACAT responsibilities for Compulsory Third Party (CTP) scheme matters;979 funding and administrative arrangements for the ACT Drug and Alcohol Court;980 time taken by ACT Courts to determine matters;981 savings - new courts public -private partnership (new courts);982and new court buildings.983 977 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements D , Justice and Community Safety Directorate , p. 11. 978 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 775- 776. 979 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 776- 777. 980 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 786- 90. 981 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 793- 95. 982 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 795. 983 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 795. -796 SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 200 KEY ISSUES ACT CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL (ACAT) WORKLOADS AND BUDGET FOLLOWING 2016 REVIEW AND CHANGES 8.63 The Committee asked for advice on the extent of any impacts tha t resulted from the change to limits on civil disputes ($10,000 to $25,000) in 2016, including any consequent change to ACAT workloads and budgets. 8.64 In response, the committee was advised that; There has been an increase in the work of ACAT, but I think the increased jurisdiction really provided the tribunal with an opportunity to revisit some of its procedures, in particular to have a more nuanced approach to the proportionate management of matters. The tribunal introduced different tiers of managing but with an emphasis on alternative dispute resolution and conferencing at an early stage. We are trying to resolve matters by agreement or to at least focus the particular issues in dispute before they go before a member. It has led to an increase in w ork, but equally it has been matched by us being a bit clever about how those matters are dealt with. 984 8.65 When the Committee raised concerns that the necessary resources had not been provided, they were advised that the changes: ...coincided with the restructu re, as you have alluded to. The tribunal now has a body of full- time members which provide the president with some flexibility to manage the work \u2014particular members who have been assigned broad responsibility for different areas of jurisdiction. And of cou rse we have a pool of sessional members whom we can bring in as required. We are just going through a large number of those members whose current appointments are coming to an end. We are going through a process of renewal, in consultation with government about the make- up of the tribunal into the future.985 ACAT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR COMPULSORY THIRD PARTY (CTP ) MATTERS 8.66 The Committee asked for advice on the changes that will be necessary in ACAT following passage of legislation to establish a new compulsory third party (CTP) insurance scheme in the ACT; a change which will mean a considerable workload increase - in the long term - for ACAT as the tribunal responsible for CTP litigation. The Committee was advised that: From the midyear review we wer e given some funding to engage a legal officer to start working through the processes with the president. We also have some money to look 984 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 776. 985 Mr Kellow, Pr oof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 776. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 201 at what enhancements may need to be made to the case management system to support that new jurisdiction. There was a f air bit of movement with the legislation as it was being developed, and then through the Assembly, so while we were watching closely the real work has only really started in the last four weeks. We have someone now working through that. While ultimately i t is a matter for the president as to how the business will be managed, it is my expectation that we will follow what we have done in the civil area\u2014 to have heavy use of conferencing and triaging to assess which matters may be able to be resolved quickly, preferably through some sort of alternative dispute resolution mechanism, through to those which may require a hearing before a member. We need to work through the legislation. There are different limits on the evidence that can be considered. There are so me areas of the jurisdiction where the tribunal is really reviewing that same material that was reviewed by the insurer and their internal review processes. There will be some new evidence, so we need to work through what guidance we can give to applicants coming to the tribunal in terms of what material they need to present and to make clear the parameters around that review process. 986 8.67 In the context of ACAT 's workload the Committee asked about the capacity of ACAT to deal with CTP matters involving medical treatments in a timely manner and were informed that: We have a number of areas within ACAT which are time sensitive and the president is well aware of those. We will get that greater knowledge as we work through the legislation, but we are very conscious of the need to have matters resolved quickly. That is why we are looking at the use of alternative dispute resolution and other mechanisms that can try and streamline that process. 987 8.68 The Attorney -General also indicated that: There is $4.3 million in this y ear's budget to help deliver the changes to the motor accident insurance scheme, specifically in the area of ACAT. I met with the president of ACAT recently, who is working on the appropriate way of recruiting new members to ACAT. A number of presidential members have terms that expire soon, so there is a process. I have been speaking to the president about making sure that ACAT is well resourced for those new changes. 988 8.69 In response to additional concerns from the Committee that 'the insurance companies woul d effectively be represented because their employees would be sufficiently qualified and 986 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 776. 987 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 777. 988 Minister Ramsay, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 776- 777. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 202 therefore this would make it very unfair for the normal person' who is not represented989 the Committee was informed: There is always debate about the role of representa tion within tribunals \u2014and courts for that matter. Ultimately the tribunal has very broad powers and discretions to try and achieve the best outcome for the applicants and the respondents. Information will be provided to help guide people through and the re gistrars will make sure people understand the role of the tribunal and the sorts of material it can consider. For a lot of the matters it will be relatively straightforward. Some may have greater complexity. There are always different views as to the poin t that legal or other representation assists that process. We are keen to have a process which is quick and fair, particularly in those matters which are time sensitive, where they relate to treatment options and so on. 990 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.70 The Committee is conscious that the introduction of a new and quite different scheme of CTP insurance coverage in the ACT, including new avenues for any resolution of claims in the courts, means that the tribunal involved (in this case ACAT) requires a high degree of realistic planning and funding to ensure matters are satisfactorily dealt with. Recommendation 105 8.71 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government review the resourcing needs of ACT Civil and Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 2020, in light of Compulsory Third Party insurance changes and the increased demand on ACT Civil and Administrative Appeals Tribunal resources. TIME TAKEN BY ACT COURTS TO DETERMINE MATTERS 8.72 The Committee sought advice on what appeared - at 12 months - to be longer than reasonable time estimates for the determination of cases in the courts of the ACT. 8.73 The Committee was advised that: The 12 months is really picked up from the international framework of court excellence, which draws upon all of the jurisdictions here; it has members from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Singapore courts and so on. Other courts use slightly different parameters. The Federal Court of Australia uses 18 months as its benchmark. 989 Ms Le Couteur MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 777. 990 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 777. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 203 The important thing is to see how quickly matters are progressing. As the statistics show, the bulk of the matters are being done within that 12 months. It depends very much on the nature of the matters. Things can ebb and flow in terms of complexity. It has been noted before that the criminal work of the Sup reme Court in recent years has become far more complicated than it used to be, with the nature of the offences \u2014 homicides, serious assaults and so on. It is about trying to put forward a measure. If we were achieving well over 100 per cent for 12 months, i t would suggest there is a lot of stretch in 12 months and we would want to try to set a more ambitious target. But it is really to give some indication about timeliness in 12 months, which seems to be the accepted standard in most jurisdictions at the mom ent. 991 8.74 The Committee was also informed that this was the first year that the indicators had been in place and indicated that: The Chief Justice was keen to set the targets for the Supreme Court with a fair bit of stretch. The actual information that I had g iven her, for example, for the civil was 55 per cent of matters being resolved in 12 months. That was as at 2016 -17. To be frank, I was a bit nervous when she said 85 per cent, but it is the stretch that she wanted to put in; so we are working hard to move towards that As is the case with all indicators and accountability matters in the budget papers and annual reports, we do review them to make sure they are real, that they are useful and that they indicate how the courts and tribunal are travelling. Where appropriate, we revise those indicators. We will have a couple of years tracking against the current targets, but we would certainly be keen to review that to see how we are going and to make sure they have some meaning\u2014 that there is some sort of benchmar k that we are measuring against.992 8.75 The Attorney -General also informed the Committee that the aim of legal administration, with regard to time taken to resolve legal cases, includes the use in the ACT of such methods and approaches as criminal case conferenc ing: Again, with the criminal case conferencing, obviously, not only is there a time saving that comes through that but there is a significant flow -on resourcing impact, a savings impact, for example, with the DPP and others. Obviously, if you are not need ing to move to anywhere near the same number of trials, that frees up prosecutorial, or in other cases defence, resources to be able to move through. It becomes de facto budget savings or at least enables a reallocation of resources and takes some signific ant pressures off the DPP and others. The marked steps up that have happened in the last 991 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 793. 992 Mr Kellow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 794- 795. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 204 few years and the efficiency of the courts have had a great impact on the courts themselves; also, there have been those flow- on effects in other areas.993 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.76 The Committee is aware of community concerns, often echoed by the profession, that matters coming before the ACT courts should be resolved more quickly than they are, and notes that setting timelines for resolution of matters can lend support to the v iew that such timelines as 12 months simply become the accepted norm and are taken up as performance goals. 8.77 The committee considers this matter should continue to be a focus for Government. Recommendation 106 8.78 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnmen t continue to work to reduce the delays in determining ACT court proceedings. NEW COURTS BUILDING 8.79 The committee discussed the progress in stage 2 of the new courts building project, and its likely completion date. 8.80 Advice received by the Committee was that: Stage 2 commenced once we moved into stage 1 in October last year. It is progressing well. It will be completed in three component parts, the first of which will be in a week or two. That is the transfer of the existing custody operations from under the Magistrates Court into part of the new custody environment in the base of the old Supreme Court building. The second completion event is the whole of the heritage building being refurbished, which includes the drug and alcohol court and the additional non-jury court. The third part is the reconfiguration of the space that custody will vacate under the Magistrates Court. 994 8.81 It was also indicated that: The progress at the moment is tracking in accordance with the contractor's program, which has the complet ion of the heritage building refurb in October- November and the total completion of stage 2 works by the end of the calendar year. 995 993 Minister Ramsay, MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 795. 994 Mr Esau, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 796. 995 Mr Esau, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 796.

The Committee, while welcoming the advice set out above, regards the completion of this important project as a matter to be pursued. Recommendation 107 8.83 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment , bearing in mind the ongoing dela y in completing the new courts building, prepare a revised and updated timeline on the project, to be provided to the Legislative Assembly at least once each quarter until the project is completed. EMERGENCY SERVICES (4.1) 8.84 Output 4.1, Emergency Services, provides the following: Prevention and Mitigation: Measures taken in advance of an emergency aimed at decreasing or eliminating its impact on the community and the environment. Preparedness: Measures to ensure that, should and emergency occur, communities, resources and services are capable of responding to and coping with the effects. Response: Strategies and services to control, limit or modify an emergency to reduce its consequences. Recovery: Strategies and services to return the ACT Emergency Services Agency to a state of preparedness after emergency situations and to assist with community recovery. 996 MATTERS CONSIDERED 8.85 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Emergency Services included: roles for new firefighters and number of firefighters;997 figures on possible retirements for fire service;998 new appointments to the ambulance service;999 996 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements D, Justice and Community Safety Directorate , p. 12. 997 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 826- 827. 998 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 827- 829; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 222, answered 5 July 2019. 999 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 828- 829, Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 306, answered 5 July 2019.

They were informed that: The additional firefighters who will be recruited as part of colleges 42 and 43 will primarily be to replace front -line staff who are retiring. After their 20 -week training program \u2014the first college will commence next February \u2014they will join their colleges at front -line fire stations across Canberra.1007 8.87 In the context of recruitment the Committee then asked how they were looking to bring more women into firefighting and were informed that: The ESA has a women in emergency services strategy. We have a target of recruiting 50 per cent men and 50 per cent women, should those candidates meet the required standard. So far we have not got to 50 -50. With the three recruit colleges that we ha ve commenced since that strategy was put in place, we have managed to recruit 25 per cent women. There is room for improvement but it is still a lot better than we have achieved in the past. We are going to be doubling our efforts to get more women in colleges 42 and 43. 1008 1000 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 829- 834; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 314, answered 2 July 2019. 1001 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 834. 1002 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 834- 837. 1003 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 840- 841; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 310, answered 15 Ju ly 2019. 1004 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 837- 838; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 311, answered 5 July 2019. 1005 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 842- 843; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 307, answered 5 July 2019. 1006 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 841- 843; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 309, answered 5 July 2019. 1007 Mr Brown, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 827. 1008 Mr Brown, Proof Transcript of Evi dence , 25 June 2019, p. 827. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 207 8.88 When pressed as to the modelling of retirement in the current cohort of firefighters, ACT Fire and Rescue indicated that: We have. It is difficult to get exact numbers because many people who are about to leave the organisation do not make their intentions clear. However, we believe that once we recruit these additional two colleges, by the end of 2020 we should be very close to our funded establishment.1009 8.89 Further to this they explained that 'funded establishment' is the 'number of positions . We are funded to fill all our front -line positions. In the case of Fire and Rescue, it is 338 officers and firefighters.'1010 Recommendation 108 8.90 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment ensure there is an ongoing program of recruiting additional firefighters in the ACT to ensure the funded establishment of personnel is met. PRIORITISATION OF AMB ULANCE RESPONSES 8.91 The Committee noted that often the priority rating given to a callout can b e changed and asked how that occurs. They were advised By Minister Gentleman, Minister for Police and Emergency Services (the Minister), that not only can the call centre change the priority but so can the paramedic crew: We have looked at the functionalit y of the ability for them to look at priority changes on their way out. Current practice is for priority one cases to be initially graded by the call taker; that is in the clinical dispatch guidelines. The case may be subsequently re - graded by a paramedic communication centre clinician. Under the Australian road rules an ambulance crew must consider whether, based on the information provided by the Comcen, the case is reasonable to treat as a priority one. If the ambulance crew do not consider the informat ion reasonable, they are required to seek clarification from the Comcen. If there is no additional information, the crew is able to re -grade the case to priority two. 1011 8.92 Following this explanation there was extensive discussion about the practicalities of t his approach and the full conversation has been replicated below for completeness: 1009 Mr Brown, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 827. 1010 Mr Brown, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 827. 1011 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 834. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 208 Mr Wren: In respect of the first part of the question, if the clinician believes that the case should remain as a priority one, then it will remain as a priority one. There is a capacity for the clinician to override the crew's decision. But generally speaking, this \u2014 MRS JONES : But aren't they generally off to the next case by that stage? Mr Wren: No, not necessarily. That does not happen all that often. The main reason that this happens is that the case has gone out to the crew as a priority one based on the first allocation of priority, if you like. The crew have seen this. They have started the case as a priority one and they have read further information on the mobile data terminal and decided that it may not necessarily meet the criteria. They will then check back. If there is no additional information, they are permitted to downgrade the case. MRS JONES : So they are in disagreement with the clinician. Mr Wren: Sorry? MRS JONES: So they are in disagreement with the clinician? Mr Wren: No, they are in agreement with the clinician if\u2014 MRS JONES: So it is done in consultation with the clinician \u2014 Mr Wren: Yes. MRS JONES: that the priority one gets downgraded; always? Mr Wren: Yes, unless the clinician does not involve themselves in it, which occasionally they will not. MRS JONES: Explain to me how the clinician could be not involving themselves in a downgrade. Mr Wren: That may be the situation where they are looking at ano ther case or talking to another caller. MRS JONES: So they are on to the next case. Then it is up to the drivers \u2014 ACTING CHAIR: Paramedics. MRS JONES: Yes, okay. Mr Wren: Yes, they are all paramedics. MRS JONES : who are on their way to a case to downgrade it \u2014 Mr Wren: Yes. MRS JONES: and the clinician may not see that because they may be busy doing something else\u2014 just to clarify. Mr Wren: That is correct. It can happen like that occasionally. However, can I also say that the crews are able to upg rade cases as well? That does not happen as frequently \u2014 MRS JONES: No, I am sure it does not. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 209 Mr Wren: but it does happen.1012 8.93 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice the Committee was informed that the number of Priority 1 cases excluded from reporting b ecause the priority was changed is 891 for 2017 -18 and 907 for 2018 -19 (up to 25 June 2019).1013 8.94 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice the Committee was informed that In 2015, the ACT Ambulance Service (ACT AS) conducted an analysis of cases re -graded by ambulance crews after initial Priority 1 allocation. The internal work was led by the current Chief Officer of ACT AS, who advises that the following information was considered: Across several months in the latter half of 2015, 30 cases were selected at random. Case information sent to the crew was analysed, and an assessment made on whether, based on this information, the decision to re -grade might represent a risk to the patient. For the cases selected, no risks were identified as a result of the decis ion to re - grade the case.1014 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.95 The Committee considers detail on these events should be collected as data for future use by the ambulance service. Recommendation 109 8.96 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure the Emergency Servi ces Agency collect data on when emergency incident priority classifications are upgraded or downgraded and that the officers making decisions to upgrade or downgrade priority classifications are recorded. AMBULANCE LEVIES 8.97 During its hearings with the Emergency Services Agency (ESA) the Committee discussed the level of ambulance levies in the ACT, and the collection of fees for service from ambulance users. 1012 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 835- 836. 1013 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 312, answered 5 July 2019. 1014 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 312, answered 5 July 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 210 8.98 The Committee was told that exemptions and waivers of the payment of ambulance fees are provided for and extended in a large range of cases where an ambulance user is unable to afford (or is not insured for) the fee. We do actually issue exemptions, if that is what your question is around. When people incur a fee for the Ambulance Service, there are e xemptions, and we do issue exceptions, especially in some hardship cases.1015 8.99 The Ambulance Service detailed how requests for exemption and waiver are dealt with: There is a range of reasons. If it is financial stress, there is a process that is followed wher eby people are offered an opportunity to pay in instalments over a period of time, if that can be facilitated. Beyond that, if people really are genuinely experiencing severe financial hardship and can demonstrate that, generally by a third -party report from a support service or something of that nature that will be considered very favourably.1016 8.100 The Committee were informed in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice that 'the amount of ambulance user charges issued for the 2018 -19 financial year to end May 20 19 is $4.48 million.' 1017 8.101 The Committee emphasised that there was a cohort of the ACT Community who can't afford private insurance but are not eligible for Centrelink but still have to pay the levy. The questions how someone it that situation should have to p ay what is to be $982 from 1 July 2019. 8.102 The Minister advised the committee that: Those who are in any financial hardship have a provision within the Ambulance Service to seek a waiver, as we have heard. There are a number of groups within our community th at do not have to pay for the Ambulance Service: school students, pensioners or concession card holders, people in incidents involving motor vehicles on an ACT road or road related area, good Samaritans, persons in lawful custody, minors under care orders, deceased persons, victims of domestic violence, and people in financial hardship or exceptional circumstances. 1018 8.103 The Directorate further stated that: As we said before through the chief officer, there are arrangements to pay it off over time if they have a capacity. But there is a whole range of exceptional circumstances including just the discretion of the opinion of the chief officer where he can waive the fee. 1015 Mr Pryce, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 830. 1016 Mr Wren, Proof T ranscript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 830- 831. 1017 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 314, answered 2 July 2019. 1018 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 831. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMB LY) BILL 2019- 2020 211 I assure the committee that ACTAS has a heart. In the ones I have seen where people have sough t exemption for various reasons, we have offered a waiver or have worked with them to lessen their burden. At the end of the day, ACTAS provides a service to support people at a time of critical need, and I want to make it clear that this is definitely not a decision at that point of providing the emergency service or getting them to treatment. 1019 8.104 They went on to also inform the Committee that: To pick up on what I said before, we will have a look at the website wording again and see whether we can improve th at to make it clearer. The intent is not around crippling people with financial burden and hardship after they have suffered some health emergency. Equally, we will take on board the views expressed and look again at the notices we provide to people follow ing an ambulance service to make sure that they understand that there is a provision if exceptional circumstances exist. I am pretty confident that that is already there, but we will look again at whether we can make that more prominent or more upfront in the face of people so they do not get bill shock just after they have just been through a medical emergency and probably been to hospital. 1020 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.105 The Committee considers the matter of the affordability of the ambulance levy be given serious con sideration by Government, as the current arrangement regarding ambulance fees needs review. Recommendation 1 10 8.106 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment undertake an analysis of the socioeconomic status of people who are required pay the current ambulance fee. Recommendation 1 11 8.107 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government consider discontinuing charging an ambulance fee to ambulance users who do not have private insurance. 1019 Mr Pryce, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 832. 1020 Mr Pryce, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 833. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 212 Recommendation 1 12 8.108 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment ensure the ACT Ambulance Service review its current public information regarding financial exemption applications from payment of ambulance services to ensure that public information is accurate. AMBULANCE CREWING LEVELS 8.109 During its hearings with the Emergency Services Agency the Committee discussed the budget allocation for scoping service delivery and models of care for the ACT Ambulance service and were info rmed that: The proposal is that we will engage the services of an experienced consultant to look at some options that we can implement, rather than just sending two paramedics in a large truck to every case. There has been quite a lot of work done intersta te, and we would like to leverage off that.1021 The use of the consultant is to allow us to have an evidence -based model and to inform our decision -making, optimise the number of ambulance personnel we have, and make sure we provide the right crewing levels t o the right jobs.1022 8.110 In this context the Committee asked what the minimum crew levels are currently allocated for each shift and were informed that: This was the subject of considerable change and review over recent years. Rather than having an absolute, set number, we moved to a model that allows a little bit more flexibility. The reality is that we still aim to have a minimum of 10 ambulance crews on, as a minimum. The minimum is considered to be an overnight number, and during the course of the day we put additional crews on to meet demand because the demand increases across the peak of the day.1023 8.111 In response to a query in relation to how many shifts have fallen below minimum crew level the Committee was advised of the following in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice:1024 Month Number of Shifts Number Below Minimum Crewing Percentage of Shifts Belo w Minimum Crewing October 2018 62 8 12.9% 1021 Mr Wren, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 840. 1022 Ms Whelan, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 841. 1023 Mr Wren, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 840. 1024 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 310, answered 15 July 2019.

These services include the protection of persons and property, crime prevention and detection, maintaining peace and good order and the enforcement of ACT laws.1025 1025 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements D , Justice and Community Safety Directorate , p. 12. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 214 MATTERS CONSIDERED 8.114 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to ACT Policing included: public safety in Canberra;1026 additional police officers (Sworn and unsworn);1027 crime -related community safety statistics;1028 police station upgrades;1029 ACT Policing master accommodation and services plan;1030 ACT Policing Futures program;1031and roadside dr ug test capabilities.1032 KEY ISSUES ADDITIONAL POLICE OFFICERS 8.115 The Committee was advised by the Minister that: Through this budget we have begun transitioning towards a police services model for the ACT community with the recruitment of over 60 new police personnel over the coming years. That model will see ACT Policing deliver a more visible, connected and efficient police service. The new investment will support policing to deliver a system - wide approach towards crime prevention, disruption and response act ivities supporting our efforts to reduce, of course, our recidivism target of 25 per cent by 2025. 1033 8.116 The Committee then asked how many will be sworn officers and was informed that: I think, of the 60 -odd FTE that we talked about, by the end the vast majority will be operational and the vast majority of those will be sworn police officers. At this point I could not say exactly how many because there will be particular positions that might be either a sworn police officer or an unsworn officer in partic ular skill sets. But the vast majority will be.1034 1026 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 844. 1027 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 844- 845; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 304, answered 12 July 2019. 1028 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 846- 848. 1029 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 849- 852. 1030 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 851- 852. 1031 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 852- 853; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 302, answered 3 July 2019. 1032 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 853- 854. 1033 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of E vidence , 25 June 2019, p. 844. 1034 Assistant Commissioner Johnson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 844. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRI ATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 215 8.117 When pressed as to how this would be broken down the Committee were informed that 'it is about 68 or 69 FTE in total. I would say probably 60 would be sworn' and that specific skills sets would be a consider ation:1035 I think the best example would be operationalised intelligence. One of the first things we are working on this year is to set up the operationalised intelligence centre, which basically gives us 24/7 intelligence capability and support of operation s. They could, and most of them probably will, come from the sworn ranks. Some of them might be recruited externally as specialist intelligence people who may not be. Some of the exact numbers will be a bit dependent on opportunity, who might be interested and other things. There is a good example. At least one of them is planned to be a psychologist. That will be one who probably will not be a police officer. Again, it is hard to be sure on the figures but I would have thought certainly into the 50s, if no t up into the 60s, will be sworn police officers. 1036 8.118 The Assistant Commissioner also indicated that: The final year of the budget measure will see the full number. It will build from here on through. This year, I think you can see in the budget lines, it is about $2.2 million, which obviously will be less in terms of people, but it gives us a chance to plan and be sure that we have got ourselves ready for future recruitment. Obviously to be ready and have recruits come online from even next financial year we will have to have them in the college in January. 1037 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.119 The Committee notes the significant additional staffing proposed in the 2019 -20 Budget for ACT Policing, and notes the advice provided on the breakup of new and prosed sworn officers for that period. The Committee considers clarity as to the breakdown of th e figures regarding officer numbers is required. Recommendation 1 14 8.120 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment provides clarity on the breakdown of the number of additional swo rn, operational and professional ACT Policing personnel that will be employed under the initiatives contained in the 2019 -20 ACT Budget. 1035 Assistant Commissioner Johnson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 845. 1036 Assistant Commissioner Johnson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 845. 1037 Assistant Commissioner Johnson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 846. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 216 ACT POLICING FUTURES PROGRAM 8.121 In response to a query about the completion of the ACT Policing Futures Program the Commi ttee were informed that: I guess there are a number of parts to futures, much of which has already been delivered. An example is the unified operations communications phone. The platforms that it provides us with are being delivered as we speak. There are some other things that are already being delivered. We are on the futures journey already. In respect of the transformation to the services model, quite a bit of planning is already in place. But we are now at the point where, without the certainty of fun ding and planning over the next four years, yes, we are at the point where we have a broad plan, absolutely, but it is now just delivering it, to be fair. 1038 8.122 In response to a Question Taken on Notice the Committee was advised that the Final Report that analy ses ACT Policing's future operating environment could not be provided as it 'remains Sensitive: Cabinet.'1039 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.123 The Committee highlights the importance of development of ACT Policing Futures Program. The information provided to the Committee requires some updating for completeness and timeliness. Recommendation 1 15 8.124 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment provide the Legisl ative Assembly with an update on the progress, findings and recommendations of the ACT Policing Futures Program by the final sit ting period of 2019. ROADSIDE DRUG TESTING CAPABILITIES 8.125 The Committee sought advice on the current model and effectiveness for roadside drug testing by ACT Policing. The Committee was informed that: Drug testing is carried out using basically a saliva swab in a scientific process that allows that to happen. Certain police officers are trained in the use of it. Not everyone is trained. It is done on the side of the road; it takes longer than a breath t est. We did, up to 31 March this financial year, 766. We think that by the end of the year it will 1038 Assistant Commissioner Johnson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 852. 1039 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 302, answered 2 July 2019.

And that is a step up from the year before, which was abo ut 600.1040 8.126 The Assistant Commissioner further indicated that: It is primarily [conducted by] traffic operations, and as people come and go, with the training, they do not lose it. If they go back into general duties, for example, or somewhere else, we will inevitably have more people trained. There is a cost that goes with the tests. We have to be reasonably prudent with the use of the test. They are certainly more expensive than doing alcohol testing. There is more prudence around their use, but, yes, we wil l have more people trained. 1041 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.127 The Committee considers roadside drug testing to be of major importance in road safety and security, as well as important in drug use interception and prevention. Recommendation 1 16 8.128 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment provide greater resources to ACT Policing to review and improve roadside drug testing capabilities.

Each Commissioner is appointed as an independent statutory office hoIder with different areas of authority. Section 13 of the Huma n Rights Commission Act requires that commission members act in a way that promotes the collegiate nature of the Commission. The current Victims of Crime Commissioner is a lawyer and frequently speaks publicly and advocates for particular issues or outcom es in her individual capacity. The Commission does not keep specific records of when individual Commissioners take 'divergent' views on particular issues. In terms of human rights, all ACT Government agencies, as Public Authorities under the Human Rights Act 2004, must act and make decisions consistently with human rights. Section 15 of the Human Rights Commission Act reinforces this obligation for Commissioners. All Commissioners strive to fulfil their duties compatibly with human rights, including in the public positions they take on key issues. The co -location of statutory office holders within the Commission provides a dynamic opportunity for the exploration of challenging policy issues. The Commission's success in advocating for law and service reform is often due to its ability to speak with authority on critical issues, putting a position informed by a diverse range of expertise. This is a practical strength of the Commission structure. The Commission's public 1052 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 817- 819. 1053 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 817- 81; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 300, answered 1 July 2019. 1054 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, pp. 817- 819. 1055 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 820. 1056 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 820- 1. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 220 position on issues is enhanced and infor med by the expertise and experience of all Commissioners, and is not developed or determined by a single Commissioner or the President in isolation. On some occasions, Commissioners choose to provide an independent position rather than contribute to a col lective Commission statement. A recent exam pie of this is the separate submissions from the PACYPC (Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner) and the Discrimination, Disability, Health Services Commissioner to the 'Our Booris, Our Way' c onsultation. There are also Commission submissions where a specific Commissioner takes the lead in developing a Commission statement, such as the Victim of Crime Commissioner's work on the Commission's August 2018 submission to the ACT Government's Victims Charter of Rights Consultation. Consensus positions are developed with collective input and agreement, of Commissioners. Commissioners retain the right to exercise an independent view where a consensus view cannot be reached. The Victims of Crime Commiss ioner speaks freely and independently on issues as they arise, and contributes to joint positions as she considers appropriate. 1057 OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES 8.136 The Office of the Inspector of Correctional Services is established to provide independent oversight of ACT Correctional and Youth Justice facilities, focusing on continual improvement and prevention of ill -treatment.

The prima ry purpose of the Commission is to provide vulnerable and disadvantages Australians with access to justice through a range of legal aid services. These services are delivered through in -house legal, paralegal and non -legal staff and private legal practitio ners.1063 MATTERS CONSIDERED 8.139 The Committee discussed the following matters with the Legal Aid Commission: effect of reduction in Legal Aid reserves;1064 elder Abuse;1065 establishment and funding of Older Persons ACT Legal Service (OPALS);1066 funding affected change s to Safer families and domestic violence services (also discussed under Public Prosecutions, Policy Advice and Justice Programs and CSD) ;1067 impact of the new Drug and Alcohol Court;1068 and clients with disabilities.1069 KEY ISSUES EFFECT OF REDUCTION IN LEGAL AID RESERVES 8.140 The Committee sought advice on the level of funding overall for Legal Aid, and the effect of reductions in Legal Aid reserves 8.141 The Committee was advised by Legal Aid that: The cash reserves is an ongoing significant issue for us.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 222 that is nearly half our resources. So, yes, there is a real issue for the board of commissioners. We have had a range of discussions about what that level should be, and some advice also in relation to that. The figure of around $4 million in cash reserves seemed to be appropriate for a whole range of re asons. We are struggling to maintain that. There is a variety of reasons for that, partly the more recent reduction in funding from the statutory interest account, which is run by the Law Society, although that has come good in this past financial year, th ankfully. In our current year, we are looking at around breaking even. But the prospect for the out years is not looking promising. It is increasing from about $500,000 deficits to up to about $700,000 deficits in some of the out years. 1070 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.142 The Committee is concerned that the growth in demand, and the development of new areas of focus involving domestic violence and rights and protections for older persons can only result in greater pressure on Legal Aid funds and reserves. Recommendation 1 17 8.143 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government urgently work with Legal Aid ACT and its Board of Commissioners to ensure its cash reserves and operating deficits are sustainable. FUNDING AFFECTED CHANGES TO SAFER FAMILIES AND DO MESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES 8.144 Similar concerns arose for the Committee in relation to the considerable reductions to Legal Aid in relation to front -line services in the domestic violence service. They noted that there was 'changes to the budget around the safer families program. Some of them seem to affect legal aid directly. There is a reduction of $313,000 in 2020 -21, another reduction of $321,000 in 2021- 22 and another reduction of $329,000 in 2022 -23.' 1071 8.145 The Committee expressed concerns that there appeared to be a high chance that there would be a reduction in FTE staff for an essential element of Legal Aid's support for clients. 8.146 Legal Aid agreed that it 'would have a big impact on our clients' and advised the Committee that: 1070 Dr Boersig, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 803. 1071 Mrs Jones MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 804. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 223 We have got a year to discuss this. I have met with the attorney. The case around the needs of front -line services is very well made. We have got the data to support it. I am hoping that whilst the money is no longer in the levy money it is found elsewhere in the budget. Thankfully we have got a year to try to negotiate that. The stats are very strong. 1072 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.147 Bearing in mind the loss of frontline staff at Legal Aid ACT and bearing in mind the serious impact this may have on large number of predominantly women clients, resourcing this area of support for persons in need, particularly those subject to domestic violence, is a matter of high priority. The Committee is concerned that Legal Aid's funding difficulty will not be recognised and overcome in a timely manner. Recommendation 1 18 8.148 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government conduct an urgent review of the effect of reducing funding to the Legal Aid Commission so as to at least maintain current funding in support of staff dealing with domestic violence matters. ESTABLISHMENT AND FUNDING OF OLDER PERSONS ACT LEGAL SERVICE (OPALS) 8.149 The Committee were informed about the status of the Older Persons ACT Legal Service (OPALS) and were advised that: The statistics around that are proving the dramatic need for assistance in that area. I think that that is just tapping the issues around elder abuse and needs of people over 65. Clearly, we are going to, around Australia and particularly in the ACT, given our demographics, have to address that issue more thoroughly. The OPALS service was a welco me response by the government. We have developed that. We have now got a full-time officer involved in that from the beginning of this year.1073 8.150 In relation to the number of calls the service receives, the Committee was advised that; We took over what was kno wn as the APRIL line at the beginning of the year. I think annually they were getting between 80 and 100. We are now getting well over 400 this year. I will get the exact details, but that is my recollection of it. That is fantastic because it means that the message is getting out to people.1074 1072 Dr Boersig, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 805. 1073 Dr Boersig, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 804. 1074 Dr Boersig, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 804. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 224 8.151 The Committee was also informed that Legal Aid had received great support from ACT Libraries in relation to the OPALS program: I would like in that context to put on record the cooperation of the libraries. We now work with them on their mobile service so that some of our material is going out with them in their mobile libraries to people who are stuck at home. There was a bookmark developed. Carol Benda, who is here, developed this bookmark. That has just been patented by the Australian Human Rights Commission.1075 COMMITTEE COMMENT 8.152 The Committee draws the attention of the Legislative Assembly to the development of OPALS and considers that priority is given to the service by the ACT Government. Recommendation 1 19 8.153 The Commi ttee recommends that the ACT Government ensure the Older Persons ACT Legal Service be reviewed in 2020 to ensure it is adequately resourced with the increasing demand for its services. PUBLIC TRUSTEE AND GUARDIAN FOR THE ACT 8.154 The Public Trustee and Guardian (PTG) provides rights, choices, security and justice for all people in the ACT community.1076 MATTERS CONSIDERED 8.155 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Public Trustee and Guardian included: risk management;1077 role of P TG in tenancy es where family;1079 GreaterGood;1080 Self-funding model;1081and 1075 Dr Boersig, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 25 June 2019, p. 804. 1076 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements D , Justice and Community Safety Directorate , p. 77. 1077 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 813- 4. 1078 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 813- 4. 1079 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 813- 4. 1080 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 814- 5. 1081 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 815- 6. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 225 Rates of return on funds held and invested.1082 KEY ISSUES GREATER GOOD 8.156 The Committee asked about why the trust fund GreaterGood was set up and what it is intended to ac hieve. They were advised by the PTG that: ...it was set up by the Public Trustee and Guardian in 2003. I think it is true to say that immediately prior to that, the Public Trustee and Guardian had been appointed as trustee for the ACT bushfire recovery appea l. Looking back on that, I think it was evident that the Public Trustee and Guardian had all of the assets and mechanisms in - house to establish itself as what the taxation office calls a public ancillary fund. A public ancillary fund is also a deductable g ift for a recipient category 2 and a registered charity. With some consultation with the community and with the department at the time, the Public Trustee and Guardian went ahead and established itself as a foundation with all of those accreditations. It was primarily set up to address a shortfall when conducting will interviews with clients. Very often the question of charity or philanthropy will come up in a will interview. Either they will promote the question or we do. People will seek advice on what i s a... good mechanism, a better mechanism, than just throwing cash at a charity. Essentially, GreaterGood is an endowment fund. It retains the capital; it invests the funds for growth; and it distributes the net income \u2014so net of fees \u2014that we pay external fun d managers every year. I think it is true to say that we have distributed about $10.5 million to charities operating in the ACT since 2003. We have in the order of $21 million in assets in GreaterGood at the moment. 1083 8.157 The Committee was also advised that the decision about who the fund go es to is 'totally directed by the testator...or settled'1084and in instances where the body they wanted the funds to go to no longer existed 'it is a standard provision in that deed that the board \u2014the Public Trustee and Guardian G reaterGood board \u2014will make a decision based around the requirement that it should go to a like charity.'1085 8.158 In that context the Committee asked if it was possible for people to donate to GreaterGood without specifying where the money is to go and were advise d that: 1082 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 815- 6. 1083 Mr Taylor, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 815. 1084 Mr Taylor, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 815. 1085 Mr Taylor, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 815- 816. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 226 It can do so, yes, although the nature of GreaterGood is that it is a low cost, low budget organisation distributing most of its benefit. So the board does not see itself as having a role in determining social need or good. Generally, the conversat ion would be that we would like you to distribute it, for example, for rural education. As to how that might be done, that would be a lot easier for the board to determine then a blanket cause. 1086 INTESTATE MATTERS WHE RE THERE IS NO FAMIL Y 8.159 The Committee asked what happens when a private rental tenant dies intestate, with no relatives and were advised that: The Public Trustee and Guardian is not automatically the person who undertakes the administration of estates or intestate estates. We may. That may happen through the courts. Generally speaking, we have quite a bit of that going on with the ACT housing trust; we work very closely with ACT Housing. Where you have a tenant who has died and does not have a representative appointed, the question is: how a re those assets dealt with on the person's death? There has been a recent case involving that which highlighted that we do not have an automatic role in dealing with people in that situation. 1087 8.160 In this context the Committee asked why the ACT Police needed the authorisation from the Public Trustee in such circumstances and were told that: There is an arrangement with ACT Policing that they will call us when there is what is commonly called a police call- out. If there was a death under unknown circumstances that might be subject to a coronial, they will call us to do things like secure the premises and see whether there was information around relating to family. There might be a will, et cetera. We go along and do that, but we do not necessarily administer the estate. There is a legal line drawn between doing that and intermeddling in an estate.1088 8.161 Further to this the Committee was informed that: I should preface that by saying that we do, very often, administer the estates of people who die intestate, on appointm ent by the court, or we can voluntarily seek to administer the estate ourselves. And there are some very difficult situations along the lines that we have perhaps alluded to. But the reality is that the legislation does not make it a responsibility of the Public Trustee and Guardian to administer the estates where there is nobody there to do that or they have not left a will. It even goes a step further: there are quite often situations where families will not bury their own family 1086 Mr Taylor, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 816. 1087 Mr Taylor, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 814. 1088 Mr Taylor, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 814. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 227 because of the cost. We h ave had a number of those situations during the year, where we have been urged to take on the burial of a family member where the other members of the family would not do so.1089 8.162 When asked if changes to the law were needed in order to clarify the lines of re sponsibility in such situations the Committee were told that additional funding would be needed in order to facilitate the involvement of the PTG : Sure; that would be a start. But then, of course, the public trustee would have to be funded to do these kind s of things. Those estates are generally what we might call non - viable, and the public trustee is a largely self- funding entity. We receive $518,000 a year in community service obligations. That has not been reviewed for over 10 years. I would suggest that we are now subsidising the community service obligations to the extent of about 500 per cent. 1090 Recommendation 120 8.163 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government make it the clear responsibility of the Public Trustee and Guardian to administer the affairs if someone dies intestate with no obvious relatives and fund the Public Trustee and Guardian to do this as a comm unity service obligation. 1089 Mr Taylor, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, p. 814. 1090 Mr Taylor, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 25 June 2019, pp. 814- 815. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 228 9 ENVIRONMENT , PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT DIRECTORATE INTRODUCTION 9.1 The ACT 2019 -20 Budget Statements E, Environment Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate (EPSDD) states that the Directorate: ...promotes the orderly growth of our city, strengthens the Territory's response to climate change, provides an integrated planning and land use system that contributes to the sustainable development and future of the AC T and manages the Territory's parks and reserves. The Directorate's aim is to 'Shape Canberra's Future'. We deliver on this vision though our Strategic Plan 2019 -22 and the Directorate's four strategic objectives, which provide a blueprint for the Directo rate's priorities and performance management. The objectives require the Directorate to plan and deliver a compact and efficient city that balances the needs of the environment, our heritage and out culture, and that we do this while building resilience ag ainst climate change and other change stressors The Directorate is responsible for developing and implementing key ACT Government and spatial plans (including the Territory Plan), climate change, housing policy, building policy, the Indicative Land Release Program, management plans for reserves and urban renewal initiatives. 1091 9.2 The Committee considered the following Outputs, Output Classes and Statements of Intent: Output Class 1: Planning: Output 1.1: Planning Delivery; Output 1.2: Planning and Building Poli cy.

In response the Directorate stated: We are very mindful of that as a potential strategy...It is more challenging if the amendments are considered individually to be minor and able to be dealt with by the certifier, for example, a change in glazing. What we are doing in that respect is looking at how we can require those particular matters to come b ack through the planning process. We are also including conditions. There are certain aspects of developments that we think are important design elements. We are clearly marking those on the plans and including conditions. Even if it is considered ordinari ly to be minor and able to be dealt with as exempt, we are saying we think it is important enough that it needs to come back to the planning authority. In relation to some of those, we are also then requiring an assessment by the Government Architect if th ey are important design features. We are certainly mindful of the issue and working on how we can address that, and it will be a case of incremental change. We will try new avenues, and, if it works, that is great; if we think we can refine it, we will con tinue to refine it. But we are very mindful of that as a potential problem. 1105 9.6 In further questioning the Committee made specific reference to the Geocon Republic Development and traffic access changes. Initially the Directorate provided some general informa tion about such amendments to Development Application: If an approval is in place, Ms Le Couteur, and a proponent builds not in accordance with the approved plan, and then seeks to amend that DA, we are not stuck at all. We 1100 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 904- 909. 1101 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 909. 1102 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 909- 911. 1103 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 912- 913. 1104 Ms Le Couteur MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p.886. 1105 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 886- 887. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 231 can, and we have, refused those types of applications. It is then incumbent on the proponent to build as per the approved plan. It is open to proponents \u2014we do not want to close it off completely \u2014to seek amendments. That is simply because, as they start construction, things can change. Th ey may need to make some adjustments, but that will undergo a detailed and thorough assessment. As I said, we are now incorporating conditions of approval where we think particular aspects are critically important to the success of the development.1106 9.7 The Di rectorate then provided some more specific information about access related changes and how the Directorate works with Transport Canberra and City Services (TCCS) on the issue: In terms of the changes proposed, we are currently assessing that. As I underst and it, it is to do with the access point. That can still change during construction. If deemed to be appropriate, and that is where we would rely on our colleagues in Transport Canberra and City Service ... to provide us with the frank and fearless advice, we will then consider that and make a decision, which could be to approve \u2014they may be able to build a really strong case \u2014or, alternatively, they do not and we would refuse that, and they will need to build in accordance with the approved plans.1107 9.8 The Commit tee then asked about the community's capacity to make comments on proposed amendments to development applications and were informed that: ... depending on the nature of the amendment proposed, it can be renotified. If it is minor internal changes, that would not necessarily be publicly notified. But more significant changes are publicly notified.1108 9.9 When inquiring as to how this public notification process occurred the Committee were informed that: The general answer is that the Planning and Development Act allows discretion to the planning authority to undertake renotification of an amendment application. Generally our test would be whether anybody who made a representation, or anybody else, would b e detrimentally affected by what is proposed. That would be the first test. The second test could relate to the extent of the changes; whether the change is so significant that it warrants that further notification process. If it is internal arrangements, most of the time we would probably not renotify that. If it is minor changes to things like building materials or finishes, we probably will not notify. But if it impacts things like access, solar access for an adjoining neighbour or the interface with a neighbour, we are more likely to notify. 1106 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 887. 1107 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 888- 889. 1108 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 889. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 232 We also look at what was initially said and the original consideration of the act. We look at two things there: the number of representations or the actual representations received \u2014not necessarily a quantum \u2014to see what they were and what the issues were to inform us of whether this is something that is important to renotify. Then the other aspect is to look at entity advice received, whether that will change the substance of what we have approved initially. 1109 9.10 The Comm ittee then sought to clarify who exactly is told as part of this notification process and whether that included purchasers of properties off the plan and were informed that 'there is no statutory mechanism for that. We encourage people to look at websites and even our DA phone app to see if it is renotified. But the short answer is no.' 1110 9.11 Minister Gentleman, Minister for Planning and Land Management (the Minister), went on to explain that: We are looking at these aspects through the strata reform process to ensure that we can inform those purchasers of any option changes and whether we need to legislate that position as well. 1111 9.12 Further to this the Committee also asked about how much discretion there is in relation to whether an amendment to a develo pment application is renotified or not. The Directorate indicated that: The legislation allows that discretion and there are standard operating procedures in place for the development assessment team for a range of our activities. We would go back to the o riginal decision to see whether this was a point of contention for the original decisions. That is a fairly clear indicator that you would want to renotify if we had submissions dealing with that issue. Particularly if our assessment team had identified it themselves as an issue, not through public notification, we would probably want to renotify. If it was internal to the building \u2014sometimes it is simply a slight adjustment to the electrical substation \u2014it might not necessarily impact and it would probably be a change to internal arrangements for the basement car park. We go through a range of considerations to understand whether somebody might be materially impacted. We have a range of professionals who apply their professional judgement, and that is what we expect of them. 1112 9.13 In this context the Committee asked how many developments have had amended development applications and if they went out for public consultation.

APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 233 Question Taken on Notice the Directorate provided information (summarise d in the table below) that indicated three Geocon developments, Republic - Belconnen; Wova - Phillip and Grand Central - Phillip, had amended multiple Development Applications for each site, albeit not all had been lodge d:1113 Site Number of DAs (in addition to original) Number of Notifications (in addition to original) Republic 6 for Stage 1 3 for Stage 2 At least 9 for Stage 3 1 for each Stage Wova 5 1 Grand Central 4 1 Recommendation 121 9.14 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government change relevant planning and leasing legislation to ensure that off -the plan apartment buyers are notified of any proposed changes to the Development Application for their building and be given the option of cancelling their contract without penalty if substantia l changes are approved to their unit or the overall development. Recommendation 122 9.15 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government renotify all amendments to Development Applications. DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION BACKLOG 9.16 The Committee asked the Directorate about what steps it was taking to address the backlog of Development Applications. Initially they were informed that there were a number of factors 1113 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 324, answered 15 July 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 234 that had contributed to the backlog, including changes in dwelling type, number of persons in a household, less detached dwellings, more multistorey developments, population growth, added complexity in dwellings, more multi -use dwellings and a greater community interest in development applications.1114 They also stated that: The reasons for the backlog relate to the quantum of DAs, the scale of DAs and the complexities, but also the level of community interest in DAs we have found. That all contributed to it. The last two, the complexity and community interest, mostly related to infill development. There are now a greater number of people affected by these more complex DAs and there is a greater impact on infrastructure that we need to be more carefully concerned about because it is existing infrastructure that needs to be either u pgraded or accommodated within development.1115 9.17 The Directorate stated that there were a number of reforms made to 'try and get though the large amount of work' that:1116 Fundamentally, we commenced a stage assessment process in August 2018, last year. The numbe r in the backlog peaked around October. As part of the stage assessment process \u2014I will walk you through the stage assessment process in a sec \u2014we reviewed and refined the stage assessment process again in April. We trialled it between August and April and t hen bedded it down in April this year. We also implemented target overtime sessions. We engaged some very limited staff, additional staff on short -term contract arrangements, where it was particularly hard to find those sorts of people whilst maintaining our independence as the planning authority. They are mostly retired assessing officers, for example. We have also spent some time revising our assessment templates, combining three templates into a single template to reflect our stage assessment; and we h ave revised our notices of decision to make them less complex. That was also in response to a request from industry \u2014industry is concerned about the complexity of our notices of decision \u2014for notices to be more plain English notices of decision that are easily understood. Then, obviously, there is the budget that resulted in the additional positions. That is what we have done. 1117 9.18 The Directorate went on to explain that the stage assessment process entailed six stages which were based on the 'statute considerati ons and the steps in the Planning and Development Act':1118 1114 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 895- 896; 1115 Mr Cilliers, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 896. 1116 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 896. 1117 Mr Cilliers, Proof Transcrip t of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 896. 1118 Mr Cilliers, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, p . 896. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 235 The first stage would be pre -assessment and review. Fundamentally, we ask the question: is the land suitable? That is a question we have to ask in terms of the act; it goes back to not just permissi bility but zone objectives and those sorts of things. The second stage is basically consideration of entity advice, again a requirement under the act. The third stage is for consideration of representations. The fourth stage is the technical assessment against the Territory Plan; we actually look at the drawings, assess them against code requirements and see whether they comply. The fifth stage is a sort of in -between stage, what we call the preliminary decision -making stage. Before we start drafting and m aking a decision, we have a senior officer look at the DA: take a step back and look at all the previous stages, what the recommendations were and what the decision should be. That stage also gives you the opportunity to escalate it to the major projects review group or to the landscape review panel if there are any issues in relation to that. The last stage is the drafting of the actual notice of decision and the final decision by a delegate. In addition to that, we have bundled our pre -lodgement services with our gateway team. They undertake a range of duties: things like inquiries, pre -lodgement advice, pre -application meetings and completeness checks. I have also introduced the role of coordinator. This particular person's role is to make sure that a DA keeps on progressing through those stages. Then there is a small team responsible for post -decision review. They are things like ACAT reviews and those sorts of things. 1119 9.19 Further to this they spoke about the reasons for undertaking such an approach, inclu ding the volume of work; the need for consistency in decision making; the need to identify pressure points and trends, and vulnerable DAs that can be handled more efficiently; and the wellbeing of staff.1120 9.20 They also spoke of the challenges they have had to face: The challenges we have with the stage assessment process are largely in relation to communication. Applicants or industry were used to contacting a single DA assessing officer. Now, it is very difficult. What am I doing about that? We have centralised the communication part with our gateway team, and we currently have two duty planners at any stage. This has led to what I referred to earlier: the need for a coordinator to maintain a level of fairness. The way we are dealing with overdue DAs is to deal with the old ones first; obviously that leads to some complaints from people whose DAs are getting older while we are dealing with them. Another challenge is dealing with amendment applications. We discussed that earlier. Something else is that the quality of applications and documentation we receive still, in some cases, leaves \u2014 1121 1119 Mr Cilliers, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 896- 897. 1120 Proof Transcript Evidence 2019, pp. 896- 898. 1121 Mr Cilliers, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 897- 898. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 236 9.21 Feedback on and outcomes of the new process were also provided to the Committee: Let me go to the feedback we have. Let me go to proponents that did make a change, particularly proponents who, as Mr Cilliers said, were used to ringing up the single assessing officer, to the point where they were sometimes ringing the assessing officer so often that they had no time to do any assessment because they were kept talking to the one proponent. Centralising those phone calls has allowed the assessors to work in teams on each of the stages. I think, too, you will have seen in the budget that the government has made a major change to staffing, so we will be able to put on an initial six new assessing officers out of this budget. And we have done a change to the fees so that it will be, in effect, industry funded. 1122 We keep a close eye on the success of our stage assessment process because it is a new thing. In October, 462 DAs at th at given point were under assessment. We are currently down to the 350 mark. It does show that it works. We would like to be around the 200 to 240 mark for it to be a healthy level of work.1123 9.22 Noting the extra workload and overtime that had been required, the Committee asked for additional details as to what the targeted overtime involved and were informed that: It peaked in about February this year. We asked officers if they would voluntarily agree to overtime twice a week \u2014that was totally volunt ary\u2014and some on Saturdays as well. That would have been for about two to three hours. We would focus on particular backlogs within the stage system. A stage system exposed where bottlenecks were. For example, with entity advice, we had a significant bottle neck there for quite a few months. We would take the overtime staff and get them to focus on that particular stage, and get that moving through the system to the next stage. It could also be where we see a bundle of applications in the same area that are s imilar; we would ask them to deal with the same issue, just for efficiency purposes. 1124 9.23 The Directorate also indicated that this need for overtime is likely to be reduced with the addition of new permanent officers and that they were : ...sure we will not need to do overtime. We have efficient processes in place now, and, with the additional staff, as Mr Cilliers said, we hope to get those DAs assessed in a quality and timely manner.1125 1122 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 898. 1123 Mr Cilliers, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 898. 1124 Mr Cilliers, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 899. 1125 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 899. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 237 ENTERTAINMENT PRECINCTS 9.24 The Committee noted that there had been an urban sound s discussion paper released in 2016 and asked the Directorate when and what the Directorate would be doing in response to the options discussed in the paper. In response the Directorate stated that: ...we have taken the urban sounds project and we have start ed to split that work out, similar to what we have done with the strata reform work. There are a lot of things that we can do but not all of it fits within one portfolio neatly. We are now starting to work through where each of those actions neatly fits an d what can be done in the short, medium and longer terms and not wait for a package of reforms that can be undertaken and that might take 12 months; things that we can do now. We are looking to see what we can do now . 1126 9.25 The Committee were then informed by the Directorate that in relation to the entertainment precinct area they had been working with a number of other Directorates of what could be done through processes involving zoning, leasing conditions, strata reforms, and noise regulations a s well as : ...looking at other jurisdictions and what they do. The City of Sydney has done work in this area, on the night -time economy and those sorts of things, previously. We are also looking at what other jurisdictions do as well. 1127 9.26 The Committee , noting that it was no w 2019 and the paper came out in 2016, asked why things that could have been done quickly had not been done, and were informed that: Given the work we have been doing, we are now at a point that we can make changes as opposed to these were always easy thin gs to do. The work has been done and we can now give effect to some of those things.1128 9.27 The Committee then asked what some of these things were, and were informed that in addition to possible amendments to noise requirements and the possible identification o f an overlay of an entertainment precinct there were more broader issues: The broader planning issues are a bit more complex in terms of whether we look at zoning, changes to zoning and leases. That is a bit more complex and we will probably look at that a bit more through the planning review work that we are doing on the Territory Plan and looking at zones. On the strata reform work, we have been looking at whether there is anything through strata reforms and building management plans \u2014those sorts of thing s\u2014that we can 1126 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 905. 1127 Dr Brady, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 905. 1128 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 906. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 238 incorporate there. Again, some of it is about making people aware that they are in a different precinct and the noise levels might be different.1129 9.28 When pressed as to whether there would be an announcement soon the Directorate indicated that: I think the short answer is that we will settle our advice to the minister. Then that would be a decision for the minister in terms of what we are recommending. I do not think I would look to make announcements around what and when until we have settled tha t advice. But we are talking short term. 1130 9.29 Specifically n oting noise levels as a significant concern, the Committee asked about the ability for buildings to be constructed in such a way as to cope with noise. They were advised that the Building Code as part of the National Construction Code, sets the requirement for building. The Directorate also stated: We can certainly look at that and we can work with our colleagues on the Australian Building Codes Board. If we got to the point where we thought there was a variation that was critically important, we could explore that with the minister. But I think we would need to do some more policy thinking around that in terms of the impact of having different building requirements in the ACT in relation to noise. Nois e is certainly an issue that is being considered by the Building Codes Board at the moment. 1131 9.30 The Committee also sought further elaboration on how noise is measured and were informed that: The measurements of noise are often at the boundary of a use. There are different measures for what is called a city precinct area or more a suburban area. We have been talking with the EPA about whether different levels should be used perhaps in some of the inner city, more urban areas, where there probably are different noise levels. At the moment, some of the levels cut off at 10 pm; so we have been asking whether on a Friday night or a Saturday night they could be extended to midnight, for example. 1132 9.31 The Minister also added that: As another action, I will be also writing , of course, to the design review panel to ask them to consider acoustic measures when reviewing development proposals.1133 1129 Dr Brady, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 907. 1130 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 908- 909. 1131 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 907- 908. 1132 Dr Brady, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 Ju ne 2019, p. 908. 1133 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 908. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE O F THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 239 Recommendation 123 9.32 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government release within three months an update for the community on work following the 'Urban Sounds Discussion' paper . Recommendation 124 9.33 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government finalise work to protect live music and activity within Canberra promptly, with the first stages to be completed during 2019. PLANNING AND BUILDING POLICY (1.2) 9.34 Output 1.2, Planning and Building Policy, provides high quality professional services in strategic land planning; administering the Territory Plan; planning for land release; developing policies for high quality urban design; and pol icies for buildings, building services, equipment and appliances, and the building and construction industry. 1134 MATTERS CONSIDERED 9.35 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Planning and Building Policy included: building quality reforms;1135 Disciplin ary Register (also discussed under EPSDD) ;1136 building inspectors (also discussed under EPSDD);1137 and EER Schemes1138 KEY ISSUES BUILDING QUALITY REFORMS 9.36 The Committee asked the Directorate as to the status of the 43 reforms since the change of minister and were informed that: 1134 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 8. 1135 Proof Transcript of Evidence 2019, pp. 384, 390- 391.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 240 What we will do now is make sure that there are at least 15 of those reforms completed by the end of this financial year, which is the end of next week, and we are committed to following through on all of those. I think the y are important reforms. I know you are aware of those reforms. I think the most recent steps in relation to the documentation guidelines and the codes of practice are strong demonstrations of not only the government's commitment to implementing those refo rms but also the effect that they are likely to have on lifting the quality of building, and not only the quality of building but the quality of confidence that people have. I think one of the important things for people in the ACT to have is a high level of confidence that buildings are high quality \u2014and our buildings are generally very high quality. The way those reforms are going, I think, continues to build that confidence. 1139 9.37 Whilst it was noted that the government was seeking to draw together both build ing policy and building regulatory oversight into one portfolio the Committee asked the Directorate what outcomes were being sought from the implementation of the reforms. Minister Ramsay, the Minister for Business and Regulatory Services (the Minister) st ated that: It will obviously depend on each of the various reforms. There are going to be different outcomes from each of the reforms. I said earlier that we have a threefold purpose: the highest quality building; a high level of confidence in the building sector by the general population; and a strong regulatory response for those increasingly few occasions where that is necessary. With some of the reforms \u2014for example, the documentation guidelines \u2014one of the key outcomes is that it will be very clear, ever yone will know what documentation is required, the building will match the documentation and it will be easy to follow through. That obviously means a higher level of quality of the building and a level of confidence in that. 1140 9.38 The Directorate further stated that: ... the 43 reforms all pretty much work together, so there is not just one reform that will improve the whole building system. They all fit together. Some of them have less visible outcomes than others. In the documentation guidelines it will be much clearer for designers through to certifiers that this is what is expected of all the documentation that accompanies any building and follows through in the inspections. Another thing we are doing is a code of practice. The first one we will see is for certifiers, surveyors. That, again, clearly documents what is expected of them and what is required of them. A lot of these things are already in existence but we are making it very clear to people. We have done some work on licences and training programs. W e 1139 Minister Ramsay MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 382- 383. 1140 Minister Ramsay MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 390. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPR OPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 241 are improving training for people as they go through to get their licences as builders. We have modified exams. As I said, all these things are working together to make improvements. 1141 9.39 In relation to codes of practice and fairer practices the Directorate also informed the Committee that: The codes of practice, in particular, are looking not just to improve the level of verification and oversight of what is actually happening on building sites by both the builder and the building surveyor but also to get be tter consistency. At the moment there is a lot of discretion in some of the provisions of our act and there are a lot of differences of interpretation about what is required at particular stages of work and what needs to be verified and certified. So we ar e looking for improved consistency and, where people are not doing what we think would be a minimum, to at least bring people up to that bar. There are some reforms about fairer practices within the industry. Some relate to contracting: from a consumer sid e, people understanding their rights and obligations under the contract better; and from an industry side, reducing the impacts of, say, insolvencies and unfair payment terms. There is dispute resolution as well. A lot of the work that we are doing is to, firstly, prevent disputes and complaints coming through to Access Canberra. Access Canberra, as well, is looking to reduce things post occupancy rather than addressing them at the time. The dispute resolution processes that we are working on are to, where there is an issue, have alternative dispute resolution processes where people can resolve those more rapidly. Throughout the entire building process we are looking to see improvements and increased responses to problems in those particular areas. 1142 9.40 Comment was also made in relation to the possible impact of the reforms by of Access Canberra as the regulator: Given the significant exposure the regulator has had and the focus the government has placed on this particular aspect of regulation, we have seen an in crease in complaints recently. Those complaints are not just for activity that is happening now. They are for problems people might have had for a while, but they now feel there is an avenue they can pursue to get them corrected. But through time we will expect to see the complaint numbers trending down. We recognise that this is a long- term indicator as well. Some of the complaints we might get on any given day might be for a building that was constructed eight years ago, for instance, but we are starting to see some of those quality impacts coming through. It will be a slow -moving indicator, but certainly 1141 Dr Brady, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, pp. 390- 391. 1142 Ms Morris, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 19 June 2019, p. 391.

APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 243 KEY ISSUES FUNDING OF LOCAL LANDCARE GROUPS 9.43 The Committee noted from discussions held at the Community and Industry Groups hearing on 14 June 2019 that the local Landcare groups had each been funded about $30,000 less than they had asked for. The C ommittee asked why this was the case. 9.44 In response Minister Gentleman, the Minister for Environment and Heritage (the Minister), stated: We funded the groups last time to look at opportunities for themselves to do a new business model in how they engage and operate to be financially responsible ... They did that work. They came to us and said, \"For this year we still need some funding to continue.\" We have delivered that within the directorate.1148 9.45 The Conservator, provided further details on the funding arrangements for the Landcare groups: The $90,000 for each catchment group is for providing that core support to enable the catchment groups to deliver more across the ACT. In addition to that funding, we have also been able to resource those catchment gro ups with funding for particular programs, which is what they have been delivering. Frogwatch and Waterwatch are two programs and areas of activity that the catchment groups historically have invested in, and we have continued to invest in those areas as we ll. That grows the pie of resource to the catchment groups. In addition there are some 20 new healthy waterways infrastructure projects coming onto the books of the ACT.1149 9.46 In response to a question on whether the Government would maintain the $90,000 fundin g for each of the groups going forward, The Conservator replied that while it would be good to maintain this level of funding: ...the land catchment groups have historically been funded by the commonwealth, and the commonwealth has reduced its investment int o those areas. The ACT government is really enabling and keeping these catchment groups moving. We are looking at novel approaches to that; hence the conversation about Frogwatch and other things. 1150 9.47 In the context of this discussion, the Conservator also mentioned that the catchment groups are recipients of the Government's environmental grants. Additionally, the Conservator noted ongoing Government investment in an education program for the management of waterways 1148 Minister Gentleman MLA, 27 June 2019, p. 1009. 1149 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1010. 1150 Mr Walker, Pro of Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1011. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 244 'and ensuring the community are not putting inappropriate things down the stormwater drain'. He noted that 'the catchment groups are now picking up that responsibility and the funding to deliver that program. That was an in -house program delivered by the Directorate; we are now giving catchment gro ups some investment to enable them to take that partnership on'.1151 Recommendation 125 9.48 The Committee recommends t hat the ACT Government continue to deliver community education programs on the importance of keeping leaves out of storm water drains and plastic out of waste water streams and other catchment clean- up messages. WATER QUALITY IN THE LAKES 9.49 The Committee noted a report by the University of Canberra on dealing with algal blooms in the ACT and asked what the Government's response to this is. 9.50 The Directorate informed the Committee that the $93.5 million ACT healthy water ways project is made up of $85 million in Commonwealth funding and $8.5 million in Territory funding. The funding is focused on 20 infrastructure projects and a range of other work s including the research by the University of Canberra. The Committee was also told that the University's research was 'done on two aspects of water quality research, one looking at Lake Tuggeranong...and also looking at nutrient dynamics in our urban wetlan ds and ponds'. 1152 9.51 The Directorate explained further that: In relation to Lake Tuggeranong, the University of Canberra work has firstly looked at better quantifying the nutrient dynamics in the Lake Tuggeranong catchment as well as in the lake itself to det ermine the relativities. I guess the advice from the University of Canberra is that Lake Tuggeranong has a high nutrient loading from its catchment but, as Ian was just alluding to, over the 30 or so years that the lake has been there, there has been an ac cumulation of sediments and now it has got issues with temperature stratification of the lake which allows for nutrient release from the sediments that have built up over time. ... When the lake is stratified you get low- dissolved oxygen at the bottom of the lake and that can allow the phosphates that are in the sediments to be released, and that provides a source of food, if you like, for the blue -green algae. The University of Canberra advice is that, in terms of the approach to dealing with trying to reduc e blue - 1151 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1012. 1152 Mr Kendall, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1016. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 245 green algae and lake closures, it needs to be an approach that looks at cleaning up the catchment, and the infrastructure works that have been implemented are a big part of that. 1153 9.52 On the results of the University's research, the Directorate explained: They have tested a range of additives, three different additives, as well as a number of controls. They are still assessing the efficacy of those additives. But in terms of the products that are being tested there, one is a product called Phoslock, whic h is a type of bentonite clay that can lock up the phosphates; effectively it caps the phosphates in the bottom of the lake. One is a product called Diatomix; that is a different type of algae, if you like, that can out -compete the blue -green algae. The th ird additive is hydrogen peroxide, which specifically targets the blue -green algae as opposed to good algae or other plants and animals.1154 Recommendation 126 9.53 The Committee recommends t hat the ACT Government continue to research algal bloom spread in our lak es and to trial and monitor new products as they become available so that the number of days lakes are closed to recreational use is reduced and ultimately eliminated. CONSERVATION AND LAND MANAGEMENT (2.2) 9.54 Output 2.2, Conservation and Land Management, in corporates the planning and management of the ACT's parks, reserves, unleased public land and plantations, including associated community infrastructure. The land manager role includes management of land for recreational use; conservation management; inclu ding management of national parks, nature reserves; fire management; and pest and weed control as well as the management of the Territory's softwood plantation and oversight of rural production areas. 1155 MATTERS CONSIDERED 9.55 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Conservation and Land Management included: 1153 Mr Kendall, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1016. 1154 Mr Kendall, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p p. 1016- 1017. 1155 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 10.

I really want to congratulate PCS in particular for the work they have done in looking after those pristine catchment areas that contain our water for the ACT. They have done a great job to ensure that we have as few animals as possible, particularly hoofed animals, in the area. We have had a process for the removal of horses over a number of years and also a process for the removal of sambar deer. 1167 1156 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p p. 989- 991; 1000; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 347, answered 5 July 2019; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 349, answered 5 July 2019. 1157 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 991- 992; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 348, answered 5 July 2019. 1158 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 991- 992. 1159 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p p. 991- 992. 1160 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 993. 1161 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 993. 1162 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p p. 1000- 1001. 1163 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1002- 1006; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19-351, answered 5 July 2019. 1164 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1006- 1009. 1165 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p p. 1012- 1013. 1166 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1013- 1015. 1167 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 990.

Of course, the ACT deals with the Australian Alps. That arrangement has been in place for many years. We continue to support that memorandum of understanding with those organisations, including the commonwealth government. We have contributed to the monitoring of horses in the Australian Alps and we continue to do that. That work involves a whole range of different techniques for monitoring, from using remote cameras through to aerial surveys. Collectively, that information becomes available and goes on to the Australian Alps website. The information is then publicly available.1168 Recommendation 127 9.59 The Committee recommends t hat the ACT Government publish details about the ACT's contribution to feral horse counts across the Australian Alps region. INGLEDENE FOREST - REPLANTING AND RECREATIONAL USE 9.60 In response to a question on why the Government is replanting Ingledene Forest, the Minister informed the Committee that: It is an important opportunity for us to look after that area that was burnt out in the 2003 bushfires. Since then we have had just a little bit of management of that particular area. We have seen invasive weeds come into the area. We have seen misuse by different groups wanting to provide themselves with some entertainment on weekends, for example. We want to ensure that we can manage that particular area. 1169 9.61 To this, he added: I asked EPSDD to look at what we could do in managing it in a sense both for the environme nt but also in an economic sense. The opportunity to replant Ingledene means that we will have an industry occurring in the area that pays for itself. We have some carbon sequestration that is available in that process as well but, more importantly, a bett er recreational area, particularly for mountain bikers. 1170 1168 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 990. 1169 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transc ript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 991. 1170 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 991. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 248 9.62 The Minister also noted that the replanting of Ingledene Forest and the provision of mountain biking tracks within the forest provides an alternative location for mountain bikers to use during times when harvesting occurs at Kowen Forest. 1171 9.63 In the context of this discussion, The Conservator informed the Committee 'about the concept planning around mountain bikes': In the year ahead we are investing in developing a concept plan for mountain biking in the ACT. This mountain bike concept plan will provide the iconic experience for mountain bikers across the ACT and link a number of the trails and networks. From the Stromlo Forest Park to Kowen and other areas we are working with the mountain bike fraternity to create an iconic experience in the ACT that links networks and trails already in existence but really tries to elevate and promote those sorts of in -nature activities.1172 9.64 The Conservator also informed the Committee that the planting of Radiata pines at Ingledene Forest provides: ...a recreational hub for the community with mountain bike riding, walking and horse riding. Those sorts of activities can be accommodated very well in pine plantation or replanted areas where they do not have the same impact on m any of our more natural areas, like Namadgi National Park, where some of those activities are constrained because of the impact they would have on the environment. 1173 COMMITTEE COMMENT 9.65 The Committee notes statements by the Minister and Directorate officials that Ingledene Forest will serve as a recreational hub for the mountain bike, trail walking, and horse riding communities. To ensure that the Forest can be utilised by as much of the community as possible, the Committee believes Government must consult clo sely with community groups when designing and planting Ingledene and other forest areas. Recommendation 128 9.66 The Committee recommends t hat the ACT Government work closely with the recreational mountain bike , mountain trail walking and horse riding communit ies when replanting and redeveloping Ing ledene and other forest areas so that such areas can be used to the maximum benefit of ACT residents. 1171 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p p. 991-992. 1172 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 992. 1173 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 992. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 249 Recommendation 129 9.67 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment work toward a rotation programme, to ensure that bike trails in both Ingledene and Kowen Forest are maintained and usable even during periods of timber harvesting . INGLEDENE FOREST - BUSHFIRE PREVENTION 9.68 The Committee sought comment from the Minister on the steps the Government has taken to mitigate the fire risk at Ingledene Forest following the replant. 9.69 The Minister replied that: ...of course we are doing it within our bushfire operational plans. I think it has only caught fire once, in 2003. I cannot remember a fire in Ingledene prior to that. It is to the east of the main Namadgi ranges and east of Gudgenby River so there are a couple of breaks that assist us naturally with looking at fire. But we have moved a long way since 2003 in addressing bushfires. With our aerial capability and our raft teams we have a much better application of bushfire management than we had in 2003. I am comfortable that whilst we are introducing new forest we will have the opportunity to be able to ensure that the bushfire risk is mitigated. 1174 9.70 In response to a furth er question, the Minister told the Committee that 500,000 Pinus Radiata will be planted as well as a native species.1175 COMMITTEE COMMENT 9.71 The Committee believes that the experiences of the catastrophic 2003 bushfires should be borne in mind by the Government when planning the planting of new forest areas. The Committee urges Government to ensure that the Territory's bush -fire management plans are up-to-date and in -line with best practice. Recommendation 130 1174 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 993. 1175 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 993. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 250 9.72 The Committee recommends t hat as new forests are rep lanted , the ACT Government updates bushfire operational plans to ensure best practice and close management of new areas to reduce their fire risk to safe levels. KANGAROO MANAGEMENT PLAN 9.73 The Committee asked about the Kangaroo Management Plan and was informed by the Minister that: The conservator looks after that plan. There is a funding element of $37,000 for the implementation of the survey and the monitoring requirements of the kangaroo management plan. That was in the 2018 -19 budget. This was in addition to funding for the operational aspects of the conservation cull undertaking.1176 9.74 In response to a question on the kangaroo cull, The Conservator provided the Committee with the following information: The program this year is the largest program that we have undertaken. It is planned to remove some 4,000 kangaroos from key areas where biomass and the animals that native vegetation supports are being impacted. That is the key message for this group. While kangaroo management in itself is an activity, th e key purpose of that kangaroo management activity is to enable native grasses and native woodlands to recover and the species that are dependent on those ecosystems to continue to survive in the ACT. That is why we undertake kangaroo management work. 1177 9.75 He added: We also survey the community to get their view of kangaroo management. Some 80 per cent of the community highly value the activity of kangaroo management. They recognise that it is an important step that we need to do in the ACT. Again, the reason we undertake this conservation work is for the benefit of a suite of threatened species. 1178 9.76 The Committee also asked questions about collisions between motorists and kangaroos; it wanted to know if the Directorate had data on this. The Conservator replied the Directorate does keep data and provided the following details: In the last financial year, we have run into some 3,000 animals in our cars, so there is a fair impact across the community in managing kangaroos that have been hit by cars. 1179 1176 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p p. 1002- 1003. 1177 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1003. 1178 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1003. 1179 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1004. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 251 9.77 In response to a related question later in the hearing, The Conservator indicated that the Directorate has 'good information that...provides a good visual representation of where kangaroo -car accidents are occurring'. 1180 COMMITTEE COMMENT 9.78 The Committee believes that data on ka ngaroo -vehicle collisions available to the Directorate could be better used to keep motorists informed about collision hotspots. Recommendation 131 9.79 The Committee recommends t hat the ACT Government make publicly available , a database or a heatmap of collisi ons between kangaroo and vehicles. GOLDEN SUN MOTH 9.80 The Committee asked for an overview of the conservation status of the G olden Sun Moth. 9.81 The Directorate provided the Committee with the following information: The golden sun moth is listed under the Nature Conservation Act and has been for quite a while. We have a number of listed species which we provide actions for, and it is one of our species that is commonwealth listed as well as ACT listed. It is quite an interesting species because 10 years ago it was highly rare and we thought it was purely in native grasslands. With research and a lot of information that has come about in the past 10 years we have found golden sun moth in a lot of other areas and we have actually found it in Chilean needle grass. So we have this complex area of a listed threatened species occurring in areas where a listed weed grows, but that is what it likes. 1181 PINK-TAILED WORM LIZARD 9.82 The Committee noted the development of housing near the Molonglo River peninsula at Coombs and asked about the impact of this development of the pink -tailed worn -lizard. 9.83 The Minister responded that 'we are providing as much habitat as we can in the Molonglo River reserve for the pink -tailed worm -lizard'.1182 The Conservator added to this response, noting that: 1180 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1005. 1181 Dr Margaret Kitch en, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1012. 1182 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1014. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 252 ...providing habitat is the key means by which we can conserve pink -tailed worm -lizards and their habitat. The peninsula and the reserve itself provide suitable habitat. We have a national environment sig nificance plan we are bound to follow, so we continue to implement that work and monitor and undertake activities to conserve the species there.1183 9.84 The Committee then asked a follow- up question on whether the species is protected in areas designated for deve lopment. The Conservator replied: Like all development proposals, there is an assessment done pre- development about what values are there, and if there are any values there then yes, they can potentially be relocated to other areas. That is part of the wor k that the developers would be required to do consistent with their development applications and processes there.1184 HERITAGE (2.3) 9.85 Output 2.3, Heritage, administers the heritage provisions of the Heritage Act 2004 and assists in the conservation of the ACT' s heritage assets to ensure their recognition, registration and conservation. The area also provides administrative and operational support to the ACT Heritage Councils; administers the annual funding of the ACT Heritage Grants Program, the Canberra and Re gion Heritage Festival and Capital Works projects as they relate to heritage conservation works. 1185 MATTERS CONSIDERED 9.86 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Heritage included: illegal removal of heritage -listed Aboriginal scarred trees from Wan niassa;1186 heritage application process;1187 Lanyon Homestead;1188 KEY ISSUES ILLEGAL REMOVAL OF HE RITAGE -LISTED ABORIGINAL SCARRED TR EES FROM 1183 Mr Walker, Proof T ranscript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1014. 1184 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1014. 1185 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 10. 1186 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p p. 993- 1000. 1187 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1001- 1002. 1188 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1006. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 253 WANNIASSA 9.87 The Committee noted that two heritage- listed Aboriginal scarred trees had been illegally removed from Governmen t land in Wanniassa. The Committee asked if Government staff or contractors had been involved in the removal. 9.88 ACT Heritage, provided the Committee with the details of the incidents: ...the two trees were located within close proximity to each other, one with in the school and one within the parkland adjacent to the school. Both matters were subject to an investigation by Access Canberra and parks and conservation. I cannot disclose the outcomes of that due to privacy laws, but in one instance we know the offen der and in the other instance we do not so the approaches to remediating both the sites and responding to both those cases is different.1189 9.89 In response to further questioning, ACT Heritage told the Committee that one of the trees had been removed by a Govern ment contractor, but the removal had not been approved by the ACT Government. The Committee was also told that the contractor had self- reported the removal and that the action 'was not malicious; there was no intent'. 1190 9.90 The Directorate explained further tha t the contractor had been engaged to remove trees in the area according to a tree management plan. The contractor had 'misunderstood the plan and inadvertently removed one of the trees that they should not have removed'. 1191 9.91 When asked about the consequences for offences under the Heritage Act 2004 , ACT Heritage indicated that: At present, the options are very black and white: it is either education or prosecution. Obviously prosecution is quite a lengthy process, subject to DPP review and uptake. The Minister recognised that and has asked EPSDD to look at amending the compliance area in the legislation so that we can have a greater toolkit for situations like this. 1192 9.92 Later in the hearing, the Directorate, provided more information on enforcement of the Heritage Act: In matters under the Heritage Act the onus of proof on the territory is to prove intent; that there was an intent to damage. That is a very difficult hurdle to meet, in the way the act is constructed. As my colleague Ms Moore said earlier, there is w ork going on, in terms of modifications and amendments to the Heritage Act, to bring in different tests for investigators, when they look at those things. Over many years of doing this 1189 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 993. 1190 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 994. 1191 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 994. 1192 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 995. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 254 type of work in my previous roles, the element of intent with respect t o heritage has been a difficult hurdle to get over within the jurisdiction.1193 9.93 When asked if there was a strict liability offence within the Heritage Act, the Directorate responded that 'there is a strict liability offence within the Act but it is not replic ated in the Magistrates Court Act, so it does not have effect'.1194 9.94 The Committee asked what had happened to the trunks of the felled trees and was informed that one had been mulched while the other was salvaged. 1195 When informed that the mulched tree was the o ne cut down by the Government contractor, the Committee sought an explanation as to how the contractor could mulch the tree while also self- reporting the mistake to fell the tree in the first place. The Minister responded that 'I think we will find that out once the investigation is complete.'1196 9.95 Later in the hearing, the Committee was informed that both incidents occurred in 2017 and that the Directorate was notified about the one involving the contractor immediately. It learned about the other incident six months after it occurred.1197 9.96 The Committee asked when the investigations would be completed and was informed that 'we would hope that by the end of this year the matters will be closed in their entirety'. 1198 The Committee also asked whether the Minister would undertake to present the result of the investigation to the Legislative Assembly and was told he would.1199 9.97 In response to a question on what the Government intends on doing with the salvaged tree trunk, Ms Moore indicated that 'we will be guided by the Representative Aboriginal Organisations [RAOs] and their desires for the future of the trunk'. 1200 9.98 Later in the hearing, ACT Heritage provided further information on how the Government intends to work with the RAOs in responding to the felling of the two trees: On both of those sites there will be an interpretation or a reflective outcome. One is being driven by Education and with the other one we will be working with the RAOs about their wishes. That is what we spoke about before: whether they want to see it back in its location or somewhere else, much like we have done down at the Namadgi visitor centre. That is still ongoing at this point. 1201 1193 Mr Simmons, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 997. 1194 Mr Simmons, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 997. 1195 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 996. 1196 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 996. 1197 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1000. 1198 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1000. 1199 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1000. 1200 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 996. 1201 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 999. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 255 COMMITTEE COMMENT 9.99 The Committee recognises that scarred trees are important cultural artefacts for the Territory's Aboriginal communities. The Committee believes that any actions to rectify the loss of the two felled scarred trees, including the handling of the remaining tree trunk, the commemoration of the sites, or the broader education of the population on the signi ficance of scarred trees, must be led first and foremost by the Territory's Aboriginal peoples. The Committee believes that Government should report any actions taken in this space to the Legislative Assembly. 9.100 The Committee believes that the investigation into the illegal felling of the two Aboriginal scarred trees in Wanniassa has taken an exorbitantly excessive amount of time. 9.101 The Committee also believes that legal loopholes exist which undermine the effective enforcement of the provisions of the Herita ge Act 2004 . The Committee believes that the effective enforcement of the Act is vital for protecting the Territory's heritage and strongly urges the Government to remove these loopholes to the enforcement of the Act. Recommendation 1 32 9.102 The Committee recom mends that the ACT Government expedite efforts to remove any judicial, legislative, or other loopholes to the enforcement of offenses arising from damage caused to heritage protected places, items, or objects. Recommendation 133 9.103 The Committee recommends t hat the ACT Government expedite the investigation into the two felled scar red trees from 2017, and report back to the Legislative Assembly on the outcome of that investigation. Recommendation 134 9.104 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government c onsult with local Aboriginal groups about the appropriate way to rectify the loss of the two scarred trees illegally felled in Wanniassa, including the appropriate handling of the salvaged tree trunk, and report any actions to the Legislative A ssembly within six months. SELECT COMMITTE E ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 256 HERITAGE APPLICATION PROCESS 9.105 In response to a question about changes to the processing of heritage applications, the Minister informed the Committee: We have looked at speeding up the process of heritage applications, so we hav e extra staff on board now. I am very pleased to see that the number of applications has reduced quite dramatically. Back in 2008 we had some 320 on the list and we are down to 88. I am very pleased by the hard work the council has done, and it has also wo rked hard in the tribunal, which is very good. We hope to manage those numbers into the future and that is why we have provided the extra staff. 1202 9.106 In answer to a follow -up question, the Minister told the Committee that one extra FTE staff member would be ad ded to the Directorate to 'help with managing nominations and working through that to expedite the process associated with listings'.1203 9.107 The Committee noted that a recommendation made in 2017 -2018 Budget Estimates report concerning the inclusion of more acc ountability indicators of heritage matters was not implemented by Government.1204 The Committee asked why this was the case. 9.108 ACT Heritage replied that the Heritage Council considered introducing an accountability indicator on nominations but found that it cou ld not quantify this 'because it was outside of the Council's control as to who it would be and when and how a nomination would be received'. 1205 9.109 Further to this they stated to the Committee that: You could not control meeting a quota of nominations received and therefore a quota of nominations processed. Also, each nomination is incredibly different. One nomination might be for a single dwelling or a single object, and one nomination might equate to a suburb of places. The level of time and investment by the Heritage Council to make a decision on the nomination varies vastly depending on the nature of that nomination. So making a strategic indicator would not give a true representation; you would not be able to report against it, because a lot of it is outside the control of the government or the council. 1206 1202 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1001. 1203 Mr Walker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1001. 1204 See: Select Committee on Estimates 2017 -2018, Appropriation Bill 2017 -2018 and Appropriation (Office of the Legislative Assembly) Bill July 2017, Recommendation 95, viewed 4 July 2019. 1205 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p p. 1001- 1002. 1206 Ms Moore, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1002. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 257 COMMITTEE COMMENT 9.110 While recognising the difficulties associated with quantifying an accountability indicator for Heritage applications, the Committee believes that Government can do more to provide transparen cy on the number of Heritage application nominations processed by the Heritage Council. Recommendation 135 9.111 The Committee recommends t hat the ACT Government action the Heritage recommendations outlined in the report of the Select Committee on Budget Estimates 2017- 18, or at a minimum develop a reporting mechanism or accountability indicator for the annual number of Heritage Application nominations processed. CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABILITY (3.1) 9.112 Output 3.1, Climate Change and Sustainability develop and provide advice in relation to: the ACT's climate change agenda; investments in renewable electricity to achieve the government's 100 per cent renewable electricity target and delivery of local industry development strategies; frameworks to ensure the ACT's energy systems (electricity, fuel and liquid fuel(s) are reliable, sustainable and affordable; measures to help hou seholds manage their energy better to reduce emissions and costs, including administration of the Actsmart programs; the ACT Zero Emissions Government framework; and administration of the Energy Efficiency (Cost of Living) Improvement Scheme.1207 MATTERS CONS IDERED 9.113 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Heritage included: solar panel quality;1208 energy efficiency programs;1209 1207 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , pp. 10 -11. 1208 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 752. 1209 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p p. 752- 754.

We have had a range of public consultations on that. .. One will be that we will change how we measure the energy efficiency improvement scheme [EEIS] from an emissions basis to a draws basis, or an energy unit basis, so that you can still gauge activities effectively. But also within the EEIS you have seen a number of products where you can no longer transition to a more efficient gas product. You can now no longer access gas products, 1210 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 754- 755. 1211 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 755- 758. 1212 Proof Transcript Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 758- 759. 1213 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 759. 1214 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 759- 760. 1215 Proof Transcript Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 760- 763. 1216 Proof Transcript Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 763- 766. 1217 Proof Transcript Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 766- 771. 1218 Proof Evidence 2019, pp. 772- 773. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 259 because we are encouraging people to go down the all -electric path. That is the broad direction we are going in in that scheme.1219 9.116 The Committee asked if the Government would be assisting people in transitioning from inefficient to more efficient electrical heaters through the EEIS. 9.117 The Direc torate informed the Committee that: When we did some community consultation around the extension of the EEIS, what came through loud and clear was about what we can do to help people with either inefficient gas or inefficient electric. So the government has agreed to extend the scheme to 203 0, because it is a very popular scheme, and then that will line up with our interim targets. The focus of that is now becoming, as much as efficient electricity, getting off gas. 1220 9.118 Further to this the Directorate provided additional information on the Government's review of the EEIS: Due to the 100 per cent renewable electricity target, we will be changing to an energy metric, which means there will be more uptake of efficient electric replacements in the future. There are also opportunities for low income h ouseholds to save on energy through an energy efficiency improvements in public housing program, which will replace inefficient electric heaters with more efficient electric reverse cycle air conditioners. 1221 9.119 In explaining why some public housing tenants hav e not been able to transition to a split system since the initiative was announced in the 2018 -19 budget, the Directorate indicated that: I think what has happened is they focused on gas to electric first and then they are transitioning into the electric t o electric reverse cycle. So they should be eligible now.1222 Recommendation 1 36 9.120 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government extend the energy efficient improvement scheme to include replacing electric resistance heaters with split system reverse cycle s ystems. 1219 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 753. 1220 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 753. 1221 Ms Harmer, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p p. 753- 754. 1222 Ms Harmer, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 754. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 260 ZERO-EMISSION VEHICLES 9.121 In response to a question on the number of zero -emissions vehicles the ACT Government has in its vehicle fleet, the Directorate informed the Committee that the ACT Government currently has 17 electric vehicles.1223 9.122 In reply to a follow -up question on the number of electric bikes in the ACT Government's fleet, the Directorate explained: We used eight in the trial which finished in 2018. What we found from that trial was that they were effective and they were used. It has been an interesting thing with the e-bikes that what we have seen is that often people try the e- bikes as part of the fleet and then they go out and purchase their own e -bike for private use. It has actually been an interesting promotional tool for e -bike retaile rs across the territory.1224 9.123 The Committee inquired about Government actions to widen the number of zero -emission vehicles in the ACT. The Minister replied that the Government has 'adopted the target to have the ACT Government fleet, basically all the vehicles, to be zero vehicles within three year'. He noted that this would be subject to vehicles being fit -for-purpose; some job categories, such as park rangers, would still require use of conventional vehicles.1225 9.124 The Minister explained three ways such ac tions within Government are important in terms of widening the use of electric vehicles more generally among the population: One is that people will see more vehicles around, which I think is part of the public education process. The second is that, as veh icles come out of the lease cycle they will become available as second -hand vehicles. The third is that the ACT government committing to this target has generated real interest from the car -making sector. We have had all the major car importers and makers in Australia come and see us to talk about being involved in this arrangement. I think what it is doing is giving some market confidence to make it worth it for them to import vehicles. The great barrier in Australia still is that there are not many vehicl es available. 1226 9.125 The Committee also asked about electric bikes and scooters, particularly mentioning safety concerns around collisions with pedestrians. 9.126 The Minister responded that: As you, I am sure, are aware, there is real tension out there between pedestrians and cyclists, as there is between cyclists and cars and the like. What we are doing is trying 1223 Mr Mozqueira, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 755. 1224 Mr Mozqueira, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 755. 1225 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 756. 1226 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 756.

In that order of vulnerability, pedestrians are the most vulnerable of the road users. I am sure we have all seen it, but unfortunately there are some bike riders who are not considerate; equally there are some pedestrians who are not considerate. The bottom line is: if everyone was a bit more considerate to each other we would all be a lot bette r off. 1227 Recommendation 137 9.127 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment engage in an extensive education campaign to ensure pedestrian, riders and driver safety around electric bikes and scooters. IMPACT ON THE WORKFORCE OF THE SHIFT TOWA RDS ELECTRIC VEHICLE S 9.128 The Committee asked about the impact of the shift to electric vehicles on the workforce. 9.129 The Minister responded that: We are very conscious of these sorts of transitions. There will also be new jobs, of course. For example, CIT at Fyshwick is one of the leading campuses for training people in electric vehicle use, maintenance, servicing and t he like. We need to make sure that we offer those retraining opportunities as we progress. In becoming a bit of a known hub for these things, some of these opportunities are coming to the CIT. At CIT in Bruce, at least when we launched it, we had the only accredited wind training course in the Southern Hemisphere. So there is some of that first mover advantage.1228 Recommendation 138 9.130 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government explore further the economic benefits and options for job creation stemming fro m the transition to zero emissions and the embrace of new technologies - such as the training of people in zero emission vehicle maintenance. PETROL AND DIESEL VEHICLES 9.131 The Committee noted moves in other jurisdiction for the banning of the sale of new pe trol and diesel vehicles. The Committee wanted to know if the Government intends on taking similar actions. 1227 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 757. 1228 Minster Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 759. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 262 9.132 The Minister acknowledged that there is a broad movement away from the use of petrol and diesel vehicles towards the increasing use of electric ones . He said that, at the moment, the Government's focus is on promoting the wider use of electric vehicles through the provision of necessary infrastructure, such as charging stations and recharging points. 1229 9.133 In addition, the Minister noted: As a small juris diction, we are conscious that our ability to shape the global car market is small. We are a taker rather than a pace setter, although, because of setting our target, we are probably more advanced than most other jurisdictions in Australia. We have been ab le to box above our weight in that sense.1230 COMMITTEE COMMENT 9.134 Given statements by the Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability that the ACT is not intending to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, the Committee acknowledges that ACT residen ts will continue to purchase and use these types of vehicles into the future. 2025 EMISSIONS TARGETS 9.135 The Committee asked when the specific plan for meeting the Government's 2025 emissions reduction target will be released. 9.136 The Minster replied that the plan would be released in the next few months. He added: 'I was recently looking at action plan 2, so the next one will essentially be action plan 3. We have had two previous ones. It is scheduled to come out in 2021, but we will be a little bit ahead of schedule on that'. 1231 9.137 The Minister commented further: We undertook some community consultation from late 2017 through to the first half of 2018. We received an enormous amount of community input. I was very encouraged by both the quality and quantity of input that we received. We had over 1,000 specific policy suggestions from members of the community, which I thought was very positive. It has taken us a little bit of time to sift through all of those suggestions, to analyse them and to work across government to get that whole of government coordination to bring together a strategy that the whole of government has bought into. 1232 9.138 When asked whether there would further consultations on the plan, the Minister replied that there would not be, adding that: 1229 Minister Rattenbury MLA , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 758. 1230 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 759. 1231 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 759. 1232 Minister Rattenbury MLA , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 760. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIV E ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 263 This new strategy will be all about getting us from now until 2025. It will just be the strategy. It is not coming out as a draft. Because of the extensive consultation we have done, we are just coming out with a plan.1233 COST OF 2030 EMISSIONS TARGETS 9.139 The Commit tee recounted a Canberra Times article in which the Minister had stated a 65 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 would cost $5.8 million.1234 The Committee asked how the ACT Government had arrived at this figure. 9.140 The Directorate informed the Committee tha t: Before we hold to that number, we should be clear that it was based on economic modelling. We are seeing a lot of change, and the pace of change is rapidly changing ... With the pricing of what that change will be, I am sure if we went to another economic modelling firm today we would get a different number. I am sure if we went there in another month we would get to another number. 1235 9.141 The Directorate went on to explain that the modelling was based on a range of scenarios and that 'there are an infinite numbe r of scenarios to get any outcome' and went on to indicate that: At the time, for example, the expectation was that electric vehicles would become cost competitive with petrol vehicles by around 2030. All of their thinking since then is that that is likely to happen sooner, if anything. The costs...are changing. It also comes down to the fact that the scenarios in the future will become more difficult to estimate. We will get to our 2020 target of a 40 per cent reduction largely through achievement of our 10 0 per cent renewable electricity target. That is based on a range of specific contracts that we have in order to deliver that renewable electricity. To get to the 2025 target, then 2030 and beyond that, requires a much larger range of actions in the commu nity in terms of transport choice, fuel choice within homes, fuel choices within businesses, and how people build their buildings over a long period of time. It has a much bigger requirement for the particular engagement of players in activities that they need to undertake. The range of costs of that become more difficult to estimate. 1236 1233 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 760. 1234 See: Katie Burgess, 'Cost of emissions reduction target revealed', Canberra Times , 17 August 2018, https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6012809/cost -of-emissions- reduction -target- revealed/ , viewed 2 July 2019. 1235 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 760. 1236 Mr McGlynn, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 761. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 264 9.142 During a discussion on the nature of the $5.8 million cost, the Directorate explained that 'it is a social welfare cost...it is an estimation of the difference in the social we lfare that existed at the time, if you went with that strategy or not'. Additionally it was expalined that: It is based on a range of assumptions about what would exist in 2025 and what would need to exist in 2030; that then incorporates within it assumpti ons about population growth, economic growth and other sorts of assumptions.1237 HYDROGEN REFUELLING S TATIONS 9.143 The Committee recounted recent news of a hydrogen fuelling station fire in Norway and asked what actions the Government has taken to ensure the safety of the Fyshwick hydrogen refuelling station. 9.144 The Minister replied: The station being built at Fyshwick is being done as a partnership with ActewAGL and Neoen. ActewAGL, of course, are quite expert in the provision of liquid fuels and have done it for man y years. They are subject to a range of both their own organisational safety requirements as well as a range of government regulatory requirements. The best advice I have been given on this...is that probably it still would be more dangerous to go to a petr ol station than to a gas refuelling station. However, obviously there will be an examination of what happened at that incident in Norway and we will be working to make sure that we are aware of the lessons that come from that, if there are any that are directly applicable to the ACT. 1238 9.145 The Directorate added that ActewAGL has operated a refuelling station at the Fyshwick site safely for some time and that the refuelling station to be built 'will be subject to particular regulations in terms of safety and work place health and safety requirements'.1239 9.146 The Directorate then provided further information on the refuelling station and related safety issues: Obviously, hydrogen is a new technology for Australia. We understand that the facility that is under construction at Fyshwick will actually be Australia's first publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling station ... Obviously, land use and other approvals are required, ensuring appropriate zoning and the like. ... Again, it is fair to say that hydrogen refuelling has a range of safeguards built into it which are not available in your conventional fuel station ... There is a range of smart 1237 Mr McGlynn, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 762. 1238 Minister Rattenbury MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 763. 1239 Mr McGlynn, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 763. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFI CE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 265 technologies with hydrogen in that it is a closed system. When the nozzle, for want of a better term, attaches to the vehicle, it requires the vehicle to talk to the bowser and the bowser to talk to the vehicle to enable the flow of hydrogen. There is a safety measure there. Also, you cannot drive off in the vehicle with the pump still attached as it will not allow the vehicle to engage the eng ine until the connection from the bowser is actually disengaged. So there is a closed system. Hydrogen refuelling capability has additional safeguards. 1240 9.147 The Directorate also noted that the Planning and Development Act 2007 and the Dangerous Substances Act 2004 'in particular wrap around this facility and ensure that it will meet the appropriate planning obligations and obviously safety obligations'.1241 ACTSMART 9.148 In response to a question on the Actsmart program, the Directorate provided the following overview: It has a number of elements. It has a general household program and then some parts are focused particularly on low income households and assisting those in a variety of ways. It has a schools component where every school in the ACT is signed up to the Actsmart program and they go through an accreditation process where they go through the five different aspects of Actsmart. There is a business program as well. All three of those are part of the Actsmart program. They share some knowledge but they also have quite different approaches.1242 9.149 Further to this the Committee was informed that Actsmart 'has a range of community components as well: community gardens grants, community zero emission grants and also the community partnership agreement we have with the ACT Government with three community organisations'. 1243 9.150 On the low income element of the program, the Directorate indicated that: We support about 1,500 low income households per year. That gives low income households the opportunity to access a range of services, from education advice only right through to draught -proofing support with no interest loans for appliances and also appliance upgrades. It also connects with our solar program. 1244 1240 Mr Harding, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 764. 1241 Mr Harding, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 764. 1242 Mr McGlynn, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 766. 1243 Ms Malouf, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 766. 1244 Ms Malouf, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 767. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 266 9.151 When the Committee inquired as to the take- up of the low -income pro gram it was indicated that it was 'oversubscribed'.1245 9.152 On the business and school elements of the program, the Directorate informed the Committee that: With our business programs we support almost 1,000 businesses with the waste and recycling program, with annual accreditation into that program, and that is from small businesses to large businesses. With the schools program we have 100 per cent of schools, public, private and independent, signed up to the schools program.1246 9.153 In response to a foll ow-up question, the Directorate informed the Committee about the organics part of the program: Our 1,000 businesses have to have an organics component to become accredited. To give you some idea of the organics diverted from landfill, until 31 March this y ear the 626 accredited sites have sent 2,877 cubic metres of organic material to an organics reuse facility to be broken down more efficiently than in landfill.1247 9.154 It was also explained that organic worm farms are one example of the organics component of the program and that this could either be delivered through an in -house set up or through a commercial arrangement with an external organics recycler. 9.155 The Committee asked about the type of advice that the Government provides to smaller businesses and were inf ormed that: We tailor the advice depending on the site of the business, whether they are a multi - tenanted unit, whether they can manage it if they have got a large enough amount ... It depends on the amount of material, the organics that they produce. It also depends on how they process a lot of their material. Lots of places get fruit and vegetables arriving already peeled and they do not create a lot more waste. It is tailored advice for each individual business or school. 1248 9.156 In response to a question on wheth er it is more cost effective to send organic waste to landfill, the Directorate stated: If you just got the compost it would be cheaper to send it to landfill. But the other recycling methods \u2014the mixed recycling and the paper recycling \u2014make it cost effecti ve if you do it as a package. If you were just sending waste to landfill it would be a certain price. It would be cheaper if you put in your mixed recycling and your paper 1245 Ms Le Couteur MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 767; Ms Malouf, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 767. 1246 Ms Malouf, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 767. 1247 Ms Malouf, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p p. 767- 768. 1248 Ms Malouf, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 768.

You can run through th e program at least at cost neutral. Many organisations actually save money.1249 9.157 The Committee asked about the number of attendees that Actsmart events generally attracts and were informed that: Our household workshops have anywhere between 30 and 60 attendees . We run those workshops in local areas to try to take the actual information to the suburbs. They are run through local libraries, community centres and school halls. We had one last week on heating your home without breaking the bank; that had 35 attende es. They are generally run after hours to catch people who cannot get to something during the day. 1250 Recommendation 1 39 9.158 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government increase funding for the low -income energy efficiency program , which is over -subscribed. LAND STRATEGY (4.1) 9.159 Output 4.1, Land Strategy, provides strategic, policy and planning direction and support, including preparation of the four- year Indicative Land Release Program (ILRP). The ILRP sets out the Government's intended program for land release and seeks to facilitate housing diversity, provide affordable housing, stimulate economic activity, and meet the demand for land in the Territory and support a competitive land development and construction market. An element of this includes undertaking due diligence for land that contributes the ILRP.1251 MATTERS CONSIDERED 9.160 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Land Strategy included: decrease in number of residential dwellings to be released;1252 Indicative Land Release Program;1253 due diligence Studies;1254 1249 Ms Malouf, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 770. 1250 Ms Malouf, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 771. 1251 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 11. 1252 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 881- 886; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 327, answered 4 July 2019. 1253 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 882- 886; 911- 912. 1254 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 911- 912.

The Directorate responded in terms of the factors involved in developing the four -year indicative land release program, stating: In terms of developing the four -year indicative land release program, the directorate looks at a range of factors, including expected demand and policy. We need to factor all of that in. There was a particular need over the previous period for the additional greenfields sites in particular.... we look at a range of factors in developing the indicative land release program. That includes looking at demand. Also, we need to be very mindful of government policy. We have the planning strategy 2018 that looks at an urban renewal greenfield split of 70 -30, so 70 per cent of new dwellings within the existing urban footprint. Not all of that will be delivered by the government. 1262 9.162 The Committee then queried whether the reas on fewer blocks were available was because the Directorate was hoping for more infill and the Directorate indicated that this was the case an d that they then needed 'to look at the strategies that are available to the government to encourage the private se ctor to assist in delivering on that planning strategy and the outcomes.'1263 1255 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 915- 917. 1256 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p p. 920- 922. 1257 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 922- 923. 1258 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 923, 925- 927. 1259 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 923- 925; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 328, answered 4 July 2019. 1260 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 932; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 329, answered 4 July 2019; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 330, answered 4 July 2019. 1261 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 Jun e 2019, pp. 927- 929; 934. 1262 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of , 26 June 2019, p. 882. 1263 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 882. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 269 9.163 The Committee asked how many dwellings need to be released each year so as to keep up with population growth and was informed that: We saw the planning strategy 2018 estimate that one scenario could require about 100,000 new dwellings by 2041. The most recent indicative land release notes that we expect we will have approximately 32,000 people coming to Canberra by 2023. That averages about 8,000 people per year. That is what we are seeing in population growth. Based on the assumptions of household size \u2014who requires housing for example \u2014we anticipate we will need approximately 3,076 dwellings per year. Based on that 2018 strategy, it is another scenario of closer to about 4,000 a year. We will monitor this land release program annually and look at the land supply.1264 9.164 In more detailed questioning the Committee asked why with increased demand is there not an increase in the number of dwellings released. In response the Directorate stated: ...it is not just for the government to meet the demand in terms of population. It is not just a simple equation where there is an increased population and therefore the government must release more gre enfield land; we need to consider other planning objectives. Going back to the planning strategy, with 70 per cent of that growth being contained within the existing urban footprint, the government does not own all of that land. There are other policies that will facilitate the private sector to step in and assist in meeting that demand. 1265 9.165 More specifically the Committee asked whether the release of fewer greenfield blocks, with a corresponding high level of demand would increase the price for the blocks. T he Directorate indicated that this would not be the case: ... because we do not want all of that demand to be catered for in greenfield areas. It is not, as I said, a simple equation of there being people needing housing and therefore it is all greenfields. We need to think about how we want the city to grow. The government has made a very clear decision, through the planning strategy, that it wants to protect those things that we have heard from the Canberra community are important to them, which are the cit y in the landscape concept. That means we cannot continue to spread out. 1266 9.166 When pressed further on this issue the Directorate indicated that it did not necessarily follow that the price of new blocks would increase because they were now a premium product. T hey stated that during the conversation with the Canberra community: 1264 Minister Gentleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 913. 1265 Mr Ponton, Proof Tra nscript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 882- 883. 1266 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 883. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 270 We heard very strongly that the Canberra community were quite comfortable with the idea of a more compact and efficient city. They were comfortable with moving away from what was then a fifty -fifty split to a higher ratio of development within the existing urban footprint, provided that, as a result of that, they were seeing high quality development and good quality public spaces. The planning strategy talks about how we are going to deliv er on that. 1267 9.167 The Committee continued with its questioning along these lines, asking the Directorate to take into account the 2015 Winton housing choices survey, which indicated the 91% of respondents wanted to live in a detached house. The Directorate indi cated that: Of course, we have also talked in this room about the context of many of those questions. We asked a series of questions, including, \"In an ideal world, what would you like to see?\"; then, as we started to drill down into what that might mean i n terms of infrastructure costs, impact on the environment, and what it means if we start to spread the city outwards as opposed to being more compact, people started to balance what was really important to them. That was when, as a result of the further d rilling down in that particular survey, people were more comfortable with the idea of a compact and efficient city. It is important to understand the context of the questions, and I have made that point previously. 1268 9.168 Minister Gentleman, Minister for Plannin g and L and Management (the Minister), also responded, stating: ...the newer Winton research shows that there are just as many people who want to downsize into denser living as, as you mentioned earlier, want to upsize. It is a reflection of what we have seen in the community and implemented in our planning process that is now coming out in the research as well. 1269 9.169 The Directorate then went on to state that: It is also important to note that since 2015 and the minister's statement of planning intent, that was th e start of the conversation. We moved to housing choices, which was an outcome of the statement of planning intent. We undertook the research with Winton. Since then, and importantly over 2018, we undertook extensive community engagement in relation to the planning strategy refresh. That is where we really started to drill down in terms of this idea of the major policy shift potentially being a change from a fifty -fifty split. 1270 1267 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 884. 1268 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 885. 1269 Minister Ge ntleman MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 885- 886. 1270 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 886. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 271 MOLONGLO 3 9.170 The Committee noted the inclusion of Molonglo 3 in the land release p rogram and queried as to whether there had been any planning undertaken in relation to transport options for the new suburb. The Committee was informed that: There is a planning design framework which sets out the structural elements of Molonglo 3. There i s further work being done by EPSDD on how the transport routes operate through Molonglo 3, in the sense that Molonglo 3 is the several suburbs that sit on the north side of the Molonglo River.1271 9.171 When asked about the work being done in relation to community facilities , including schools and shopping centres for the new suburb , Minister Berry, Minister for housing and Suburban Development (the Minister), indicated that: The whole planning process for new suburbs also involves various directorates. The Educatio n Directorate and the Transport Canberra and City Services directorate are involved in the planning of new suburbs, to make sure that those facilities are available and are built into the whole suburb design.1272 9.172 The Directorate also indicated that: As part o f the early planning we make sure that the land is appropriately available. Then we continue to work with our colleagues in other directorates in terms of their modelling to make sure that we have allocated land for particular types of uses. At the high le vel, we do a needs analysis of what we think in general terms would be required. We make sure that there is sufficient land available. Then we start to go into the finer grain of understanding, for example, what type of school would be required, whether it is government or non-government . That involves a lot of work with our colleagues in Education, who undertake modelling. We work with other parts of government\u2014 the Community Services Directorate, for example\u2014 to understand what land might need to be releas ed over that four -year process. I guess that is a long way of saying that land is available. We continue to refine the work to understand the exact need and then make sure that the land is available in the land release program. 1273 We have the city cluster, w hich is a monthly meeting of directors -general and deputies where we deal with these issues at the higher level to make sure that we have a complete understanding in terms of city issues and to make sure that we are managing all of those concerns. 1274 1271 Mr Gordon, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 923. 1272 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 J une 2019, p. 925. 1273 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 925. 1274 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 925- 926. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 272 9.173 In relation to clarifying the planning for bus services to a new suburb the Directorate informed the Committee that: We work with our colleagues but, of course, I cannot make the decision to put a bus route into a new suburb. But I will work very closely with my colleagues. Then Transport Canberra and City Services would brief the minister appropriately. But the short answer is that we know that we need to get bus services into new estates as early as possible. We work with our colleagues to make sure that that happens.1275 Recommendation 140 9.174 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that public transport is provided to all new estates and significant recreational facilities, such as Stromlo Park. Recommendation 141 9.175 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that community, commercial and educational facilities are provided to align with demand in new suburbs. MOLONGLO BRIDGE 9.176 During discussions on Molonglo 3 the Committee asked about the current status of plans for the bridge across the Molonglo River. The Directorate indicated that: That work is currently underway. It is being considered by the design review panel. We talked earlier about the design review panel. That is not just for new buildings; it is for infrastructure as well. It is so that our infrastructure has appropriate design and is not just chunks of concrete. We want to make sure that we have infrastructure \u2014 1276 9.177 When pressed further on a possible time frame the Directorate indicated that was 'in early design' and there is not 'a clear budget commitment to the construction'1277 even though there is a 'commitment to early design...[which]...will inform a design and construct tender process.'1278 9.178 When pressed again the Directorate indicated to the Committee in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice that: 1275 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 926. 1276 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 923. 1277 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 923; Mr Gordon, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 923. 1278 Mr Gordon, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 924. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 273 The final section of John Gorton Drive, linking Cotter Road and William Hovell Drive/Coulter Drive, will include 1.7km of arterial road approach to a 225 -metre bridge crossing of the Molonglo River. The design and construction will allow for the inclusion of additional road and bridge works that could accommodate Light Rail in the future. Transport Canberra and City Services - Land Release Infrastructure Section is currently preparing the preliminary sketch plan (PSP) designs for this final section which will inform a 'Design and Construction' Business Case to inform a budget bid in the next 1 -2 years. The current work is funded in the 2018 -19 Budget for $1,100,000. The project also includes the preparation and submission of a developme nt application for Territory development approval. This work is anticipated to be finalised by March 2020. Should the design and construction of the proposed works be supported with budget, the detail design could commence around November 2020 and construc tion commence around late 2021. The construction of the bridge and road approaches are expected to take three years to complete. 1279 Recommendation 142 9.179 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide a timeline for the construction of the bridge along John Gorton Drive, crossing the Molonglo River , and ensure it is built before there is significantly more population growth in Molonglo.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 Centre;1288 limitations properties;1289 and urban renewal needs - shopping centres.1290 KEY ISSUES URBAN RENEWAL INITIATIVES 9.182 In discussions about what actually constituted urban renewal the Committee asked whether urban renewal was a discrete program or a by -product of ot her programs. The Directorate was informed that it was 'a by -product of some other activities that occur, but there are also discrete programs within the urban renewal portfolio as it is defined'1291 9.183 In this context the Committee asked if there was any consol idated list in existence that may indicate what initiatives are deemed to belong under the urban renewal banner. Minister Stephen -Smith, Minister for Urban Renewal (the Minister), indicated: Not specifically, I would have thought. A lot of the activity that the City Renewal Authority do is obviously urban renewal and they produce their reports about the things that they have been doing. We have various reports about the things that EPSDD is doing specifically within the urban renewal portfolio. But it depends on how broadly you want to classify the term \"urban renewal\". You could argue that building a new road is urban renewal. 1292 9.184 The Minister also stated that: The question of what sits within the portfolio is really about major urban renewal proje cts outside the City Renewal Authority precinct \u2014projects like the Kingston arts 1283 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1042- 1044. 1284 Proof pp. 1051- 1059. 1285 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 767. 1286 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p p. 1049- 1051. 1287 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p p. 1053- 1054. 1288 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June pp. 1139- 1140. 1289 Proof pp. 1055- 1056. 1290 Proof Evidence 2019, pp.1054- 1056. 1291 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1039. 1292 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1039- 1040. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 275 precinct and the brickworks, essentially, or a project where the Suburban Land Agency is responsible for the release of land within brownfield areas as well as some of the policy things around urban renewal, such as the urban renewal team working with Transport Canberra and City Services on the Woden experiment to then look at what we can learn from the Woden experiment that will help us to do activation in other parts of the ci ty. That is the policy side of the urban renewal team. Then there are the housing demonstration projects, which obviously work very closely with the housing choices policy process that Minister Gentleman has responsibility for. It is about the practical s ide of what are we looking for in these specific developments that will be for urban renewal and, for the housing demonstration projects that do not have sites, how can we help identify sites; and for those who have sites, how can we help them get through the regulatory processes that they might need to go through. 1293 9.185 When asked if there was a document that forecasted the scheduling and planning of urban renewal initiatives in the context of the planning sphere the Directorate stated: In terms of land release , obviously there is the indicative land release program, then through some of the other planning work, the planning policy work coming out of that, there will be sites identified for future urban renewal opportunities. It is a bit of a continuum in that w e undertake the planning work and from that we might identify land that we think will need to go onto the indicative land release program. The budget papers talk about due diligence work, further work that we will need to do to get the work ready for release. At the right time we pass it over to our colleagues in the Suburban Land Agency. We have developed a framework to help us clearly map out which parts of the organisation are responsible and at what point, and what information we transfer over to the Suburban Land Agency. 1294 9.186 The Committee then asked if there was some part of the budget papers that shows all the budget projections for urban renewal initiatives as a whole and was advised by the Minister that there was no such section although it was indicat ed that budget paper 3 has a section on capital initiatives and that: As you go through that you can say, \"That one is in a brownfield site and involves building a new building or renewing a site.\" But it is not consolidated all under the heading of urban renewal; it is directorate by directorate.1295 1293 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evide nce, 27 June 2019, p. 1040. 1294 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1040. 1295 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1041. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 276 9.187 When asked if in future budget -cycles such a statement or consolidated list could be included the Minister stated: I think that is probably something that is worth considering on balance \u2014how many different types of budget papers you want to produce as part of the budget process. We split things up in a whole lot of different ways. But that is something we could certainly consider looking at.1296 9.188 The Directorate further indicated that: ... in developing budget bids for consideration by government we certainly work across directorates, with our colleagues, to identify what work is required to support urban renewal initiatives. Whilst it might end up as a separate line item in the budget for another directorate, in the early development of those bids we are thinking about how it all fits together.1297 Recommendation 143 9.189 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government publish a consolidated list of urban renewal projects that are currently underway, or have been committed to by the ACT Government, including detailed capital and expenditure, by agency. Recommendation 144 9.190 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide a definition of urban renewal in Budget Paper 3 , explaining its difference to other development and infrastructure upgrade programs . IDEAS FOR URBAN RENEWAL 9.191 The Committee asked where the suggestions for urban renewal projects originate and were informed that: We get such approaches and that would then come through the urban renewal teams and Mr Fitzgerald's team and we would brief ministers as appropriate.1298 9.192 The Minister also added that: 1296 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1041. 1297 Mr. Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1041. 1298 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1052. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 277 I think, though, on those requests about the refresh of local shopping centres, that does go to the intersection between EPSDD and Transport Canberra and City Services. A lot of the work around refreshing the outdoor areas of a suburban shopping centre would fit with city services. 1299 9.193 When asked about where more significant 'uplift' requests would be directed the Minister stated: It would probably depend in p art on where it comes from. If we have a community council saying, \"We want to do some work with you,\" that is something that we would look at. I know the Kingston and Barton Residents Association and the Inner South Canberra Community Council have raised with me interest in doing some more work at the Kingston shops around refreshing and renewing. But it potentially might be a landlord looking to do some redevelopment of a building in that zone and then that is really a question for the planning process around what is \u2014 1300 9.194 The Committee then expressed a concern that areas outside of the City Renewal Authority boundaries were not getting the same focus as those in the city when it came to 'uplift' and were informed by the Directorate that: In terms of the City Renewal Authority, if I may, I meet regularly with my colleague Malcom Snow, the CEO, and other directorates \u2014TCCS and the like \u2014and when these things come up in other areas, or even for that matter within the city renewal precinct, we identify where it best sits. Where it is outside the city renewal precinct or it is not a greenfields area and we are getting those approaches then the approaches are often to me or to Mr Rutledge. Mr Fitzgerald often also receives those requests. To say that they do not recei ve the same level of, I think the word you used was, interest or priority, is certainly not the case. When the approaches are made to us we will consider those very carefully and, as necessary, provide briefings to ministers or connect people through to ot her parts of government \u2014for example, TCCS. 1301 WODEN COMMUNITY CENTRE 9.195 The Committee noted that there are monies provided in the budget for the design and documentation approvals for a new Woden community centre. They were advised by Minister Steel, Minister f or Community Services and Facilities (the Minister) that: Planning for this facility will be an ongoing process to ensure that it is meeting the needs of the community more broadly, as well as Woden Community Service, which it 1299 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1052. 1300 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1052. 1301 Mr Ponton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1052. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 278 will house. We have been work ing with Woden Community Service on the first design brief for the community centre. Over the next 18 months the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate will continue to work with Woden Community Service and engage with other key sta keholders in Woden, the Woden Valley Community Council included, to seek input into the design brief. 1302 9.196 The Directorate further indicated that 'the ultimate aim is to work towards a DA by 2021 for that development.'1303 9.197 When asked about the scope of the projec t and what the community are looking to see in the centre the Minister indicated that: We are trying to get a sense, and we have been working closely with Woden Community Centre, of exactly what they might need, not only for what they are doing now but for what they might need to do in 10 years. Their services have been growing quite significantly as a result of their winning significant tenders from the ACT government to deliver a range of community services, but also the community is growing in Woden. We have been working with them to make sure that their functional brief informs any future design work. From the community more broadly, they would like to see a large community space that is flexible that can be used for a range of different things, whether that is to deliver programs potentially for the arts and maybe some sporting events as well. 1304 9.198 The Directorate further stated: A lot of what they are looking at goes to the basic elements, being the number of desks, counselling rooms, meeting rooms, activity spaces and sensory rooms for people with disabilities. That is at the first stage of what we are looking at. Obviously, from there, as the minister mentioned, there are opportunities for additional spaces like half- court basketball stadiums and th e like. That is all part of the functional brief at this stage.1305 EASTLAKE 9.199 Following confirmation that Eastlake was considered urban renewal, due to it be being a brownfields site , the Committee asked what the plans were for the area and were informed that: 1302 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p 1139. 1303 Mr Fitzgerald, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p 1139. 1304 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, pp. 1139- 1140. 1305 Mr Fitzgerald, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p 1140. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 279 Quite a lot of background work has been done around the potential staging of development \u2014that work is still underway \u2014and the potential number of dwellings to be released or to be built on releases on that site. Some of that is reflected in the indicative land release program. I think there are two years of releases scheduled for East Lake in the current four -year forecast for indicative land release. That would give you some idea of the number of dwellings on those particular areas. But there is also work about staging activity in relation to things like the switching station in Kingston. That will obviously need to be demolished. Some more work around that is being worked through between EPSDD and SLA.1306 9.200 The Directorate acknowledged that the focus of land r elease had not been on the Eastlake area for some time but advised the Committee that 'the government sought to re- look at East Lake, knowing that things have changed, the city has changed and people's housing choices have changed \u2014people's desires to live in attached, semidetached and unit developments. '1307 9.201 The Committee then asked about the possible vision for the site and were informed that: I think there are a number of issues there. Obviously with the future of the Kingston railway station \u2014which we are no t intending to move, just to be clear \u2014there is potential opportunity for transit -oriented development, depending on future transport networks. But there is also the interface with the Jerrabomberra wetlands. There are some potentially really great opportun ities there to do something new and different in the way we develop the urban realm, with water sensitive urban design and that wetland interface. So there are a whole lot of things that we can get quite excited about. But there are also challenges in dev eloping that site in relation to the existing uses of some of those areas around the railway corridor, and obviously The Causeway. 1308 9.202 Noting the proximity of the Jerrabomberra Wetlands the Committee then asked about the management of the interface between the wetlands and the urban areas. In response the Directorate acknowledged that: That is part of the reason why we need to continue to do some additional studies. The wetlands have developed during that time, and both the visitor experience and the birds that are being attracted to the wetlands are far different even from where they were 10 years ago, such is the success of that. So we really need to have a look at that. Again, that is what we will be doing in the studies coming up.1309 1306 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1050. 1307 Mr Rutledge, Proof Tr anscript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1050. 1308 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1051. 1309 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1051. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 280 Recommendation 145 9.203 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that the Jerrabomberra Wetlands are protected as part of the future development of Eastlake. LOOSE -FILL ASBESTOS INSULATION ERADICATION SCHEME (5.1) 9.204 Output 5.1, Loose -fill Asbestos Insulation Eradication Scheme, is delivered by the Asbestos Response Taskforce. The taskforce provides support and advice to affected homeowners, the Canberra community, industry and Government. 1310 MATTERS CONSIDERED 9.205 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Loose -fill Asbestos Insulation Eradication Scheme included: properties surrendered as part of buy -back program in last 12 months;1311 properties yet to be purchased as part of buy -back program;1312 properties not participating in buy -back program;1313 letters from WorkSafe to owners of Mr Fluffy residences;1314 blocks sold for more that was paid to owners;1315 non-disclosure agreements;1316 private demolitions;1317 overall cost in relation to initial projections;1318 payments to agents;1319 and 1310 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 12. 1311 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1018. 1312 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1018- 1019. 1313 Proof pp. 1019- 1020. 1314 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp.1020- 1021; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 373, answered 5 July 2019. 1315 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp.1020- 1021; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 375, answered 11 July 2019. 1316 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1022; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 171, answered 4 July 2019. 1317 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1022. 1318 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1022- 1023. 1319 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2 019, p. 1023.

That includes consideration of things like supporting the elderly who may wish to remain in their home for the final years of their lives, flexible transition arrangements for those who have complex circumstances, including medical circumstances and things like the provision of tip fee relief for the disposal of private demolition waste at Mugga Lane Resource Management Centre. There is a range of c onsiderations that we are working through at the moment in close consultation, as far as possible, with the remaining property owners. 1322 9.208 The Committee then queried whether future measures would involve compulsory acquisition and were informed that 'w e have not ruled in or out compulsory acquisition. But we do not think we will need to get there. '1323 9.209 The Directorate further stated that: What we have found, particularly this year, is that the position remains clear that eradication of loose -fill asbestos is the ultimate goal. That has not changed. What we found is that people who are not participating in the scheme are not doing so for very different reasons \u2014-1324 Everyone who has participated in the scheme has also done so for different reasons. What we are doing i s trying to work out individual pathways for the remaining 14. I am not sure that they will participate in the scheme. Maybe they will undertake private demolition. What we have found just by talking to them \u2014they may come in and meet directly with an execu tive member of the directorate or they may talk to our personal 1320 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1023- 1024. 1321 Proof Evidence , 2019, pp. 1018- 1019. 1322 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1019. 1323 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Ev idence , 27 June 2019, p. 1019. 1324 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1019. SELECT COMM ITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 282 support staff \u2014is that people who had not previously engaged in the scheme are finding a new reason to and they are looking for those pathways. I imagine that for the remaining 14, private demo lition will probably be the most likely outcome.1325 9.210 Upon noting that the likelihood of private demolition the Committee sought clarification on whether this would be voluntary and were informed that this would be the case - 'Voluntarily, yes I think that is where they will end up...'1326 9.211 The Committee were then informed that despite the buy -back scheme ending at the end of June 2020 there was likely to be 'an ongoing commitment to asbestos removal after that' and that 'management of those properties is very import ant through an asbestos management plan.' 1327 The Minister went on to explain that in terms of ongoing engagement: ... the government and the task force recognise that there will be, obviously, a long - term, ongoing impact of the Mr Fluffy episode on all of th e home owners and previous residents of Mr Fluffy properties. There will be ongoing engagement. I met with Dr Sue Packer the other day, who is chairing the community and expert reference group around the legacy project. It was a very useful meeting to talk directly with her about the experience of the Fluffy owners and what she has experienced as chair of that group. There will be ongoing engagement around the legacy of Mr Fluffy for all of those who want to participate, in addition to the management of the houses.1328 LETTERS FROM WORKSAFE TO OWNERS OF MR FLUFFY RESIDENCES 9.212 The Committee made note of some letters that had been sent to owners of Mr Fluffy residents by WorkSafe and asked if these letters had included information about possible imprisonment. The C ommittee was informed that: In the government's ongoing involvement and engagement with the remaining occupiers of affected premises, WorkSafe has been engaging to a very large degree with the existing owners and those who have not participated in the sche me. Over the past two years we have sent a total of six letters outlining assistance, responsibilities and ways forward for the owners. We have had multiple engagements through phone calls, visits and whatever with the people. So we have ongoing engagement . 1329 9.213 The Committee were further informed that the most recent letter 'outlined some of the legal consequences of non -compliance with the community safety and responsibilities' and whilst it was acknowledged that the letter may have been construed as threaten ing the Committee was 1325 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1019. 1326 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1020. 1327 Mr Rutledge, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1020. 1328 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1020. 1329 Mr Jones, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1020. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 283 informed that this was the 'sixth letter, as part of an ongoing, intensive two -year engagement.'1330 9.214 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice WorkSafe informed the Committee that they had: ...forwarded a total of six letters to loose -fill asbestos affected property owners between March 2017 and June 2019. The letters varied in content depending on the owner's compliance with the Dangerous Substances (General) Regulation 2004. The actual numbe r of letters each homeowner received depended on the owner's specific circumstances and compliance with the Dangerous Substances {General) Regulation 2004. Definitions (outlined below) of Compliant, Partial Compliant and Non -Compliant have been consistently applied to all letters. Unless stated otherwise all letters were sent to owners of the property. March 2017 - Letter 1 contained three options which were used depending on whether WorkSafe ACT had received an Asbestos Contamination Report (ACR) and ass ociated records of works: 1. Compliant - WorkSafe ACT has received the Report for your property and the record of works showing compliance with its requirements. 2. Partial Compliant - WorkSafe ACT has received the Report for your property but no record of works that may have been required within the six(6) month timeframe. 3. Non- Compliant - WorkSafe ACT has not received the Report for your property and no record of works that may have been undertaken. June 2017 - Letter 2 was only being sent to those owners who wer e Partial or Non -compliant, Compliant owners did not receive Letter 2. April 2018 - letter 3 was sent to those owners who were Partial or Non -Compliant, including properties that had become Non -Compliant due to Reports expiring after two years. Letter 3 was also sent to tenants. September 2018 - Letter 4 was sent to those owners who were Non -Compliant. February 2019 - Letter 5 was sent to those owners who were Non -Compliant. June 2019 - Letter 6 was sent to those owners who were Non -Compliant.1331 1330 Mr Jones, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1021. 1331 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 372, answered 4 July 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 284 PUBLIC HOUSING RENEWAL TASKFORCE (6.1) 9.215 Output 6.1, Public Housing Renewal Taskforce is delivering 1,288 replacement public housing dwellings that will better meet the needs of tenants, now and into the future as part of the ACT Government's public housing renewal program. The program supports the renewal of Canberra's urban areas as it works with Urban Renewal, the City Renewal Authority and Housing ACT, to support the sale of older multi- unit public housing properties that are no longer fit for purpose. 1332 MATTERS CONSIDERED 9.216 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Public Housing Renewal Taskforce included: engagement with tenants for relocations;1333 alleged upsurge of anti- social behaviour by newly relocated tenants;1334 vulnerable people being located near violent people;1335 heating/cooling in new housing stock (also discussed under Housing ACT);1336 next phase of public housing renewal;1337 regions for new developments;1338 asset recycling program;1339 and process for proving that like for like housing has been provided by ACT Government.1340 KEY ISSUES NEXT PHASE OF PUBLIC HOUSING RENEWAL 9.217 The Committee asked about the new phase of the public housing renewal program and how staff would be transitioning from the old to the new program.

A number of my team will transition across to that team to assist in that process. The renewal program itself was linked to the asset recycling initiative. That program is complete. There is a transition. Some of those staff have been retained with that knowledge to go forth on the next program . 1341 9.218 The Directorate further indicated that: Part of the work we are doing in the evaluation stage is developing that set of guidelines as to what we have learned through the program so it is not lost. Our audit committee has been specifically targeting \u2014asking for us to have that piece of work that we can hand over. There has been quite a long list of lessons learned through the process . 1342 9.219 The Committee then asked for a br eakdown of the district locations where tenants had been located and the physical types of housing. The Committee were provided with the following district breakdown: In Belconnen we had 94; Weston Creek, 36; and total it was 30 suburbs . 1343 9.220 In an answer to a Question Taken on Notice the Directorate provided a breakdown of the dwelling type delivered by the Public Housing Renewal Taskforce in the districts indicated :1344 Region/Type Single Residential Townhouses Units Total Belconnen 10 27 57 94 Gungahlin 104 109 318 531 Inner North 1 6 210 217 Inner South 2 2 Molonglo 24 26 176 226 Tuggeranong 99 74 173 1341 Mr Fitzgerald, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 937. 1342 Mr Fitzgerald, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 937. 1343 Mr Fitzgerald, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 938. 1344 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 322, answered on 4 July 2019.

Certainly, as we progress through the program, for starters, the program allows for six -star energy rating apartments, and we have consistently got that. Our units are actually seven -star. Combined with that, we are now goi ng back and retrofitting window treatments to a lot of our properties to avoid some of the situations that I am aware are occurring. So we have heard some of that feedback and we are looking at how we can address that. 1345 9.222 Further to this the Committee asked about whether instead of just window treatments air - conditioning split systems will be installed From February 2017 we started installing split systems. The first 500 properties \u2014just over 500 properties \u2014that we constructed as part of the renewal program h ad heaters only. We have now replaced them with split systems.1346 9.223 The Directorate further informed the Committee that a ir conditioning: It is not something that we have contemplated at this stage. Again, much like what we have done with the window treatments , we will listen to feedback. Our main source of feedback is Housing ACT, as the interface with the tenants. We will make an assessment as to whether we can do that.1347 Recommendation 146 9.224 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide improved window treatments, split systems or other equipment so that public housing dwelling s are habitable within temperature ranges experienced in Canberra. 1345 Mr Fitzgerald, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 936. 1346 Mr Fitzgerald, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 937. 1347 Mr Fitzgerald, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 937.

KEY ISSUES BUDGET ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT 9.227 The Committee discussed the Office of the Commissioner's budget arrangements.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 288 9.228 The Commissioner explained that: What always happens with the budget for my office is that there is a rollover for the state of the environment report, and we have always received that because the State of the environment report is not completed in a three -year cycle. It is completed in a four -year cycle.1357 9.229 The Commissioner explained, further, that the Commission had made a budget submission to 'because there was some suggestion that we were not going to get the rollover'. Following this, she said, 'there was then ongoing discussions about whether we would be getting the rollover. At one stage it was suggested that we would not be, but we now are'. She explained that the current budget increase reflects 'the fact that we get that rollover in relation to the state of the environment report'. 1358 COMMITTEE COMMENT 9.230 The Committee believes that the four -year reporting cycle for the State of the Environment Report could be better funded through a single grant to cov er the entire four -year reporting cycle rather than incorporating this funding into the core funding of the Officer of the Commissioner. Recommendation 147 9.231 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment provide funding for the State of the Environment Re port in a single grant on a four -year basis, rather than varying the core funding of the Office of the Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment. Recommendation 148 9.232 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment provide additional information in the budget papers detailing the funding allocated to the Office of the Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment. STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT REPORT 9.233 In response to a question on when the State of the Environment Report will be ready, the Commissioner provided the following answer: 1357 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 744. 1358 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 744. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISL ATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 289 It will be with the minister, as is required, in December this year. That is in accordance with the statutory requirements. The minister then has six clear sitting days to table the document, which will be in Feb ruary; then there are six months after that for the recommendations to be responded to. 1359 9.234 In reply to a follow -up question, the Commissioner indicated that the ecological footprint will be released as part of the State of the Environment Report.1360 9.235 The Commit tee asked whether the Commissioner had made any changes in making the latest Sate of the Environment Report compared to earlier ones. 9.236 The Commissioner informed the Committee that: We will adhere to the way in which state of the environment reports are alwa ys presented, in that there will be numerous chapters. The chapters will be along the lines of air, water, biodiversity and human settlement. Human settlement will include questions of energy, water and waste. 1361 There will also be, in this particular state of the environment report, a starting -out chapter which I am provisionally calling Indigenous Ngambri. In that particular chapter we will be dealing with issues of cultural heritage and Aboriginal people's perception of that here in the ACT. We have taken on board an Indigenous consultant to pick up that work ... The other thing that we will be doing is that we are intending to produce an interactive web design. That web design is coming together as we speak. That will be under embargo until such time as the minister has tabled the report in February because it would not be appropriate for it to be released any earlier. But I can tell you, in relation to that, that I now have working in the office a person with some GIS skills, so we have mapping skills in the office, which we did not have previously. 1362 HEROIC AND THE DAMMED REPORT - WATER ABSTRACTION CHARGE 9.237 The Committee asked about the Heroic and the Dammed report, noting that the Government did not accept the Commissioner's recommendation about funding fr om the Water Abstraction Charge (WAC) being directed to catchment management. 1363 The Committee wanted to know why this recommendation was not picked up. 1359 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 744. 1360 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 745. 1361 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evi dence , 24 June 2019, p. 745. 1362 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 745. 1363 See: Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment, The Heroic and the Dammed\u2014 Lower Cotter Catchment Restoration Evaluation, December 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 290 9.238 The Commissioner replied that: We are simply provided with the same response that you are. We are not giv en anything additional to what is provided to the Legislative Assembly about the fact that that report has been noted rather than accepted. The recommendation was made on the basis that our consultations, over the time that we produced that report, continu ed to raise with us the issue of needing ongoing financing for work that needed to be done in relation to the lower Cotter. It was not made lightly; you would not expect it would be. Over the time of putting the report together, there were, as I say, exten sive discussions with a range of experts about the need for there to be ongoing financing of the restoration program up there, and a monitoring and evaluation framework, which we have gone to some trouble to include in the report. 1364 9.239 In an Answer to a Questi on on Notice the Committee were informed that the funds derived from the WAC are intended to be spent on ACT Government management of the ACT's water resources and assist in helping improve catchment and water supply as well as other measures to protect an d enhance the environment.1365 According to the Answer to a Question on Notice, activities funded include: Biodiversity and Environmental Monitoring Environment Protection Water Utility Regulation Water Health Monitoring and Regulations Water Policy and Admin istration Land Management Programs (and delivery) aligned with Plans of management/Capital Works/Initiatives and Specific Projects that link to water related works or catchment management activities1366 Recommendation 149 9.240 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that the amount of money spent on improving waterways and preserving our drinking water is roughly equivalent to the amount of money raised by the Water Abstraction Charge. 1364 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 746. 1365 Answer to Questio n on Notice E19- 506, answered 12 July 2019. 1366 Answer to Question on Notice E19- 506, answered 12 July 2019. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (OFFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 291 HEROIC AND THE DAMMED REPORT - DUMPED VEHICLES 9.241 The Committee n oted that the Heroic and the Dammed report also mentioned the issue of dumped vehicles in the catchment area and asked if the legislative changes required to deal with this issue have been addressed in the proposed change to the Litter Act. 9.242 The Commissioner responded: No. I have been told that that matter is under consideration, and I have got the response in respect of that particular recommendation. I will say about that recommendation that that issue was raised in every field trip that we took in respect of the lower Cotter. It was raised because it was an ongoing issue. As this report was provided to the minister, I think none of us will forget that the Pierces Creek fire occurred at that same time. It is outside this particular catchment, or outside this area, but it occurred that night or just the afternoon beforehand. 1367 9.243 The Committee asked about the risks of restricting access for vehicles into the catchment area versus the requirement to ensure fire trails are accessible, well- maintained and free of overgrowth. 9.244 The Commissioner provided the following reply: There are risks either way. That was pointed out to me. Going over the area, it is very clear that there have been very significant endeavours to block off some of the roads or some of the paths that people have been using. It is also clear that there is a need to make sure that they are open for the purposes of fire hazard reduction and also dealing with what might be wildfires in that particular part of the landscape. It was raised with me as a complex problem that required ongoing analysis and assessment, on the ground monitoring, care and planning, and thinking through how you might keep people out of certain areas but how you make it possible for the relevant emergency vehicles to be c apable of getting in and dealing with issues. It is complex. 1368 COMMITTEE COMMENT 9.245 The Committee recognises that there is a need to restrict the access of vehicles into the catchment area, especially considering issues with the frequent dumping of vehicles i n the area. Despite this, the Committee believes it is vitally important that emergency vehicles can readily access the catchment and surrounding areas in times of emergency. 1367 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 747. 1368 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 748. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 292 Recommendation 150 9.246 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment ensure that roads and fire trails, including disused or restricted access trails, are maintained and accessible for emergency vehicles. BRUMBIES , FERAL PIGS AND FERA L DEER 9.247 The Committee asked whether actions by the New South Wales Government on the management of feral animal populations, such as brumbies, had negatively impacted the catchment area. 9.248 The Commissioner replied that: I was not on any field trip where I witnessed the impact of brumbies, but we certainly were shown what was happening with pigs and deer . They were matters that were raised persistently. We were also acquainted with what people said was the concerning risk of brumbies crossing from New South Wales to the ACT. There is nothing to stop them from doing so, basically. At one stage, I and my office were part of a field trip that did go out and have a look at what was concerning about where brumbies might find their way into Namadgi, for instance, but I did not witness any personally myself, and it is not the subject of any commentary, because th at is not what we saw. It is what we have been acquainted with as a potential risk, and a real risk. 1369 COMMITTEE COMMENT 9.249 The Committee recognises that feral animals, such as brumbies, pigs and deer, can negatively impact the natural environment and the ACT' s catchment areas. The Committee believes that proper monitoring and management of these species is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the ACT's environment and ensure the quality of the catchment areas. Recommendation 151 9.250 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment notes that pigs, feral horses and deer can have significant impacts upon the natural environment, and continue to monitor the presence of all these species in the ACT catchment area . 1369 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p p. 748- 749. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 293 COMPLAINTS 9.251 The Committee asked about the number of complaints generated investigations undertaken by the Office of the Commissioner in 2018 -19. 9.252 The Office of the Commissioner provided the Committee with the following response: This year we received nine potential and real complaints. Six of those were potential and three were real. The reason we are starting to capture potential versus real is that the office does invest significant time in following up an inquiry and making sure that we have the best and most up -to-date informat ion on the issue, should it proceed to a complaint. There is still a fair bit of work the office does before a complaint form is lodged. We have had three formal complaints. One is closed; two are under inquiry at the moment. Our first action is to forward the complaint to the relevant directorates for an initial response. Then we proceed from there. To get to the point of your question, we have not had any formal investigations for complaints this year, but we do spend significant time making sure that we are able to respond to the constituent's matter. 1370 9.253 When asked to clarify that no investigations were generated as a result of complaints, the Office of the Commissioner replied that: We have received three. One was inquired into and closed. It was a matter of the independence of experts brought into the matter, so it was not something which we needed to launch a full investigation into. The other two are under inquiry and may well go through to investigation once we get those responses back. 1371 COMMITTEE COMME NT 9.254 The Committee notes that the Budget Papers indicate that the Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment achieved 100 per cent outcomes against 100 per cent targets for undertaking complaints generated investigations in accordance with the Terms of Reference. 1372 Evidence heard during the hearing indicates that for the previous financial year, the Commission conducted no complaints -generated investigations. The Committee believes that such reporting does not accurately reflect the work of the Commis sion in years where no complaints -generated investigations were carried out.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 294 9.255 The Committee recommends that the Commissioner for Sustainability and the Environment does not report that 100 per cent of complaints investigations are complet ed in years where investigations have not taken place. DECLARATION OF CLIMATE EMERGENCY 9.256 The Committee wanted the opinion of the Commissioner on the ACT recent declaration of a climate emergency. 9.257 The Commissioner noted that the declaration brings the ACT i nto alignment 'with others who are showing leadership in respect of that issue' and that it would be addressed in the State of the Environment Report. 1373 9.258 Related to this, The Commissioner noted that the Office of the Commissioner was also engaged in work on the impact of climate change on sport. She explained: The reason I have asked the team to complete a piece of work on that is because it is not just about whether we are drought proofing our turf and our ovals; it is about how communities are going to deal with climate change realities from the point of view of health and sport and across demographics and the whole of the ACT. 1374 Recommendation 153 9.259 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government develop a climate change and sport and recreation strategy to ensure continued sport and recreation opportunities for ACT residents in a changing climate. STORY MAPS 9.260 The Committee noted that the Commission has made use of GIS story maps as part of its work. It wanted to know whether this material is produced in -house or by external contractors. 9.261 In response, the Commissioner informed the Committee that the two story maps it produced in relation to its plastic bags report and the Molonglo Valley Strategic Assessment Audit were produced in house. The Commissioner not ed that the Office of the Commissioner had invested in staff training to bring GIS and story mapping skills in house. It was explained that: We spent $16,000 on getting that skilling up into the office. The reason I have done that is that I see it as a mea ns of maintaining the skill in the office, developing and demonstrating that we can do that work, making sure we are assisting others in the 1373 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 749. 1374 Professor Auty, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 750.

I regard it as a really significant and serious part of the work of the office. 1375 9.262 In reply to a question on the effectiveness of story maps as a communication tool, the Commissioner said that 'story maps have been used by a vast array of people'. Earlier in t he hearing, the Commissioner noted that 1,000 people had viewed the story map on plastic bags and 1,900 people had viewed the one on the Molonglo Valley. 1376 9.263 The Committee asked how this viewing figures compared with non -story map media.

More owners are participating in the scheme. So some really positive signs. Nd, of course, in managing the levy the government asked us to take on that responsibility in January 2018 and we take that responsibility very seriously. We need to be able to demonstrate value for money, return on investment to those who contribute to the levy. And certainly we believe we are on course for doing that. 1393 9.267 The Authority went on to clarify that the i ncrease is due to the 'increase in the numbers of people contributing to the levy' and that the rate of the levy had not changed.1394 9.268 The Committee then queried the impact of the levy on business investment and were informed that some did question the applica tion of levy but that the answer to this was the delivery of 'the kind of results and outcomes that those who contribute to the levy expect.'1395 9.269 The Authority went on to say that: I think we realised that we have got to have empirical evidence. We have got t o metrics around his. We cannot just say we think there is more activity in Civic.

I think it all goes to that fundamental point that I think levy payers need to be able to see the effect of our work in managing that levy. And we realise we have got to have the hard numb ers to be able to do that. 1396 LEVY EXPENDITURE 9.270 The Committee queried the proportion of the city and marketing levy that was spent on event as opposed to maintenance and were informed by the agency that for the year that is about to end: 2 per cent - performa nce accountability framework; 15 per cent - city grants; and 3 per cent - safer city project contribution1397 9.271 The Agency also indicate d that: Partnerships and events, communications and engagement, 9 per cent; vibrant streets, which includes capital works, 21 per cent; and other capital works, 18 per cent. So it is quite a spread. The pie chart is made up of a whole lot of different elements. 1398 SUBURBAN LAND AGENCY (SLA) 9.272 The Suburban Land Agency (SLA) is a Territory Authority established under the City Renewal Authority and Suburban Land Agency Act 2017 . Its purpose is to deliver the ACT Government's desired suburban land development.1399 Its objectives are to: 1) encourage and promote: a) inclusive communities by delivering people -focussed neighbourhoods; b) suburban development and urban renewal, other than in the City Renewal Precinct, that supports: i) affordable living; ii) a safe and healthy population; iii) social inclusion; 1396 Mr Snow, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 18 June 2019, p. 288. 1397 Mr Snow, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 18 June 2019, pp. 293- 294. 1398 Mr Snow, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 18 June 2019, p. 294. 1399 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sust ainable Development , p. 75.

I hope we would have an outcome of our negotiations within the next month.'1410 1400 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 75. 1401 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1057- 1059. 1402 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1059. 1403 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1059- 1060. 1404 Proof pp. 1060- 1061. 1405 Proof pp. 1043- 1044. 1406 Proof Transcript Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 899- 900. 1407 Proof Transcript Evidence , 27 June 2019, pp. 1046- 1048. 1408 Proof Transcript Evidence , 2019, pp. 917- 920. 1409 Minister Stephen -Smith, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1057. 1410 Mr Dietz, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 Ju ne 2019, p. 1057. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 300 9.275 When asked by the Committee about the anticipated costings Minister Stephen -Smith, Minister for Urban Renewal (the Minister), and the Agency were unable t o release details of the related budget expenditure due to the ongoing negotiations. 9.276 The Committee then asked about the nature of the agreements with the arts organisations who will have to relocate once development on the precinct begins. The Committee wa s advised that: To respond to your question, we have been working really collaboratively and closely with artsACT who are the representatives of the seven arts organisations that are identified for qualification to the Kingston arts precinct. We have certainly had a number of sessions and meetings with the seven arts organisations which were leading towards the shaping of the agreement which now all of them have signed. The agreement is a non -binding agreement. It is really a goodwill agreement that reflec ts on a process that we all want to embark on post contracts being signed with the preferred tenderer. In particular, it addresses the extent of engagement that we want to have with the arts organisations on the design development of their facilities. It does deal with other things, like future management of the precinct. But that is really sort of the artsACT and arts organisations part of work that they will do together in establishing how that is going to roll out once the buildings are together. 1411 COMMI TTEE COMMENT 9.277 The Committee notes that following the Estimates hearings, the ACT Government entered into a partnership agreement with GEOCON to deliver the Kingston Precinct Foreshore Arts Precinct project. 9.278 The Committee is of the understanding that the nex t phase of the project will be design development and community consultation in relation to the Estate Development Plan and any Development Applications relevant to the site. Recommendation 154 9.279 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that the Minister for Urban Renewal, by the last sitting day of 2019, update the Legislative Assembly on the status of the Kingston Foreshore Arts Precinct, including, but not limited to, how the precinct design will respond to the needs of the arts organisatio ns that will be located there. 1411 Ms Sharp, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1058. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 301 MINGLE 9.280 The Committee asked a bout the recent changes involved in the Mingle program and were informed that: The big changes we have seen in the last 12 months include that we have tripled the number of activities delivered ac ross Canberra over five suburbs \u2014Wright, Coombs, Taylor, Throsby and Moncrieff. We have also tripled the attendance levels since last year. The reasons for that have been the increase in partnerships and collaboration not only across government but in the industry. One of the big achievements this year is through the Canberra Institute of Technology, where we have partnered with the community development students to deliver a whole program of activities. Those students are having real -life experience to then send them out into the workforce with.1412 9.281 The Agency further explained the collaboration with the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) to the Committee stating that CIT: ...have a community development class and there are about 30 students in that program. Part of the work we have done is that we had one of their student work in our office for an 80 -hour program as a full learning mentor program. This year we have delivered five activities with groups of students. We have mentored them on how to deliver eve nts, how to research, how to work with local communities and also how to share their learnings in communities around cultural awareness. Most recently we delivered a storytelling with food event at CIT in Reid, where the students told the history of the recipes and the foods they had cooked. There was huge positive feedback. For us it is a real partnership within government and also puts students in the position where they are getting real -life experience. 1413 9.282 When asked about future events identified by residents for the coming year the Agency indicated that: There are a couple of things. We are looking at a feast event to celebrate the end of Ramadan. Diwali again is going to be very popular. We have received a number of inquiries about doing Christmas or end of year celebrations. They are also very keen to connect over things that might be challenging them within their own suburbs \u2014how they can improve sustainability and recycling or how they can work together with the police and create a Neighbourhood W atch that promotes and improves safety within their community. We mentor through that program as well. 1412 Ms Gleeson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 917- 918. 1413 Ms Gleeson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 918. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 302 Another one is local markets in the Molonglo Valley, which will be delivered on 29 September. Again, that is a resident- led initiative and we are hoping this year to partner with EventsACT and link in with Floriade.1414 9.283 The Committee then asked if a Mingle program was possible in older suburbs that are going through significant rejuvenation and changing demographics and not just new suburbs. The Agency infor med them that: At the moment there is not. I guess the Suburban Land Agency's role is to focus on the new communities that we are building. What we are doing\u2014 and we are trialling Gungahlin's, which will be this financial year coming \u2014is working with the local residents associations created for all those existing suburbs, some of them being Ford, Crace, Casey, Ngunnawal, to try and connect those people, actually share the learnings of mingle, work together and collaborate on how we can work with the commun ity councils and those local stakeholders and suppliers to get that general consensus of building community within the region, not only within the individual suburb ... I guess from a budgeting and a resource point of view, to roll it out in every suburb in Canberra would be quite intensive. But where we can, we certainly integrate. 1415 9.284 Minister Berry, Minister for Housing and Suburban Development (the Minister), went on to state that: I think there could be opportunities to learn from the work that mingle does i n building those communities in new suburbs and how we could replicate that in some way in older suburbs. Maybe we can do that through different grants programs across the government. People are always saying they miss talking to their neighbours or people do not get out in the street and play cricket anymore.1416 9.285 The Agency informed the Committee that in relation to Molonglo and Weston Creek there is a plan to: ... go to the Weston Creek Community Council within the next six weeks or so, if we can, to work out ways that we can work together and collaborate a little better across Molonglo Valley and Weston Creek. Where we know things are happening in Weston Creek as well for those residents \u2014the dog parks and things like that \u2014we certainly promote that to all the l ocal residents to try and get that combined, shared knowledge. In a lot of areas we are using things like Communities@Work or Neighbourhood Watch. We are tapping into resources that are in Weston Creek already. I hope that will grow as we grow. 1417 1414 Ms Gleeson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 918- 919. 1415 Ms Gleeson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 919. 1416 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 919. 1417 Ms Gleeson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 920. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 303 9.286 In the con text of potential expansion of the Mingle program into older suburbs the Committee asked about the possibility of restarting the 'parties at the shops' program. The Committee were informed that: The difference with parties at the shops \u2014I have been in conta ct with the organiser over the past couple of years \u2014is that that was something that was put forward as an application to government by somebody and, again, was a community led program. There was somebody who was running that and was partnering with all tho se individual shops like Lyneham. Bonner was another one.1418 Yes, in the centenary year. At this stage it is not in the mingle program, but whether it is in anything broader we are not aware of yet.1419 Recommendation 155 9.287 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment restart the 'Party at the Shops' program. TENDERS 9.288 In discussions about the asset recycling initiative the Committee made reference to the tendering process that had been undertaken for Turner and Braddon on Northbourne and the fact that the tend erer was unsuccessful. They went on to ask the Agency whether the prospective tender had known about the financial constraints. The Committee was informed that: They were aware that the financial amount was part of a value -for-money assessment. Through the preferred tenderer status, we were negotiating with them on the financial amount. In that negotiation they were aware that they were bidding under the reserve and had the opportunity to up that bid. 1420 9.289 Further to this the Committee asked if the p rospective tenderer was aware of 'any of the financials so that they were able to make an informed judgement as to whether or not it was worth spending the money.'1421 In response the Agency stated: No, they were not. Traditionally, going out for a tender we would not be advertising the reserve. However, as a lesson learnt, we are considering that in some of our future tenders. It would be the next step in a design led tender. Essentially, we would look at a valuation which we felt was appropriate for the site , based on the criteria. We would advertise that valuation and then we would essentially be tendering on the quality of 1418 Ms Gleeson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 920. 1419 Ms Gleeson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 920. 1420 Mr Dietz, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1044. 1421 Ms Le Couteur MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1044. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 304 the product they could provide for that price. That is something we are considering for Macarthur House.1422 Recommendation 156 9.290 The Committ ee recommends that the ACT Government implement a pilot program of tenders where the reserve is set and the competition is on a design basis , as outlined by the Chief Executive Officer of the Suburban Land Agency in evidence given at Budget Estimates heari ngs on 27 June 2019. SECTION 72 DICKSON 9.291 The Committee asked about what was occurring with Section 72 Dickson, noting that the only site on the land release program was Common Ground, yet the YourSay website refers to a draft estate development plan. The C ommittee was informed by Minister Stephen -Smith, Minister for Urban Renewal (the Minister), that: We might look to update the information that is on the your say website. I have written a couple of times to North Canberra Community Council to update them o n the current process. As you are currently aware, Ms Le Couteur, the consultation process, as it had taken place over last year, was looking at the three blocks \u2014block 6, block 22 and block 25\u2014 as being sort of the anchor for the creation of a really integrated plan for section 72, particularly that western side of the site. Consultation had started on the assumption that the Salvation Army was going to surrender block 22 to the government within a fairly short time frame. For various reasons internal to the Salvation Army, that has not happened. They are still considering their position in relation to block 22. So progressing with a plan about the development of that block when the government does not have control of that block is a bit difficult. But we were, of course, absolutely committed to the development of Common Ground. It is an election commitment. The work that we had done in the consultation had left open initially the location of Common Ground within section 72. As a result of that work, we firmed up on the original proposed site, which is block 25, the old Downer club site. So the current path forward is to proceed with a separate Territory Plan variation and relevant processes for the development of Common Ground on block 25. When we get certaint y around the future ownership of block 22 and the Salvation Army's intentions in relation to that, we will then enter the next stage of community consultation around how we develop an integrated site across section 72. I have committed as part of that to the establishment of a community 1422 Mr Dietz, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 27 June 2019, p. 1044.

CLEANING CONTRACTORS - ONGOING EMPLOYMENT 10.15 The Committee asked about how the Education Directorate is upholding principles of secure work and were informed that due to the nature of the work and school dates, the Directorate has a significant percentage of casual and contracted employees.1480 10.16 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notic e, the Directorate confirmed that as of May 2019 there were 4976 permanent, 1224 temporary and 829 casual staff within the Directorate, noting that casual numbers only include those paid within that pay period.1481 10.17 Of interest to the Committee was the Directo rate's recent announcement that all school cleaners currently contracted to private enterprise will be offered ongoing employment as an ACT Government employee from the start of the 2020 school year. 10.18 The Minister confirmed that employee entitlements will transfer across and that cleaners will be no worse off following the transition, including with regard to wages and conditions. 1482 The Minister also noted that various models of employment will need to be considered as there are a range of visa considerations that need to be taken into account, and some of those may prevent a person from being offered fulltime ongoing employment. 1483 1480 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 723- 724. 1481 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 179, answered 2 July 2019. 1482 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 671. 1483 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 672. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 312 10.19 The Minister told the Committee that the total cost of this policy is $5.082m additional to that under the procured agreement.1484 The Directorate later added that $1.6m of this is allocated to capital expenditure.1485 COMMITTEE COMMENT 10.20 The Committee notes that providing cleaners with ongoing employment is expected to cost $5.082m, with $1.6m allocated to capital expenditure for similar ser vice outputs. Some of the Committee are concerned that this may not represent value for money. GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS 10.21 The Committee asked about how teachers identify and support students who are gifted and talented and was informed that a gifted and talented policy provides systemic advice across all schools regarding Directorate expectations about how they meet the needs of the children who are gifted and talented. Additionally, each school has a liaison officer for families with gifted an d talented students. 1486 10.22 The Committee was also told that the school principal is responsible for ensuring that students have access to programs that are developmentally appropriate .1487 It was later clarified that \"programs\" are better described as education s trategies that are developmentally appropriate for the particular children .1488 10.23 The Directorate then told the Committee: Depending on the needs of that child, individual learning plans can be developed, just like they are for students who have additional need s. We can do whole -grade acceleration. We can do single -subject acceleration. We can do specialised programs within classroom settings through differentiation.1489 10.24 The Committee asked about what training is provided to teachers for them to identify gifted and talented students and were informed that Gateways E ducation has been engaged since 2015.1490 10.25 The Committee was also told that p art of Gateways E ducation work is providing professional learning to assist teachers identify and how to work with gifted and talen ted students. 1484 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 707. 1485 Mr Matthews, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 707. 1486 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 696. 1487 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 696. 1488 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 696. 1489 Ms McMahon, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 697. 1490 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 697. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 313 Additionally the Committee was informed that t hey also provide access to written research and articles for newsletters for parents in the community.1491 10.26 The Committee asked how empirical testing in the Gifted and Talented Program was done and in an Answer to Question Taken on Notice was informed that: In line with the Gifted and Talented Students Policy (2014), the school/teacher collects information for the purposes of identification and assessment of a potentially gifted and talented student pr ior to consultation with school psychologists. Measures that support this process may include teacher professional observations of the student, work samples and curriculum -based assessment tasks. School psychologists oversee the choice of measure or speci alised approach, test procedures, and interpretation and communication of results to families.1492 COMMITTEE COMMENT 10.27 The Committee notes that this matter was initially considered at the Community and Industry Groups hearing on Friday, 14 June 2019 with the AC T Gifted Families Support Group . The Committee would like to acknowledge the Group for encouraging the Committee to consider this matter further. 10.28 The Committee notes that the current system for the identification of, and support for, gifted and talented st udents is ad -hoc and largely dependent upon an individual teacher or parent pursuing the need for additional learning consideration. The Committee believes that a systematic approach to all stages of identification and support be considered by the Directorate. Recommendation 161 10.29 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment investigate provision of appropriate training for all ACT teachers to assist in identifying gifted and talented students in their classes. Recommendation 162 10.30 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment investigate surveys used in NSW schools to assist in early identification of children showing gifted and talented abilities. 1491 Ms Brighton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 697. 1492 Answer to Questio n Taken on Notice E19- 176, answered 4 July 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 314 Recommendation 163 10.31 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment improve monitoring and evaluation of all gifted and talented students in ACT schools. Recommendation 164 10.32 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment increase its outreach and communication with representatives of g ifted and t alented students and parents. RESPECTFUL RELATIONSHIP PROGRAMS 10.33 The Committee asked about how respectful relationship principles are being taught in schools, and if the syllabus includes topics such as intimate image abuse given recent legislative amendments. 1493 10.34 The Minister told the Committee that respectful relationships are now part of the Australian curriculum, which means that school teachers and leaders are qualified to be able to deliver the programs required.1494 The Minister noted: The school communities work very closely around the e- safety place and how students and young people are provided with all the tools that they need to be respectful online and how they work online with regard to their schoolwork and outside of schools; and provide advice to parent communities through the eSafety Commissioner.1495 10.35 The Directorate provided additio nal information to the Committee, informing them that each school approaches the topics discussed differently to ensure they meet the needs of their school community.1496 The Directorate also noted that schools might bring in external programs: We work with YWCA; PCYC; the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre; The Line, which is an Our Watch program; and Sexual Health and Family Planning. We have lots of different groups who can support the work that schools do.1497 1493 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 672. 1494 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 672. 1495 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 673. 1496 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 673. 1497 Ms Seton, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 673. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 315 10.36 The Committee notes that this was raised by the YWCA at the Community and Industry Group hearing on Friday, 14 June 2019. The Chief Executive Officer told the Committee: The ACT remains one of only two jurisdictions that has not funded and embraced a comprehensive respectful relationships program. These programs have been proven to promote egalitarian relationships in the schoolyard, build shared decision -making among peers, and create awareness of gender imbalances that can emerge as destructive interpersonal behaviours.1498 COMMITTEE COMMENT 10.37 The Committee notes that Respectful Relationship programs require appropriate funding in order to ensure that a consistent message is taught across ACT schools. Recommendation 165 10.38 The Committee recommends t hat the ACT Government investigate implementing the Victorian Model of Respectful Relationships in all ACT Government schools. Recommendation 166 10.39 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide funding to train teachers to deliver respectful relationships training in schools . USE OF SCHOOL FACILITIES AFTER SCHOOL HOURS 10.40 The Committee asked about how school facilities are utilised outside of school hours. The Minister told the Committee that in relation to grounds, including playgrounds, 'the policy in the Education Directorate is that every school is availab le out of school hours for general community use.' 1499 10.41 Further to this the Committee asked about using school buildings outside school hours and the Minister confirmed that there is a general policy relating to fees and access, however it is predominantly boo ked with, and managed by, schools on an individual basis. 1500 She told the Committee: 1498 Ms Crimmins, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 24. 1499 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 731. 1500 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 731. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 316 From Education's perspective, the ACT government would like to see our schools as vibrant places after three o'clock in the afternoon as well as during the day. We want to make sure that they are not left empty and are used by the broader community all across the week and at weekends. Freeing up those school halls for sports clubs to be able to use them out of school hours has been really important. Not only does that give a space for people to come together; it makes the schools a safer place as well. 1501 10.42 The Directorate confirmed that they are considering security arrangements that may assist in schools being able to offer the use of spaces without needing a staff member prese nt.1502 10.43 The Committee also asked if groups would need public liability insurance to use the space and were told: In terms of public liability insurance, it varies, depending on the usage of the space. If it is a sporting group, a long- term hire or after school hours care and things like that, there would be a public liability responsibility for the individual group in terms of their agreement in hiring the space. When we talk about, say, a church group or a small group that might come to just use that spa ce, they would be covered by the school's public liability insurance at that time. 1503 COMMITTEE COMMENT 10.44 The Committee agrees that school facilities should be available for use by the whole community outside school hours, and that a system -based approach to matters considered above would be valuable. Recommendation 1 67 10.45 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment examine what opportunities might be available to schools to lease out their facilities out of school hours and during school holidays with a view to generating additional income for the school and to reduce the risk of vandalism and to enable bet ter community use of facilities. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR LEARNING SUPPORT ASSISTANTS 10.46 The Committee sought additional information on the minimum qualifications required to be employed as a Learning Support Assistant and were told: They can range. For ou r LSAs at the moment we are offering a cert IV in disability. A range of people take on the role of LSA. There is a reasonably sized group of students 1501 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 731. 1502 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 732. 1503 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 733. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATIO N (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 317 who are pre -service teachers who do the LSA work whilst they are studying. We also have others who worked in the disability sector and preferred to move into the school.1504 10.47 The Directorate also confirmed that learning assistants work as part of the team under supervision from teachers.1505 10.48 The Committee also asked if autism -specific training is required and was in formed that it is not required, however, there is online training offered and if a particular group needs additional training we have occupational therapists, speech therapists and psychologists who can offer support.1506 COMMITTEE COMMENT 10.49 The Committee notes that the children in autism specific learning units will have unique education needs and that learning support staff should be equipped to manage these needs in a way that supports learning and maintains the safety of all staff. Recommendation 1 68 10.50 The Com mittee recommends that ACT Government ensure that all teachers and support staff in L earning Support Autism Units be required to have accredited training in autism awareness and delivery of learning to students with an autism diagnosis. DEMOGRAPHICS AND SCHOOL PLANNING 10.51 The Committee asked about schools reaching capacity, particularly in the inner South and what forward planning was being done. The Directorate told the Committee: At the moment we have capacity in each region. And every student can roll up t o their local school and be guaranteed enrolment. But the master planning all around the infill, around from the north and the south, down as far as Woden and out to Weston Creek, is all being considered . 1507 10.52 The Committee was told: 1504 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 694. 1505 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 694. 1506 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 694. 1507 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 684. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 318 We are very conscious of [growth in] Gungahlin, but also the projected growth in Molonglo, projected growth along the central corridor where the infill is happening as you have already heard. 1508 10.53 The Directorate went on to say: Where they are\u2014 when it comes down to \u2014at th e regional level, then it is \u2014we can be pretty accurate at the regional level. Where it gets difficult is at the individual suburb level because people move, they do not stay in the same place. And that means it requires a more sophisticated level of analys is. That includes, for example, looking at \u2014for every single school in the ACT, the children that come in, what the pathways they take as they go to high school and college, and understanding that thoroughly and building the models that will enable us to b e more accurate. 1509 10.54 The Committee also asked if the rise in public high school enrolments has been driven by a lack of land being released to non -government schools in the high growth areas, such as Gungahlin, however the Directorate confirmed that this is n ot considered a factor as non -government schools in Gungahlin are understood to have additional capacity for enrolments.1510 10.55 This led the Committee to enquire about the process for land release to non -government schools. Directorate officials confirmed that the first role belongs to the Education, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate ( EPSDD ), and that the Education Directorate does not become formally involved until the registration process begins.1511 10.56 The Committee subsequently inquired as to whether it was possibly too late 'by the time the school has or has not acquired land, for the Education Directorate to be getting involve d.'1512 It was later clarified that the Education Directorate and EPSDD do have a relationship where the Education Directorate provide s advice as to the projected enrolment numbers over time to EPSDD, however it is EPSDD who determine how many sites need to b e in a development area.1513 10.57 The Directorate also told the Committee that the relationship between the Australian national University ( ANU ) and the Directorate is designed to meet the demographic needs in relation to planning future schools and predicting enr olments: 1508 Mr Gotts, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 684. 1509 Mr Gotts, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 684- 685. 1510 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 685. 1511 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 686. 1512 Mr Wall, MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 685. 1513 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 686. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 319 ...the relationship with the ANU is specifically developed to provide us with greater access to demographic expertise when we need it, and specifically when we need it rather than go case by case and ask questions.1514 10.58 The Committee asked about timin g for completion of demographic work by the AN U and heard that a three- year relationship has commenced and that the deliverables in that relationship will be agreed each year and will relate to the specific elements that we are interested in seeing an addi tional layer of work o n.1515 10.59 The Committee was told that the relationship with the ANU was entered into earlier this financial year, and the state that it is in now is that the ANU have been recruiting the staff to provide additional support. And so as of the beginning of July, of this year, will be the point at which agreement will be reached that we would like some specific work done. 1516 10.60 In relation to expenditure, the Committee heard that the contract amount is for $531,000 including GST over three years, with two key outputs .1517 10.61 The Committee was informed that the first output is the development of a small area projection model, and the technical support to support that. This will allow the Directorate to input numbers to do a more detailed layer of modelling moving forward. The second element of the project is specific studies that would be request ed each year that they are needed.1518 COMMITTEE COMMENT 10.62 The Committee remains concerned that the Education Directorate does not have enough opportunity to provide ear ly advice to EPSDD regarding the need for new or expanded school sites in areas subject to greenfield or urban renewal development. Recommendation 1 69 10.63 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that the Education Directorate and the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate work more closely in identifying government and non- government school sites in new and developing areas. 1514 Mr Gotts, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 684. 1515 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, pp. 686- 687. 1516 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 687. 1517 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 687. 1518 Mr Gotts, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 24 June 2019, p. 687.

Recommendation 1 71 10.65 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment investigate as a priority looming capac ity issues at a number of existing schools. APPRO PRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 321 11 COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTORATE INTRODUCTION 11.1 The ACT 2019 -20 Budget Statements G, Community Services Directorate , states that the Community Services Directorate's (CSD) primary purpose is to empower people to m eet their full potential within an inclusive and equitable community by: Intervening early to support people to be safe, to ensure basic needs are met to enable active community participation, and to support positive life outcomes; Delivering services that are human centred, holistic, tailored and integrated with a focus on ensuring the right supports are provided to those most in need, proactively identifying risks, and enabling people to work towards self- sufficiency as much as possible; Building strong communities with a focus on using evidence to inform services and programs, community development approaches that connect people to local communities, and maximising inclusion through targeted community -based programs. This includes alignment of government priorities and legislation to address community identified needs; Enabling inclusive participation by supporting Canberrans to participate in decision making, to form community connections, and to live fulfilling lives, fostering cohesion, equity and inclusion for all; and Driving collaboration and partnerships within and external to the Directorate, working collaboratively with other government agencies and building effective relationships with non-government community partners. This includes embedding the cultural change needed to intervene early and improve life trajectories as part of an integrated and holistic services system.1519 11.2 The CSD provides services through the following output classes: Output Class 1: National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Implementation Output 1.1: NDIS Implementation Output Clas s 2: Strategic Policy, Inclusion and Participation Output 2.1: Inclusion and Participation Output 2.2: Office for Disability Output 2.3: Strategic Policy Output 2.4: Quality, Complaints and Regulation Output 2.5: Safer Families 1519 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statement G, Community Services, p. 1.

APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 323 KEY ISSUES : NDIS IMPLEMENTATION 11.5 The Committee asked about the NDIS implementation and the full scheme agreement and whether there was more certainty for participants. They were informed by Minister Stephen - Smith, Minister for Disability and Minister for Children, Youth and Families (the Minister), that: I am not sure I wo uld say the full scheme agreement gives individual participants more certainty. We have been very clear and we have been clear in our discussions with the commonwealth that the NDIS is an uncapped scheme in that if you are an eligible participant you are an eligible participant and you should have access to the scheme. That has consistently been our position and that has been agreed with the commonwealth. However, it provides certainty more broadly to the community that the ACT government is 100 per cent c ommitted to fully funding our share of the NDIS. Of course, in full scheme we will continue to fund approximately 50 per cent of the scheme for the ACT in terms of those projections. There is a risk of excess costs in the scheme above projected costs and the commonwealth will take that. 1527 11.6 The Directorate further indicated that: The position of the ACT has been to bring us to the point where full scheme for us looks very similar to what the preceding couple of years did. The purpose of the period before full scheme was to get all those providers who might be interested in providing services for people in the ACT registered and engaged in offering services. Probably for the people in our community who are in the NDIS, nothing will seem different about full sche me. That is really about the arrangement the territory has made with the commonwealth. 1528 11.7 In terms of catering to future participant growth in the NDIS the Minister told the Committee that: We have a very concrete commitment in relation to our financial cont ribution, and that is indexed at four per cent per annum for the next 10 years and the commonwealth bears any extra costs above. So if participant growth is higher than the projected additional 500 participants over the next four years the commonwealth will bear any extra costs associated with that. In terms of providing certainty to the community, going back to your original question, the other thing to bear in mind is that our budget measure provides certainty around 1527 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p. 1080. 1528 Ms Evans, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p. 1081. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 324 some of the other services that are no longer NDIS eligible in -kind services: rehabilitation and community supports in the health space, the taxi subsidy scheme, the child development service and the children and young people equipment loan service. That is subject to review, but we will continue to provide those services that are no longer NDIS eligible to ensure that Canberrans with a disability get the broad range of supports they need. 1529 11.8 The Committee was informed that, in relation to the NDIA, the Office for Disability undertakes an advocac y role on behalf of individuals and carers, regarding their plans and plan reviews, often to escalate matters to ensure issues can be resolved in a timely way. The Minister emphasised that the Office will continue to play that advocacy role.1530 Recommendatio n 172 11.9 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government continue to work closely with the National Disability Insurance Agency to ensure favourable outcomes for ACT participa nts in the N ational Disability Insurance Scheme . CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 'S EQUIPMENT LOAN SERVICES SCHEME 11.10 The Committee asked about the Children and Young People's Equipment Loan Scheme (CAYPELS) and were informed that: The children and young people's equipment loan scheme includes a variety of paediatric loan equipment. It is designed for children up to the age of 16 and it includes a variety of equipment to assist with self- care and everyday activities. We have got a number of borrowers of equipment that include families in the ACT who have private therapists who are prescribing equipment to assist with seating, feeding and bathing, those sorts of everyday activities. In addition, the Education and Health directorates a re also accessing some equipment, for example for children who leave hospital and require a wheelchair and they do not have an appropriately sized one in the hospital to lend them. That would be something that CAYPELS would also cover. 1531 11.11 To be able to acces s the loan scheme the Committee was advised that: To be able to access the loan scheme you have to have a therapist working with you to be able to ensure that that equipment is appropriate for what the child's needs are. That would be either someone at the hospital, one of the allied health staff who work 1529 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p 1081. 1530 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p 1082. 1531 Ms Parker, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, pp. 1086- 1087. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 325 in education...We have in fact had quite a few families contact us directly because they have heard about the scheme and need a piece of equipment and have not been referred by their therapist. In that circu mstance our staff will actually work through with them on what is required and, if necessary, contact their provider to discuss what their needs might be. 1532 11.12 The Committee was also informed that the scheme is not means tested and is designed to fill the gap while waiting for a permanent piece of equipment, for instance while waiting for equipment to be approved for NDIS funding or self -purchase. It is also designed to be able to allow a client to trial a piece of equipment.1533 11.13 As the scheme was part of a suite of services offered by Therapy ACT, following the transition to the NDIS, was placed in the child development service. The Committee was told that Its future is being reviewed with the Minister noting that the Government was looking at how it might become an NDIS provider for that type of service. 1534 Recommendation 173 11.14 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government guarantee adequate funding to the Children and Young People's Equipment Loan Services Scheme for the purchase of new mobility aids and equipment as needed. INCLUSION AND PARTICIPATION (2.1) 11.15 Inclusion and Participation provides strategic advice to strengthen the inclusion and participation of all people in Canberra's community, including people from multicultural backgrounds, youth, women, veteran s and seniors and people with disability. The contribution and support for the engagement of all people is recognised through community events, awards, ceremonies and grants .

APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 327 11.18 Minister Ramsay, Attorney -General and Minister for Seniors and Veterans (the Minister), advised the Committee that an implementation plan that will feed into the national plan will be considered at the end of June 2019, by the Council of Attorney -Generals. The national implementation plan wi ll have several matters under the responsibility of each state and territory.1552 11.19 The Minister also provided the Committee with an update on services provided through Older Persons ACT Legal Service (OPALS ) which is currently designing resources for older people that are available o nline and in hard copy. Information and referral services have also been made available for concerned third parties. Collaborative work has also begun with both health and community services organisations. The Minister also noted that OPALS is anticipating 500 contacts this financial year, with approximately a third raising issues in relation to elder abuse.1553 11.20 The Committee was also advised of a relatively new service, senior relationship service, provided by Relationships Australia for Canberra, which is fu nded through the Commonwealth Attorney -General. In addition to the senior relationship services, the ACT Human Rights Commission, was highlighted as an alternative option of referrals and investigation relating to elder abuse.1554 11.21 The Minister noted that $10, 000 was budgeted for ACT Disability Aged Care Advocacy Services to counter elder abuse through individual advocacy and community education at aged -care facilities. ACT domestic and family violence frontline worker training has also been rolled out to recog nise and respond to domestic and family violence. 1555 11.22 The Committee enquired further into the prevalence of elder abuse within the Canberra community and was advised that: The question of elder abuse is very simple in some ways, in that you know exactly what elder abuse is when you get to one end of the spectrum. When you are at the other end of the spectrum it is not elder abuse at all. Then there are a whole range of areas in between that move from relational support to strong relational support to inappropr iate relational support through to criminal activities. It is easier to provide information around criminal activity than it is for other areas. The accepted definition of elder abuse is any act that provides a financial, emotional or social harm to elders, and nowhere in Australia or, to my understanding, internationally has a sound way of being able to measure that. 1556 1552 Minister Ramsay MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 19 June 2019, pp. 375- 376. 1553 Minister Ramsay MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 19 June 2019, p. 376. 1554 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 19 June 2019, p . 376. 1555 Minister Ramsay MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 19 June 2019, pp. 377- 378. 1556 Minister Ramsay MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 19 June 2019, p. 377. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 328 11.23 With regards to criminal activity, the Committee i nquired into the availability of statistics. In response to this question, in an Answer t o a Question Taken on Notice the Committee was informed that that the working definition of elder abuse does not line 'up with particular specific crimes' and that ACT Policing do not 'record instances of 'elder abuse' as they record by breaches of specific law.1557 Recommendation 24 11.24 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government adopt a definition of 'elder abuse' and investigate ways to record instances of 'elder abuse'. AGE FRIENDLY CITY 11.25 In discussions on seniors the Minister informed the Committee that part of the national plan to respond to the abuse of older Australians was the Age Friendly City and that this concept: ...came out of the work of the Ministerial Advisory Council on Ageing over the last 12 months, where there was broad community consultation on how we can continue to make Canberra the best possible age -friendly c ity. Twelve principles came out of the consultation with the community and the reflection across the whole of government, which were drawn together by my ministerial advisory council. Key principle 7 is that the abuse of older people in any form is not tolerated and that the protection of older people from any form of abuse is a priority and is paramount. There is an Incoming Ministerial Advisory Council on Ageing, whose appointment I announced last week. Four forums will be held over the next few months, looking at each of the four areas in this vision: being involved, connected and valued; being safe, secure and free from abuse and discrimination; information services and supports which embrace diversity; and a city for all ages. We will hold a public forum on each of those four areas. The ongoing consultations with the Ministerial Advisory Council on Ageing, chaired by Professor Diane Gibson, will be drawn together as an ongoing plan for each of those four areas and 12 principles. That will help guide the government's work over the coming years. 1558 1557 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 71, answered 11 July 2019. 1558 Minister Ramsay MLA, Pro of Transcript of Evidence, 19 June 2019, p. 378. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 329 COMMITTEE COMMENT 11.26 The Committee acknowledges the importance of ensuring the ACT is an inclusive community. The Committee believes that the Age Friendly Cities program will help facilitate a city that is inclusive of older Canberrans. Recommendation 175 11.27 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government expand the roll -out of age -friendly suburbs under the Age Friendly Cities program. BREASTFEEDING IN COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENTS 11.28 In recent years a number of initiatives have been undertaken in ACT Public Service workplaces to promote breastfeeding, primarily around the provision of appropriate locks, washing facilities and the storage of breast milk. Noting that many women in the ACT are employed in the Australian Public Service (APS), Minister Berry, Minister for Women (the Minister) was asked if she would be willing to take up the issue of enhancing breastfeeding facilities in the APS with her new federal counterpart. 11.29 In response the Minister indicated that: 'Mrs Jones, I would be happy to join with you and campaign and lobby for that to occur, for federal government public servants in the ACT. 1559 Recommendation 176 11.30 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government ensure that the Minister for Women work with her opposition counterpart to engage with the Commonwealth Government to ensure that breastfeeding and pumping facilities inside Commonwealth department and agency buildings located in the ACT are suitable for breastfeeding working mothers. WOMEN 'S BUDGET STATEMENT 11.31 This year's Budget marks the first time in several years that a Women's Budget Statement has been delivered. The Government has indicated that it would like feedback on the statement in order to improve it in future. 1560 1559 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 965. 1560 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 969. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 330 11.32 The Committee noted that many of the items referred to in the statement (such as providing services to high needs children and babies, and reducing recidivism) were not exclusively of benefit to women. Questioned on how the statement was compiled, the Committee was informed that a major challenge was that so much of the material was cabinet -in-confidence until released. Directorates were also asked to indicate where the impact on women was notable. 1561 11.33 Noting that the Government was planning on develo ping a series of wellbeing indicators, the Minister was asked how those indicators would interact with the Women's Budget statement. She replied that: ...with the work that is going on into the wellbeing focus in the budget, there is a lot of consultation on what that is going to look like and how it is going to play out in the community. My intention is that we have a women's budget statement that best suits the needs of individuals and groups of women in our community. But I am particularly wanting to make sure that the people who engage in this and under stand this are not just the ordinary people who engage in this process. I am really wanting to get people who, in their homes, out in the communities, engage in what is it that they want to see and under stan d what is available and happening for women in the ACT. That is what we will be asking, through our consultations with groups like the YWCA, the Women's Centre for Health Matters and others, to go beyond your own group of usual people who are...the usual sub mitters to this process. I really want to go further than that and engage other people in our community who would not ordinarily do it and have a document that actually makes sense. It is not the kind of language that you were talking about earlier that is easily under stood by everyone. 1562 11.34 Noting also that the Government was also developing a second ACT Women's Plan , the Committee asked and was informed that: As I mentioned before, those early pieces of work that we are doing with some of our sector community partners is starting to set us up towards the second action plan. The thing that the minister has been very keen on, as she has mentioned, is making sure that our broader community are engaged. That work will give us a bit of a discussion paper, if you like, that the Y and the Women's Centre for Health Matters are contributing to. We have had some guidance through ACTCOSS as well. Once we have that discussion paper, we will put that out broadly. We will have women attend the summit. We will have some other consultation that, for instance, the ministerial advisory council might lead, that sort of low -key connection with women who might otherwise not get the opportunity to have a say. It is about a six month process across this year. It also means that at th e same time we are actually finishing 1561 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 966- 967. 1562 Minister Berry MLA , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 969. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 331 up the first action plan and tying off those actions. So it is a good opportunity for us to kind of reset, if you like, for the second action plan. The minister's intention is that that second action plan will be laun ched from about March next year, around International Women's Day. We expect to have a nice product of really clear, meaningful actions that also thinks about what the outcomes we are seeking are and how we measure them. That is something that in the past we have not always had. We have just had a great big list of actions but not what the outcome might be or what the impact might look like. 1563 COMMITTEE COMMENT 11.35 The Committee notes the measures included in the Women's Budget Statement were only those new init iatives that made mention of benefits to women. Recommendation 177 11.36 The Committee recommends the ACT Government reintroduce a Women's Budget Statement to provide a detailed analysis of how the budget measures represent improved outcomes for women, and how t hese measures align to the ACT Women's Plan and reflect the whole impact of the budget on women, not just list those initiatives that may impact women. Recommendation 178 11.37 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government e nsure s that the Women's Budget Statement and the w ellbeing indicators are complimentary measures and do not just duplicate the same work. OFFICE FOR DISABILITY (2.2) 11.38 The ACT Office for Disability promotes social inclusion and community participation of people with disability through supporting the implementation of the NDIS; progressing the objectives of the National Disability Strategy including equal access to justic e for people with disability through the Disability Justice Strategy; progressing the Disability Inclusion Grants to provide increased opportunities for people with disability to participate in mainstream community 1563 Ms Evans, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p 970.

She was unable to say when, nor was she able to say how this will be funded.1568 Recommendation 179 11.41 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment release the Disability Justice Strategy and the action plan for the Disability Justice Strategy . Recommendation 180 11.42 The Committee recommends that the ACT G overnment fund the action plan for the Disability Justice Strategy without diverting funding from other programs. 1564 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statement G, Community Services, p. 13. 1565 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1082- 1083. 1566 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1085- 1086. 1567 Proof Transcript of Evidence, pp. 1089- 1090. 1568 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 28 June 2019, p 1085.

It leads strategic engagement and policy reform with inter -jurisdictional groups and Commonwealth bodies, progresses service system reform work, and progresses CSD accountabilities under the whole -of-government digital reform agenda.1569 MATTERS CONSIDERED 11.44 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Strategic Pol icy, included: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs budget;1570 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Agreement;1571 elected body;1572 Treaty for the ACT;1573 strengthening services - Our Booris, Our Way;1574 and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander budget statement.1575 KEY ISSUES ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER AGREEMENT 11.45 The Committee were informed how the priorities of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Agreement were identified: In developing the agreement and identifying the core focus areas and priority areas, the elected body and OATSIA worked together to develop the agreement and also to have the conversations with the community on what should be included. As part of the community engagement strategy we had an online survey which extended into the community. We had the your say website, and we had face to face conversations with over 60 individuals, including the traditional custodians, community members, community organisations and reaching into the AMC and others. We also had an onl ine survey that reached in excess of 1,000 individuals across Canberra. 1569 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statement G, Community Services, p. 13. 1570 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1120- 1122. 1571 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1122- 1123. 1572 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 pp. 1120- 1123. 1573 Proof Transcript of Evidenc e, 28 June 2019, p. 1123. 1574 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1123- 1126. 1575 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1126- 1127. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 334 We also reviewed a number of past consultations over a 10 year period to come to the core focus areas. We have worked together with the elected body through an inter directorate commit tee to form what you see in the priority actions that were identified by community through the elected body consultations. 1576 11.46 When asked if funding was being provided to initiatives, programs or services being delivered under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Agreement , Minister Stephen -Smith, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, advised the Committee that : As you are aware, there are more than 90 actions within the action plan for the agreement. We probably cannot go through ea ch and every one of them and say who is getting money to do what. But I would certainly draw attention to the budget measure in the Health portfolio around the funding for the design feasibility for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander alcohol and dru g service. That work will be done with Winnunga Nimmityjah ... $300,000 will go to Winnunga to do the design and feasibility work for that service. 1577 That money will indeed go to Winnunga. The ACT government will fund Winnunga to design the delivery of a dedi cated Aboriginal residential rehab facility, and the agreement is that Winnunga will identify a specialist Aboriginal alcohol and drug service provider to assist them with that work. ACT Health will partner in the work, including identifying potential locations that provide access to other health and emergency services, and that work will then inform the construction of a facility. 1578 QUALITY , COMPLAINTS AND REGULATION (2.4) 11.47 Quality, Complaints and Regulation (QCR) operates independently from program, funding or policy streams within the Directorate. It includes the Office for the Human Services Registrar, which regulates human service providers under ACT legislation. QCR is responsible for building capacity of service providers to deliver quality and viable services, whilst investigating incidents and complex complaints made about government and non-government service providers.

We have been responsible for assessing them and making recommendations for registration with the NDIA and also assessing their compliance against the standards that they are required to comply with. We have had 17 complaints up to 5 June in this finan cial year about providers, specific complaints that have led to a targeted compliance assessment generally. We have had, as at 5 June, 223 registered specialist disability support providers that we have been oversighting. The Office is also responsible for assessing specialist disability support providers (223 as at 5 June), making recommendations for their registration with the NDIA and assessing their compliance against the requisite standards. 1580 SAFER FAMILIES (2.5) 11.50 The Office of the Coordinator General for Family Safety provides strategic leadership, coordination, policy analysis and innovation expertise to drive cultural change and system reform, and to build whole -of-Government and whole -of-community capability to address domestic and family violence .1581 MATTERS CONSIDERED 11.51 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Safer Families, included: funding for frontline and support positions (also discussed under Public Prosecutions, Policy Advice and Justice Programs and Legal Aid) ;1582 1580 Ms Gibson, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1083. 1581 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements G, Community Services, p. 14. 1582 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 952- 953.

Res ponding to this, Minister Berry, Minister for the Prevention of Domestic and Family Violence (the Minister), stated that the purpose of the levy was to fund innovative responses to the prevention of domestic and family violence. She said: Some of that has meant that there are some changes, which were identified in the budget. They are very well described on page 421 of the budget papers. This gives a very good explanation of the innovation that is happening through the family safety levy, that it was never designed to be a business -as-usual funding resource. We always wanted to make sure that the community were very aware of where their contributions were going. That is why it is detailed very clearly in the budget papers and has been since it was implemente d. One of the things that we could have done was leave the levy as it was. Then we would not be making any change or have any innovation. But the main purpose of this levy is to address domestic and family violence in new and evidence -based ways that actu ally change people's lives. 1588 11.53 The Committee was informed that the funding changes will be implemented over a 12 -month transition period. While funding for some services will cease to be provided under the Safer Families Levy, the Minister stated: We will wo rk with the directorates, with other ministers and with their portfolio areas around whether or not the funding that was provided for these particular services is 1583 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 955- 956. 1584 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, p. 957. 1585 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, p p 957- 960. 1586 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 960- 962. 1587 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 962- 964; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 346, answered 5 July 2019. 1588 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, pp. 950- 951; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 345, answered 4 July 2019.

We deliberately gave a 12 -month period to make this change, and that is why it is clearly identified here in the budget papers and across other directorates, so that everyone could see that we are making some changes about where the funding comes from to provide these services. 1589 11.54 The Minister later reiterated that: I would not expect the funding to change for those services. It just will not come out of the family safety levy1590 11.55 However, shortly after the Minister also stated that: What I can say is that the fund ing for services to address domestic and family violence across the directorate which are currently being funded by the family safety levy will not continue, and directorates will have a conversation with the family safety coordinator, who has the expertis e in this area, about what kinds of services are needed, whether these are meeting the needs of our community, and whether that service needs to change.1591 11.56 When asked about what the current funding actually was , the Directorate indicated that: The package fo r the safer families package and the safer families levy is $24 million over four years. The levy provides $20 million of that funding. The safer families package cannot possibly cover the government's full response to domestic and family violence, because we know that across a whole range of services it is much bigger. 1592 11.57 Data received in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice identified what the levy was currently funding as opposed to what it will be funding next financial year and is comparatively repres ented in the table below: 1593 Safer Families Initiatives Funding Initiative Lead Directorate/Responsible Agency 2018/19 Funding $'000 2019/20 Funding $'000 1589 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 954. 1590 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 954. 1591 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 954. 1592 Ms Wood, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 952. 1593 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 345, answered 4 July 2019.

WE DO NOT SHOOT OUR WOUNDED INITIATIVE 11.63 The Committee asked about the We Don't Shoot Our Wounded recommendations and how the funding allocated would be spent, noting that the funding appeared to cease in 2022 -23. 11.64 The Directorate indicated that Domestic Violence Prevention Council Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reference group has been established and that: SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 342 Our starting point has been a conversation with that group about how we start this work with the community to respond to those recommendations. We recognise that the long delay, particu larly in responding to the We Don't Shoot Our Wounded recommendations, means that there is work that we have to do to build credibility with the community, that this is a genuine process and that the contribution they make will be followed through. We have also invited other contributors to We Don't Shoot Our Wounded to be part of this process if they would like to do that. We see the reference group as a core group that we are working with but we are open to other people who want to be part of it. The con versation is still at an early stage with the reference group but what we are talking to them about is how we can support that group to lead a conversation with the community about what the first steps might be and the first priorities they actually want t o work on. We are talking to them about how we resource them to do that, and they are considering that and they will be coming back to us with how they want to be supported. We are looking to use the funding that is being committed in the budget quite flex ibly and really have it driven by what the community tells us they want to start with. Obviously within We Don't Shoot Our Wounded there is a range of recommendations that are really comprehensive. We cannot work on everything at once. We are looking to the community's leadership on where they want us to start and what that might look like. 11.65 The Directorate indicated that the funding was an 'initial commitment' as they still had to: ...do the work with the community and support the community to set the priori ties and the specific actions. We do not yet know what is going to be required. This funding will not respond to all the recommendations. This is a place to start, to have some funding that can support the community to get some things started. But we know that more will come out of it, and we will need to consider resourcing beyond what is here. 1594 11.66 The Minister further stated that the funding was allocated for 'just the co -design work...to make sure that we are getting it right and what kind of funding it actually might need. ' 1595 Recommendation 186 11.67 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government e nsure there is sufficient ongoing funding to ensure that all recommendations from the reports \"We Do Not Shoot Our 1594 Ms Wood, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 962. 1595 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 962.

CHILD AND FAMILY CENTRES (3.1) 11.68 Early intervention and prevention services are provided through a universal platform with targeted services for vulnerable families. Services provided include parenting groups, advice and support, sustained home visiting, specialist clinical services, and community development and education programs. Services are deliver ed in partnership with other agencies, local community organisations and service providers .1596 MATTERS CONSIDERED 11.69 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Child and Family Centres, included: supporting incarcerated parents;1597 Belconnen childcare centre car park;1598 child and family centre infrastructure;1599 integrated management systems1600 services to child and family centre clients;1601 vulnerable and complex families;1602 Match Nurse visits.1603 KEY ISSUES VULNERABLE AND COMPLEX FAMILIES 11.70 The Committee asked about what child and family centres are doing to target vulnerable and complex families.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 344 The child and family centre model and approach is a universal service. It is welcoming, culturally safe and inclusive for all families. And that is very successful in terms of engaging families that maybe experiencing vulnerability and disadvantage. Why that is so is that it is non -stigmatising. It is a service for everybody. And we see that as people come in the door and the y talk with us about the different needs and requests for services. I think the way that we do our work is a very important part of engaging more vulnerable families. That is the first thing. It is also the range of service types that we provide. We can p rovide something that could be a light touch in terms of some information but then that goes right through to a scale of intervention or support like case management, which is really tailored to your family, and where we can work with families with high an d complex needs for quite a period. 1604 11.71 In terms of reaching out to people who need but do not seem to be accessing the services the Committee were told that whilst the service was well known they were seeking to promote i ts existence online and via other pub lications: We have publications like this. I am holding up the guide to our services and programs. This is widely distributed, and a lot of people take this small brochure. We make sure that each year it is a comprehensive but very accessible document. Thi s is across locations in the ACT. We get referrals from many agencies, whether it is general practitioners, whether it is through community sector partners \u2014and it might be very targeted service providers \u2014and also from our colleagues, for example in Health. The other thing is that we have services like maternal and child health collocated on site. What that means is that if a vulnerable family is coming in for something mainstream \u2014an immunisation for their young child \u2014the match staff member says, \"There see m to be some things happening for you and your family at the moment. Come down. Come down to intake. It is just around the corner. I would like to introduce you to Mel.\" It is a really successful way of being able to link families into a range of other sup ports. The other thing is that we have a lot of services that are providing very targeted services as well. We have been the pilot site for one of the innovation challenges under the family safety hub. We have a solicitor two days a week co -located at Gungahlin child and family centre, and that is a health -justice partnership. That staff member is able to help co -facilitate groups, provide advice to families, be available to provide advice. And that has been a really successful initiative. 1605 11.72 Further to this it was indicated that the Directorate are: 1604 Ms Saballa, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1104. 1605 Ms Saballa, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1105. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 345 ...continually looking at what we provide, and that is a reason why we do see variance across our indicators as well. It is not a mere transactional service that you get when you come into a child and family centre. We see shifts across our indicator as we respond to what the community is asking for.1606 CHILD DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (3.2) 11.73 The Child Development Service has a focus on early identification and intervention and provides assessment, referral, information and linkages for children birth to six years living in the ACT, where there are concerns relating to their development. Autism assessments are provided for children up to 12 years. Children seven to eight years with complex needs who have not had a previous assessment by allied health professionals can access the service .1607 MATTERS CONSIDERED 11.74 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Child Development Services, included: respite services;1608 Holder child development service;1609 child development services and their interaction with other services;1610 integrated management systems;1611and dyslexia.1612 KEY ISSUES HOLDER CHILD DEVELOPMENT SERVICES 11.75 The Committee was informed what programs the child development service delivers As you would be aware, the child development service was established in the transition to the NDIS. It is primarily a service that families in the community can come to where they have concerns about their children's development. It is a universal service. That means that all families with young children are welcome to participate. Families attend 1606 Ms Saballa, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1105. 1607 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements G, Community Services, p. 15. 1608 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1096- 1097. 1609 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1098. 1610 Proof Transcrip t of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1100- 1104. 1611 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1099- 1100. 1612 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1103; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 429, answered 15 July 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 346 either through a drop -in clinic at the child and family centres or directly at the Holder site. What we have seen over the last few years with the transition to the NDIS is the complexity of the whole early childhood early intervention service system landscape, and it has changed. The child development service and what we offer is different to Therapy ACT and what was offered previously. We have the new NDIA -funde d provider that I was talking about before, NDIS EACH. They have very specific roles in terms of what they do. There are two pathways. One is a pathway into an NDIS supported package and then the other pathway is into early intervention supports for child ren that may not need a package but would definitely benefit from some targeted support to enhance their development. Then there is a suite of service providers. Families with funded packages will be able to go out with their plan for their child and, with choice and control, choose providers that can provide services for their children. So the landscape has changed. 1613 11.76 The Committee was informed that Holder was the main place where these services could be accessed but that that the drop -in centres at child a nd family centres and Gugan Gulwan are also providing linkages: For the ones that we have carriage of under this output class, our main site is the Holder site but, as I was mentioning, we definitely have a presence in the child and family centres. Those d rop-in clinics are really highly utilised. We also co -facilitate a number of programs with either community partners or government partners. Some of the work we have focused on over the last couple of years is with Aboriginal community -controlled organisat ions. We have been very committed to how we best engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families with young children. The approach that we have refined is an outreach approach and it is going to where families are. 1614 11.77 It was noted by the Committee that the child development service at Holder is not an NDIS provider. 1613 Ms Saballa, Proof Transcrip t of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1100- 1101. 1614 Ms Saballa, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1101.

They were informed that 1615 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements G, Community Services, p. 16. 1616 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1093- 1095. 1617 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1095- 1096. 1618 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1109. 1619 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1106- 1110; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19-430, answered 9 July 2019. 1620 Proof Transcr ipt of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1108- 1109. 1621 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1109- 1110. 1622 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1110- 1115. 1623 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 pp. 1115- 1116. 1624 Proof Transcript 2019, pp. 1116- 1117. 1625 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1117- 1119. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 348 There are a number of elements to that particular funding measure. Part of it is reflecting the updated experience around the number of children and young people in out of home care. When A step up for our kids was initially funded, there were obviously projections ar ound the number of children and young people who were expected to be in out of home care. The number has been higher than those initial projections on which A step up was based. This is about sort of re -baselining the number of children and young people in care. Also, there is some work through the mid-contract review of ACT Together. Barnardos is the lead agency of the ACT Together consortium around pricing for the continuum of care. Ms Pappas can talk a bit more about that. 1626 11.81 The Committee then asked how m uch of the funding was going to foster care, kinship care and residential care. They were informed that: The ACT Together consortium runs a continuum of care. They run residential care, foster care and some kinship care where there are children on long -term orders. It is not proportioned in terms of there being money for each of those individuals. They run the entire service system. They are providing funding regardless of where children are across any of those program areas.1627 11.82 In the context of improving fu nding sustainability the Committee was informed by Minister Stephen -Smith, Minister for Children, Youth and Families (the Minister), that: Previously, where there has been excess demand compared to the forward estimates funding for the number of children a nd young people in care, that is being managed either through cash managing from underspends in other areas of the directorate or through Treasurer's advances. People will have seen in previous budgets that the Community Services Directorate has Treasurer' s advances in a number of years. That has been part of the reason for those. There are two other elements to this overall funding line that I should mention. This goes to your question, Miss Burch, around foster carers and kinship carers. There was within A step up for our kids a grandfathering arrangement for those fostering and kinship carers who were receiving higher payments than the new payment schedule under step up. That grandfathering is due to end from 30 June this year. Cabinet made a decision to continue those grandfathering arrangements so that we do not see any foster or kinship carers who still have the same children in their care as they did at the beginning of step up losing payments or getting their payments reduced. Those grandfathering pa yments will remain. We talked earlier in relation to NDIS about the fact that we had some in -kind claims that reduced our cash contribution. One of those in -kind claims related to support for 1626 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1106- 1107. 1627 Mr Pappas, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1107. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 349 children and young people in out of home care with a disability. We were advised that that could no longer be an in -kind claim; so that funding as well contributes to that.1628 11.83 The Committee then asked whether this funding addressed concerns raised in the 2018 carers wellbeing survey and were informed by the Minister that there was a wide range of issues raised in the survey but that the focus was more on therapeutic supports as opposed to carer and kinship payments.1629 11.84 The Directorate further stated that: In respect of A step up for our kids, I guess the carers subsidy is s ort of a carryover from what was being experienced in the previous iteration of the out of home care system. In addition, foster carers and kinship carers were provided with access to therapeutic assessments, which determine then the individual needs of ch ildren and young people. Then the funding flows based on what those individual needs are. Carers were given choices. The therapeutic assessment team was to identify what the individual needs were and then support the agencies to assist carers to access tho se services, or carers could source those services on their own. 1630 CHILD AND YOUTH RECORD INFORMATION SYSTEM 11.85 The Committee asked about the completion of the child and youth record information system and whether this had 'capacity to measure parent with a di sability who have kids in the system.'1631 11.86 The Committee was informed by the Directorate that: It will. It will measure disability. I probably will not get the words right; so people diagnosed. It is formal diagnosis and then it is for where people are on the journey either to being assessed towards a diagnosis or just where there is a suspicion or an observation, I guess, and then also a formal diagnosis for parents and for children. That is not going to retrospectively capture everybody in the system but it will build that data probably once the system goes live. 1632 11.87 The Minister added that: ...one of the challenges we often face is that people do not self -identify as having a disability, even if they do. Again, it is actually making the system safe for people to identify that they have a disability and therefore can be supported.1633 1628 Mini ster Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1107. 1629 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1108. 1630 Mr Pappas, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1108. 1631 Ms Le Couteur MLA, Proof Tra nscript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1115. 1632 Mr Pappas, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1115. 1633 Minister Stephen -Smith MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1115. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 350 11.88 In terms of when the system would be in operation the Committee was informed that: ...we are doing a lot of user testing at the moment. We also have to migrate data from the old system; s o we are doing a few things in parallel. We are hoping to go live later this year for the first section.1634 11.89 The Directorate further stated: Child protection systems are all sequentially looking to upgrade their systems. The lessons from the New South Wales experience are that it is better to take your time, make sure that you have done substantial training with your staff, that you have tested the system and also that the data migration is working as it should before you go live. I do not have a date, but we are optimistic that that will happen in the second half of this year. 1635 SOCIAL HOUSING SERVICES (1.1) 11.90 Housing ACT provid e social housing and specialist homelessness funding to meet the needs and circumstances of low income and disadvantaged peopl e. Housing ACT aims to alleviate social isolation and build resilience, contributing to a safer, stronger and more inclusive community - a community where everybody has the opportunity for a bright future regardless of their characteristics, circumstances or backgro und.1636 11.91 Housing ACT is a division of the CSD reporting separately as a public trading enterprise and treated as a 'not-for-profit' entity under the Australian Accounting Standards .1637 11.92 The Director -General of CSD is appointed as the Commissioner for Social Housing and is an incorporated body under the Housing Assistance Act 2007.1638 11.93 Social housing primarily occurs through the provision of subsidised rental housing. A rental subsidy is provided to eligible tenants, calculated to ensure that no more than 25 per cent of assessable household income is paid. In addition, social housing is provided to community housing providers, homelessness service providers and other specialist housing provid ers for their use to accommodate and support high need and low-income individuals and families.1639 11.94 Housing ACT also funds homelessness service providers to provide intensive support and assistance to individuals and families who are homeless, and those who are at risk of becoming 1634 Mr Pappas, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, pp. 1115- 1116. 1635 Mr Pappas, Proof Transcript of Evidence, 28 June 2019, p. 1116. 1636 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statement G, Community Services, p. 42. 1637 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statement G, Community Services, p. 42. 1638 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statement G, Community Services, p. 42. 1639 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statement G, Community Services, p. 46.

We are now sitting at 0.6 per cent. That is incredibly tight. I think Hobart might be even tighter. When we compare that to Darwin, at the moment it is sitting on five per cent. We have an incredibly tight rental market. We will see that trickle down or impact all across the continuum, in terms of n umber of places and rough sleepers. 1648 11.97 The Committee was also provided with the names of several organisations in the ACT who provide accommodation assistance, which included: Toora single women, Toora family and women with children, Beryl and Doris. We hav e the Youth Emergency Accommodation Network; we have Samaritan House for men. 1640 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statement G, Community Services, p. 46. 1641 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 972- 975. 1642 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 975- 977; 986- 987. 1643 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 978- 979. 1644 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 979- 982. 1645 Proof Trans cript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 982- 984; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 355, answered 18 July 2019. 1646 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 984- 986. 1647 Proof Transcript of Evidence, 26 June 2019, pp. 987- 988. 1648 Ms Gilding, Proof Trans cript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 975. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 352 Certainly, at Ainslie Village, there are a number of vacancies at the moment. Unfortunately, Havelock House has no vacancies.1649 11.98 The Directorate also made reference to: Street to H ome, St VDP. As part of OneLink and the specialist homelessness housing providers, we have at least 600 properties that are head -leased to that sector to provide emergency accommodation, crisis accommodation and transitional accommodation.1650 11.99 Regarding the n umber of people sleeping rough, it was noted that this was no longer a city - only issue in that the prevalence has spread out to encompass all the town centres.1651 Recommendation 187 11.100 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government , as a matter of urgency, increase and improve the options for short term and emergency accommodation for those who are sleeping rough in the ACT. COMMON GROUND 11.101 The Committee was briefed on the work being undertaken to advance the Common Ground community housing project in Dickson. Asked about any plans to expand the initial Common Ground in Gungahlin, Minister Berry, Minister for Housing and Suburban Development (the Minister), responded: One of the things that we have been doing leading up to t he development of this Common Ground in Gungahlin is having a look around at some of the other Common Grounds around the country. This will be our second Common Ground and it will be different from the first Common Ground because we have learnt from the development of that Common Ground how we could do things better, particularly around service provision, from talking to the sector here but also across the country about what is the best model for a particular cohort. Those are all being considered, as well as the physical layout but also what we do, how we support the individuals that live there. 1652 11.102 The Committee queried what made Common Grounds distinct from other accommodation options and were informed that: 1649 Ms Gilding, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 975. 1650 Ms Gilding, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 976. 1651 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 977. 1652 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 986. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 353 Some of the aspects that make a Common Ground are that it is designed for people who are chronic homeless or have had entrenched issues with being at risk of homelessness. The other aspect is the security and the concierge. It is something that in other Common Grounds adds to the community, which is somet hing that we have in Gungahlin. We have got a space. The Common Ground model which originated in New York was really about something that was a community but also reached out into the broader community in many different ways. But, essentially, the underlying principle is that it is a safe, permanent home for people who have experienced homelessness. 1653 11.103 When asked what work is being done to advance the development the Committee was informed that: The first thing is that obviously the government is committed to building a Common Ground in Dickson and the site has been identified. Part of the work that is going towards developing that Common Ground is having a look at what it is going to look like. Who is going to live there? Is it going to be the same or differe nt to the current Common Ground as far as the physical layout but also as far as the cohort is concerned? There is a bit of work that will need to be done at that site around Territory Plan variations and other planning work and there is some significant c onsultation that is happening with the community now about that whole site but particularly around Common Ground. I think everybody agrees that that is a good way forward. 1654 11.104 Further to this the Committee were informed that: As the minister has just said, th e site has been identified but its zoning needs to change. Essentially, over the next 12 months it is going to be a process of continuing the consultation on that site, because we know that there has already been significant consultation on all of that sec tion 72. We now need to proceed with a zoning change for that, conversations with the community around what the height, the shape, the scale of the development might look like and a decision, again, around the cohort, similar to the conversation that we we re having with Ms Le Couteur around the MyHome model. You need to identify the cohort that you are actually building for. Once those processes are underway then the range of other studies \u2014feasibility studies, procurements et cetera \u2014can take place. 1655 11.105 In term s of the design the Committee were advised that this was impacted by the location, the local community and cohort of residents who may live there : Each site is different and I think we really need to be sympathetic to the location of every site that we bui ld on. I think it would be a shame if in a public housing portfolio we were to say, \"Here is our design brief and this is what we build exactly to on each 1653 Ms Foulcher, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 986. 1654 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 984. 1655 Ms Gilding, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 985.

We really need to have those conversations and be sympathetic to that site, to that community, in terms of what we build going forward. 1656 We have been through the consultations that we did leading up to the development of the strategy with the community. Different groups were identified where there might be gaps in our public housing provision. That included older women, it included single - parent families and it also included younger men. There were t hree different cohorts. I guess what we are looking at now is what the physical layout of the site can actually house. That is what we will consider as we decide what is the actual cohort. Who is going to live there? Whose home is this going to be?1657 11.106 In ter ms of committing to future Common Ground 's the Committee was informed that: I think the first thing we will do is get on with this Common Ground, which is part of our election commitment, in Dickson, but we are always talking with the community about the f uture for that Common Ground. Governments will make commitments in the future about what they decide to do there. I am not going to make a commitment here to you.1658 Recommendation 1 88 11.107 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government expand Common Ground Gungahlin to the maximum capacity that can be accommodated on the site. 1656 Ms Gilding, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 985. 1657 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 985. 1658 Minister Berry MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 26 June 2019, p. 985.

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 358 use of bike sheds in an integrated transport system.1692 KEY ISSUES SPECIFIC BUS ROUTES 12.6 The Committee asked a range of questions relating to specific bus routes and how these have been impacted by the introduction of the new network. 12.7 The Committee noted that under the old network, bus 629 used to stop at Sacred Heart Primary School in Pearce and that under the new network no bus stops at the school. The Committee asked whether buses 2035 and 2036 could stop at the school. The Directorate responded that this could be considered but noted that 'e very time you stop a bus at a new stop it has a knock -on effect in terms of what happens thereafter'.1693 12.8 The Committee asked about old bus routes 25 and 60. In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice it was noted that in relation to route 25 that 'in the previous bus network, Hilder Street in Weston was serviced by the Route 25 during the week and by Route 925 on weekends. Under the new network, Hilder Street is serviced seven days a week by the Route 66'.1694 12.9 On route 60, the same Answer to the Question Taken on Notice noted that Kambah West is now serviced seven days a week by route 70. Whereas under the old route 60 there was a diversion to the Gleneagles Estate, this no longer occurs. This is because of the 'low ridership' of the diversion, 'which was only being used on average by one person a day'.1695 12.10 The Committee asked about old bus route 3 and the alternatives for patrons of this route under the new network. 12.11 The Directorate replied that the ultimate measure of success for the bus network is patronage numb ers. On old bus route 3, the Committee was told: Route 3 also goes through the ANU, and we found that the vast majority of ANU students were not using route 3; they are using the rapid routes and the other routes that service the outside of the university . When we are starting with a blank sheet of paper and we know that the route 3 patronage is not as high as somewhere else in the network, that is when we make that decision of where we put the route, where we are going to create the best overall outcome.1696 1692 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 652- 653. 1693 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 611. 1694 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 118, answered 3 July 2019. 1695 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 118, answered 3 July 2019. 1696 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 616. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 359 12.12 The Committee spoke about old route 743 and new route R2, noting that the transitions from the former to the latter has meant increased travel time for some users. In response, The Directorate acknowledged that with the old Xpresso routes, such as 743, ' you got from A to B without stopping anywhere in the middle on some occasions ' but noted that these services were infrequent and left people with few options if they missed there Xpresso bus. By contrast, it was explained that with the Rapids, where ' it is o f benefit to you is if you miss the bus. That is okay because there is another rapid bus coming five minutes behind '. 1697 12.13 The Directorate continued: ' What we were finding in the old network was that, just on an aggregate basis, many more people were using rapid buses than Xpressos anyway. But even on a per bus basis, there are actually about twice as many people using the rapid buses than the Xpresso buses'. 1698 NETWORK 19 AND CHANGES TO SERVICES 12.14 The Committee noted that for some passengers, the changes to the b us network has resulted in them having to make three transfers to complete their journey. The Committee wanted to know whether the Directorate had a plan to improve services for these people. 12.15 In response, Minister Fitzharris, Minister for Transport (the Minister), informed the Committee 'in the previous network 0.13 per cent of passengers would have had three transfers, and in the new network it is 0.25 per cent'. She added that 'I think it is worthwhile understanding some of the data, and the number of peo ple who will transfer three times is very small'. 1699 12.16 The Committee was also told in an Answer to a Question o n Notice that 'the percentage of public transport journeys made on Transport Canberra services using a MyWay card that included two or more transfers was 1.99% in June 2018 and 3.33% in June 2019.'1700 12.17 The Committee noted that for many, the changes to the network mean they now have to walk further than they did before to catch a Rapid route. The Committee wanted to know what the Government is doing to he lp Canberrans who face difficulties walking the extra distance to Rapid stops. 12.18 The Minister responded that: We are genuinely looking to respond to a number of those issues. For some people a bus stop might have now appeared in front of their residence, whe reas previously there was not one. I know particularly of one retirement village that now has a bus 1697 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 627. 1698 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 627. 1699 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 616, 617. 1700 Answer to Question on Notice E19- 386, answered 11 July 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 360 stop right outside, and dozens of residents there are delighted. Equally, there are some where that has not been the case for them. With respect to designin g a network that makes sense for the city as a whole, and that takes into account all of those factors that have been spoken about\u2014 actually properly designing a public transport network \u2014that has been done. Genuinely listening to the feedback is again somet hing we have genuinely been doing.1701 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.19 The Committee acknowledges that for some commuters, the changes to the network have resulted in more convenience and less distance to walk to their bus stops. However, the Committee believes that some face greater difficulty and longer walks to bus stops than they did under the previous network. This is particularly an issue for some older members of the community and others who have difficulty walking. The Committee believes that Government should do more to assist these people in the journey. 12.20 The Committee reiterates that for some commuters, the change in the bus network has resulted in increased travel times and the inconvenience of multiple transfers whilst for others there has been decreased tr avel times and increased convenience. Recommendation 1 89 12.21 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government within 12 months, undertake a review of the new bus network with the specific intention of improving journey times . Recommendation 190 12.22 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government trial other on- demand services that can assist people with mobility issues. FEEDBACK ON THE NEW P UBLIC TRANSPORT NETWORK 12.23 The Committee asked about the feedback the Directorate has received since the commenc ement of the new public transport network and was informed that around 4,500 items of correspondence had been received in the first seven weeks. 1702 1701 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 616. 1702 Proof Tr anscript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 610. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 361 12.24 The Committee requested that a breakdown of this correspondence be provided to the Committee. This information was provided in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice as follows.1703 Bus Network Feedback (29 April 2019 - 23 June 2019) Complaint 2788 Request of Information 310 Request for Service 288 Suggestion 264 Notification 117 Compliment 118 Total 3885 Anonymous Feedback 991 Transport Canberra ACTION Complaints (Breakdown) Network 1125 Service delivery 1277 Other 386 12.25 This information showed that, between the commencement of the new public transport network on 29 April 2019 and 23 June 2019, Transport Canberra received 2,788 complaints. In contrast, only 118 compliments were received during the same period. Anonymous feedback amounted to 991 items. 1703 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 117, answered 4 July 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 362 12.26 Transport Canberra also indicated that feedback which crossed all category types amounted to 1495 items.1704 12.27 The Committee wanted to know what processes the Directorate had in place to respond to complaints. In response, the Directorate informed the Committee that We have a customer service team within Transport Canberra. It works closely with Access Canberra. If it is a piece of feedback which in the nature of feedback that does not demand a response, then it is noted. But there is a range, particularly since the establishment of the new network. There is range of occasions where we have taken feedback from the community. Where there is a quick fix to be had, we do our upmost to do that. For example, there have been instances with the new network when, if there was a school bus that was at capacity and there was a way to kind of deal with that qui ckly by swapping out one form of bus for a steer -tag or an articulated bus, then we did that. If it is more in the nature of a substantive comment, it gets noted. Then as we consider our future network changes down the line, it effectively goes to the cons ultation process around those future network changes. That is a kind of long- winded way of saying that if it is a piece of feedback that we can deal with quickly and easily, that is always what we try to do. If it is in the nature of something that is more policy or of a more long -term nature, it is noted and then we consider it in future network changes. 1705 12.28 In response to a question on how the 4,500 pieces of correspondence compares with the usual amount of correspondence the Directorate receives, the Minist er told the Committee: You could probably compare it to this time last year but I think probably you need to compare it to a network change. I think the previous large -scale network change was in 2014. I do not think we would have that here. Clearly it is a massive change and probably one of the biggest changes ever. It is probably one of the biggest changes ever. We expected to see a lot more feedback. We expected to hear complaints from people because for a number of people their journey did change. It is certainly higher than what it would have been in an average week at the same point last year. But in terms of a major network change, we expected high levels of feedback. 1706 12.29 In response to claims from the Committee that many in the community have not had th eir complaint or request responded to, the Minister indicated that: There has been a range of follow -up. Those that have asked specific questions ought to have been followed up by now, with a phone call either directly from my office or from 1704 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 117, answered 4 July 2019. 1705 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 610. 1706 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 610- 611. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 363 Transport Canb erra. If it is general commentary, sometimes that is a bit difficult to respond to.1707 Every single email from my office has been acknowledged, with an indication of how that will be responded to, and forwarded on to the directorate. They have made an extens ive effort in getting back to people. On schools, in particular, there is also direct correspondence with the schools and also with, obviously, the Education Directorate, for government schools, and with peak bodies in the non -government sector as well. Schools have been communicated with on multiple occasions. 1708 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.30 The Committee notes the number of complaints received by Transport Canberra since the commencement of the new network and seeks clarity about how these complaints are managed and addressed. 12.31 The Committee is also concerned about how these complaints are considered and incorporated into network planning. Recommendation 191 12.32 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government develop a new web form for customers to lodge compl aints to Transport Canberra relating to network services. TRANSPORT OFFICERS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENTS 12.33 The Committee asked whether there is a mechanism in place to filter through feedback from Transport Officers and Customer Services Agents. In respon se, the Directorate informed the Committee that ' We have a reporting system whereby, if there is anything happening across the network which is potentially problematic, depending upon the severity of it, my phone will ding, other people's phones will ding, and you get those text messages straightaway. So there is an immediate reporting mechanism '.1709 12.34 The Directorate added All sorts of odd things can happen \u2014and good things. Depending upon the nature of the incident, we have procedures in place that give us guidance as to how we categorise those. They will then send through immediate reports, depending upon the severity of the incident, so that there is appropriate escalation . 1710 1707 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 612. 1708 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 612. 1709 Mr Edghill, Proof Tran script of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 614. 1710 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 614. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 364 12.35 In response to a further question, the Directorate clarified that cases such as where Customer Service Agents assist disorientated people in finding their buses are not captured in the reporting mechanism as 'we would think of that as business as usual'.1711 12.36 The Committee noted that for some of the Rapid routes, bus bunching was still an issue \u2014 where multiple buses of the same route are arriving at a stop at the same time or shortly after each other. The Committee asked whether the Directorate could not better use its Customer Services Agents to direct customers from crowded lead buses into less crowded buses arriving shortly after. 12.37 The Directorate replied that ' Our transport officers, who are more operationally focused, can work to regulate the headway in the service, to stop three buses going at once, meaning there is a gap, and then an other. That is one strategy that we employ, using the transport officers '. He added that the Customer Service Agents could potentially play a role in this, especially as they have access to real -time information on the flow of the network through their iPa ds but noted that 'the first goal will be to regulate the headway'. 1712 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.38 The Committee believes that Transport Officers and Customer Services Agents can provide valuable feedback through their business -as-usual interactions with public trans port system users. The potential data that could be captured through feedback from such interactions could help to improve the system and address possible problems before they escalate. 12.39 The Committee believes that Transport Canberra's Customer Services Agents can better be used to maximise ease and comfort for commuters using the public transport system. Recommendation 192 12.40 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government investigates the feasibility to introducing a reporting mechanism to capture the feedback received through the everyday interactions between public transport system users and Transport Officers and Customer Service Agents. 1711 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 615. 1712 Mr Steele, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 637. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 365 SCHOOL CHILDREN AND SCHOOL BUS SERVICES 12.41 The Committee were informed that there were '240 dedicated school services in the previous network and there are now 224'1713 and there had been extensive engagement with schools and also with peak bodies,' including the Education Directorate on the new system .1714 12.42 In this context the Committee made reference to the impact of the changes on school children, in particular questioning the Directorate on the number of children who have 'potentially been lost and disoriented under the new network.'1715 12.43 In their response the Directorate indicated that they did not know if any children had been 'lost' or needed help from a customer service agent to know which bus to get or what platform to go to. They stated that 'in terms of the customer service officer saying, \"You have to go to platform 2 or platform 3,\" that is business as usual and we do not capture that data.'1716 12.44 However, the Directorate also indicated that: If, within the organisation, it is \"lost\" in the sense that there is a child who has never used a bus before, who has stayed on beyond their stop and needs to get home, and we se nd out a transport officer to take that child home, in that circumstance, absolutely, we know about it.1717 12.45 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice the Directorate indicated that: Since the commencement of the new bus network on 29 April 2019, field staff have transported students to their destination (school or home) 10 times. For the same period last year, field staff transport students to their destination (school or home) 5 times. This includes all individual cases where field staff have transport stude nts (e.g. including student missed a bus), rather than only instances where a student has stayed on a bus too long and missed their stop. Such incidents are notified internally. 1718 Recommendation 194 12.46 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government when unde rtaking a review consider reducing the number of changeovers for young school children. 1713 Minister Fitzha rris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 612; 618. 1714 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 612- 613. 1715 Miss C Burch MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 615. 1716 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 615- 616. 1717 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 615. 1718 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 119, answered 28 June 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 366 NUMBER OF BOARDINGS P ER JOURNEY UNDER THE NEW NETWO RK 12.47 The Committee discussed the difference between boardings and journeys as measurements of patronage for the public transport network. The Directorate clarified that 'a boarding is when you tap on and tap off. If somebody were to catch two buses and tap on twice in one journey, that counts as two boardings '. He added that other jurisdictions use 'boardings' to measure the patronage numbers of their public transport systems. 1719 12.48 On the number of boardings per journey required of passengers under the old network compared to the new network, the Directorate informed the Committee that: What we are seeing in the new network versus the old network is that the ratio of boardings is pretty much the same. In the old network we were at 1.31 boardings per journey; at the moment we are at 1.36 or 1.37 boardings per journey . 1720 12.49 Later in the hearing, the Committee asked whether, with the change to a hub -and-spoke model, this number should have changed more. 12.50 The Directorate replied: In terms of the interchanges with the new network, because we changed from a lot of meandering, single seat journeys to frequent rapid routes, there may have been a thought that we could see more interchange in the network. But I think the reasons it has held fairly steady from the old network to the new network are the ones I articulated before. One of the features of the network is that there are some connections between local and rapid services, but we have gone from having four rapids to effectively 10 rapids in the network, which is more convenient for a lot of users. A lot of users are looking at it and saying, \"That new rapid is providing me with a single seat journey from A to B, to where I want to go.\" That has netted out against some of the journeys where there may be an interchange now. 1721 FLEXIBLE BUS SERVICE 12.51 The Committee asked why the flexible bus service was only extended for one year in the budget papers. 12.52 The Minister responded that: It is, but we could do so much more with it and so much more with the rest of the capacity that exists in the community transport sector. That is a piece of work that is at the point where we are getting to the end of a particular procurement process.

We will continue to fund it; we remain very committed not only to the existing service but to opportunities to improve that service and make it av ailable to many people . 1722 12.53 The Committee noted that the flexible bus service is not an on -demand service and asked what work is being done in terms of on -demand and last mile services. 12.54 The Directorate informed the Committee that there is currently a procurem ent process in place ' which is looking at a new booking system which can be applied for both the flexible service and potentially other shuttle services that we are running in the new network '. Additionally, part of this procurement process is to bring dow n the lead times in booking these services.1723 12.55 In response to a later question on what type of timeframe between booking and using the service the Directorate is aiming to achieve through the procurement process, the Directorate explained that, ultimately, ' for me, you would be talking about minutes '.1724 12.56 The Minister added to this discussion that the flexible bus services ' meets the needs of people in the community who have mobility issues or might be recovering from an operation or have a variety of other need s'. In relation to last mile services, she continued, ' over the last couple of years we have had work with Uber; we have partnered with them to offer discounted last - mile services on the way home over the summer period. That has been well -received '.1725 12.57 Late r in the hearing, the Committee asked whether there had been any increase in sign -ups for users of the flexible bus service since the commencement of the new network. 12.58 The Directorate explained that the new network is only seven weeks old and that the Direc torate did not have enough data to provide a definitive answer however, there had been a 'modest increase'.1726 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.59 The Committee notes that the flexible bus service provides transport to some of the most vulnerable and isolated members of our c ommunity. The Committee believes that this service is highly valuable, however current booking systems and hours of operation are unnecessarily restrictive. 1722 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 620. 1723 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidenc e, 21 June 2019, p. 620. 1724 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 638. 1725 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 621. 1726 Ms Flanery, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 636. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 368 Recommendation 194 12.60 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government provide ongoing funding to the Flexible Bus Service and expand it to allow for same -day service requests that can be made online or over the phone. PERCENTAGE OF ACCESSIBLE BUSES 12.61 The Committee recounted evidence provided by People with Disabilities ACT at the Committee's hearing on Friday, 14 June 2019 that around 80 per cent of Transport Canberra's bus fleet is currently fully accessible.1727 The Committee wanted to confirm this figu re and were informed the Committee that 85 per cent of Transport Canberra's bus fleet is accessible.1728 12.62 In response to a follow -up question on the timeline to reach 100 per cent accessibility, the Directorate told the Committee that 'there is a legislated ta rget for DDA [Disability Discrimination Act] compliance, which is 31 December 2022'.1729 Out of a fleet of 454 buses, there are 72 DDA -non-compliant orange buses with steps which will be replaced with accessible buses by December 2022.1730 12.63 The Committee acknowledged the move towards DDA compliance by 2022 but expressed concern, that in the meantime, as not every bus is accessible, passengers with mobility issues or a parent with a pram cannot be sure if the next bus coming to their stop is accessible or not and a s such are unable to plan their trip with any level of certainty.1731 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.64 The Committee notes the efforts of the ACT Government to ensure that the bus fleet remains on track to be fully disability compliant by 2022 as per its requirements under the statute. However, the Committee believes that better notification and real time reporting to passengers about which buses are disability compliant and which are not on a particular route should be investigated so as to provide clarity to passengers wit h mobility issues. 1727 Ms Sirr, Proof Tra nscript of Evidence , 14 June 2019, p. 75. 1728 Mr Steele, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 623. 1729 Mr Steele, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 623. 1730 Mr Steele, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 623. 1731 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 623. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPR OPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 369 WEEKEND DRIVER SHORTA GES AND SERVICE FAIL URES 12.65 The Committee noted that under the current Transport Canberra Operations (ACTION) Enterprise Agreement 2018 -2021 ,1732 weekend rosters are filled under a voluntary system. The Committee wanted to know what measures the Directorate will take to ensure that there are no driver shortages on the weekend. 12.66 In response, the Minister said that the Directorate will have ' ongoing d iscussion with them [drivers] around that, and around what some of the options are for that in the future . 1733 12.67 In discussion on the number of route failures due to driver shortages, the Directorate informed the Committee that 'generally, we are delivering in excess of 90 per cent' of services on the weekend.1734 12.68 The Directorate provided the following additional information on how weekend services are staffed: There are proposed rosters that go up in our depots in advance of every weekend. We will have discussions with individual drivers, if it is looking like numbers may be falling short, to encourage people to fill the shifts. We have a continuing rolling recruitment process on foot at the moment, which is really focused on engaging drivers who are more inclined to work on the weekend. We also try to manage on the ground on a weekend so that, if there are some services which are going to be lost, we do it in a way that creates as few issues as possible . 1735 12.69 The Committee asked for the specific number of weekend servi ce failures there have been since the commencement of the new network and the number of times the field van had been used to cover those failures. 12.70 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice, the Directorate provided the Committee with statistics on service failures for the previous eight weekends. According to these statistics, the best performing weekend was the weekend of 1 -2 June 2019, where 3,613 services out of 3,721 scheduled services were delivered, or 97.1 per cent reliability. The worst performing weekend was 22 -23 June 2019, where 3,392 services out of 3,721 scheduled services were delivered, or 91.16 per cent reliability. The best performing day was the Public Holiday on 27 May 2019, where 1,641 services out of 1,647 scheduled services were delivered, or 99.64 per 1732 MLA, Proof , 21 June 2019, p. 624. 1734 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 624. 1735 Mr Edghill, Proof Tra nscript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 625. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 370 cent reliability. The worst performing day was Sunday 26 May 2019, where 1,445 services out of 1,647 scheduled services were delivered, or 87.74 per cent reliability.1736 12.71 This Answer to the Question Taken on Notice also indicated that 'since the commencement of the new bus network on 29 April 2019, field staff have transported passengers in the field vans 167 times on weekends .'1737 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.72 The Committee believes that service failures during the weekend create inconvenience for comm uters and act as a deterrent for people using public transport on weekends. The Committee understands that many of these failures are due to driver shortages on the weekend and, therefore, urges the Government to do more to ensure an adequate number of drivers are available to staff weekend bus services. Additionally, to allow commuters to plan their travel the Committee urges Transport Canberra to improve real -time reporting mechanisms of services for commuters. 12.73 The Committee also believes that, in order t o ensure the reliability and integrity of the weekend bus service, Government should commit to maintaining appropriate levels of services reliability for weekends services and report annually on this benchmark in the TCCS annual report. Recommendation 195 12.74 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government acts immediately to address failures in weekend services due to driver shortage. Recommendation 196 12.75 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government acts immediately to improve the real-time reporting syst em for commuters.

APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 371 12.76 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government introduce a separate benchmark for weekend service reliability as a strategic objective in the T ransport Canberra and C ity Services Directorate Annual Report . LIGHT RA IL 12.77 The Committee asked a range of questions on the light rail including about the actual and expected patronage numbers for the light rail. 12.78 The Directorate explained that in the light rail business case, patronage numbers were forecast at two points: 2021 and 2031. For 2021, usage was forecast at a little over 15,000 users, rising to around 18,000 users in 2031. The Committee was informed that 'w hat we have been seeing is that in broad terms we are already achieving our 2021 patronage estimates of 15,000 boardings per weekday. During the free travel period, we were experiencing light rail patronage that was getting up to our 2031 forecast '. On its busiest day, Friday 17 May 2019, patronage was close to 19,000 people. 1738 12.79 The Committee asked about the timeframes for the completion of the light rail stop at Mitchell. 12.80 The Directorate provided the Committee with the following statement: There is funding for the construction of the stop over the next two financial years. We are working through that process at the mom ent to get something underway as soon as we appropriately can. There is a broader logistical question about potentially doing the Mitchell stop in conjunction with other works that may need to happen in the future, but our current expectation is that there will be arrangements which are finalised in the 2019 -20 financial year. Then there is more detailed planning that needs to be finalised with Canberra Metro to determine the precise time of delivering it. That is when we are talking about . 1739 12.81 On the construc tion of the new stop, the Committee sought confirmation on whether the Directorate would be making use of night works to minimise disruptions to the network. In response, the Directorate said that the Directorate's ' strong preference is not to stop the cit y's mass transit system while we build a stop, so we will be working around that. By definition, that means that you are really looking at engineering hours as the appropriate time to do that'. 1740 1738 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence June 2019, pp. 628, 629. 1739 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 630. 1740 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 631. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 372 12.82 The Committee asked what the current peak hour capacity of th e light rail is and how this compares to current peak hour usage. In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice, the Committee was advised that 'current peak hour capacity is 4,140 passengers (7 -9am, Gungahlin to City)' and the 'current average peak is 2,856 (7 -9am, Gungahlin to City)'.1741 12.83 The Committee asked when a timetable for the light rail will be available on Transport Canberra's website and were informed that light rails 'has a timetable; the timetable is actually in the contract, which I think is online ' and 't he other option is the journey planner, which shows you when the next light rail vehicle is coming '.1742 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.84 The Committee notes that Transport Canberra's website does not currently offer an easily - accessible timetable for the light rail services.1743 The Committee acknowledges that the service is designed as a 'turn -up-and-go' service which runs every six minutes in peak times and every 15 minutes in non -peak times, but believes an easily -access ible timetable on Transport Canberra's website would aid some commuters in their travel planning. The Committee believes this is particularly important given that at some times of the day the frequency of the services is every 15 -minutes. Recommendation 1 98 12.85 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government make easily -accessible light rail timetable s available for commuters. LIGHT RAIL - LAUNCH 12.86 The Committee noted reports that the estimated cost of the light rail launch party was in excess of $100,000. The Committee wanted confirmation on the actual costs of the day's proceedings. 12.87 The Directorate provided a breakdown of the associated costs of the launch: For the light rail launch event, there are two components to costs associated with the day. There is the cost of the light rail launch event itself, and that is some of the entertainment and whatnot that you saw there. The other component is not related to an event, but just by virtue of the fact that it was the first day of light rail, whether there was entertainment or not. There was a component of traffic management, crowd 1741 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 121, answered 28 June 2019. 1742 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 373 safety and crowd management that we needed to invest in, given that we were aware that the launch of light rail would create a lot of community interest .1744 12.88 Further to this the Directorate provided the figures associated with these two cost streams. It was explained that 'we spent $292,000 on traffic management, security and queue management' and 'i n terms of the celebratory side of things \u2014things like event management, entertainment, AV, ma rquees and that kind of thing \u2014we spent $154,000 .'1745 TICKETING SYSTEM 12.89 The Committee asked about the introduction of an integrated ticketing system into the ACT, following the model of NSW. The Committee wanted to know when this system would be introduced. 12.90 The Directorate replied: A procurement process is on foot, but effectively we are looking to move away from a card -based ticketing system, as we have at the moment, to what is called an account - based ticketing system . 1746 12.91 The Directorate explained that with the current system, a customer's MyWay card balance is stored on the MyWay card, whereas with an account -based ticketing system, such information will be stored online, making online card top -ups instantaneous.1747 12.92 In reply to a question on whether consideration was being given to making the ACT's ticketing system compatible with NSW's, the Directorate said, 'that is very firmly the direction that we are wanting to head in'.1748 12.93 The Directorate added that The nirvana for public transport agencies in Australia is th at you can use any card and any token in any public transport system across the nation. It will take us a while to get there, but certainly what we are doing now is with a view to that future interoperability with other jurisdictions .1749 12.94 The Committee asked how long a MyWay card can be inactive for before it expires. The Directorate informed the Committee that 'it is two years'. When asked why there is a two -year limit, the Directorate indicated: 1744 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcr ipt of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 634. 1745 Mr O'Daly, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 634. 1746 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 640. 1747 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 640. 1748 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 641. 1749 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 641. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 374 The answer to that is really that it is an ageing system. The MyWay system is probably 15 years old. When they designed it way back, and the hardware, the people designing the back end of it coded it in. They thought two years would probably be about right. That is probably where that really came from. What it is about is that, due to the complexity of the ticketing system, the system has to recognise the card in the system to be able to keep it up to date. Over the course of two years, the system goes through incremental software updates and things like that. It is a kind of hard rule that is in the system. If it does not see your card for quite a while, it moves it to the side and carries on . 1750 12.95 The Committee asked the number of cards which expire each year. In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice, the Committee was informed that the 'MyWay system does not provide information on expired cards. Cards expire after two years if they are not used in order that the customer's financial and transactional data is protected'. 1751 12.96 The Committee noted information it received indicating a $25 fee for the refunding of MyWay card balances and a $10 fee for the transfer of balances. It asked why these fees are so high. In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice the Directorate indicated that: Balance transfers to anoth er MyWay cared owned by the customer or a customer's [sic] family member is free of charge. A $10 administration fee is applicable for a MyWay balance transfer between two MyWay cards that are not in the same name. ... Card Balance refunds are provided for c ustomer [sic] wishing to be paid out the entirety of their MyWay card balance (not transferring the balance to another card as listed above). A cost recovery fee of $25 applies for this service.1752 PARK AND RIDE 12.97 The Committee noted that to be eligible for a Park and Ride permit, users must ensure that they have $90 or more credit on their MyWay card. 1753 It asked why this was the case. 12.98 The Directorate explained: It is part of the terms and conditions if you are applying for a permit at some of our park and ride locations. The general idea behind that is to ensure that people have got the money on their card and use the park and ride appropriately, rather than just 1750 Mr Steele, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 643. 1751 Answer to a Question Taken on Notice E19- 123, answered 28 June 2019 1752 Answer to a Question Taken on Notice E19- 124, answered 28 June 2019. 1753 Park and Ride conditions are as follows: '$90 or more travel credit (on a standard/adult MyWay card), or $40 or more travel credit (on a concession MyW ay care \u2014note, no balance is required for seniors over the age of 70, or an active autoload (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 375 signing up and never using the card. I believe there are also checks to make sure that park and ride permit users are actually using their card .1754 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.99 The Committee understands that the current eligibility requirements for the Park and Ride permit are designed to ensure that commuters are using the Park and Ride appropriately. The Committee believes the requirement to have $90 loaded on a MyWay card before signing up to Park and Ride may be a prohibitive expense for some commuters and suggests that better enforcement provisions should be explored. Recommendation 199 12.100 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government develop initiatives to better enforce the proper use of Park and Ride permits so that the lowering of travel credits does not result in an increase of permit misuse. ELECTRIC AND HYBRID B US TRIAL 12.101 The Committee asked abou t the results of last year's trial of electric and hybrid buses. 12.102 The Directorate provided the Committee with an overview of the results of the trial: We had two electric buses and one hybrid bus. I think there were lessons that we learned across the entirety of that process. I think it was publicly documented that in the first instance we had gone down the path of one particular bus that was not able to be delivered; so we changed tack and had different buses brought in. Straight away, I think one of the lessons there was that there is still a degree of maturing that the bus market in Australia needs to go through. In terms of the performance of the veh icles themselves, I think we found a few things. Actually, pleasingly, the battery system in the buses worked. It did what was expected of it, which was fantastic. On the flip side with the electric buses, there were maybe two things that were brought to o ur attention. One was that the batteries carry weight with them; so it does reach a point where you need to consider how many batteries you put on versus the people -carrying capacity. There is a balancing act. Obviously, the fewer batteries you have on board, the less the range but the more passengers you can carry. That is one learning. Another learning was that you need to give thought to the way that you charge these buses. The way that our diesel buses work at the moment is that they come in at the end of the evening. The refuellers put diesel in and then they are right to go in the 1754 Mr Steele, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 643. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 376 morning. It is okay to have gone to electric buses, but one of the logistical challenges for us is that, as well as investing in the electrical capacity of the depots, it may not work that way with an electric bus. You may have some of them charging for a period in the middle of the day and then in the middle of the night other ones need to be charged . 1755 ACQUISITION OF NEW BUSES 12.103 In response to a question about the budget alloc ation for the acquisition of new buses, the Directorate informed the Committee that there is a current procurement round for 40 new buses and the 'budget has provided funding for 84 replacement buses over the next four years' 1756. 12.104 Asked whether these budget a llocations were for the growth of the bus fleet or for replacing older vehicles, the Directorate replied that 'a ssuming that we have enough buses to run the network, the first priority is to get the old orange buses off the road'.1757 The Committee believes that the old orange buses include the 72 DDA non -compliant orange buses. 12.105 The Committee sought clarification on whether the 124 new buses will be replacements or will be additional buses. The Directorate explained that: The reason it is not exactly precise i s because it depends upon future decisions that are made with the network. In three years there may be fewer buses that we are buying that will be in one category, not the other. If we are expanding the services again in three years, maybe there are fewer going into the replacement category . 1758 EXPANSION OF CITY INTERCHANGE 12.106 The Committee asked the reasons behind the expansion of the city interchange and were informed that: One of the key features is more buses are coming through the city, so we need more spac e. The other element is that with the opening of the light rail system you have the current terminus of stage 1, and even when stage 2 progresses the Alinga Street light rail stop will be a key interchange between buses and light rail. 1759 12.107 The Committee raise d the issue of commuters being required to cross Northbourne Avenue in order to change buses. In response, the Directorate stated: 1755 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 644- 645. 1756 Mr Steele, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2 019, p. 645. 1757 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p . 646. 1758 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 646. 1759 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 648. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 377 We are alive to ensuring that we are making pedestrian movements as safe as possible in that area. I think you would have alr eady seen the no left hand turn signs and from Alinga Street west on to Northbourne northbound. Part of that is around minimising vehicle -pedestrian interactions. There is continuing work with our colleagues in the roads area to further enhance and monitor what is happening at the interchange. 1760 12.108 The Minister added that ' you will have the no turn heading eastbound, but we will be talking with businesses there next week because we plan to close that to general traffic between Northbourne Avenue and Moore Stree t. There are stops going in there as well and cover for passengers too '.1761 NUMBERING ON BUSES 12.109 The Committee noted reports that some people have had difficulties distinguishing the numbers of buses at a distance. In particular, the Committee noted reports of problems associated with the \"R4\" bus route. The Committee asked whether measures could be taken to better distinguish the numbering and letters on these buses. 12.110 The Directorate acknowledged they had received feedback on this issue. He said that 'certainly , it is something we will look at' and that 'ensuring that the destination signs are very clear, both with the language that says where it is going, so that people know where it is going, and with the number, is a real priority'.1762 Recommendation 200 12.111 The Co mmittee recommends that the ACT Government consider making alter ations to bus destination text so that commuters can better identify route numbers . ACTIVE TRAVEL 12.112 In relation to a discussion on Active Travel, the Committee asked whether the Government will take any actions to increase the capacity either on buses or at bus stops for bike racks. 12.113 In response to the question on the current two -bike capacity of buses, the Directorate informed the Committee that: 1760 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 649. 1761 Minister Fitzharris MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 649. 1762 Mr Steele, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 650. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 378 There is a physical constraint to how big those things on the front of a bus can be, because they fold up, and they cannot fold up in front of the windscreen and so forth. So it is not possible on the buses themselves. 1763 12.114 The Directorate provided a response on the possibility for additional bike racks at bus stops: Bike racks are just one component of the integrated network. They provide an option for people that want to carry their bikes on the buses. Similarly, with the light rail, there is capacity for people to carry their bikes on those light rail vehicles. We need to think about it in terms of the whole integrated network. We also provide infrastructure such as bike -and-ride facilities, where there are cages available. Bicycle parking is located throughout the city. There are a range of ways in which you can integrate your bicycle trips with the overall network. 1764 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.115 The Committee believes there is room for the Government to increase the number of spaces for bikes on new buses and at bus stops in order to encourage more comm uters to utilise active travel. Recommendation 201 12.116 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government investigate the feasibility of expanding the number of bikes able to be racked on new buses, and at bus stops, so as to increase the accessibility of public transport for active commuters. ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE (2.1) 12.117 Output 2.1, Roads and Infrastructure provides management of the Territory's road and associated assets, stormwater infrastructure, community paths, bridges, traffic signals, streetlights and car parks. This output also includes the provision of asset information services, capital works and d evelopment approvals relating to the acceptance of new infrastructure assets.1765 MATTERS CONSIDERED 12.118 Matters considered by the Committee in relation to Roads and Infrastructure included: 1763 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 652. 1764 Mr Davidson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 652. 1765 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements H , Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate , p. 18.

The Directorate described the process for assessing intersections for upgrades: Roads has an ongoing process of forward works planning. We maintain programs of potential works over two, fiv e and 10 -year horizons. We also maintain a database of intersections and mid -block sections in the network, ranked according to their statistical history in terms of traffic volumes, speed data and crash history. On that basis intersections are essentially ranked in terms of what that data suggests about the level of risk associated with those intersections or sections of road. That indicative risk, based on available data, is then taken into account in a further process of considering what interventions mi ght be effective in reducing the level of risk. That process produces those programs of potential future capital works projects.1775 12.120 The Committee noted the intersections earmarked for upgrades and recounted the number of crashes since 2011 at each of these s ites, including one case where 50 accidents had 1766 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 590- 592; 599- 600. 1767 June 2019, pp. 592- 594. 1768 Proof Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 594- 599; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 113, answered 28 June 2019. 1769 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 600. 1770 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 600- 602; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 114, answered 4 July 2019. 1771 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 602- 603; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 115, answered 28 June 2019. 1772 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 604- 605. 1773 Proof Transcript Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 605- 607 1774 Proof Transcript Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 607- 608. 1775 Mr Marshall, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 591. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 380 occurred. The Committee asked whether 50 crashes before an upgrade occurs was an excessive figure. 12.121 Minister Steel, Minister for Roads and Minister for City Services (the Minister), replied that 'we are taking action on these but it is also important that not all of these are based on the crash data; it is also about traffic flows, and safety improvements to pedestrian access in particular'. 1776 COMMONWEALTH AVENUE BRIDGE 12.122 The Committee asked what involvement the G overnment has in the process to determine whether the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge should be replaced. 12.123 The Directorate provided the Committee with an overview of the issue: With the Commonwealth Avenue B ridge, there are effectively two things happening at the moment at that crossing. On the C ommonwealth Government side of the equation, the NCA is looking at engineering works that need to happen. There are two bridges there. They are looking at engineering works which are required to ensure the longevity of th ose bridges. The bridges are 50 or 60 years old, and there is work required to bring them up to standard and to prolong the life of the bridge, if that is the path that the commonwealth goes down. In the recent federal budget there was money afforded to th e NCA to undertake those works.1777 12.124 Additionally, the Committee was informed that the ACT Government has engaged the Commonwealth on the need to upgrade the Bridge in relation to Light Rail Stage Two. The Directorate informed the Committee that 'we are thinki ng at the moment that there would be a new structure, a light rail only structure, to be built between the two existing Commonwealth bridge structures'. The Committee was told that during negotiations between the ACT Government and the National Capital Aut hority, 'both of us came to the conclusion that before we go too far down our respective paths, we should at least ask ourselves the basic question: if we were to think of both of these objectives and projects together, what may be the best holistic outcom e?'1778 12.125 In response to a question on the likely traffic management arrangements the Government will implement during the construction process, the Directorate stated: Because there are two existing structures, it may well be the case\u2014 and this is a little bit hypothetical at the moment\u2014 that if there were a decision made by both the commonwealth government and the ACT government to look at replacing those 1776 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 591. 1777 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 593. 1778 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 593.

Th ere are two structures there, so there are ways that you can have contra -flow arrangements during peak and so forth. But that is a level of detail that we just have not got to yet.1779 TRAFFIC ARRANGEMENTS AT THE REPUBLIC DEVELOPMENT IN BELCONNEN 12.126 The Committee asked about the traffic arrangements agreed between the developer and the Directorate for the Republic development in Belconnen. 12.127 The Directorate informed the Committee that: The directorate has a team that deals with EPSDD on developments. On this parti cular development there is a bit of work ongoing right now to assess the traffic impacts of that development, and to look at any off -site works that are required to be delivered by the developer to support that particular development. But that work is ongo ing. Some of it might include the requirement initially for some modelling, to understand the full extent of the traffic impacts of that development. We can then have a better understanding of any off -site works that are required. 1780 12.128 The Committee asked whet her the Directorate has given a final sign -off of the Development Application for the Republic development and were informed that 'we are continuing to work with the developer to really determine what the traffic and transport impacts are within that vicin ity'. 1781 12.129 The Committee asked whether it is normal to have a construction underway without traffic arrangements being finalised and the Development Application being signed -off on by TCCS. 12.130 The Directorate provided the following explanation: In this development, because it is large and it is complex, I understand that the developer has staged the development applications. The works that are being undertaken now are only to a certain stage. It is really getting it out of the ground, where we get the fo otings dug and complete and the several basement levels done. Mr Davidson is referring to further approvals being needed for the rest of the development. But it is multiple towers as well. Obviously, the concept is known about, originally what the develope r was proposing and those sort of things. That all gets factored in, all those broader planning terms: traffic and all that sort of stuff.1782 1779 Mr Edghill, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 594. 1780 Mr Davidson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 595. 1781 Mr Davidson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 596. 1782 Mr Corrigan, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 596. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 382 ROAD MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION 12.131 The Committee noted that funding for road maintenance will reduce by $17 million in 2019 - 2020 and asked how the Government will be able to maintain the Territory's roads in good condition with an eight per cent cut in the road maintenance budget. 12.132 The Directorate explained that: The logic behind the way Roads ACT prepares its road mainte nance program, principally the road resurfacing program, each year is to essentially reassess every segment of the road again on a yearly basis and optimise the program within any given year to deliver the maximum benefit in terms of prolonging the life of the overall network within the resources available. I guess what that means is that we have data which is never any more than three years old on the condition and the position of each segment of road in terms of its deterioration over time from wear and tear, and we are able to see, for each segment, the optimum time for intervention to maximise the benefit that we get from what is mostly a preventative treatment program in terms of extending the life of those segments and then aggregate that up in quite a sophisticated computer modelling exercise and determine what the maximum benefit over the whole network is for a given resource input.1783 12.133 The Committee noted that the budget papers indicate that targets for road maintenance remain unchanged.1784 The Committee asked again how the Directorate intends on keeping currently levels of maintenance with a reduced budget. 12.134 In response, the Directorate told the Committee: The four and five per cent targets are essentially based, a little simplistically, on the expected us eful life of the surfacing treatments of roads. They are targets that give a broad indication of whether, essentially, we are reinvesting in the road network at a rate that is equivalent to the rate at which those surfaces are being consumed by use. Broadly speaking, that four and five per cent indicates that, if we can meet those targets, we are in a steady state, if you like; we are reinvesting in the road network at the same rate at which we are consuming it. There is a range of strategies that we use to target that steady state, that equilibrium state. We certainly are constantly trialling and investigating different treatment options to maximise value for money, and the optimisation process that I discussed earlier is, in fact, also aimed at extracting the maximum possible benefit from the resources available in pursuit of those targets. 1785 1783 Mr Marshall, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 600- 601. 1784 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements H, Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate , p. 22. 1785 Mr Marshall, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 601. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 383 12.135 The Committee reiterated that this does not explain how the Directorate intends to absorb an eight per cent reduction in the roads maintenance budget while ensuring cur rent levels maintenance. The Minister made the following statement: There is not a direct correlation between the number in the back of the budget papers and the five per cent target, and this year, in the 2018 -19 financial year, there was a road resealing blitz which is probably being picked up in those numbers. There is an ongoing maintenance program which will help us to meet the four to five per cent target, and the numbers in there reflect the fact that we have done a blitz this year and it will be going back to normal levels in the following financial years.1786 12.136 In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice, the Directorate provided an explanation on the reduction in the road maintenance budget: 'the main driver for the decrease in 2019 -20 Budget from the Estimated Outcomes is reclassification of expenses associated with Light Rail Operations function to the Rail Transport' category. Additionally, it was indicated that 'the Roads ACT budget specifically for roads maintenance, including resurfacing, pot hole repairs, line marking, and routine works will increase by 5 per cent in 2019 -20'. 1787 12.137 This Answer to a Question Taken on Notice also responded to a question on the cost of the roads maintenance blitz, informing the Committee that the cost of the blitz was $ 4.5 million over a three -year period, budgeted for in the 2017 -18 Budget.1788 PATH MAINTENANCE 12.138 The Committee recounted reports1789 that the ACT Government's investment in path maintenance is inadequate. It wanted to know what action the Government will take to ensure paths are adequately maintained. 12.139 The Minister provided the following response: It is certainly something we need to consider on an ongoing basis, but we have been investing significantly in upgrades to active travel connections. In last year's budget I think there was $30 million for active travel. That is a significant investment that we have not seen on that scale in the ACT since a lot of the suburbs were built. We are seeing investments in maintenance. In my area alone there is footpath maintenanc e in Kambah and Weston Creek. In the budget there is of course the age- friendly cities program which has been moving on to a further set of suburbs. That is less around maintaining existing footpaths and 1786 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 601- 602. 1787 Answer to a Question Taken on Notice E19-114, answered 4 July 2019. For the relevant section of the Budget Papers, see: ACT Budget 2019 -20, Budget Paper 3, Budget Outlook , p. 331. 1788 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19-114, answered 4 July 2019. 1789 For example, see: ACT Auditor -General, Maintenance of Selected Road Infrastructure Assets , Report No. 5, 2017, ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 384 more around improving and updating some of the old infrastructure. That can be updating ramps or widening paths in certain areas, depending on what the community feedback has been. Interestingly, when we engaged with the community through the better suburbs process the recommendation was not really to inc rease the amount of investment in this area; it was to maintain a similar level, so we have to consider that as well as the Auditor -General's recommendations and so forth when we are making decisions. 1790 12.140 The Committee queried whether the funding used for com munity paths is a part of the funding for road transport maintenance and was informed in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice that 'community path maintenance is allocated from Roads ACT recurrent budget. $5.6 million has been allocated in the 2019 -20 b udget for community path maintenance.'1791 12.141 In terms of where resources are targeted the Directorate explained that : We target our resources in terms of where we know there is likelihood of serious injury, things like that, and we look at our maintenance prog ram. Sometimes the condition of a path is acceptable but it might be subject to continual washouts, a lot of tree debris, things like that. So we look at other interventions as well. It is not like we just sit there and just look at it in a lineal fashion \u2014I know they are lineal paths of course \u2014but we look at how we get the best return on safety for the city, particularly cyclists. 1792 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.142 Despite assurances from the Minister that there has been an increase in funding for active travel infrastructure, the Committee remains concerned about the growing number of footpaths in disrepair and in need of maintenance. Recommendation 202 12.143 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government invest more resources into footpath and shared path repair and maintenance. 1790 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 603. 1791 Answer to Question Taken on Noti ce E19- 115, answered 28 June 2019. 1792 Mr Corrigan, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 603.

The funding would be used to refurbish the freed -up 'space for the community so that programs can be run on that level' and to make the ground floor accessible after hours.1797 12.148 The Directorate provided further details on the how the funding will be used: That money will be used, first and foremost, to make that ground floor room accessible. The very strong feedback that we received from the community was that they wanted to be able to use that room after hours. .. We are probably going to put in a glass wall, so that you can get from that meeting room. If you know the access point into the library, there will be a glass wall around it, so that people can access the toilets. The toilets that are part of the Access Canberra facility are not up to standard and are not accessible at all to people with disabilities.

Of course, we have to put in some securit y systems so that people can access it after hours.1798 ACCOUNTABILITY INDICA TORS FOR LIBRARY SERVICES \u2014VISITS AND ITEMS BORROWED 12.149 The Committee noted that Library Services are not expected to meet their 2018 -19 targets for per- capita physical visits and items borrowed.1799 The Committee wanted to know why this was the case. 12.150 The Directorate indicated that there had been a change in how libraries are used by residents compared to previous years: Back in my day, you went to the library and borrowed a whole lot of books to do your school projects, for example. These days a lot of that is online. Teachers do insist that young people still go and use a book in their studies, but nowhere near as much. If you needed to do some ready reference work, you often borrowed a book; these days you look it up on the internet.1800 12.151 In relation to physical visits, it was indicated that the per capita physical visits figures remain strong and that the slight dip in the figure was caused by the closure of Dickson Library for several months at the beginning of the 2018 -19 financial year. It was also explained that the contin uing use of library facilities by residents was due to Library Services offering over 160 different programs every two months and people using the libraries as community spaces. 1801 ITEMS ADDED TO THE HE RITAGE COLLECTION 12.152 The Committee also pointed out that the target for ACT publications or collections added to the heritage collection was not met. It asked whether this was due to the relocation of the Heritage Library. 12.153 In response it was suggested that the relocation of the Heritage Library was partly the re ason but also pointed out the inappropriateness of the heritage item acquisition figure as an accountability indicator: You will note that we are recommending that that come out as an accountability indicator. It is so very dependent on people donating the ir papers and material to us. 1798 Ms Little, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 584- 585. 1799 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements H, Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate , p. 23. 1800 Ms Little, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 585. 1801 Ms Little, Pr oof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 585- 586.

Sometimes it is years of working with someone to donate those.1802 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.154 The Committee agrees with Library Services that the total acquisition figure for heritage items is inappropriate as an accountability indicator, as this is reliant on donations from members of the public. The Committee believes a more appropriate indicator would be around the quality of the don ation experience. Recommendation 203 12.155 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government remove the number of ACT publications or collections added to the Heritage Library as an accountability indicator for Library Services and replaces this with a more appro priate indicator.

The Committee wanted to know why this was the case. 12.159 The Directorate informed the Committee that: The issue is around privacy as well. Those locations are not on our register of addresses; so we cannot confirm that that actually is an address. That is to do with housing and defen ce. We have asked Defence Housing or the other housing areas to look for that address. We do not have access to their address information to confirm that they actually are a SUD \u2014a single unit development \u2014to be able to get the facility. 1811 12.160 When asked why the Directorate could not get this information, the Committee was told that 'we have been working with ACT Housing and Defence and we have been unable to get that information'. 1812 12.161 In addition the Directorate indicated that: The issue is that we do not have acces s to all the databases that we need but we are working through that with them to solve it. The short answer is that if a public housing tenant wants a green bin we can resolve it and get them a green bin. It can be done.1813 12.162 The Committee inquired how TCCS go t information about other locations in Canberra where Green bins can be supplied but did not receive a response on this matter. 12.163 The Directorate did provide additional information in an Answer to a Question on Notice which indicated that the supply of green bins is managed by a contractor wh o requires the ACT Government to provide a list of eligible households to validate registrations. The Committee was informed that 'the list of addresses for ACT Housing could not be provided to the contractor due to priva cy protocols relating to the Housing Assistance Act 2007 .'1814 1810 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 582- 584. 1811 Mr Haraldson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 579. 1812 Mr Haraldson, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 579. 1813 Mr Corrigan, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 581. 1814 Answer to a Question on Notice E19- 387, answered 5 July 2019. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019 -2020 389 12.164 Additionally, the Answer to the Question on Notice indicated that 'there is no such problem with Defence Housing residents and the concerns raised appear to be due to a misunderstanding'. It conti nued: 'Defence Housing Australia has confirmed that tenants of its properties are available to register directly through the online green bin registration process on the same basis as other ACT residents'.1815 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.165 The Committee recognises the need to protect the privacy of ACT Housing tenant s, however the current methodology for registering for a green bin fails to protect it. TCCS has said that all addresses in the ACT that are not large -multi -unit or public housing are on the Green Bin part of its website. If this the case, it enables the public to identify an ACT Housing property by its absence from the database. 12.166 The Committee believes that the application process for green waste bins for tenants of ACT Housing can be significantly simplified. City Services currently provides such tenants with red waste and yellow recycling bins and the Committee cannot see any reason why such tenants cannot also easily be provided with green waste bins if they pay the required registration fees. If required, th e Directorate should bypass the contractor and supply these tenants directly. The Committee believes that because the registration process for the green waste bins require a fee, the registration process will not be abused for frivolous reasons. 12.167 The Commit tee is also concerned in case there are other government services that ACT Housing tenants cannot access easily because they are ACT Housing tenants. Recommendation 204 12.168 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government change the information displayed on the green bins part of the T ransport Canberra and City Services website so that it is no longer possible to identify ACT Housing properties. Recommendation 205 12.169 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government improve the application process to allow ACT H ousing tenants to easily request green waste bins for the address at which they reside . 1815 Answer to a Question on Notice E19- 387, answered 5 July 2019.

It wante d to know what measures the Government will take to improve the results of the Scheme. 12.171 The Minister provided the following response: We are increasing the number of drop -off points. Yesterday I announced that four extra spots will be available: at the IGAs in Evatt and Farrer, at Anglicare in Phillip and we have been piloting a container pod which is a drop -off point available at the RDOC in Gungahlin. We are hoping that the new increased return points will be more convenient for the community to use, parti cularly after work hours, and that we will see an increased rate. We are also working with the CDS scheme operator to increase awareness about the scheme. We will be looking to do that over the next 12 months with a new education campaign. We are looking at further drop -off points; there will 18 by the end of this financial year and then we will work with the scheme operator to see whether even more points can be rolled out to make it more convenient.1816 CITY MAINTENANCE AND SERVICES (2.4) 12.172 Output 2.4, City Maintenance and Services, provide planning and management of the Territory's parks and urban open space system including associated community infrastructure, maintaining the look and feel of the city, and managing the urban forest and sportsgrounds facilit ies.

It will provide our public nursery in Yarralumla with a tree propagation program. They will be given significant lead -in time to be able to propagate the trees. We are looking at this from a climate change perspective, in terms of supporting our adaptation to climate change, because we know that it is much cooler in areas where there is a sig nificant tree canopy. Areas in Canberra that are more at risk as a result of climate change will be part of that focus. That will include the new areas of Gungahlin and Molonglo, I would imagine, as well as areas where the trees have come to the end of the ir life and need to be replaced. 1826 12.176 In response to a question on whether the Government has a tree canopy target, the Minister informed the Committee that a target has not yet been established. He added that 'in the Better Suburbs work, there was a recommend ation for a target of 30 per cent by 2030, which is very ambitious. We will consider that in looking at a target'.1827 12.177 The Committee wanted to know what work the Government is doing on the introduction of new tree species optimally suited to the Canberra env ironment. 1820 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 563- 564; 566- 567. 1821 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 564. 1822 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 567- 568. 1823 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 571-573; 575- 577; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 106, answered 28 June 2019. 1824 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 573-575; Answe r to Question Taken on Notice E19- 105, answered 28 June 2019. 1825 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 586- 590. 1826 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 560. 1827 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2 019, p. 560. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 392 12.178 The Directorate indicated: We have been working through the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate and with the ANU to get advice around what species will best suit Canberra's climate for the decades to come. We are actually looking at places like Wagga Wagga and how they have managed, because they have the climate of Canberra in the future, or Canberra will have the climate of Wagga Wagga in the future, so to speak. That might mean that we see some new species in Canberra that we perhaps have not seen in our streets before, one of those being the lemon scented gum ...1828 12.179 The Committee asked what the expected average cost per tree will be for the planting and were informed that: Obviously for the purpose of building a business ca se we have made some estimates about costs. We have estimated around $325 per tree for a tree that is relatively well established, is planted under a contract arrangement and has a period of maintenance afterwards, right down to around about $30 for some t rees that we will use community volunteers to plant, which will generally be a smaller tree and probably planted in the urban open space area rather than on nature strips. We have a mix of both those categories in the budget and we are confident that that will allow us to deliver the 17,000. 1829 12.180 The Committee asked for a breakdown of this cost per tree. In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice they were told that: An average cost of S25 per tree is used for community -based planting (including tree purchase, site preparation and planting). This reflects that community plantings will be focussed on establishing inexpensive native tube stock in open space areas where site preparation is straightforward. The cost of follow -up watering will vary dependin g on species, planting location and seasonal conditions. For budgeting purposes, an average cost of $20 per tree per year is used, noting that this cost will be incurred on a staged basis as trees are planted over the three year program. 1830 12.181 In relation to a discussion on community involvement in the tree planting initiative, the Minister said the Government wants 'to encourage the community to get involved and really care about the trees that are in their street'. When asked whether the Government will take actions to make it easier of members of the community to plant trees on public land, the Minister said that 'I think that is something we can consider under the urban forest strategy \u2014 1828 Mr Alegria, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 561. 1829 Mr Alegria , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 562. 1830 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 104, answered 28 June 2019. APPROPRIATION BILL 2019- 2020 AND APPROPRIATION (O FFI CE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ) BILL 2019- 2020 393 how to work with the community'. He also mentioned, however, that there ar e regulations in place that would need to be considered.1831 COMMITTEE COMMENT 12.182 The Committee recognises that the replacement of existing tree stock is vitally important for the overall health and integrity of Canberra's urban forest. 12.183 The Committee welcomes t he Government's funding commitment for 17,000 new trees. However, the Committee believes that while this is a start, further investment is required. The Committee urges the Government to further increase the number of new tree plantings for the city and pr ovide adequate resources for the maintenance of all trees planted. Recommendation 206 12.184 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government increase its investment in tree planting across the forward estimates and provide adequate resources for ongoing tree maintenance. NEW COMPLIANCE TEAM 12.185 The Committee noted the budget allocation for a new compliance team. It sought clarity on the role this team would play. 12.186 In response, the Minister informed the Committee that: They will be in addition to domestic animal se rvices staff, which already has a compliance focus and in addition to the licensing compliance team within TCCS that, I guess, handles higher level investigations as well. They will be focusing on the pieces of legislation that City Services has responsib ility for, including the Domestic Animals Act, the Public Unleased Land Act, Tree Protection Act compliance and the Litter Act. They will have a remit across all of those, mainly focusing on some of the lower level offences there so the rest of the licensi ng compliance team can focus on the higher level offences. They will be going out and educating the community. They will then be issuing warnings. Then they will be going out where necessary and issuing infringement notices as well. 1832 12.187 In response to a quest ion on where this team would be working, the Directorate informed the Committee that it would work in targeted locations: 1831 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 565. 1832 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 564. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 394 We have reasonably good data about where there are hotspots for illegal dumping, uncontrolled dogs, any of those kinds of issues. We k now that, if we put our resources into a particular area, we will get good value for money in terms of being able to engage with a large number of people. As we build our intelligence and our data, we can target further to make sure that we are targeting t he areas where there is the most need. 1833 DOG REGISTRATION 12.188 The Committee asked whether the Government is intending to introduce annual registrations for dogs. 12.189 The Minister informed the Committee that currently dog owners are required to pay a one- off fee for the registration of their dog. He said that under the Canberra Dog Model the Government was proposing to introduce an annual registration process, but that this would not involve additional fees. 12.190 The Minister outlined the reasons for this change: We are d oing that for three reasons. It is because we want to make sure that we rehome dogs to their owners if the dogs are lost. We need updated details in order to do that. The second reason is that we want to make sure that we can enforce the domestic animal laws that we have. Again, to do that, we need to make sure that more dogs are registered. The third reason is to get a picture of how many dogs we actually have in the ACT. At the moment, with lifetime registration, if a dog dies we do not actually know that it has died. It will give us a much better sense of how many dogs there are and that will help us to better target our compliance education activities. Also it will enable us to better educate the community about responsible dog ownership. 1834 12.191 In reply to a question on how these annual registrations will be completed, the Minister told the Committee that 'we would want to do it online to make it as easy as possible but also to reduce administrative costs for the Government'.1835 12.192 The Committee asked for the numb er of dog registrations per year for the last ten years. This was provided to the Committee in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice.1836 1833 Mr Alegria, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 567. 1834 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 572- 573. 1835 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p . 573. 1836 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 106, answered 28 June 2019.

Let us imagine that a construction company in the city requires the verge to be fenced off so that it is safe. They pay us a square metre r ate per day for the duration of their use of that land.1837 12.195 The Directorate then confirmed that land -use revenue is also generated from businesses such as cafes and restaurants which utilise public space outside shop premises but noted that 'particularly the construction use of land is a significant source of revenue for us'.1838 12.196 In response to a question on whether the slowing of the current construction boom would cause revenue problems for the Directorate, the Committee was told that it would not, 'because we know that we are only grabbing a certain proportion of what is out there'.1839 1837 Mr Alegria, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 574. 1838 Mr Alegria, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 574. 1839 Mr Alegria, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 574. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 396 12.197 It was explained further that: There are a whole lot of small things out there that we have never really been able to tackle in a systematic way. They are the kinds of things that we are going to be trialling in this next six month period to see exactly what is out there that we could better tackle and where we could generate more revenue and, as the minister said, make a better city, because we are going to be holding people to acc ount for what they do out in the public realm.1840 12.198 The Committee requested a breakdown of the revenue generated through land -use fees and charges. This information was provided in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice, which indicated that between 1 July 20 18 and 27 June 2019 $1,901,546 from Land Use Permit Fees and $125,910 from Land Use Licence Fees were generated.1841 PLAYGROUNDS 12.199 The Committee asked a range of questions on new playgrounds. For one, the Committee wanted to know what new playgrounds have been budgeted for and which exiting ones will be receiving upgrades. 12.200 The Minister replied that: As a result of funding of $1.9 million that was made available for the play spaces forum last year we undertook to do play space reviews in five suburbs, and those p lay space reviews are underway as we speak, working with the community to look at all playgrounds in each of those suburbs, what the next play experiences are, what improvements can be made either to all the playgrounds or to one playground, the need to bu ild a new one or to upgrade one playground or several playgrounds in those suburbs.1842 12.201 In response to a follow -up question, the Minister explained that the five suburbs are Torrens, Waramanga, Richardson, Narrabundah, and Higgins. He also noted that funding has been provided for 19 play space refreshes. The refresh will include 'painting new playgrounds, and replacing some equipment, and new shade sails at certain playgrounds as well to make them accessible particularly during the summer for families'. The Mi nister told the Committee that shade sails would be provided for playgrounds in Hughes, Issacs, Monash and Macquarie. 1843 1840 Mr Alegria , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 575. 1841 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 105, answered 28 June 2019. 1842 Ministe r Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 586- 587. 1843 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 587.

The Committee hopes that the resources for the refreshes are effectively used to replace broken or ageing park facilities across the city in a timely fashion. Recommendation 207 12.203 The Committee recommen ds that the ACT Government ensure that all broken or ageing park facilities across the city are replaced in a timely manner. CAPITAL LINEN SERVICE (2.5) 12.204 Output 2.5, Capital Linen Service, provides a managed linen service to a range of customers including public and private hospitals, health and aged care providers, hotels, restaurants, major tourist attractions, educational institutions and emergency services.1844 MATTERS CONSIDERED 12.205 The matter considered by the Committee in relation to Capital Linen Service was: accountability indicators;1845 KEY ISSUES ACCOUNTABILITY INDICA TORS 12.206 On Notice, the Committee asked several questions concerning the accountability indicators for Capital Linen Service. Firstly, it wanted to know why tonnage delivered has been dropped as an accountability target. 12.207 In an Answer to a Question on Notice, the Committee was informed that Capital Linen Service has shifted its focus to 'customer retention and business consolidation' and that, therefore, 'measuring and reporting growth in tonnage is not a relevant performance indicator'. 1846 1844 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 19. 1845 Answer to Question on Notice E19- 390, answered 8 July 2019. 1846 Answer to Question on Notice E19- 390, answered 8 July 2019. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 398 12.208 The Committee wanted to know why one accountability indicator measures service \"delivered in full\", not \"delivered in full and on time\" or \"delivered in full on time and on budget\" and were told by the Dir ectorate in the Answer to a Question on Notice that: In terms of \"on time\", CLS is unable to compare the actual delivery time against the time the order was scheduled to be delivered, hence the conservative description of \"delivered in full\". In terms of \" on budget\", the granularity of the budget process is unable to provide the cost to produce an individual order.1847 12.209 The Committee asked whether it is good governance for a business unit to only have two accountability indicators. The Directorate indicated that while Capital Linen Service is open to increasing the number of its accountability indicators, 'data gathering systems and processes in some of these areas still requires further development to ensure utmost accuracy'.1848 12.210 The Committee wanted to know how the public is to know that they are receiving value for money from owning Capital Linen Service. In response, they were informed that Capital Linen Service 'was recently subject to a value for money test undertaken by ACT Health during the last service lev el agreement process in 2017' and that: This test benchmarked CLS against other laundries operating in the ACT and other jurisdictions. The determination detailed that CLS' offering was competitive, providing value for money to the Territory. 1849 ACT PUBLIC CEMETERIES AUTHORITY 12.211 The ACT Public Cemeteries Authority is an independent statutory authority established under the Cemeteries and Crematoria Act 2003 to effectively and efficiently manage public cemeteries and crematoria in the ACT. The Authority currentl y manages and operates three public cemeteries at Gungahlin, Woden and Hall.1850 The key purpose of the ACT Public Cemeteries Authority is to: ensure the equitable availability of interment options, and maintain burial capacity in the medium to long term f or the ACT community; operate as an efficient Government business with a strong customer service focus; and 1847 Answer to Question on Notice E19- 390, answered 8 July 2019. 1848 Answer to Question on Notice E19- 390, answered 8 July 2019. 1849 Answer to Question on Notice E19- 390, answered 8 July 2019. 1850 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 62.

That is how the results are reported back to us '.1862 1851 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 62. 1852 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 556- 557; Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 102, answered 28 June 2019. 1853 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 557. 1854 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 J une 2019, p p. 557- 558. 1855 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 558- 559. 1856 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 558- 559. 1857 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 559 1858 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p p. 569- 571. 1859 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 569. 1860 Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, pp. 569. 1861 ACT Budget 2019- 20, Budget Statements E, Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development , p. 6 5. 1862 Mr Corrigan, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 557. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 400 12.215 The ACT Cemeteries Authority, added: We provide an opportunity for all users of the services of the cemetery to fill in a survey and return it. If any matters are raised that are of concern, those are followed up. There is actually a fairly low rate of expressions of concern because people do not tend to do that at a time of bereavement. Nonetheless, anything that is raised is taken very seriously. 1863 12.216 The Committee asked the number of survey responses generally received by the Cemeteries Authority. In an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice, the Minister informed the Committee were informed that 'in the period 2017 -18 there were 60 survey respondents' a nd 'in the period of 2018 -19 (to date) there were 92 survey respondents'. 1864 STAFFING 12.217 The Committee asked why there was an increase in staff in 2019 -20 and a similar increase last year. 12.218 The ACT Cemeteries Authority provided the following answer: It is simply volume of business. The major bit of work that the cemeteries do is the maintenance of the cemeteries, there is ongoing work involved with burials. The volume of burials is not growing, but you would understand that the more sites are used, the more maint enance is needed. Essentially, you just expand the number of gravesites that need to be maintained every year. 1865 12.219 The Committee asked about the annual increase in gravesites and was informed in an Answer to a Question Taken on Notice that 'in the period of 2 018-19 (to date), there were 266 graves created and one additional position'.1866 12.220 The Committee noted that male staff outnumber female staff employed by the Cemeteries Authority and asked why this was the case. 12.221 The ACT Cemeteries Authority said this was becau se most of the staff are employed in grounds maintenance, and while he acknowledged that there are women interested in this type of work, he noted that 'it is just that the pool of people they are drawing from has a lower proportion of women'. He added tha t 'it is desirable, where possible, to seek to employ women in those areas of work'.1867 1863 Mr Bartos, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 557. 1864 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 102, answered 28 June 2019. 1865 Mr Bartos, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 558. 1866 Answer to Question Taken on Notice E19- 103, answered 28 June 2019. 1867 Mr Bartos, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 558.

Another thing...was making opportunities available in the authority for graduates to rotate through'. He added that there 'are other things in terms of standard workplace morale -boosting activities, such as staff social functions and so on'. 1869 SOUTHERN MEMORIAL PARK 12.224 The Committee asked about the budget allocation for the planning and development of Southern Memorial Park. 12.225 The Minister provided the Committee with the following information: This is funding that was provided through budget review which is reflected in the budget appropriation of $900,000 to further the planning for southern memorial park. We envisage that will be located adjacent to Long Gully Road, so I guess it could be in the Hume/Tuggeranong a rea. This will be a future cemetery for the ACT.1870 12.226 The Minister further explained that because Woden Cemetery is now closed for new burials, Southern Memorial Park 'will provide the future cemetery needs for the south side in particular'. 1871 12.227 The Committee ask ed when the Southern Memorial Park is expected to be completed. The Minister did not provide a definitive timeline for completion, noting 'we do not have a date for that, but we are starting the work and the money is there to do that planning'. 1872 12.228 The Direc torate explained to the Committee on how the $900,000 budget allocation will be spent: The $900,000 is identified in the budget and our capital works team has commenced some early planning based on the master plan work the cemeteries authority undertook in 2011. There are various stages because to go ahead with the Southern Memorial Park on the southern side of Canberra we want it ultimately to be a very good facility with memorial halls and the like with good gardens and a range of burial options and inter nment of ashes and all these sorts of things. 1868 Mr Bartos, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 559. 1869 Mr Bartos, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 559. 1870 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 569. 1871 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 569. 1872 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 570. SELECT COMMITTEE ON ESTIMATES 2019- 2020 402 The preliminary planning work is undertaken and we will look at a staged approach. There is further consultation to go on with the Cemeteries Authority. Ultimately I imagine the Minister will appoint an authority to run it. So there is a fair bit of work to go. We are working through design work at the moment. The other part is that there is box gum woodland on the identified site, so we need to work through any environmental approvals that may be necessary. Ultimately we will come back to Government for further capital works funding and further consultation with the community. 1873 12.229 In response to a follow -up question, the Minister informed the Committee that there is currently no consideration be ing given to grave recycling and that 'at the moment burial is in perpetuity in the ACT'.1874 12.230 On this matter, Mr Bartos provided additional information: At present burial is interment in the ground but there is an option now of natural burial as opposed to burial in a tradition al-style coffin. Renewable tenure was something considered by the Assembly when it had an inquiry into cemeteries. I think the position back then is the same as now it is certainly an idea that has some important reasons why it should be considered but it is also one that is sensitive and needs considerable community consultation. In line with the recommendations of the Assembly inquiry that is something worth considering, but worth considering very carefully. 1875 1873 Mr Corrigan, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 570. 1874 Minister Steel MLA, Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 569. 1875 Mr Bartos , Proof Transcript of Evidence , 21 June 2019, p. 569.
