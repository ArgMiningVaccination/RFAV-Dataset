Extremely intuitive, she guides you to heal the emotional, spiritual and physical causes of your issue. As a result, she enables your body to heal itself. I have been to multiple chiropractors who were good at adjusting me, but my body could never hold the adjustment for more than a day or two no matter how many times I went. With dr Lisa, because my body is re-educating itself, it is finding its own new balance. Even more than the physical changes, I appreciate the spiritual growth and emotional healing. Dr Lisa really gets how deep healing happens. She is a rare gem. - 9/21/2015 Dr Lisa Hartnett is a wonderful and gifted energetic healer and NSA chiropractor. She works as a NSA chiropractor with a very gentle touch that can relax tensions in your body, heal pain, and gets stuck places or energy moving again. She can also guide you to heal emotional stuckness and wounds. I am very grateful for all of her help! She helped me to get access to past grief, how to deal with loss, and she has given me many tools how to deal with emotions, and how to make my life fuller. My life is now more fulfilled, deeper and richer. I don't need to suppress emotions as much anymore, and that makes space for more life force, more energy and happiness! - 2/17/2017 I am giving Lisa a review primarily for her animal communicator work. Her ability to mind-link with my cat remotely saved her life. The cat, Honey, was admitted to the Veterinary Hospital due to not eating and not eliminating. While I knew that Honey, had an arthritic condition, and was administering medication to ease that, Lisa's remote animal communication session revealed that the pain was far greater than any one imagined. Not only that, but the session revealed that the cat's main focus in living was her relationship with me. Lisa indicated that my recent extended absences (which Lisa had no way of knowing about personally but shared that was what she was getting from the cat) were also negatively impacting the cat's emotional well being and desire to live, and therefore her health status. As a result of the session I had the Veterinarian adjust and add to her pain management regime, which had immediate good results within 2 days, and I also made a point of spending more quality time with Honey on a daily basis. Since that session, what seemed to be a cat in certain decline and on the way to death has turned around to a healthy, warm, sweet, interactive cat. Thank you, Lisa!!!!
