Hepatitis A vaccine should be administered prior to a rrival of the adopted child or travel to adoptee country. More information is at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/default.htm . 4 Influenza Vaccine For the 2009 -10 season influenza vaccine is recommended for all children 6 months through 18 years of age, removing the qualification \"if feasible\" from the recommendation for children 5 through 18 years of age. Offices should plan for yearly influenza vaccination of all children 6 months and older .

The Branch will inform VFC providers as soon as information becomes availabl e. Adolescent Vaccines A bivalent HPV vaccine and a second meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) are under review by the FDA. Hib Vaccine Shortage The shortage of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine will persist in 2009. All clinicians and local health departments should carefully read the CDC's most recent information on H ib disease . Assessments 2008 LHD and CHC Immunization Coverage Assessment Results The 200 8 statewide public clinic assessment included 135 local health department (LHD) clinics and 236 community health centers (CHCs). This was the first year that the birth cohort matched a calendar year ; i.e., children born between 1/1/2005 and 12/31/2005. To measure the immunization status of children served by these clinics, local staff collected immunization records from all two -year -olds attending the clinics (n = 43,409) and entered them into the Comprehensive Clinic Assessment Software Application (CoCASA ). Similar to recent years, s tatewide coverage levels for the 4:3:1:3:3:1 series were 66.3% ( in CHCs. (Table 1 ) CHC coverage levels are similar to the National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimate of 78.6\u00b13.9 during the period of 3/2007 -2/2008. As LHD clinics provide \"safety net\" immunizations to patients who receive immunizations from multiple providers , coverage levels at LHD clinics tend to be lower than at CHCs , which offer continuity of care. Coverage levels by local health jurisdiction , as well as ind ividual health department and CHC clinic results listed in ranking order, are available online.
