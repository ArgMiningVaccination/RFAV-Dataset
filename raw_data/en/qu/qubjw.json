Learn about cancer care in Alberta Cancer Care Services Start After a Cancer Diagnosis* Before you come to the cancer centre, the doctor who referred you should complete all of the needed tests and blood work. If this hasn't happened, a triage nurse (sometimes called triage coordinator or a nurse navigator) will contact the doctor and ask them to do this. Our triage nurses are registered nurses who coordinate referrals to the cancer centres. They work to book patients with the right doctor. They also support patients by explaining treatments and tests and help you prepare for your consult visit. Once a diagnosis of cancer is confirmed and a referral is made to Cancer Care Alberta (CCA): Your first appointment will be arranged. You will get an appointment letter in the mail and the triage nurse may contact you with details for your first appointment. Our registration team members may contact you to check your personal and insurance information before your first appointment. *Sometimes, patients will come to a cancer centre to see an oncologist or other specialist, when they have a pre-cancer diagnosis. If this is you, please know that the materials, resources, classes and supports are available for you also. Our Cancer Centres CCA is part of Alberta Health Services and is responsible for the programs and services at 17 cancer centres in the province. The centres offer different levels of service and are grouped into 3 different levels or \"types\" of centres. Tertiary CentresLarge cancer centres that offer a full range of specialist services. Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton) Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary) Regional CentresMedium-sized centres that offer many, but not all specialist services. In cancer care, these centres provide systemic treatments and some provide radiation treatments.Radiation and Systemic Treatment Central Alberta Cancer Centre (Red Deer) Jack Ady Cancer Centre (Lethbridge) Grande Prairie Cancer Centre (Grande Prairie) Systemic Treatment only Margery E Yuill Cancer Centre (Medicine Hat)AManage Your Cancer Care2 Community CentresSmaller centres in the local hospitals.

Find out where you can get care This map shows you where the 17 cancer centres are. Ask where your appointments will be and what treatments are available there. Check out 'Getting the practical help you need' (see page 37 ) if travel or financial issues are a challenge for you. Care Closer to Home We try to keep you as close to home as possible. But sometimes, people need to travel to a cancer centre that offers the type of treatment they need. Talk to your doctor or clinic nurse about care closer to home. You may be able to receive some or all treatments and supportive services closer to where you live. Some examples: some patients start their systemic treatment in a Tertiary or Regional centre and complete it at a cancer centre closer to home people living in south Calgary can sometimes have their treatments in High River When You Live Outside of Alberta If you live in another province and are going to a Cancer Care Alberta centre, there are other steps needed. For example, your home province may need to pre-approve your treatment in Alberta. We may need to wait to book your treatment visit until we receive this approval. Manage Your Cancer Care4 A3. Attend your first appointment Getting to the Centre Public Transportation Depending on what centre you are going to, public transportation may be available. Contact Alberta 211 to find out what options are available for you. 211 To plan your route to the tertiary centre or for more information: Edmonton www.edmonton.ca/ edmonton-transit-system- ets.aspx 780-496-1600Calgary www.calgarytransit.com/ 403-262-1000 Canadian Cancer Society Wheels of Hope Program The Canadian Cancer Society has volunteers who donate their time and vehicles to drive patients to and from their active cancer treatment appointments in some cities. There is a yearly registration fee of $100 for this service. 1-800-263-6750 Parking Information can be found at: www.albertahealthservices.ca/Parking/ provincialparking@ahs.ca 1-855-535-1100 Ask at your centre if weekly or monthly parking passes are available. Time Arrive early for your appointment to give yourself time to park and make your way to the reception desk at the main entrance to check in. How long will my first appointment take? You should plan to spend 2 to 4 hours for your first visit. Future visits may be shorter, but its a good idea to always allow yourself extra time. Help with Mobility Wheelchairs should be available at the main entrances of the centres. Identification When you arrive at the main reception, check in with the clerks at the desk. You will be asked to show one piece of photo ID (identification) and a second piece of government ID. W e suggest your healthcare card along with your driver's license or your Status/Treaty card. A2.

Manage Your Cancer Care 5What to Bring to Your Appointments Being prepared for your appointment can help make the experience smoother and more comfortable. Review and complete the checklist on page 51 to make sure you have everything you need. Remembering Information At your first appointment you will get lots of information about your diagnosis and treatment. It can be overwhelming and hard to remember everything. It can be helpful to: Have someone come with you to listen and take notes. There is space for one or two people you trust to attend your appointments with you. Take notes during the conversation. You might want to have a notebook that you use for all of your appointments or write in the books you are given like this one. Use the free AHS My Care Conversations app so you can audio record your conversation with your healthcare team. Find out how where to download and how to use the app on page 31 . Pregnancy and Fertility Pregnancy Treatments to someone who is pregnant can affect the unborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you may be pregnant or if you have been trying to get pregnant. Fertility Cancer and cancer treatment can sometimes damage the reproductive organs such as the ovaries and testicles. These changes can have short or long-term effects on your fertility (the ability to get someone pregnant or to get pregnant and carry a child to a healthy birth). Talk to your doctor before treatment starts if you would like to have a child in the future.

Hearing how you are doing and what questions or concerns you have helps us provide the best care possible. If we know what matters to you with each visit we can help provide the support, information or even referrals you need. Cancer Doctor (Oncologist/Physician) There are different types of cancer doctors (oncologists). You may see a: Medical Oncologist (systemic treatment doctor) Radiation Oncologist (radiation treatment doctor) Surgical Oncologist (surgeon) Hematologist Oncologist (blood cancer doctor) Gynecologist Oncologist (surgeons who also prescribe systemic treatment for cancers that affect female reproductive organs) They will tell you your treatment options and the risks and benefits. The doctor makes the treatment plan with you. Family Doctor Helps manage your health before, during and after treatment.

Learn the basics of cancer It is very hard to hear the words \"you have cancer.\" It can be a difficult and confusing time. It's important to understand what cancer is, so you can better understand your options and make decisions about your treatment. What is cancer? Our body is made up of many cells. Healthy cells know when to divide and when to die. Cancer happens when cells start to grow out of control. When these cells grow and divide, they can form a lump called a tumour. Not all tumours are cancer. Some are non-cancerous (also called benign ). It might help to use the example of a garden: Cancer cellsGood cellsA Healthy Body Imagine your body as a garden. The soil is your immune system, the good plants are your good cells, and the weeds are the cancer cells. When you're healthy, the good plants grow and the soil helps keep the weeds away. When the odd weed starts to grow, the body is able to get rid of it by itself. Cancer cellsGood cells A Body with Cancer Cancer cells are like weeds in your garden. Sometimes the body cannot get rid of the weeds and needs help.B It can be hard to remember everything you hear. Make a plan to help. You can: Bring someone with you Take Notes Audio record with the My Care Conversations app Healthy cells dividing: Normal CellsCancer CellsManage Your Cancer Care12 Types of Cancer There are over 215 types of cancer and even each type of cancer can be different depending on what stage and grade it is at. Stage of a cancer - the size of the tumour and how far it has spread from where it began Grade of a cancer - how the cancer cells look (under a microscope) Determining the stage and looking at the grade of the cancer helps doctors recommend what type of treatment would be best. The doctor will also consider any other health conditions you have, whether you have had cancer or cancer treatment before and your specific concerns. We are here to support you in whatever way we can. You may get lots of different advice from well-meaning family, friends and even strangers. Not everything that someone else has experienced will work or make sense for you, even if they have the same type of cancer. Stay true to yourself and make decisions that are right for you.

Ask questions about your cancer diagnosis It's important to make sure you have all the information you need. Listen carefully and share any concerns you have with your doctor. Tell the doctor If you do not understand what they are saying and ask them to explain things in a different way. Get the information you need by asking questions that are important to you. Prepare questions before you talk with your doctor. You may want to ask questions like: What kind of cancer do I have, and where did it start? Has the cancer spread to other parts of my body? How advanced is my cancer? B3.

Understand the types of treatment There are many different types of cancer treatments including: systemic treatment, radiation treatment, surgery and stem cell transplant. Not all of these might be options for you. To learn more about how a treatment plan is made for you, see the next section. Once a treatment plan is made, we will give you a book that tells you more about that type of treatment. Systemic Treatment Systemic treatment is any medication that travels through your body in the bloodstream to find, damage and destroy cancer cells. This medication can also affect healthy cells in your body. Systemic treatment can be used alone or combined with other treatments. Types of systemic treatment include: chemotherapy targeted therapy immunotherapy hormone therapy Cancer cellsGood cellsChemotherapy Chemotherapy is like spraying a weed killer on the whole garden. The goal is to kill the weeds, but sometimes some of the healthy plants are also affected. Cancer cellsGood cells Targeted Therapy Weeds are directly sprayed with weed killer. Good plants may still be damaged.C Continued next pageManage Your Cancer Care 17 Cancer cellsGood cells Immunotherapy Immunotherapies are like adding a fertilizer to the soil. They make the soil (immune system) stronger to restore the garden's health and remove the weeds. Cancer cellsGood cells Hormone Therapy Hormone therapy is like spreading mulch on the garden. The mulch blocks the sunlight and air that the weeds need to grow and stops more seeds from taking root. Radiation Treatment Radiation treatment is a cancer treatment that: Uses high energy x-rays to get rid of cancer cells or shrink tumours Treats many types of cancer as well as some conditions that are non-cancerous Can be used alone or combined with other treatments such as surgery, or chemotherapy. Cancer cellsGood cellsRadiation Treatment Radiation treatment is like increasing the power of the sun with a magnifying glass and aiming it at the weeds. The goal is to damage the weeds in order to get rid of them, or prevent them from growing or making new weeds. Sometimes other healthy plants nearby might get damaged as well.Manage Your Cancer Care18 Surgery Surgery involves cutting out the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around the cancer. The amount of tissue taken depends on the size of the cancer. Sometimes surgery is the only treatment a person needs. Other times systemic or radiation treatment are also needed. If you need surgery, your surgeon will talk with you about your options. Certain types of day surgeries to treat cancer are performed at our cancer centres, but most surgeries take place at other local hospitals. Cancer cellsGood cellsSurgery Surgery takes out the weeds and some of the healthy plants and soil around them. How much depends on the size of the weed. Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) Some people require blood and marrow stem cell transplants as part of their treatment. A specialized team supports your care during this treatment. Some types of transplants are done in Edmonton while others are done in Calgary. Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) SCT removes the seeds (new good cells) and stores them. Then the garden is treated with chemotherapy or radiation (or both), which kills both the weeds and the good cells. Seeds are then replanted so the garden can start new.Systemic Treatment Total Body IrradiationHarvesting the seeds Replanting the seedsManage Your Cancer Care 19C2. Make a treatment plan How a Treatment Plan is made We need many different types of doctors, nurses, and other care providers to help treat people with cancer. In the cancer program, we are organized into teams of many different types of care providers called multidisciplinary teams. This helps us give you the best care possible. Research has shown us which treatments work best for different types of cancer . By working together and using this evidence and research, we are able to recommend the best treatment plan for you. There are many things to consider when making a treatment plan. These include: 1. The type of cancer and where it is in your body 2. Any other medical conditions you may have 3. Whether you have had cancer treatment before 4. Provincial guidelines for treatment ( www.albertahealthservices.ca/info/cancerguidelines.aspx) 5. Your personal wishes and goals Your doctor will talk with you about your treatment plan, answer your questions, and work with you to decide the best plan for you and your goals. Complex case review Complex cases are cases that include other things that might make planning your treatment more difficult. When we get a complex case, we talk about it at a meeting called the Multidisciplinary Tumour Board Rounds (MTBR). This may happen before you come to your first consult, or at another time during your treatment. At MTBR, doctors and nurses from different specialties review your medical history and test results. This information helps them look at the best way to manage your care. The review may include radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, nurse practitioners, and other healthcare providers, or even doctors who work in other cancer centres or parts of Cancer Care Alberta. We do not review all cases at MTBR. It is okay for you to ask your oncologist if your case was reviewed at MTBR. If it has, you are welcome to ask what was recommended. If you are unsure of what your doctor has recommended for you for treatment, ask if your case was discussed at MTBR. If it was, then please know that a team of doctors and other health care providers reviewed your case and created a treatment plan for you. They may have also recommended more tests for you if needed. If your case was not discussed at MTBR, ask your oncologist if this review would be helpful. The results of the discussion will be reported back to you. This may delay the start of your treatment for a short time. Manage Your Cancer Care20 Concerns We welcome you to talk about your concerns with your doctor and nurses. Maybe something your doctor told you seems different than what you were told before, or you do not feel like your wishes have been respected. We want you to feel comfortable talking about your concerns. Often concerns can be managed by talking with your doctor or nurse. Our healthcare teams want to know about your concerns so we can do our best to work out a solution. If you do not have enough time during your clinic visit to talk about your concerns or ask questions, ask for another appointment or phone call. If you feel you cannot continue with your doctor, you may ask to see another doctor. Changing doctors can take time and it's important to know that you may need to: Continue working with your current doctor until the changes are made. Have your care at a different cancer centre if your doctor is the only one who treats your type of cancer or provides a certain type of treatment. Goals of treatment The goals of treatment are different for everyone, even for someone with the same type of cancer as you. This is because the stage and grade of their cancer or their personal wishes for treatment may be different than yours. The 3 goals for treatment are to: Become cancer-free \u2014 to get rid of the cancer from your body Get control \u2014 to stop the cancer from growing and spreading to other parts of your body (non-curative; palliative) Relieve or reduce symptoms the cancer may cause such as pain, or shortness of breath (palliative) Monitoring Your Health (Imaging Tests and Lab Work) You have had many tests to help find out the type of cancer you have and where it is in your body. These tests include imaging tests so we can see where the cancer is and what parts of the body are affected. Tests also include blood tests. We monitor your progress and overall health with these tests. Usually, your schedule for tests depends on the type of treatment you are having. C3. Learn about clinical trials Clinical trials are studies that test different treatments or supports. Patients volunteer to participate in these studies. Since teaching and research is important, we run many different clinical trials each year. For more information about trials or to see which ones are active now in Alberta, visit: www.albertacancerclinicaltrials.ca Manage Your Cancer Care 21C4. Ask questions about your cancer treatment It's important to make sure you have all the information you need. Listen carefully and share any concerns you have with your doctor. Tell the doctor if you do not understand what they are saying and ask them to explain things in a different way. Get the information you need by asking questions. Consider asking the ones on page 54 . Write down your questions before you talk with your doctor. C5. Manage concerns and track symptoms Possible Symptoms and Side Effects Cancer and cancer treatments can cause you to feel unwell. The symptoms or side effects you experience will depend on many things including your general well-being, where your cancer is and what treatments you are on. Side Effects Caused by Treatment Most side effects are specific to the type of treatment you get. Your doctor will talk with you about what side effects your treatment could cause and how you might prevent, reduce or manage them. For more information on side effects and how to manage them, look at our treatment books, or our booklets on certain side effects (such as constipation, or diarrhea). Ask for these at your cancer centre or look online: www.cancercarealberta.ca > Patients and Families > In Treatment > Managing Side Effects General Side Effects There are a few general side effects, such as emotional challenges, intimacy and sexuality , and fatigue that people have no matter what treatment they are having.

My Treatment Worksheet p. 54 If you are having a medical emergency, call 911 right away. 21Manage Your Cancer Care22 Palliative Care Palliative care is an added layer of support for you and your family that can be used before, during or after treatment ends. It is often misunderstood and is sometimes thought of as a negative or scary thing. In fact, palliative care can provide many benefits to both patients and families at any stage of your cancer care. It can be provided along with treatment for the cancer or by itself. Palliative care can help patients and families live life to the fullest. Palliative care: Who provides palliative care? Your current care team can provide some palliative care. There are also specialized palliative care teams (doctors, nurses, social workers and other professionals) who work together with you, your cancer doctor and your family doctor to focus on the issues important to you. This team works with you to make care plans based on your values, preferences and wishes. In some centres this group is called the \"Pain and Symptom Management\" team. Where can I get palliative care? Palliative care is available in the home, community, nursing homes, outpatient clinics and hospitals. If you think palliative care may help you, ask your care team for more information or try these resources: Alberta Health Services \u2014 Palliative Care Health care services for people needing palliative care and their families. Information and links to resources by area are available. 811 www.albertahealthservices.ca/info/ Page14778.aspxLiving My Culture Quality palliative care that helps you honour your culture, spirituality and traditions.

We do this through our conversations with you, and with lab or diagnostic tests. To do this, we use a Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire called the MySymptom Report. It helps us: see how you are doing at the beginning of an appointment monitor how your symptoms are changing over time work with you to address any concerns or side effects You may be asked to complete the MySymptom Report questionnaire for most of your appointments. You can complete this questionnaire online in your MyAHS Connect account up to 3 days before your appointment. If you cannot complete it online, you may get a paper version. MySymptom Report The first section of the MySymptom Report has 15 symptoms that are commonly experienced. Rate these on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being no symptom and 10 being high symptom distress. The table below can help you rate your symptoms from 0-10. None Symptom Rating 0Mild Symptom Rating 1-3Moderate Symptom Rating 4-6High Symptom Rating 7-10 I do not have this symptomI am able to manage this symptom wellI am not able to manage this symptomI am in serious distress or discomfort I can still do daily functions or activities It is hard to do daily functions or activitiesI cannot do daily functions or activities This symptom does not affect my quality of lifeThis symptom affects my quality of lifeThis symptom significantly affects my quality of life It is hard to think about anything else because of this symptomI cannot think about anything else because of this symptom MyPersonal Needs The second section is called MyPersonal Needs . When you are completing the questionnaire online in MyAHS Connect, it may ask you for more information based on your symptom ratings in the first section. Here is an example of what it might look like: In this section, you can check off your concerns, and whether you would like to have a conversation with your care team about a referral to supportive care services. If you and your care team are not able to talk about all of your symptoms or concerns at your appointment, decide on the next steps together. If you feel your care team is not reviewing or discussing your symptoms and concerns with you, please speak with them.See page 31 for information about MyAHS Connect. Manage Your Cancer Care24 We also use this Patient Reported Outcome information across the province to look at group trends and help us make plans to better meet patients' needs. Staying Safe Safety is a part of everything we do in cancer care. There are many things you can do to also help you stay safe. D1. Prevent infections You can be more at risk of getting an infection when you are sick or when you are having certain cancer treatments. There are a few ways that staff, patients and families can reduce spreading infections to others. Cleaning your hands This is also known as hand hygiene . It is the best way to prevent germs from spreading. Use the hand sanitizers regularly, especially on the way into and out of our centres. Washing your hands with soap and water is best before preparing food and eating, and after using the washroom. Immunizations Regular immunizations, like the flu shot, are a part of managing your health. Live vaccinations are not recommended during treatment. Talk to your healthcare team about what immunizations are right for you. Here are the healthcare provider guidelines: www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/info/ hp/cancer/if-hp-cancer-guide-supp002-vaccination.pdf Protecting others if you might have an infection Cancer treatments can weaken your immune system and make it easier for you to get sick while you are on treatment. Tell us if you are sick before your appointment, so we can better protect your health and the health of others. Call the cancer centre if you have an appointment and have any of these symptoms : Fever Sore Throat Any other cold symptoms New Rash Diarrhea Uncontrollable Vomiting New Cough Runny Nose Do you have concerns managing your symptoms? Find resources online: www.ahs.ca/cancertreatment > Managing Side Effects DManage Your Cancer Care 25D2. Communicate what's important Things You Should Know Telephone Messages We want to make sure your messages from us stay private. This is why calls from our clinics and centres will display as only \"Alberta Health Services\" or a \"private caller .\" To make sure you get the messages you need from us, we ask that you: do not subscribe to a service that does not allow unknown or private callers to reach you say your name clearly on your message greeting so that we are sure we are reaching the right person Medical Identification (ID) Cards Some centres will give you a separate Cancer Care ID card. Other cancer centres will ask you to show 2 pieces of ID when you come. We are careful with double-checking who you are because it's important you get the right treatment. When you show us a piece of ID, we will ask to confirm 2 things on the card. For example, we may ask you to spell your last name or tell us your birth date. Cancer Care Contact Numbers It's important to know who to call if you need help. If you are on systemic treatment, your nurse will give you a contact card with a \"Telephone Triage\" number. If you are on radiation treatment, your radiation therapist will give you a business card with a phone number. Other numbers can be found in the \"Getting to Know Your Cancer Centre\" pamphlet or with an online search for specific AHS programs or services (see page 10 ). Things You Should Tell Your Team Pregnancy If you think you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before you start any treatments. Treatments when you're pregnant can affect the unborn baby. Some treatments can affect your ability to have biological children later on \u2014 this is for both men and women . Talk to your doctor about your options are for preserving your fertility before you start treatment. Both men and women should use some form of birth control before and during treatments to prevent pregnancy. Ask your doctor when it would be safe to try to become pregnant after treatment. Medical Devices Let your care team know if you have any medical devices implanted in your body. We need this information to plan your treatments so they will not cause problems with these devices. My Cancer Care Contact List p. 52 Manage Your Cancer Care26 Complementary and Integrative Medicine Tell your doctor or nurse about anything you are taking or using. Some complementary medicine may make your treatment less effective. It can include things like: pills injections vitamins herbal remedies massage acupuncture hyperbaric oxygen treatment cannabis (look for the booklet called Medical Cannabis and Cancer) It's always best to talk to your healthcare team before you start using any complementary and integrative medicine. D3. Understand your medications It's important for you to know and understand all the medications and herbal supplements you are taking. You should know: why you are taking the medicine what it is used for how long you will be taking it. For example, antibiotics may be used for a short amount of time, while you might take a blood pressure medication for a long time. what foods or other medications to avoid while taking it (if any) If you're not sure, it might be time to review the medications you are on. Talk with your healthcare provider or ask a pharmacist to review them with you. It's important for us to make sure your medication list is complete, accurate, and up-to-date. We call this process Medication Reconciliation or MedRec. Making sure you are taking the right medications when you enter our care, move between services, and go home, is a priority for your healthcare team. You are a key member of the team. We need to know everything about your medications and how you take them, to help you be safe. Make sure you have an up-to-date list of all your medications (including any herbal or \"natural\" supplements). Keep your medication list somewhere you can find it to take to appointments or if you need to go to the hospital (on the fridge, in your purse). Review the list regularly to make sure you know what you are taking. Review the list with your healthcare provider at every medical appointment to make sure you are still taking the medications you need.

Plants and Pets Live flowers and plants carry germs that may be harmful to patients. No live flowers or bouquets are allowed in cancer centres. Pets are not allowed in cancer centres because there is a risk that they can bring germs into the centre. Service animals with proper documentation are welcome. Scent Free Environments Many people are sensitive to perfumes, colognes or lotions. Once on treatment, some people have taste and smell changes and may be less tolerant to certain smells. Please help us by not using any scented products such as perfume, body sprays, scented deodorant, or hairspray, on days you are coming to the cancer centre. If you forget, do your best to wash it off. Smoke Free Environments The Cancer Centres, along with all AHS property, is smoke-free. For information on quitting, see page 45 . Manage Your Cancer Care28 D5. Decide on advance care and goals of care Advance care planning is a way to help you think about, talk about, and document your wishes for healthcare. It's a process that can help you make healthcare decisions now and for the future. Goals of Care Designation is a medical order used to tell providers the general aim or focus of care. It is important for us to talk about these things with you when you start treatment and to update it regularly throughout. These two conversations are separate but can be related. While advance care planning conversations don't always result in determining goals of care designation, they make sure your voice is heard when you cannot speak for yourself. A \"Goals of Care\" designation tells healthcare providers what level of care you wish to have. How can I prepare? Talk with family and friends, and consider legally naming someone as your Substitute Decision Maker (the person who will speak for you if you cannot speak for yourself). Make sure you complete the necessary paperwork. Write down your wishes and talk with healthcare providers, and financial or legal professionals.

Numbers listed on page 35 . Covering the Costs of Your Cancer Care Alberta Health Care pays for the costs of treatment in most cases. However, it does not cover medications that you take at home to help with side effects like pain and nausea. These medications can be very expensive, so it's important to have extra coverage. How can I cover these other medications? You can use private health insurance to cover the costs not covered by Alberta Health Care. If you have Alberta Blue Cross or private insurance, call and ask your insurance company: Do I have a yearly maximum for prescriptions? If yes, what is it? What is my co-pay portion? Is my plan a direct bill plan or a reimbursement plan? What level of coverage do I have? For example, is it full or partial coverage? What if I have no drug coverage? You can still apply even with a pre-existing illness. If you have no drug coverage, we encourage you to apply for Alberta Blue Cross Non-Group as soon as possible. It will take about 3 months before Alberta Blue Cross starts covering your medicines. For example, if you apply in March you will not get drug coverage until July 1. A resource social worker may be able to help put supports in place during the waiting period. Numbers listed on page 35 . You can find information and application forms for Alberta Blue Cross Non-Group at: https://www.alberta.ca/non-group-coverage.aspx What if I need more help? If you want help with filling out the paperwork, have more questions about what your plan covers, or need more information, please call the Drug Access Coordinator nearest you (see page 8), or your local Social Worker.

Cancer and cancer treatments may affect taste, smell, appetite and the ability to eat enough food. Good nutrition can help you deal with the effects of cancer and its treatments. Tips for eating well Eat a variety of healthy foods from Canada's Food Guide each day: protein foods vegetables and fruits whole grain foods If your appetite is low, eat small meals and snacks every few hours instead of three large meals. If your appetite is low or you are losing weight, choose foods that are high in calories and protein to help you maintain your weight and strength. For recipes, tips and food ideas, visit: www.ahs.ca/nutrition/Page16043.aspx Eat foods you enjoy and that taste good to you. Drink plenty of fluids. Aim for 8 - 10 cups (2 L - 2.5 L) per day. Treat nausea and vomiting with medications prescribed by your healthcare provider. Talk to your healthcare provider about stool softeners and laxatives to prevent constipation. A dietitian can give you guidance on how to eat well through treatment. If you want more information on what to eat, drink, or both, tell your healthcare team you would like to speak with a dietitian or check to see if any nutrition classes are offered at your cancer centre. www.ahs.ca/cancerclasses For more information: AHS Nutrition Handouts - www.ahs.ca/nutritionhandouts > Cancer Canada's Food Guide - Canada.ca/FoodGuide Manage Your Wellbeing42 Sexual Health Concerns about sexuality are common during treatment.

Taking pain or anti-inflammatory medicationsThese types of medications may hide or \"mask\" your pain. If you cannot feel pain, you may push yourself too far and hurt yourself. If you take these types of medications regularly, be careful not to \"over-do-it\" and take care of any injuries right away. Recent surgeryIf you had surgery recently, talk to your surgeon about physical activity to make sure you are safe to start. You need to make sure your body is ready.

Reduce or Quit Drinking Alcohol Drinking alcohol is not recommended during cancer treatment. It increases your chances of getting certain types of cancers and can be harder on your body when it is also coping with cancer treatments. Consider limiting your alcohol intake. The Canadian Cancer Society recommends no more than 2 drinks per day for men and 1 per day for women. 1 standard drink might be smaller than you realize: Beer - 360 mL (12 fl. oz) of regular beer (5% alcohol) Spirits - 45 mL (1.5 fl. oz) of spirits (40% alcohol) Wine - 150 mL (5 fl. oz) of wine (12% alcohol) Follow these tips from the Canadian Cancer Society to help you reduce your alcohol intake: Plan ahead and set a limit on the amount you will drink. Choose the smallest serving size. Avoid double measures or specials which are often encouraged as \"better value.\" Dilute alcoholic drinks, or choose low-calorie or low-alcohol alternatives. Do not drink alcohol when you are thirsty because you are likely to drink more. Keep at least a few days each week alcohol free. Avoid salty snacks such as potato chips or nuts while drinking alcohol. Salt makes you thirsty and more likely to drink quickly. Drink alcoholic beverages slowly and space out your drinks. Eat before and while you are drinking. Do not use alcohol to cope with stress. Try a walk, a bath, read a book, exercise, or listen to music to help you relax.

Manage Your Wellbeing 47Tips for Patients, Caregivers and Family Cancer often affects the whole family and family members will often be an important part of the care team with you. G1. Communicate with family and friends Sharing Your Diagnosis Find shortcuts to help you update family and friends. You might consider a blog, an email that can be sent to more people at the same time, or asking someone to communicate updates for you. Asking for Help You may need to rely on others for help. This doesn't mean that you need to accept everyone else's advice. Think about what is best for you and your loved one - whether you are the patient or the caregiver. Be prepared to: Ask for help when you need it Be specific in your requests of others (\"could you shovel my driveway this week?\") Be prepared to tell others \"thanks, but no thanks\" for their advice Take time for yourself G2.

Manage your priorities and role changes It can be hard for both patients and family members to adjust to new roles. Changing priorities are normal and part of the cancer experience. When someone has cancer, priorities can change. Family members sometimes take on new roles and responsibilities. For example, children may have to help out more, or a spouse may have to help with groceries or other things. It can be hard to make these changes. How can I adapt to my changing priorities? Take Time Decide what's most important to you and where to focus your energy Give yourself and people close to you time to sort through thoughts and feelings Understand that for a while, some tasks may not be done as well as they were before Talk Share your feelings with others. Be honest and open about how you're feeling Ask for help if you need it. Consider talking with a professional (see page 35 ) Connect Connect with others so you can talk to someone other than family Try an online forum or a support group Take care of yourself It's important to take care of yourself too.
