As no specific treatment is available, greatest emphasis is placed on prevention through immunization. A recently developed Hepatitis B (rDNA) vaccine, containing purified surface antigen of virus like particles derived from culturing genetically engineered Hansenula polymorpha yeast cells having the Hepatitis B surface antigen gene of Hepatitis B virus was evaluated to establish potential safety and tolerability of the Hepatitis B (rDNA) vaccine formulation. Non clinical safety assessment was evaluated as single dose studies in mice and rats and a repeat dose study in rats. No signs of acute toxicity were noted in mice and rats through clinical signs and gross necropsy examination. The local reactions observed in both the species at the injection site were attributed to the property of an adjuvanted vaccine. Similarly, the absence of systemic toxicity was evaluated after repeated administrations in the rat. In repeated dose study, additionally histiocytosis and/or lymphoid hyperplasia at femoral lymph node were observed. The incidences of such local effects were considered as innate immune response generated against the vaccine antigens and enhanced by the adjuvants. The vaccine was shown to be well tolerated without any obvious signs of adverse systemic toxicity, with findings largely attributable to the adjuvant used. The immunogenicity profile showed measurable antibody titer. Therefore, in these non-clinical models, the single and repeated dose administrations of Hepatitis B (rDNA) vaccine were considered as well tolerated up to absolute human dose (1 ml). Toxicological Sciences 2000 Critical Reviews in Toxicology 2014 Vaccine 2009 new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated, consisting of an essential ingredients viz. an herbal root extract ashwagandha and minerals (zinc, magnesium, and selenium). The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of Energy of Consciousness Healing (The Trivedi Effect\u00ae) Treatment on the herbomineral formulation in male Sprague Dawley rats. The test formulation was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control without any Biofield Energy Treatment, while the other part was defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely from seven renowned Biofield Energy Healers. Additionally, one group of animals was also received Biofield Energy Treatment per se (day -15) by Biofield Energy Healers under similar conditions. The immunological parameters viz. humoral immune analysis, paw volume, hematological study, biochemistry, body weight, feed and water intake, and histopathology analysis were performed in this experiment. The humoral immune response data showed the secondary antibody titre was significantly increased by 112.50% and 87.50% in the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation group (G4) and untreated test formulation group (G5) compared to the disease control group (G2). The results of delayed type hypersensitivity showed significant increased the paw volume by 111.76%, 51.45%, 100%, and 64.80% in the G4, G5, Biofield Energy Treatment group per se at day -15 (G6) and Biofield Energy Treated test formulation at day -15 (G7) groups, respectively compared to the G2 group. The platelet count was significantly increased by in the G4, G7 groups, respectively compared to the G2 group. The level of blood urea nitrogen was significantly decreased by 14.01% in the G4 group compared to the disease control. Moreover, the concentration of uric acid was significantly reduced by 28.97% in the G7 group compared to the G2 group. Animal weight parameters suggested that there were no treatment-related changes in any group. Organ to body weight ratio, feed and water intake data described that the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation was found to be safe without any side-effect during the course of the experiment. Overall, results suggested that the Biofield Energy Treated herbomineral formulation and Biofield Energy Treatment per se can be used for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, stress management and prevention, and anti-aging by improving extensively in the world-wide for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of disorders. A new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated consisted of an ashwagandha root extract and minerals (zinc, magnesium, and selenium). The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of the Biofield Energy Treated herbomineral formulation in male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats for immune biomarkers modulation. The test formulation was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control without any Biofield Energy Treatment, while the other part was defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely from twenty renowned Biofield Energy Healers. The experimental parameters studies were humoral immune response (primary and secondary titre), delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, animal weight parameters, feed and water intake, histopathology, hematological and serum biochemistry. The humoral immune response exhibited that both the primary and secondary hemagglutination (HA) antibody titre levels were significantly altered by 14.79% and 12.89%, respectively in the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation group (G4) compared to the disease control group (G2). The delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response was significantly (p0.05) increased by 55.56% in the G4 group compared to the G2 group. The hematological results revealed that the platelet count was significantly increased by 8.46% in the G4 group with respect to the G2 group. Moreover, the level of phosphorus was significantly increased by 11.16% and 16.35% in the levamisole (G3) and G4 groups, respectively compared to the G2 group. In conclusion, the Biofield Energy Treated Test Formulation would be the powerful immunomodulatory product, which was found safe at the tested doses. Therefore, The Trivedi Effect\u00ae-Biofield Energy Healing based herbomineral formulation can be applied to potentiate the immune system that helps to fight against many infectious diseases. Overall, these data suggest that the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation can be used for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, stress management and prevention, and anti-aging by improving overall health. researchgate.net IJMRHS VOl 3 Issue 1 Vediyuppu cheyaneer has been widely used in Siddha system of medicine for various diseases. The liquid form of Vediyuppu cheyaneer showed a significant inhibitory effect when screened at 500 mg/kg, for the invivo antiurolithiasis activity on ethylene glycol induced hyperoxaluria rats. The standard frusemide (20 mg/kg) and cystone (750 mg /kg) were used as comparison for diuretic and antiurolithiatic activity respectively. Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
