Jenny Colgan's new Christmas novel, CHRISTMAS AT THE ISLAND HOTEL, is out now. ____________________ Christmas on the remote Scottish island of Mure is bleak, stark - and incredibly beautiful. 'An evocative, sweet treat' Jojo Moyes 'Gorgeous, glorious, uplifting' kind of book' Mike Gayle It's a time for hunkering down, getting cosy in front of whisky barrel wood fires, and enjoying a dram with the people you love - unless, of course, you're accidentally pregnant to your ex-boss, and don't know how to tell him. In what should be the season of peace and goodwill on earth, will Joel think Flora is a bearer of glad tidings? Meanwhile Saif, the doctor and refugee from war-torn Syria is trying to enjoy his first western Christmas with his sons - but without his missing wife. Can the little family possibly find comfort and joy? Travel to the beautiful northern edge of the world and join the welcoming community of Mure for an unforgettable Christmas. ____________________ Why readers ADORE Jenny Colgan 'Jenny Colgan has a way of writing that makes me melt inside' 'Her books are so good I want to start over as soon as I have finished' 'There's something so engaging about her characters and plots' 'Her books are like a big, warm blanket' 'Her stories are just so fabulous' 'She brings her settings and characters so vividly to life' 'The woman is just magic' An Island Christmas Fall in love with the ultimate festive read from bestseller Jenny Colgan - SKU: - 9780751572070 - UPC: - 9780751572070 - Authors: - Colgan, Jenny - Year Published: - 2019 - Country of Publication: - United Kingdom - Format: - Paperback - EAN: - 9780751572070 - ISBN: - 9780751572070 - Number of - 368 - Publication Date: - 2019-10-31T00:00:00+00:00 - Publisher: - Little, Brown Book Group - Series: - Mure - Title: - An Island Christmas - Restricted: - USA,CAN - Star Rating: - 5 - Bookdata Readership Text: - General (US: Trade) - Subtitle: - Fall in love with the ultimate festive read from bestseller Jenny Colgan - product_collection: - false - Search Keywords: - books about christmas, christmas romance, military, marriage, romance, relationships, emotional rollercoaster reads, heartwarming reads, romance books, parents, Christmas, festive books, contemporary fiction, heart warming, christmas novels, books fo - Place of Publication: - London - Supplier Name: - Gardners Books 'Nobody does get-away-from-it-all romance like Jenny Colgan' Sunday Express Show more - Authors: - [Colgan, Jenny](/authors/?filter.custom_authors=Colgan%2C%20Jenny) - Year Published: - 2019 - Country of Publication: - United Kingdom - Format: - Paperback - ISBN: - 9780751572070 - Number of Pages: - 368 - Publication Date: - 31/10/2019 - Publisher: - [Little, Brown Book Group](/publisher/?filter.custom_publisher=Little%2C%20Brown%20Book%20Group) - Series: - [Mure](/series/?filter.custom_series=Mure) - Place of Publication: - London - SKU: - 9780751572070 Show more [ Write a Review ](https://guardianbookshop.com/an-island-christmas-9780751572070) Write a Review An Island Christmas 9780751572070 Paperback Write a Review An Island Christmas 9780751572070 Paperback There are no reviews for this product yet - [ be the "}
