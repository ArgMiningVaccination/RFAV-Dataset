Home Education Medical Education HEAL-IM Admissions Core Curriculum Financial Support Additional Opportunities Our Team What is Integrative Medicine? Integrative medicine can be defined as a healing-oriented practice of medicine that: Reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient Focuses on the whole person (body, mind and spirit) Is informed by evidence Makes use of all appropriate therapeutic and lifestyle approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing Underlying the spirit of integrative medicine is the commitment to involve the patient as an active partner in his or her care, with a focus on teaching self-care and self-management tools, as well as supporting healthy lifestyle behaviors that are the basis for optimal health and wellness. Integrative medicine also highlights the need for health equity and for ensuring access to much-needed prevention and wellness resources in underserved communities. Fundamentally, integrative medicine recognizes that health systems need to move beyond just the diagnosis and treatment of disease complications (pathogenesis) to fully embrace health creation, or salutogenesis. We believe the combination of evidence-based integrative care, together with advanced conventional treatment options, form the basis for providing our patients with the most effective, compassionate, whole person medical care for the 21st century. Learn More About HEAL-IM HEAL-IM is a complete mission fit for me, the clear next step on my path to becoming an Integrative Medicine practitioner and leader in the lifestyle medicine movement. The program offers training in many of the complementary modalities that initially drew me to medicine, modalities that I studied on my own at my own expense for many years.... HEAL-IM will enable me to start becoming the kind of holistic physician I want to be straight out the gates of medical school, not ten years down the line in fellowship.\" -Anna Rasmussen, Class of 2023 Who is Part of HEAL-IM?

Some have firsthand experience with integrative approaches to health conditions, a few have professional experience in integrative health, while others have navigated conventional and alternative medical systems on behalf of friends and family.
