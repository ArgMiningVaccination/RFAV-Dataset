The summer of that year was unusually dry and hot. The water levels of streams and wells were dangerously reduced, providing an excellent breeding ground for insects. By dangerously reduced, providing an excellent breeding ground for insects. By July the city's inhabitants were rema rking on the extraordinary number of flies and mosquitoes that swarmed around the dock area. That same month, a trickle of refugees escaping political turmoil in the Caribbean Islands became a torrent of thousands as ship after ship unloaded its human cargo on a torrent of thousands as ship after ship unloaded its human cargo on Philadelphia's docks. Unbeknownst to the city's inhabitants, all the necessary ingredients for an unprecedented health disaster were now in place.

The first fatalities appeared in July and the numbers grew steadily. Victims initially experienced pains in the head, back and limbs accompanied by a high fever. These symptoms would often disappear, leaving a false sense of security Shortly the disease would announce its return with an even more of security .

Developed in 1936 by Theiler & Smith by attenuating in the wild-type Asibi strain in mouse and chick tissue. After SQ inoculation neutralizing antibodies After SQ inoculation , neutralizing antibodies appear by Day 10, and immunity is probably lifelong, although revaccination is recommended every 10 years. 2424Yellow Fever Vaccine Adverse Reactions Adverse Reactions Anaphylactic reactions 1/58,000 Multisystem and neurologic adverse events was Multisystem and neurologic adverse events was 2.42/100,000 doses (total # doses 1, 440,000). 6 fatal cases of fatal rxns re ported to date p -Encephalitis in a child in the US -3 cases of multisystem failure in elderly persons in the US 2 i il i hild d d l i B il -2 similar cases in a c hild and a young a dult in Brazil The Brazilian cases had a clinicopathological picture bli ild tY F d d d i i i 2525resem bling w ild-type YF and occurre d during a campa ign in which 34 million doses were givenYellow Fever Vaccine Adverse Reactions Most AEs appear to be due to an abnormal response of the individual Most AEs appear to be due to an abnormal response of the individual host rather than to mutation in the vaccine virus. Mild, transient subclinical elevations in serum transaminases occur in 3 5% of vaccinees in the recent Monath study 3.5% of vaccinees in the recent Monath study . Recent analysis of VAERS database in the US found the incidence of severe (but not mild) AEs to be significantly higher in elderly com pared with younger individuals.
