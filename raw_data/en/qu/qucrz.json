Suddenly the age-old herbal medicine seems to have turned hep with renewed interest in the West. Currently, senior health ministry officials are in Germany holding talks for setting up an Ayurveda institute at Dortmund, in the north-west of that country. Earlier this year, experts from India demonstrated the application and efficacy of Ayurveda at the WHO annual session in Geneva. Health minister Sushma Swaraj argued at the WHO meeting that given its long and rich tradition, Ayurveda could not be put on par with similar medicine systems in other countries. Later, the health ministers of the South-East Asian Region countries assembled here and decided to open a coordination centre for the alternative system of medicine in Delhi. The American experts, according to sources, will be here for research in collaboration with their Indian counterparts. An Ayurveda college will soon be opened in Moscow as part of an agreement between India and Russia. Both Georgia and Armenia have agreed to set up Ayurveda institutions as a first step to adopt the traditional Indian system of medicine. In Hungary, it has already earned recognition. The new response and recognition from the world have prompted India to set an ambitious export target of Rs 5,000 crore for the next two years. Though the target marks a quantum jump over the recent export figures, it pales into insignificance compared with the current level of China''s exports estimated by experts here at Rs 20,000 crore. However, Ayurveda practitioners point out that unless the authorities provide the proper infrastructure and facilities, an opportunity could be missed. The quality of research at the government-run Central Council of Research in Ayurveda and Siddha, they claim, is less than satisfactory. ``The pace of work at the Council is slow and the research there should be based on the principles of Ayurveda,'''' says Devendra Triguna, a member of the Council''s governing body. Though the Centre has acquired land for a national Ayurvedic hospital in the Capital, it is still in a dilemma whether to give it to the private sector or run it like another government hospital. Swaraj has reportedly favoured retaining the hospital in the government sector. "}
