Magnetic love. Magnetic . It's got a more sexy and romantic ring than its dry, clinical-sounding counterparts\u2014 serodiscordant and serodivergent . Discord, the opposite of harmony, has a neg- ative connotation, and divergent means to extend in differ-ent directions, to differ. Magnetic suggests attraction,chemistry, sparks. In the case of magnetic couples, the romantic clich\u00e9 \"opposites attract\" is literally true. However, many partnersin mixed-status relationships find that they connect not dueto their hivstatus but rather in spite of it. Speaking with the four magnetic couples I had the privilege of interview-ing for the cover story reminded me of another clich\u00e9:\"Love conquers all\"\u2014even in the face of hiv. Without a doubt, magnetic better reflects these four couples. Thanks to all of them for sharing with us the ups and downs ofmagnetic relationships and for spreading the love. Espe-cially to Sue, one of the women interviewed, for bringingthe phrase magnetic love to our attention.

Most of these do not mean you have a seriousmedical condition. Sometimes, how-ever, they could indicate an acute and possibly life-threatening medicalemergency. Get in touch with yourdoctor immediately if you experienceany of the symptoms listed below: \"I can't keep any food or liquid down.\" This could lead to your body not getting enough water\u2014dehydration. Vomiting is a com- mon cause of dehydration, but if youcan't eat for other reasons (such aspainful swallowing or severe nausea),you might need treatment with intra-venous ( iv) fluids. \"My stomach hurts so much.\" When abdominal pain is beyondthe point where you can tolerate itand/or is getting worse, it must be dealt with. If you're on ddI (Videx),ddC (Hivid) or d 4T (Zerit), severe pain in the middle of the abdomen couldsignify pancreatitis (a life-threateninginflammation of the pancreas gland)or lactic acidosis (a condition wherehigh of theblood). \"I can't breathe normally/prop- erly.\" If you can't breathe well, you need medical attention\u2014nomatter what's causing it. There are serious hiv-related conditions,such could be of abnor-mal breathing or shortness of breath(dyspnea). \"My chest is killing me.\" If you have chest pain, afeeling of tightness andshortness of breath that lasts more than a few minutes, youshould see your doctor immediately orgo to the emergency room. These canbe signs of a heart attack. \"My vision is going blurry.\" Especially if your cd4cells are low (less than 50), this could be the beginning of cytomegalovirus ( cmv) retinitis. cmvis a serious eye infection that can cause blindness if nottreated. An ophthalmologist (eye doc-tor) should examine you as soon aspossible. \"I feel like killing my- self.\" Depression and sui- cidal tendencies can in-crease in hiv positive people. This may be even more likelyfor people taking certain medications,such as interferon (for the treatment ofhepatitis C) or the non-nuke efavirenz(Sustiva), because these drugs canhave psychological side effects. De-pression can be treated!

[For more info on depression,see \"Lady Sings the Blues,\" The Posi- tive Side, spring 2003 .] \"This is the worst headache of my life.\" Most severe head- aches in hiv positive people have nothing to do with the hiv. Still, if this headache is worse than any you've had before, call yourdoctor. \"I am passing blood in my stool (or vomit).\" A small fleck of blood is not necessarily anemergency. This can happen with a condition such as hemorrhoids.But if you go to the toilet and whatcomes out looks like actual blood, callyour doctor. \"My mouth is on fire.\" If you've had a rash, especially whenstarting a new medication(such as Bactrim), and then develop fever and nausea and noticethat the lining of your mouth (mucousmembranes) is becoming inflamed andseems to peel off, it could be serious.This condition, known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( sjs), is a major allergic reaction to medications.Although it's rare, if you don't treat it,it could be fatal.

I hadwhiplash and stress on my joints andmuscles. After a year, we saw someprogress in pain relief but I was stillwalking with a cane, so we starteddoing acupuncture as well. Most of the needles are done on my back. I lie on the table for 15-20 min- utes and more often than not I fallasleep. Then Vince does the chiroprac-tic side of the treatment and I'm outthe door. When I started acupuncture, I was also suffering from neuropathy\u2014frommy hips to toes. It felt like shards ofglass being ground into my flesh.Every step and movement hurt. Vince said: \"This isn't car accident pain, this is hivpain. I can work on that, so let's go for it.\" I went twice a week. Within a month I started feeling benefits. I stopped taking gabapentin for the neuro- pathy. The pain stopped and the acupuncture keeps it from returning. I have more energy for about four to five days after eachsession. Vince recently asked about my liver function. It's not good. I have a fattyliver and early stages of cirrhosis, sonow he's working on that organ, usingtrigger points related to liver function.I'm a firm believer in mixing East andWest. What can it hurt? One needle in10hurts, but other than that I ab- solutely love it. It's the best money I'vespent for myself. Acupuncture is an ancient Chineseform of bodywork that uses specialneedles to stimulate energy pointsto help the body heal itself.

REBEKKA VALIAN , Viral load: undetectable cd4 count: 640 Vancouver, British Columbia I've been doing yoga since I was 8 years old. I taught myself from a book.When I was diagnosed, being on theyogic path played an important rolebecause I wasn't petrified of death. Ithought: \"I can control my health, Ican stay healthy, I can not get psychedout by this diagnosis.\" In 1998 , I was hospitalized. I had only 10T cells left and I was diag- nosed with mac. I had to quit work and was bedridden for four months. Irealized I was going to die if I didn'ttry antiretrovirals. It was a combina-tion of the meds and yoga that broughtme back to life. I went to Quebec to bepart of a study on how yogic breathingimpacts hiv. It worked for me. I was in a lot of pain and as soon as I did yoga,the pain disappeared. I got pretty de-pressed around that time and tried anantidepressant, but it didn't work.Yoga brought me out of it. Getting back to the yoga really built up my T cells\u2014I'm at 640now. A lot of that is the drug cocktail, but it's alsothe complementary therapies\u2014aroma-therapy, massage, meditation andespecially yoga. Yoga keeps the muscles strong and the ligaments juiced up. It seems tokeep everything healthy and flexibleand out of the pain zone. I feel strongbecause of my practice. There's thewhole mind-body-spirit connec-tion. A healthy mind keeps theimmune system healthy. Andeveryone can afford yoga because once you know the poses you can do itin your own home. Just tune in to therhythm of your breath and let it guideyou through the stretches. Yoga, a form of mind/body exer-cise from ancient India, involvesbreathing, meditation and pos-tures. , Community Viral load: 1,500 cd4 count: 700 Mississauga, Ontario In 1995 I tried medical marijuana . It helped relieve my hiv-related nausea and vomiting. When I started medsthe next year, I tried it again and it wasreally helpful. I didn't use it regularlybecause I didn't have a medical licenseor regular access to it. So I tried over-the-counter and prescription meds,which made me pass out. I was so ex-hausted I couldn't do anything. In 2001 , they changed the medical marijuana legislation. It became a lit-tle easier to get a license. I needed totry something else for the nausea, so Igot one. I've been using medical mari-juana since then and it's helped meconsiderably. I get better pain relief formy neuropathy from marijuana than Idid from amitriptyline. It's made iteasier for me to get on with my dayand has helped me stay on haart . But it's expensive and there's no way to recoup the expense. It's difficultwith kids in the house\u2014you have hide and sneak around. And it's not really socially acceptable. Some days I feel so sick that I can't smoke, so I take a Gravol and go to bed. 6 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2004CHATTY CATIE What's Your Complementary Therapy? Interviews by Diane Peters REBEKKA VALIAN\"A healthy mind keeps the immune system healthy. \"\"I have more energy. \" Plus, I have asthma and there are days when I just can't get a breath. With medical marijuana, you have control over your dose. I can give my-self just enough to do what it needs todo so I'm not passed out all the time.Sometimes I need more, sometimesless; sometimes one puff is enough,sometimes I smoke two joints in a row.At first I get a buzz, and after a fewminutes, the buzz goes away but thebeneficial effects stay.

TOM HAMMOND , 39 Support services coordinator at the aids Committee of Guelph and Wellington CountyDiagnosed with hiv: 1992 Viral load: count: 210 Guelph, Ontario November a coworker who was training in cranial sacral therapy wanted to practice on people, so I de-cided to give it a shot. I'd never heardof it before, but I'll try anything. She starts with a guided medita- tion to help me clear my thoughts andget my breathing on track. Then sheputs her hands on my sacrum (justabove the butt) and moves them upmy body, touching lightly. You don'teven really feel it. After 10minutes, I fall asleep. When I started, the first thing I no- ticed was that it reduced my stresslevel. For a week after the treatmentI'm very focused instead of beingspaced out from my meds. I have in-creased energy. I can think clearly andsleep better. Before that I had insom-nia, probably from my meds and stress, but now I sleep right throughthe night. I also have gastrointestinalproblems from my meds, and the ther-apy soothes my stomach. When the session starts and I do my breathing, I pay attention to mywhole body and visualize the virus inmy system and how my body couldmake the medication work better.Before I started this therapy, my cd4 count was 168, and it had been there for several years. But after four ses-sions it went up to 210. It could be a coincidence, but I don't think so. It'snot a big jump but to see any change atall was \"wow!\" I'm still going, once a week for four weeks, and then I take a break. It'smore affordable this way. I've donelots of other kinds of therapies, butthis really gives me the best bang formy buck. Cranial sacral therapy is a form of massage that focuses on thehead and spine to release tensionand energy blocks. MARTIN MAILLOUX , 45 Volunteer Taoist Tai instructorDiagnosed with hiv: 1994 Viral load: undetectable cd4 count: 760 Montreal, Quebec In 1995 , one year after my hivdiagno- sis, I got meningitis. My immune sys-tem was almost destroyed; I had 18 T cells. Back then meningitis was con-sidered terminal for people with hiv, but there was a new treatment proto-col and I was one of the first patientsto be saved. Then I had to live again. I had to learn how to walk again. The recoveryperiod was about two years. In Octo-ber 1998 , I went to a Taoist Tai Chi class for people with hivorganized by Maison Plein Coeur. Despite being soweak, I enjoyed it and kept going be-cause I realized how powerful it wasfor me.Tai Chi has really improved my cir- culation, balance and coordination.It's helped reduce the side effects ofthe meds and some hivsymptoms. After each class I felt very hungry andstarted to gain weight. My headacheswent away. Tai Chi stretched out mymuscles, which were stiff from meds.It helps reduce lipodystrophy by grad-ually rebuilding my legs and bum. Tai Chi also relaxes me\u2014I've stopped worrying all the time. I trustmy body more now. Because I almostdied, it was something to trust mybody again. I have strength now and Ifeel it. At first I was the worst student, but the instructor was very patient. I hadother people with hivaround me who were doing their best to improve theirhealth. It was really motivating. Aftera while I realized: \"I'm not bad at this.I feel really good.\" One day my instructor asked me to teach. \"What are you talking about?I'm a sick person.\" She said that'swhat they were looking for. I becamean assistant in 1999 and a volunteer instructor in 2001 . I now help other instructors in two hivclasses. Generally, when you have a disease like hiv, you're overly concerned with yourself. Tai Chi helps: You have tolook at others to adjust your move-ments and you feel it as a group. Youbecome \"one\" for a little while. That'sthe magical part. Slowly, you get lessworried, improve your strength andenjoy just being with others. Tai Chi is an ancient style of mind/body exercise made up of a seriesof slow, therapeutic movements.For more info: Taoist Tai Chi Soci-ety (www.taoist.org) or MartinMailloux (see Resources page).

We met fighting oppression. Ryan used to take me to lunch fromtime to time. On June 29, 2003 , he asked me out and I needed to stop bymy place first. When we got there, itjust happened. We were sitting to-gether, we drew to a kiss andtouched. When we went for lunchthat day it was different\u2014it was adate. Did you know that Minneh had hiv? ryan : I'd known since I first met her. minneh : I was involved in hivand open about my status. ryan : At first I was concerned. I didn't really know about hivor if a relation- ship was even possible. But once Min-neh educated me I wasn't so worried.We take reasonable precautions. What kind of role does hivplay in your relationship, if at all? minneh : Not a very big part, but we're reminded of it all the time. Ryan'svery good at helping me take mymeds, reminding me or even gettingthem for me. It's hard to say that hiv isn't completely in our lives, becauseit's really right there, but it doesn'taffect us that much. ryan : hivis a very, very small part of this relationship. Are there any issues that have arisen from being in a mixed-statusrelationship? minneh : It's a good thing I've always been outspoken, because when wevisited Ryan's family, they'd alreadyWhen positive and negative attract, HIV often takes a backseat to that crazy little thing called love.Four couples tell all about negotiating the serodivergent terrain.

I just got a temporary res-ident permit, so I can stay in Canadafor three years. Then I need to renewit and apply again for permanentresidence. If I didn't have hiv, I'd already be in the country, whichwould make mine and Ryan's situa-tion quite easy. It's very frustrating. Are there any rewards from being in a serodivergent relationship? ryan : It's inspired us to start san-fan Educational Group, which stands for\"See A Need, Fill A Need.\" I organizepresentations at schools, churchesand other public areas, and Minneheducates people about hiv. She talks about prevention and technical infor-mation about hiv, and also about what it's like to live with hivand how it affects your self-worth. What contributes to the success of your relationship? minneh : The best thing that ever hap- pened to me was finding Ryan. Beingspiritual has really helped us.

How do you deal with the fear of hiv transmission? minneh : We use condoms faithfully. Has hivaffected your sex life or intimacy? ryan : I don't think so. minneh : No. Putting on a condom has become part of having sex. How do you deal with the grey areas when it comes to transmission? ryan : Because Minneh has such a low viral load, I don't worry about oralsex. We just go ahead, really. Are there other kinds of fears you deal with in a mixed-status relationship? minneh : They have to do with the medications I take for my bipolarcondition. In order to get pregnant,I'd have to stop those meds and Idon't know if I'd be emotionally sta-ble enough to be able to carry a preg-nancy. That's something we thinkabout. I'd love to have another child.But we'd like to get married first. ryan : We're getting married on May 21, 2005 . minneh : We don't know if my immi- gration will be settled by then, butwe just go on with life. There's hiv,there's Minneh, and there's immigra- tion\u2014in no particular order. I mustcarry on, moment by moment, other-wise it would be such a waste of timejust sitting around worrying about it. Ryan, how involved are you when it comes to Minneh's treatment? ryan : I'm pretty much there every step of the way. I go with her to thedoctor. I don't actually suffer the sideeffects with her or anything like that,but I'm fairly involved. minneh : I feel very well supported. I remember walking to the lab by my-self, going to the doctor's office andgetting all confused. Now Ryan goeswith me, and we talk about it laterand I understand more what the doc-tor was saying. He's a great friend aswell as a good lover. Are your families and friends supportive of your relationship? minneh : Very much. We're very fortu- nate that way. Advice for other magnetic couples: ryan : Educate yourselves and be very communicative. minneh : Before hivis the person themselves. That's how you shouldapproach your relationship\u2014ashuman beings. Then hivand other issues come in later. Remember thatyou are people first and foremost.

I was really intrigued with Brian. He washere on business for two weeks andeach night we'd have dinner, then goback to his hotel room and watch tv. We didn't have sex for two weeksafter we met. brian: We went on a date for two weeks. neal : It was total dating.

How did you disclose your hivstatus to Neal? brian: I disclosed to Neal online, so he knew from the minute we met. I always disclose because it's a trust issue right up-front for me.

I don't knowwhen, so now's the time to say youdon't want to do that part.\" I can han-dle rejection up-front, but I don't wantto be with somebody who leaves mewhen I'm sick.

Financial trouble is one thing,relationship stuff is one thing, but ifyou're sick that's another thing. neal : I couldn't believe Brian was put- ting this to me, but I'm glad he did. Ithought: \"Just because he's hivposi- tive doesn't mean I can't love thisman. Does he not deserve to beloved? And why can't I be loved byhim? I don't care if he gets sick. We'lldeal with that when the time comes.\"I don't know if I verbalized that tohim, but I know I did say \"shut up.\" What kind of role does hivplay in your relationship? brian: hiv helps me not waste a lot of time, which is probably why wemoved so fast in living together. If Iwasn't positive, I might have takenmore time. neal : hivplays a bigger role for Brian. For me, it's a very minute aspect inour lives. But, for instance, if Brian'shaving a tired day, we have a slower,more relaxed day than one that's go-go-go. It's not a big deal, it's just about balance. Are there any issues that have arisen from being in a mixed-status couple? brian: I've been fully disclosed and very public about my hivstatus, so it's not an issue for me. But I worryabout Neal because it's difficult whenI'm with his family. I'm not sure whoknows. I have to let him tell people athis own pace. neal : I'm very protective of me, in terms of how I'm bombarded withquestions from my family. Comingfrom an ethnic family, just being gaywas a huge thing. When I came outto them, their biggest fear was:\"You're going to get hivand die.\" I could only do one hurdle at a time. Iwasn't capable or willing to jump theother hurdle. I guess I got compla-cent. Certain family members knowabout Brian's hivand others don't need to know. Brian's part of thefamily, he's accepted as my otherhalf\u2014my better half, maybe. Are there any rewards from being in a serodivergent relationship? brian: You're a bit more grown up about a relationship. neal : It exposes me to a lot more than I would have known on my own.That's definitely a plus. Because ofthat, I've become a board memberwith a local aids organization, where I can help promote awareness. What contributes to the success of your relationship? brian: Being honest. For me, disclo- sure was honesty right up-front, andthat sets the pattern for a relation-ship. Also, the idea that we're not init for the short term\u2014if there's anissue, we try to talk and work ourway through it. I think we're slightlysuccessful in that, but I won't saywe're 100% . neal : We respect each other's lives and there's an open flow of commu-nication that's always there. So,we've got communication, respectand honesty. 10 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2004 \"THE CONCEPT OF NOT HAVING PHOTOGRAPHS: RONNILYN PUSTILbrian: I have a lot of respect for Neal. There are a lot of people who wouldrun scared in the other direction forthe smallest of reasons, and this isone big reason. I've had rejectionaround my hivstatus. An hivnega- tive person who runs in the otherdirection is probably doing you afavour because they're going to runeventually anyways. How do you deal with the fear of hiv transmission? brian : I know that condoms work when you use them consistently andcorrectly, so that's just become a partof life. The concept of not practicingsafer sex was never an option, it'snot even a discussion that everhappens. I don't have a hugefear in terms of hivtransmis- sion, but I'm the positiveperson. I fear being ex-posed to other stds, so honesty is re-ally importantbecause other stds could be a big threat tome. neal : I grew up in the era of safe sex. Thesafe-sex campaign wasfull-blown when I was at themost impressionable age, be-coming aware of my sexual identityand freedoms. I've never had sexwithout a condom. It's a naturalcourse of life and I'm very comfort-able with it. I've never had an stdor anything to worry about, so for meit's not a concern. Are there other fears that you deal with in your relationship? brian: Every time I come back from the doctor, if there are any changesin my health I discuss it with Neal.My counts have been the same forabout seven years, but I make surehe knows everything's fine. neal : I have the normal fears anyone else has: What does tomorrow hold?Will I have a job? Is Brian going toget hit by a bus if he doesn't watchwhen he's crossing the street? I don't know if my fears are all hiv-related. Is the fear of Brian getting hit by a bus is equal to the fear of Brian gettingsick? neal : Yes. brian : hivis probably more persistent and on your mind though, because Itake pills twice a day, so there's aconstant reminder. I think the otherway it fits into that is the long-termplanning. We're slowly starting totalk about longer-term things, likebuying a place. I never would havedone that at one time because having hivlimits your view into the future. Planning a holiday next year isn't one of my strengths. Neal likes to plan longer term, so it's a good balance. I don't let him go be- yond a year and he tries to get me up to a year. Has hivaffected your sex life or intimacy? brian: I don't think so. neal : Because I knew from Day One that Brian was hivpos- itive, it hasn't hindered our sex life in any way. Not sleeping with him in the begin- ning wasn't because he had hiv. It was because I thought I liked himand I wanted to see if it would work,if there was any substance there.And there was. How do you achieve intimacy while protecting yourself from hiv? neal : F\u2014ing isn't everything there is to sex. We achieve intimacy on somany different levels\u2014cuddling,holding hands while we walk downthe street, the special gaze we havein each other's eyes. brian: We have date night once a week, no matter how busy we are,when we go to dinner and spend timedebriefing. It's going to the moviesand all the other things you do to-gether that make your relationship.Sex is just one piece of intimacy. There's so much more. What about the grey areas when it comes to transmission? neal : I'm going to get a little graphic here: When it comes to oral sex, wetake pleasure in it and we enjoy re-ceiving and giving it. In terms oftransmitting fluids, we're a lot morecautious and aware of our actions,and we let each other know what'sgoing to happen next. brian: After many years of being posi- tive, talking to other people, doingprevention workshops and knowingthe guidelines, I know that the greyareas are just that. Sometimes youlive your life in the grey areas. Cross-ing the street between lights is a greyarea for getting hit by a car, but itdoesn't stop you from doing it. So,looking at oral sex, knowing the factsand being aware of the precautionsyou can take is common sense. It'sno longer a grey area anymore. Youjust do it and you know. It's lack ofknowledge that creates grey areas. Neal, how involved are you when it comes to Brian's treatment? neal : Not in the least. Brian's so self- sufficient and organized that I don'tsee a need to step in at this point.When there is, I'll be ready to. Have your families and friends been supportive of your relationship? neal : One hundred percent. brian: Yeah, me too. neal : If they could, I think my family would trade me in for Brian. Advice for other magentic couples: neal : Be yourself. Don't be self- conscious. Life is too short. Youjust need to live it. brian: hiv is just one aspect of life. It doesn't make a person a differ-ent person; it's just a part of whoyou are. As long as nobody's tryingto infect someone else and there'sno power imbalance, enjoy and beyourself. 11 Fall/Winter 2004 THE POSITIVE SIDE SAFER SEX WAS NEVER AN OPTION. IT'S NOT EVEN A DISCUSSION THAT EVER HAPPENS.\"GARY , 48, hivpositive for 3 years EngineerDAVID , 32, hivnegative Medical writerTogether for 10 yearsMontreal, Quebec When Gary met David: gary : We met 10years ago at a com- ing-out group at McGill University. When you were diagnosed, how did you deal with it together? gary : I was first diagnosed in London, England, in December 2001 . I'd gone to see a doctor about an std, and they performed an hivtest as part of the lab tests. I'd tested negative inSeptember 2001 , so I thought it would be ok. I got the result a couple weeks later\u2014the antibodies hadcome back positive. I was in totaldenial. I was traveling, David was inMontreal, and I wasn't able to tellhim over the phone. We met up inEurope a couple weeks later and Itold him. The hivtest was repeated in January 2002 in Montreal with the same result. David, what was your reaction? david : I was numb. My immediate re- action was to reach out to the man Iloved who was having such a hardtime telling me. When we returnedhome, I tried to make life as normalas possible. But a few months later, Icouldn't deny it any longer\u2014I neededsome help. I went to a counsellor. gary : I was also in therapy to deal with the hivand some childhood is- sues. I went for a year and then wedecided to see a couple's counsellor.Now we have our couple's counsellorand I'm in a support group withother positive men at accm [aids Community Care Montreal]. To what extent does hivfactor into your relationship? david : Most importantly, it's impacted our life as a couple\u2014emotionally, so-cially, sexually. gary : It has impacted all aspects.Was your relationship pre- hivvery different from your relationship now? gary : Yes. Definitely. What are the main issues you've had to deal with as a mixed-status couple? david : On a daily level, there is living with not being 100% well and having to be flexible around that. If Gary'snot feeling up to doing something,we both get frustrated. As well, dis-closure is an issue for us. gary : More recently sex has become an issue. Our sex is totally differentnow. How do you deal with the sex issue? gary : Mostly by not having sex. A cou- ple of weeks ago I decided I didn'twant to have sex because I don'twant my partner, who I love, to be-come infected. david : I know Gary will do absolutely everything in his power to protect mefrom becoming infected. I can feel nosafer than that. When it comes to oursex life, hivhas done some really great things and some terriblethings. Over the last two years oursex life has fluctuated. There havebeen times when we feel close sexu-ally. There was a period when thesex was very good, more intimate and emotional than ever. Recently, we've come to realize how scared we are of having sex witheach other because of the hiv. I'm dreadfully afraid of becoming in-fected. And now that it's at the sur-face, we have to deal with it. Our sexlife for the last six months has beennon-existent. It hurts, disappointsand frustrates me, but I believe thatby working through the issue we'llcome back together. We'll get the fearout, get over it and get to a placewhere we're comfortable playingagain. That's happening now, but ittakes a lot more communication.Though it happens less frequently,we have good sex. gary : I hope that with lots of commu- nication and support we'll get closeragain and I'll be more comfortablehaving sex without always beingafraid of infecting David. How do you achieve intimacy while protecting each other from hiv? david : We've always had a creative sex life, so it's easy to keep exploringareas that are safe in terms of hiv transmission. There hasn't been abig shift away from high-risk to low- 12 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2004 \"HIVHAS IMPACTED OUR LIFE AS A COUPLE\u2014EMOTIONALLY , PHOTOGRAPHS: PAUL LITHERLANDrisk behaviours. As for emotional in- timacy, that comes from us pluckingup the courage to be frank and hon-est with each other. That is bringingme much closer to Gary. gary : Right now, sex is important but not as important as bringing us to-gether emotionally. Are there any rewards from being in a serodivergent relationship? gary : It's made me enjoy life more, at least try to, even though sometimesit's hard because the hivis always in the background. It pops up andsometimes puts you down. I'm tryingto see the positive side of life. david : It's really made me appreciate having Gary around. You can eitherbemoan the fact that you're notgoing to be around forever or youcan do the best you can with everyday you have. And we try that everyday. We're not always successful, butwe try. What other fears do you deal with in a mixed-status relationship? david : The day my man's not going to be here. Because Gary has beenfairly healthy up until now, hivas an illness rarely affects us. He's been inthe hospital a couple of times, andthat's when it really hits me that thisis a disease. How involved are you when it comes to Gary's treatment? david : I get involved when Gary asks me to. Gary looks to me as a resourcefor information because with mybackground I can look at primary re-search or treatment guidelines andhelp him interpret them. Idon't get involved inGary's treatment deci-sions\u2014it's betweenhim and his physi-cian. give moreemotional But alsohave my own is-sues with it, sothere are timeswhen I consciously or unconsciously ignore Gary's trips to the doctor. I justdon't want to deal with it. gary : David was there to support me for the first couple of trips to the doc-tor, but he was never involved in thetreatment decisions. Neither was I inthe beginning\u2014I agreed to whateverthe doctor decided. When I startedthinking seriously about taking treat-ment for my hepatitis C, I becamemore involved by reading up aboutthe side effects. And now that I'm ona new hiv medication, I'm much more informed. Sometimes I have to remind David that I've gone to the doctor. I want totell him. Sometimes it's good news,sometimes it's bad news, but most ofthe time it's pretty good because mynumbers have gone down or up, andyou want to tell everyone that. It sounds like you both really want to make your relationship work. david : Over the last two years we've almost ended the relationship atleast twice. Every so often I still thinkto myself, \"I'm out of here. This is toomuch.\" I'm in a support group at accm for the negative partners of serodiscordant couples. It's been anamazing help to share with peoplewho are going through the samething. Last year when Gary and I were going through a rough time, I broughtit up in the group. The moderator saidtwo things that resonated deeply. Thefirst was that Gary is a man withworth. He said, \"You better be verycareful about throwing that man away if you're thinking of leav- ing.\" The other equally important thing he said was that if I was running away from the rela- tionship because I was running away from hiv, I should recon- sider; in thisworld I cannot escape it. Those two key points carry me through a lot ofrough times. Has being in a mixed-status relationship placed certain roles oneach of you? david : Up until Gary seroconverted, he was the caregiver. Now it's becomeplain that Gary can't always be thecaregiver, nor should he have to be.It's allowed us to both be caregivers. You mentioned something about disclosure being an issue. david : We've decided that since this is Gary's information, it's up to him totell who he wants when he's ready.This became an issue for me becauseI also needed support. I told a fewpeople without Gary's permissionand that caused friction. But nowGary's much more open about it andI've established a support network. gary : In the beginning I didn't want anyone to know about my status be-cause I felt it was something bad,that it had a certain stigma attachedto it. Now it's much better. Most keypeople in my life know. Are your families and friends supportive of your relationship? gary : Yes, definitely. david : Everyone. gary : In the beginning, the biggest fear is that you tell someone andthey'll say they don't want to be apart of your life. david : I can't think of anyone who's backed away from our relationshipbecause of it. Advice for other magnetic couples: gary : See a good therapist. david : For us, it comes down to one word: communication . Each cou- ple has to come up with their ownset of words. Ours are: communi-cate, be patient and have respect. gary : And be honest with each other. 13 Fall/Winter 2004 THE POSITIVE SIDESOCIALLY, SEXUALLY.\" SUE , 37, 15 38, hivnegative Insurance adjusterMarried for 10 yearsOttawa, Ontario When Sue met Jeff: sue: We met in high school and then dated off and on for 10years because Jeff was living in Toronto. Therewere gaps when we weren't in touch,but then we'd spend a weekend to-gether and it was like we were neverapart. We got back together in 1993 and married in '94. On September 7th we'd been together for 20years! What happened when you told Jeff you had hiv? sue: I told him on the phone because he was in Toronto. I didn't know howto tell him. Back in the early ' 90s things were a lot different. I didn'tknow how he would react. jeff: I saw it as an illness. I wasn't taken aback by it. I was very con-cerned and supportive. She was mysweetheart, my love, and it didn'tmatter.To what extent does hivfactor in your relationship? jeff: It's a daily part of our lives, but I don't dwell in the hivworld as much as Sue does. sue: I haven't been ill, so we try to live our lives like hivisn't a factor. We have a 14-year-old daughter and we both have jobs. hivis there but it doesn't control our family life. You have a daughter? sue: I was ecstatic that I was preg- nant. I found out I had hivbecause my obstetrician said I should have an hivtest. When the test came back positive I was terrified that the babywould also be hivpositive. Does your daughter know you have hiv? sue: She's known since she was 8, when she asked why I take so manypills. I told her I have a virus, and shesaid, \"like in the computer?\" I fig-ured I could work with that. I toldher that when there's a virus in thecomputer all the programs don't runproperly and sometimes the com-puter shuts down. If the virus in mybody is making my body not work properly, at some point my body isgoing to shut down. I also told herthat the virus was asleep and we'dworry about it if the virus woke up. Are there any issues that have arisen from being in a mixed-statusrelationship? sue: We've had people assume that Jeff and our daughter also have hiv, but I'm the only one who does. Otherissues have been pretty much med-ical\u2014starting new drugs, side effects,throwing up first thing in the morn-ing. If I'm not well or I'm moody orlacking physical energy, it's hard onthe family because everyone has todo more around the house. jeff: But that's not a major issue. Like any family dealing with any illness,the other family members would pickup the slack. Are there any rewards from being in a serodivergent relationship? jeff: My life before Sue didn't involve anybody who was hiv positive. I didn't know or care about hiv. But from being with Sue I've learned thatthere is more to life than being . . . know how white, heterosexual male? (laughter ) jeff: It's opened my eyes to a whole real world out there that I'd neverseen. I've met so many fascinatingand informative people in the hiv community. sue: This relationship has given me the calmness and security of know-ing that Jeff will be here for ourdaughter if I'm not. That has helpedme medically because I'm notstressed out about what will happento her. I also know every day that I'mloved and cared for. jeff: Sue having hivhas shown me that there's more to a relationshipthan just good times. What contributes to the success of your relationship? sue: He makes me laugh. jeff: Golf. And lots of it. ( laughter ) I'm kidding. We always find time for us.There are times where we're apartand I may not like it, but the quality \"THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS GIVEN ME THE CALMNESS AND SECURITY PHOTOGRAPHS: MICHELLE VALBERGtime turns out great. We alsodon't dwell on the hivfactor. sue: hiv doesn't overwhelm this away, but wecan try to controlit and live ourlives to the fullest. How do you deal with the fear of hiv transmission? jeff: It's no different from when I was single. I was aware of sexually trans-mitted infections when I wasyounger, so protecting myself from hivdidn't invoke any fears. sue: When Jeff re-entered my life, he knew full well that I was hivpositive. It was his choice to come back to thisrelationship. I still have that underly-ing fear, but he's still negative. jeff: I've had two hivtests. My gen- eral practitioner convinced me to gettested just to ensure that I was ok. sue: We do have unprotected sex. It happens. I don't know what else tosay. jeff: It's happened a few times. The moment just takes over, and becausewe attempt to live as a healthy couplewe sometimes have sex just as anyhealthy couple would. We do try veryhard to have protected sex though. Are there other kinds of fears you deal with in a mixed-status relationship? sue: I know that one day I'm going to end up a client at the agency where Iwork. I know I'm going to be sick oneday. jeff: I know that one day Sue could get very ill and that's going to hurt ourfamily in a lot of ways. We're a two-income family and taking away half ofthe income would hurt. Sue is astrong figure in our family, and itwould be hard to replace her contri-butions, both physically and mentally. sue: I was on disability for a while. And I see how hard it is for people ongovernment disability plans to makeends meet. So, it's a financial burdenthat we fear.jeff: I really can't say that I fear Suegetting sick. Inevery relationshipsomeone can getsick, and sowhy fear sickness? sue: And he'll be older I am. (laughter ) Has hivaffected your intimacy? jeff: No, Sue having hivdoes not af- fect our intimacy. Just like any othercouple that works full-time andraises a family, in our busy lives inti-macy is hard to come by. How do you deal with the grey areas when it comes to transmission? sue: We didn't have sex for the longest time when my viral load was high.And we don't have sex when I havemy period, even protected sex. It'snot a place we want to go. Why putthat risk out there? It's only aweek . . . he can go without! jeff: We've been having oral sex since Day One. sue: It was actually Day Three, hon. (laughter ) So you weigh the risks and benefits. sue: Absolutely. jeff: I've decided what I'm doing in this relationship. My goal is to have a\"normal\" relationship. I know thatby having unprotected intercourseand oral sex with Sue I could get in-fected, but I can walk out of myhouse and get hit by a car. I love Sueand I want her to enjoy her life to thefullest. You seem pretty informed about hiv. jeff: If I have a question, Sue answers it. She's a walking encyclopedia. AndI trust her. I'm very fortunate in thatsense. How involved are you when it comes to Sue's treatment? jeff: Marginally. sue: If I want to go on a structured treatment interruption, the choice ismine and I have to weigh the risksand benefits. Jeff and I discuss it, butI'm the one who goes to the doctor and says \"I want to go off meds,\" be-cause that decision is mine. Has being in a serodivergent relationship placed certain roles oneach of you? jeff: When I go to hivconferences I'm known as \"Sue's husband,\" and I'vegrown accustomed to that. sue: Since I've been giving workshops on serodivergent relationships, Iseem to have fallen into a role whereI'm asked by people I've never metbefore how the relationship and thesex work. I tell people that magneticrelationships like mine and Jeff's canwork well with lots of hard work. Magnetic? sue: The title of my workshop is \"The Magnetic Couple: The Positives andthe Negatives in the SerodivergentRelationship.\" Serodiscordant as- sumes that there's discord in the re-lationship, so I really try not to usethat term. Divergent means different. Are your families and friends supportive of your relationship? sue: He's the only boyfriend my mother ever liked. jeff: For the most part, my family's been supportive. However, some ofmy family and friends found outthrough the grapevine and were veryobtuse. sue: \"Don't use a glass that she used, don't smoke that joint with her,\" stufflike that. jeff: Sue's mother, stepmother and father are very supportive, as is therest of her family. Advice for other magnetic couples: jeff: Live for today and love the one you're with, because love isthe best medicine. sue: You can't let hiv overrule everything in your life. It's a com-ponent of your life, but it can't bethe overwhelming force that ab-sorbs everything else.

This mantra is shoved down our throats so often, whocan blame a person for saying, \"Take ALL your pills and shove 'em!\"? The problem is that playing loosewith hivtherapy can lead to drug resistance, causing treat- ments to fail. Why do we phas have to walk such a tightrope, and how do we manage to pull it off? Drug adherence (or compliance) means taking your hiv medications exactly as prescribed\u2014in the right number, at the right time, with or without food, every time. Under- standing why adherence is crucial can help you stick to thepill drill. Drug Resistance 101 Once hivis in your body, it's there for good (until medical science finds a way to extermi-nate it). Drug therapy\u2014antiretrovirals, haart , the cocktail, whatever you call it\u2014 is not a cure, but it can reduce the risk oflife-threatening infections and improvesurvival. haart (highly active antiretroviral therapy) keeps hiv under control\u2014 throwing monkey wrenches into the\"assembly lines\" the virus uses to re-produce. But a dose here and there won't succeed: It takes constant, adequate amounts of drugs to keep hivunder control. Think of hivas a gushing river, and haart as the dam holding it back. Half a dam won't work\u2014it's eitherhigh enough or not. Biologists describe antiretroviral drugsas a \"genetic barrier\" to hivreproduction. If you don't keep enough meds in your body, all the time, that barrier wearsaway under viral pressure and eventually breaks, allowing hivto reproduce. hivis sneaky, finding weak points in our defenses, such as low drug levels. The virus can change shape to sneakaround a drug: The change is called a viral mutation , and the mutated virus may be drug resistant . Once a certain drug no longer works for you, drug-resistant hivcan reproduce and grow, even if you keep taking the drug. Even worse, cross- resistance can sometimes make the virus resistant to other drugs in the same class\u2014even if you've never taken them before. Prime example? Moi: I started mono- therapy (single-drug therapy) with azt back in 1995 , before we knew that tak- ing just one med was a recipe for drug resistance. We did a lot of things wrong back then\u2014adding on 3tc(Epivir) and then Crixivan (indinavir) only made me resistant to them as well. Thanks (or no 16 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2004The Importance of Being Adherent by Derek ThaczukWhere's that spoonful of sugar when you need it? Most people can handle the challenge of adherence once their issues are addressed. PHOTOGRAPH: LEAH-ANNE THOMPSON, ISTOCKPHOTOthanks) to cross-resistance, many other new meds became useless too, and for a while my prospects didn't look good.Luckily, the fiveantiretrovirals I switched to in 2000 finally got my viral load under control, but believe me, you don'twant to paint yourself into that corner. What does all this have to do with adherence? Simple: drug levels . Whether you're taking too few meds or taking enough but not often enough, the result is the same: inade- quate drug levels. Your body is constantly clearing medica-tions out, so you have to keep putting them into maintain sufficient levels. Hence, once-, twice-, or even (bleah!)three-times-daily pill-popping schedules. We're Only Human As you can see, there's good reason to be adherent\u2014it's not just doctors being bossy. In fact, one often-quoted studyfound that chances of keeping the virus suppressed for along time start to slide if you miss more than 5% of your doses. If you pop your pills twice daily, that means notmissing more than two or three doses a month; for three-times-daily poppers, not more than one dose a week. Taking 95% of your doses for peak effectiveness is an incredibly high target. Most negative people don't comeanywhere near it. So what are we phas supposed to do out here in the busy and messy human world? Take my less-than-perfect self: I can spout stats 'til the cows come home, but I still find missed doses in my care-fully organized pillbox. My own personal pitfalls? GFalling asleep before pill time (because, dammit, I'm tired!). GBeing depressed and not feeling like eating, which makes a \"with-food\" dose a problem. GLosing track of one of my nine prescriptions, and either forgetting to get one of my hiv'scripts refilled or running out of repeats. Compliance Culprits Working at the Toronto People With aids Foundation for eight years, I've found that there are as many differentadherence challenges as there are people on meds. Laura,a single mom whose kids don't know she has hiv, has to keep her meds hidden. Luis went for weeks taking onlyhalf-doses because he thought that would lessen the sideeffects. Jimmy does really well until he lights up his crackpipe, then it's game over for the next three or four days.And I can't even begin to count the people who show up atour agency, out of meds and panicked, because their drugcoverage plan has screwed up\u2014again. Out of this assortment, some common culprits emerge: GSide effects. Who wants to feel sick? If the side effects are nasty, switching meds may make adherence easier. Talkto your doc about how to deal with them. GDepression or anxiety. Ever ask yourself \"why bother?\" Because your life isworth it, that's why. Depression can be treated in a variety of ways. Don't be ashamed orafraid to seek help. GLack of structure. This is often tied to alcohol and drug useor mental illness. Or just trying to hold a hectic life to- gether\u2014as any single parent can tell you. GThe just . hey, it happens! Finding some stable point amid the daily chaos can be the key (see \"Forget-Me-Nots\" for practicalpointers). GAccess issues. You can't take your meds if you can't fill the 'script\u2014and too many coverage schemes havecracks that people fall through. You may need to workwith your health care team or aids agency to get the drugs you need. Getting ahead of the game While there's no single magic solution, take heart\u2014most people can handle the challenge of adherence once their is-sues are addressed. Best up-front advice? Be prepared. Going from no pills a day to anypills every day is a big leap. If you're thinking about starting haart , work through your feelings about taking hivdrugs. Be aware of any potential side effects before you start taking meds and practice with jellybeans or Smarties to see where the trouble spots maylie. Talk with other haart takers.

I've been taking hivdrugs for a long time now and, like everyone else, there have been times I've wanted to ditch'em.

However, considering how heavily hivis studied, there's less research on drug adherence than you'dexpect. One reason is that it's so complex, says Laura Park-Wyllie, a Toronto pharmacist and researcher with St.Michael's Hospital's Inner City Health Program: \"A hugenumber of factors affect people's adherence. As a re-searcher, you have to make sure you're doing the sciencecarefully, but it's important to remember you're dealingwith real human beings.\" Different strokes Park-Wyllie, along with Dr. Elizabeth Phillips of Sunny- brook and Women's College Hospital, recently reviewed theresearch on adherence for the Canadian Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. Examining why people have trouble stick- ing to their regimens, they found everything but the kitchensink: depression, stress, unstable living conditions, recre-ational drug use, complex and demanding med schedules,side effects, the number and frequency of daily doses, pooror inconsistent medical care, travel, changes in daily rou-tine, and just plain forgetting. This grab-bag of troubles led to the notion of a \"toolkit\" of support techniques: working closely with each individualto assess what's most likely to help, then drawing on exist-ing tips and tools to form a highly customized adherencesupport program. Pharma karma A recent study from the B.C. Centre for Excellence, pub- lished in AIDS Care, found that pharmacists can help with adherence. People who got their meds from pharmacies inhospital clinics, where pharmacists work very closely with phas, were most likely to be highly adherent and have last- ing viral suppression as a result. STAART before HAART Psychologist Louise Balfour and others at Ottawa Hospi- tal are currently studying a program they call \"SupportiveTherapy for Adherence to Anti-Retroviral Treatment\"( staart ). Providing psychological and educational supportbefore people pop their first pill is proving useful to head off potential problems with adherence, especially for phas suf- fering from depression. A full-time job Other Canadian researchers say that adherence has a lot to do with how we as phas feel\u2014about ourselves, our med- icine and what we have to do to stay healthy. EricMykhalovskiy and colleagues at Dalhousie University inHalifax use the term \"health work\" to describe the ongoingdaily effort demanded of phas, recognizing that just getting through a typical day, with its medication and other healthdemands, requires constant effort. Mind over meds James Gillett and colleagues at Hamilton's McMaster University are talking to phas about their views of drug treatments and all that they symbolize. The McMaster teamcalls this a \"rarely straightforward\" headspace where treat-ments may symbolize hope, health and a future\u2014or intru-siveness, toxicity and \"feeling like a lab rat.\" A fine balance Sergio Rueda, from the (now-defunct) Community Re- search Initiative of Toronto, found that while some peoplesing the praises of their meds, many more see them as, atbest, a necessary evil. This \"stoic\" view reflects an ongoingstruggle: to keep hivand taking pills from ruling your life. \u2014Derek Thaczuk 18 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2004Forget-Me-Nots GPiggyback.

ZIRKEL, ISTOCKPHOTOby with hiv/aids (phas), a \"minor\" infection\u2014 think cold, flu or sinus infec-tion\u2014can have some major consequences. Avoiding infections, andtreating them effectively when theysneak up on you, is a good idea. Here'swhy: GIt's much easier for your body to knock out an infection when yourimmune system is strong. Anti-infection drugs (antibiotics, anti-fungals and antivirals) don't workalone\u2014they need a hard-workingimmune system to help them elimi-nate bugs and germs. If you let aninfection drag on, you'll have moretrouble fighting it off further downthe road if your highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( haart ) fails and your immune strength diminishes.And with decreasing immune func-tion, the infection may get worseand could cause more serious prob-lems. Treating an infection as earlyas possible increases the chances ofcompletely eliminating it. GEvery time your body has to crank up your immune system to fight aninfection, the hivliving inside the immune cells gets cranked up, too.\" hiv replicates most effectively within immune-competent cells 19 Fall/Winter 2004 THE POSITIVE SIDEInfections and Bugs and Germs . . . Oh My! A guide to keeping infections at bay\u2014 and boosting immune health while you're at itILLUSTRATIONS: BEVERLY DEUTSCHwhen these cells are activated,\" says Anthony Fauci, md, director of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases at the U.S.National Institutes of Health.\"When a person gets another infec-tion, the immune system gets acti-vated, or 'turned on,' to fight thisinfection. This activation puts theimmune system in a more vulnera-ble state for the replication of hiv.\" So, although the fever and achesand pains related to an infectionmay be all you're feeling, what'sgoing on beneath the surface mayinclude rapidly growing hiv. This issue is not just a concern for those not on haart . Although hivacti- vation is definitely greater virus, even peopleon hivmeds who have undetectable viral loads may have problems. Dr.Fauci says that although haart gener- ally lessens the increase in hivactiva- tion that another infection can cause,if your immune system has to workovertime to fight other infections thatactivity can end up making your medsless effective at suppressing hiv. So preventing (where possible) or other-wise quickly treating infections mayhelp preserve haart 's ability to keep hivin check. Which infections are of most con- cern? In general, the infections mostlikely to boost hivreplication are those that cause body-wide (systemic) symp-toms: fever, muscle aches, fatigue and\"malaise\"\u2014that all-over yucky feeling.You know how you feel when you get acold or flu or your sinusitis starts act-ing up? That's what we're talkingabout. These symptoms are indicatorsthat your immune system has been ac-tivated enough to likely increase hiv activity. Those are some reasons why it's important to prevent infections\u2014andtreat them quickly when they do occur.Read on for tips on how to avoid andtreat four common infections that canactivate hiv: colds, flus, sinus prob- lems and hepatitis. Colds and flus Achy all over, feverish, sniffling, coughing and just generally miser-able\u2014that's probably how you felt the last time you had a nasty cold or flu.Even worse, the flu can lead to pneu-monia, and the risk of this is greater inthe immune-compromised. Plus, theinfection can stress your immune sys-tem and may activate hiv. Here's what you can do to prevent or quickly knockout these misery-makers if they occur.If you notice you're getting colds andflus a lot more than usual, tell yourdoctor. Prevention: \"Start with what your mother always told you: Wash yourhands and otherwise practice goodhygiene,\" says Ottawa Hospital'sCurtis Cooper, md. Indeed, research has shown that the biggest factor inthe transmission of colds and flus istouching contaminated surfaces. Aclassic example: grabbing a doorknobthat an infected person touched afterblowing his nose. Bingo. His cold be-comes yours when your hand latertouches your eyes, mouth or nose. GAvoid directly touching surfaces in public places that are likely to becontaminated\u2014stair rails, door-knobs, faucets, toilet handles\u2014oruse a tissue when doing so. Washyour hands when you return homefrom a public place. If someone's illin your own household, extend those rules to the home-front. GAvoid eating anything that you or anyone else has touched with un-washed hands or that's been incontact with an unwashed surface.Don't drink or eat from the samecontainers that someone with acold or flu has used. GIt may not sound friendly but try to avoid being around people with acontagious illness like colds or flusas much as you can, and try not totouch any surfaces they've touchedwhen you are around them. GWhen the flu vaccine becomes available every fall, get in line to getyours. The small amount of im-mune activation that a vaccinationmay cause is nothing compared tothe effects of a full-blown infection.To prevent pneumonia, check withyour doctor about getting the pneu-monia vaccine (Pneumovax). Treatment Tips: Rest, plenty of fluids and a fever med are the stan-dard recommendations for colds andflus (and try my famous chicken veggiesoup recipe in the spring/summer2004 Positive Side !). For influenza, there's a prescription drug called tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) that might make the flu flee faster. It shouldbe started within the first two daysafter symptoms strike. There are also complementary therapies that many people swear by.Some of these have not been tested in phas, so it's hard to be sure about drug interactions and effectiveness. Aswith many natural therapies, it's bestto take them under the supervision ofa naturopath or natural health practi-tioner experienced with hiv. GBeta 1,3 glucans. Beta-glucans are components of plant cell wallsfound in oats, mushrooms (maitake,reishi and shiitake) and baker'syeast (the source for most supple-ments). They appear to indirectlyboost the immune response to in-fections. Many people who've triedbeta-glucan supplements say thatthey greatly duration ofcolds and flus ( 2-3 500 -mg capsules taken when first symptoms appear,followed by 1-2 capsules every hour 20 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2004Rest, plenty of fluids and a fever med are the standardrecommendations for colds and flus. Gor two until symptoms disappear, usually within a day). Long-termuse is not advisable because beta-glucans may end up activating hiv, just the thing we're trying to avoidhere, but a couple days' worth tohead off a viral infection appears tobe safe. G Vitamin C. Several studies have shown that vitamin C\u2014 2-6grams (2,000-6,000 mg) daily, with doses spread throughout the day\u2014canhelp prevent or shorten colds andalleviate symptoms. It works best iftaken when symptoms first appear.Different people can tolerate differ-ent amounts of C, so start with alow dose and build up gradually.Too much C can cause sudden, verywatery diarrhea. Once you stop tak-ing it the diarrhea should go away. G Echinacea. This herb has long been recommended by naturopaths totreat colds and flus, usually indoses of several capsules or dropsof a tincture daily from the very be-ginning of the infection until it'sgone. Long-term use is not recom-mended because the herb may pro-mote the production of potentiallyharmful immune system chemicalsthat are already too high in phas. Echinacea has the potential to in-teract with certain hivand other drugs, so check with your pharma-cist before using it. G Zinc acetate lozenges. Several studies have shown a shortening ofthe duration of colds if one of theselozenges is held in the mouth andallowed to dissolve slowly everytwo hours until symptoms disap-pear, followed by use every 4-6 hours the day after symptoms dis-appear to help prevent recurrence.They work best if used at the verybeginning of the infection. Thelozenges may cause nausea if takenon an empty stomach, so have asnack before popping one. Sinus Problems Achy face, stuffy nose dripping yel- low or greenish goo, wretched head-ache and fever\u2014not exactly the recipefor a happy day. For many phas, it's a combo of misery that happens toooften as the result of sinusitis, an in- flammation of the sinuses. And thesymptoms are an indication that hivis probably being activated. Sudden-onset (acute) sinusitis usually stemsfrom an infection that may be bacter-ial, viral or fungal. Long-term (chronic)sinus problems may be allergy relatedbut also frequently result from persist-ent infections. Sinusitis can returnmore often or linger longer in peoplewith compromised immune function. The focus in the past has been on bacteria as the most likely cause ofsinus infections. However, recent re-search from the Mayo Clinic hasshown that in most people the morelikely culprits are fungi. The air isfilled with fungal spores that webreathe in. This causes no problem inmost people, but in the extra-sensitivethere's a hyped-up immune system re-sponse which results in the typicalsymptoms. Seasonal and other allergies (to dust, mold, etc.) contribute to sinusproblems in many people. Whencaused by allergies, the most commonsymptoms are watery mucous produc- tion, sneezing, wheezing, itchy nose oreyes, headaches and swelling of thenasal membranes. Prevention: If allergies are the sus- pect, check with your doctor about al-lergy testing, followed by desensitizingallergy injections, if appropriate.There are reservations about usingsuch allergy shots in people with un-controlled virus (due to the risk of hiv activation), and they may not work inthose with seriously compromised im-mune function (low cd4cells). In the case of pollen, dust, mold and otherairborne sources of allergies, keepyour living space as clean and free ofthem as possible. Air filters can help. Treatment Tips: Specialists recom- mend a thorough diagnostic work-upto determine exactly what is causingyour symptoms. This can include anendoscopy of the nose and a sinus ct scan. GIf a bacterial infection is diagnosed, appropriate antibiotics usuallyclear up the infection, althoughlengthy treatment is sometimes re-quired. It's important to accompanysuch treatment with acidophilus(either via supplements, 1-2 cap- sules several times daily, or of live-culture yogurt)in order to replace the \"good\" bac-teria that are inadvertently killedoff by antibiotics. These good bac-teria serve important functions,including aiding in digestion andhelping prevent various infectionsand yeast overgrowth. GIf a fungal infection is found, an antifungal nasal spray (ampho-tericin B, usually used twice a dayfor three months or longer if neces-sary) has been shown by MayoClinic researchers to successfullyeliminate the problem in somepeople. Although amphotericin B isnot approved for this purpose, itcan be prescribed off-label and pre-pared by a compounding pharmacy. GFrequent use of a saline spray can help eliminate infections by keep-ing the area cleaned out and lesshospitable to infectious organisms. GIf there's serious congestion that makes it impossible to effectively 21 Fall/Winter 2004 THE POSITIVE SIDEG The air is filled with fungal spores that webreathe in.use the saline spray, it may be help- ful to use a spray decongestant toopen up the nostrils. Spray eachnostril once, and wait a minute ortwo to allow the lower nasal mu-cosal lining of the sinus to shrink.Then spray each nostril again inorder to reach the upper mucosallining. Spray decongestants shouldonly be used when absolutely nec-essary since long-term use can cre-ate dependence. When you canbreathe through your nose, you canwash out your nostrils with salinespray once a day to thoroughlycleanse the area. GFor serious inflammation many doctors recommend a steroidnasal spray. This should be usedwith caution and only for as longas necessary because of the theo-retical possibility of immune sup-pression from the steroid in thenasal cavity. GIf allergies are contributing to sinus problems, talk to your doctor aboutappropriate meds such as antihista-mines. Some may interact with your hivdrugs so be sure to discuss any choices, even over-the-counter vari-eties, with your doctor or pharma-cist. Naturopaths recommend sting-ing nettle, an herbal remedy that'seffective for stopping hay-feversymptoms by helping your body sta-bilize the histamine reaction. (Hist-amine is a chemical produced whenyour body is exposed to pollen orsomething else you're allergic to; itcauses itchy eyes, dripping noseand frequent sneezes.) Stinging net-tle capsules are available from herband supplement companies. Hepatitis Viruses In a much more serious league are the infections created by the hepatitisviruses A, B and C, all of which canactivate hivas well as cause serious symptoms. Both hep B and C can be-come chronic infections in somepeople, leading to serious liver prob-lems. Hep A never turns into a chronicinfection, but it may take longer for phas to recover. Although hep A is much less common in North Americathan in the developing world, it's apossibility, especially when risky foods are eaten. Prevention: \"It's really important to see if people are immune to hepatitis Aand B,\" says Ottawa Hospital's CurtisCooper, md. \"We always run tests and recommend vaccinations for both hepA and B.\" Two hep A vaccines areavailable: Havrix and Vaqta. Both re-quire two injections, usually Two hep B vaccines areavailable: Recombivax hband En- These require three injectionsover a six-month period. A combina-tion vaccine for A and B is also avail-able (Twinrix), which requires threeinjections over a six-month period.There's some concern that phas with more advanced immune suppressionare less likely to benefit from the vac-cines, so they should be given when cd4counts are at higher levels, when possible. These vaccines can come inmighty handy, along with a shot of im-mune globulin if you think you've re-cently been exposed to hep B. Avoiding exposure to the viruses is another prevention tool. Hepatitis A is shed via the bowel movements of infected people. Trans-mission can occur through:GDirect person-to-person contact: It helps to use a latex barrier like adental dam for oral-anal sex. GExposure to contaminated water, ice or shellfish harvested fromsewage-contaminated water: Drinksafe, purified bottled water, espe-cially in areas where water safety isan issue, avoiding ice in such areas.Don't eat shellfish if there's any riskthat they were taken from sewage-contaminated waters. GIt can be risky to eat raw fruits, veg- etables or other foods that mayhave been contaminated duringharvesting or handling. Take greatcare with food choices. In general,avoid eating uncooked fruits or veg-etables that aren't washed, peeledor prepared by you.Hepatitis B is transmitted through activities that involve contact withblood or blood-derived fluids. The bestapproach to prevention is to try to haveprotected sex and never share drugequipment. Hep B can also be spread ifyou use items that could be contami-nated with someone else's blood, suchas razors, toothbrushes and needlesfor piercing or tattooing. Hepatitis C is transmitted prima- rily through the exchange of blood, sosharing drug equipment is very risky.Avoid possibly contaminated needlesfor body piercing or tattooing. Be sureto practice safe sex. Treatment Tips: For acute infection with any hepatitis virus, here's the drill:bed rest, lots of fluids and, if necessary,over-the-counter pain relievers. Otherdrug treatments are sometimes usedfor chronic infection with either hep B(interferon, 3 C Naturopaths rec-ommend people with hepatitisviruses liver with nutrientslike alpha-lipoic acid and N-acetyl-cysteine ( nac), which boost and with extract). In the creepy, crawly world of germs and bugs, it's us against them.But knowing the enemy and learninghow to avoid or treat an infection cankeep you working at the top of yourgame. 22 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2004G Hepatitis viruses A, B and C can all activateHIV as well as causeserious symptoms.Iseroconverted early in the pandemic, when this illness did not yet own its final name.No one knew how to deal with it. I believedmy life was over. I was terrified, confused and suicidal. The question was: Could I find away to live with AIDS ? Diagnosed in 1985, not knowing who to talk to about it and fearing that my life wouldsoon end, I was lost in a fog of loneliness anddespair, until I began to speak about my condi-tion with Dr. Andrew Zysman, my late cousin,who was also HIVpositive. He encouraged me to turn my photographic interest toward docu-menting the history of AIDS . There was much to be learned by following this path. By attending AIDS conferences around the world, beginning in 1989 at Montreal, Ideveloped a career as a photojournalist. That sur-prised me, because I didn't believe that I coulddo anything with a death sentence imposed uponme. My interest in life was rekindled. I learnedhow to better cope with my illness. Though I grieve for all the people I've met, known, loved and lost in this struggle for sur-vival, I am at once a member of the global AIDS community and a recorder of the evidence wewitness in AIDS health care issues, politics, activism, business and society. This makes thespectre of AIDS easier to bear. Any person living with HIV/AIDS can empower his or herself by cultivating their per-sonal means of expression. This may benefit thepsyche and strengthen the will to live. We allhave a point of view about the subject of AIDS , and it is important for everyone who can tomake their voice heard, whether in the arts orby helping others.
