Daniel Lucas uses microscopy to understand how blood cells are produced in the marrow of the bone and how leukemia inhibits this process. A native Spaniard, he obtained his PhD in Madrid training with Drs. Antonio Bernad and Luis Blanco. Then he moved to New York for postdoctoral training in Paul Frenette's lab. There he discovered basic mechanisms through which the nervous system regulates blood cell production. He also identified macrophages and megakaryocytes -two types of cells produced by the blood stem cells- as key regulators of those very same blood stem cells. This was the first demonstration that the stem cells were regulated by their own progeny. He established his own research group at the University of Michigan Medical School before being recruited to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. His group has discovered mechanisms that promote faster blood recovery after transplantation and deciphered how several types of blood cells assemble in the bone marrow. I began my career at The Ohio State University, where I studied blood vessel development and received my PhD in the lab of Dr. Brenda Lilly. After graduating, I was interested in moving into the cancer field, so I joined the lab of Dr. Jill de Jong at University of Chicago, working on T-cell leukemia in the zebrafish model. There I adapted a method for identifying leukemia stem cells within a tumor, the cells responsible for relapse and resistance after initial treatment. I then moved to the neighboring lab of Dr. Megan McNerney to comprehensively test genes within a frequently deleted portion of the genome that correlates with multiple blood disorders and leukemias. Next, I followed my wife's fellowship appointment to Washington University in St. Louis and joined the lab of Dr. Daniel Link. Now in my second year here, I am continuing my work in the leukemia field, focusing on TP53, the most commonly mutated gene in all cancers. Mutations in TP53 mark the worst forms of leukemia, resistant to most chemotherapies, and finding an effective treatment is the focus of this proposal.

He is a pediatric hematologist-oncologist and directs a lab in which they study molecular and cellular mechanisms of leukemogenesis, with the goal of developing novel therapeutic strategies. Most recently, they have been studying how leukemia cells influence the microenvironment to promote immune evasion. For example, they found that IL-12 overcomes calcineurin-dependent immune evasion by leukemia cells. Collaboratively, they designed BiTEokines to deliver IL-12 to the immune synapse of T cells and leukemia cells, supported by a DOD award (CA180783). They have also found that B cell malignancies express high levels of Siglec15, a newly identified immune checkpoint, and that inhibition of Siglec15 promotes immune clearance of malignant B cells in vivo. Thus, they are uniquely positioned to further develop Siglec15 as a therapeutic target for leukemia and lymphoma. Timothy J. Ley is the Lewis T. and Rosalind B.

He is nationally and internationally recognized for his expertise in CAR T-cell therapy in lymphomas and management of toxicities associated with CAR T-cell therapy. I am a physician employed at the University of Michigan who specializes in the management of patients with a very specific blood cancer called lymphoma. The term \"Lymphoma\" describes a collection (subtypes) of tumors that originate from a blood cell called a lymphocyte. The different subtypes can have very different presentations and outcomes. Treatment for lymphoma differs from most other cancers in that chemotherapy and not surgery is essential. As part of my work at the university I conduct research in lymphoma. My research involves evaluating new drugs and drug combinations in patients with lymphoma as part of clinical trials. Clinical trials offer treatments for patients who have no other viable options and/or gives patients an opportunity to receive promising drugs that would otherwise not be available. As part of the clinical trials, I use special tests to evaluate for reasons why the drugs do or don't work. This part of the research is important to allow for me to better select patients for certain treatments and to better understanding of what makes lymphoma cells survive.

He is professor of Public Health Sciences Division and professor of Basic Sciences Division of Fred Hutch. I obtained a double Bachelor's degree in Science (honours) and IT at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. I developed an interest in medical research and undertook a PhD at QIMR Berghofer with A/Prof Steven Lane where I focussed on poorly understood mechanisms by which normal blood cells might become leukemia cells. I am interested in how leukemia cells evade conventional chemotherapy to re-initiate abnormal cell growth and cause leukemia relapse. I recently joined Prof Patricia Ernst at the University of Colorado in order to study this phenomenon in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where I am looking at two important proteins (MLL and NOTCH). These proteins belong to different genetic classes, yet they may collaborate to cause chemotherapy-resistant T-ALL. Drugs that target NOTCH have already been developed for clinical use but they display high toxicity. In this project, MLL and NOTCH may be dual targeted using a novel drug combination with the aim of augmenting the efficacy of NOTCH inhibitors which will reduce the toxicity of that therapy. Constellation Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics that selectively modulate gene expression to address serious unmet medical needs in patients with cancer.

I am a bioinformatician and postdoctoral fellow at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center working in the cancer epigenetics laboratory led by Professor Mark Dawson. Through my postdoctoral and Ph.D. training, I have developed a rare and important skill set that encompasses proficiency in both molecular and computational biology. My career to date has pursued an understanding of how epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression in cells and how we can combine clever molecular biology with novel computational techniques to reveal new insights in these areas. In the context of cancer, I have a particular interest in haematological malignancies and seek to understand the role that epigenetics and transcriptional regulation play in the development of therapeutic resistance to conventional, targeted, and immune-based therapies. My research aims to develop novel biological and computational tools to identify and circumvent these processes for the successful treatment of cancer. I began my scientific career in the Marchesi laboratories (Yale, 1982-1985) and then as an undergraduate under Don Wiley (Harvard, 1986-1988). I entered the Medical Scientist Training Program (1988-1995) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), performing doctoral research with Harold Varmus, at UCSF and the NIH. I defended my thesis at UCSF and completed medical training at Northwestern (1996-1997). I was an Internal Medicine house officer and Hematology/Oncology fellow at Univ of Chicago (UofC, 1997-2003)then stayed on as a UofC faculty member as a physician-scientist, with both research and clinical responsibilities (2003-2023). Effective April 1, 2023, I have joined the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University as the inaugural director of the Jeff and Marianne Silver Family Blood Cancer Institute of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center. I will also serve as Clinical Director of Cancer Genetics. I derive synergy between bench research and the bedside to understand disease on a molecular level. This proposal seeks to understand how inherited DNA changes influence the development of bone marrow cancers, with the goal of developing interventions that would prevent cancers in at-risk individuals to make my job as an oncologist obsolete. Dr. V. Lokesh Battula received his Ph.D. from Justus Liebig University. He is currently working as a research faculty, Associate Professor, in the Department of Leukemia at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Dr. Battula's research is focused on development of immune therapeutic tools for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. He discovered ganglioside GD2 as a unique marker to identify cancer stem cells from primary breast tumors and cell lines. He is currently developing antibody based approaches for targeting GD2 in solid tumors. He is also interested in understanding the metabolic processes that regulate the expression of GD2 and the function of CSCs in primary tumors. His lab is working on antibody-based approaches for targeting immune checkpoint protein including B7-H3, CD47 and SIRP in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. These proteins play a crucial role in the inhibition of immune cells in primary tumors. He is developing therapeutic antibodies against immune checkpoint proteins that could be used in the treatment of cancer. Dr. Reglero is a biochemist and molecular biologist interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying cancer progression and response to therapy. Clara obtained her PhD degree with honors under the supervision of Dr. Federico Mayor at the Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Center in Spain. Her work about the regulation of GRK2, a protein implicated in breast cancer, was published in several international articles. During her first years of training, Clara also developed a growing interest in the study of the mechanisms of cancer therapeutics and resistance. In 2018, she joined the laboratory of Dr. Adolfo Ferrando at Columbia University as postdoctoral researcher. The Ferrando lab seeks to decipher the oncogenic mechanisms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and translate it into new therapies for patients. In this context, Dr. Reglero is investigating the mechanisms of resistance driven by mutations in the protein NT5C2 in relapsed ALL. Her work will help understanding relapse in ALL and will facilitate the development of new therapies for the treatment of this disease. As a young kid, my best friend's brother developed cancer. This inspired me to try to advance cures and to swim for LLS. As a medical student, I witnessed my first immunotherapy as newly transplanted cord cells eradicated acute myeloid leukemia. My passion to motivate the immune system to cure cancer (and avert our healthy organs) has continued. Initially, I studied how to restart the thymus to make these cancer-killing T cells, then I learned the intricacies of expanding tumor-directed T cells. I am grateful to LLS for awarding funds to improve on this process, to better propagate and activate the cancer-killing T cells. Using a novel process to generate these cancer-specific T cells, we can then give them to patients who have had recurrence of their acute myeloid leukemia after bone marrow transplantation. These patients have endured our most intensive therapy to achieve a cure, and we hope that our therapy will offer a new way to help decrease their cancer without major toxicities.

She is an author or co-author in several research articles, reviews and book chapters. I am a former Special Fellow of the LLS and a Scholar of American Society of Hematology. My research team studies how surveillance of malignant cells by host immune cells is suppressed in pediatric and adult lymphoid malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphomas. Because the host immune system defends against cancer, lymphoid malignancies have evolved strategies to evade immune recognition. To make lymphoid malignancies vulnerable to attack by the host immune system, we are delineating how non-malignant, host immune cells are suppressed in these malignancies using mouse models and samples provided by adults and children suffering from ALL and lymphomas. We are applying our findings to develop diagnosis and early intervention strategies and to engineer safe immunotherapeutic cures for ALL and lymphomas. With support from LLS TRP, we will further develop natural killer cells, one of the first lines of anticancer immune defense, to combat high-risk pediatric lymphoid malignancies. Dr Vassiliou is Professor of Haematological Medicine at the University of Cambridge, Member of Faculty at the Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and a Consultant Haematologist at Cambridge University Hospitals. He studies the pre-clinical evolution, pathogenesis and treatment of myeloid malignancies. Highlights of his work include the co-discovery of the phenomenon of clonal haematopoiesis (CH), the first demonstration that individuals at high risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) can be identified years in advance and the identification of hundreds of novel genetic vulnerabilities of AML, through the first genome-wide CRISPR screen focused on a human cancer, leading to the development of multiple new anti-leukemic treatments. Dr. Simon is a postdoctoral fellow in Stan Riddell's laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson CRC, Seattle, USA. His studies aim at understanding biological mechanisms associated with anti-tumor efficacy, tumor resistance and therapy-associated toxicities in cancer patients treated with immunotherapy agents. With the support of the LLS CDP special fellow award, he will describe in unprecedented depth the cellular and molecular variations leading to the development of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), the most common and life-threatening toxicity in blood cancer patients receiving CAR-T cell therapies. This program will lead to the description of potential targets for therapeutic intervention to prevent or resolve CRS and therefore preserve anti-tumor efficacy of the CAR-T cell therapy. My name is Sam Taylor and I am a postdoctoral fellow sponsored by the LLS. I originally completed my postgraduate training at the University of Western Australia where I studied the effects of specific anti-leukemia drugs and how they can be repurposed to protect cancer patients from the toxicity of chemotherapy. After completion of my PhD, I decided that I wanted to continue working in cancer research with an emphasis on new therapeutic approaches and, eventually, would like to run my own research laboratory. With that in mind, I took up a postdoctoral position in Prof. Ulrich Steidl's laboratory at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY where I have continued studies into new and promising drugs to combat leukemia. When I am not buzzing around in the lab, I enjoy trying new activities and getting outdoors as much as possible - most recently I have been attempting to surf (despite being Australian I had never tried surfing until here at the Rockaways in NY!)

Now, Qingyu is applying his cancer biology expertise to high-risk blood cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). His goal is to reveal how BPDCN functions to identify novel therapies that lead to cures of this malignancy, and to find parallels of BPDCN biology in other blood cancers that can also be exploited therapeutically. Dr. Jaiswal is an assistant professor at Stanford University in the Department of Pathology and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, where his lab focuses on understanding the biology of the aging blood system. Several years ago, he identified a common, pre-malignant state for blood cancers, termed \"clonal hematopoiesis\", by analyzing large human genome sequencing studies. He discovered that clonal hematopoiesis is prevalent in the aging population and increases the risk of not only blood cancers, but also cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. Understanding the biology of these mutations and how they contribute to the development of cancer and other age-related diseases is the current focus of work in the lab. Ultimately, Dr. Jaiswal and his team aim to develop novel therapies that can prevent adverse outcomes due to clonal hematopoiesis. Jaroslaw P.

The molecular mechanisms of cell proliferation and the field of Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) have always been our main area of interest and fascination. We have the expertise, training and motivation necessary to study several different aspects of this incredibly broad field. Specifically, the training in mechanistic science, including molecular biology, biochemistry, cell/animal biology, has laid the groundwork to understand how ubiquitin ligases complexes monitor the molecular mechanisms in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Our work has identified and studied multiple key factors regulating cellular pathways, such as DNA-damage checkpoints, cell cycle, circadian clock, Toll-like-Receptor and NF-B activation, as documented in ours publications. In addition, we have successfully collaborated with several scientists, and contributed to peer-reviewed publications from each of these projects. After completing a PhD in Immunology at Trinity College Dublin, I moved to Imperial College London to study how persistent infection with a virus causes Leukemia, Lymphoma and other diseases. The virus in question is Human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1), which infects the very cells which defend us against viruses: T cells. Around 5% of virus-carriers develop aggressive blood cancer (Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, ATL), in which one infected T cell becomes malignant. ATL is very difficult to treat, and people with the most aggressive forms survive for less than a year. I made the game-changing discovery that ATL-like T cells circulate in the blood of carriers who go on to develop ATL years before they show symptoms of ATL. I am now developing new diagnostics which can detect ATL early, and together with clinicians at the U.K. National Centre for Human Retrovirology and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre, will test whether a recently licenced drug can eliminate ATL-like T cells in high-risk carriers.

The most common T-cell lymphoma in the United States includes a heterogeneous mix of lymphomas that lack distinguishing characteristics and, until recently, remained clinically and molecularly \"unspecified\". Improved understanding of T-cell lymphoma pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies will be needed to address this challenge and improve outcomes for patients afflicted with these aggressive lymphomas. Many questions, including the \"cell of origin\", the role of antigen-, costimulatory-, and cytokine-receptor signaling, and the contribution of myeloid-derived antigen-presenting cells in disease pathogenesis remain obscure. My laboratory uses complementary mouse models and primary T-cell lymphoma specimens (in ex vivo and patient-derived xenograft studies) to address these fundamental and clinically relevant questions. We are poised to clinically translate our laboratory-based findings into novel therapeutic strategies that we hope will improve outcomes for patients afflicted with these aggressive lymphomas.

Dr. Challen is currently an Associate Professor in the Division of Oncology at Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis). His laboratory research is at the interface of stem cell biology and blood cancer, and aims to determine how disruption of the epignenome changes the fate of HSCs and ultimately leads to the development of hematopoietic disorders. He was the first to describe how mutations in the gene DNMT3A regulates the balance of HSC self-renewal and differentiation as a first step to development of AML. His lab aims to develop mutation-specific therapies to inhibit CH clones as a mechanism of blood cancer prevention. Dr. Challen is investigating how mutations in genes that alter the epigenome alter the function of blood-forming hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), leading to a condition known as clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and predispose for future development of blood diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML)and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Susan Schwab is an Associate Professor at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, where she studies how immune cells navigate through the body to reach sites of disease.

Dr. Garfall is a hematologist-oncologist specializing in the care of multiple myeloma patients and research on new multiple myeloma therapies. He is a member of the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, where he is an Assistant Professor of Medicine. Dr. Garfall completed his undergraduate studies at Princeton University, medical school at New York University, residency in internal medicine at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and hematology/oncology fellowship at Penn. Dr. Garfall's research focuses on immunotherapy. He has conducted clinical trials with CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies for multiple myeloma. He is specifically interested on developing new approaches to prevent relapse in multiple myeloma patients. Nearly one-third of patients with lymphomas or leukemias who receive CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy ultimately fail therapy, with down-regulation or loss of the CD19 target on tumor cells as a prominent cause of failure. To offer alternative treatment options to these patients, Dr. Larry W. Kwak and his team have developed new CAR T cells targeting the B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) on lymphoma and leukemia cells. Supported by an LLS SCOR grant, the team will conduct a first-in-human clinical trial in patients with mantle cell lymphoma. They are simultaneously increasing the effectiveness of these new CAR T cells by combining them with lymphoma signaling pathway modulators. Dr. Jason M. Butler is the Director of Stem Cell Therapeutics and Professor of Medical Sciences at Hackensack Meridian Health's Center for Discovery and Innovation and also holds a joint appointment as Associate Professor in the Department of Molecular Oncology at Georgetown University. Dr. Butler's laboratory has dedicated itself to understanding how aged blood vessels disrupt healthy blood stem cell function and if these age-related deficiencies of the blood vessels enhance the progression of blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The Butler lab has devised novel experimental models that allow them to manipulate blood vessels to \"safeguard\" healthy blood stem cells while increasing the susceptibility of AML cells to anti-cancer regimens. The success of these studies will lead to the development of therapeutic strategies designed to augment the sensitivity of leukemic cells to chemotherapy, reducing AML-associated side effects and enhancing regeneration of a health blood system following myelosuppressive therapies. I studied Biology and Molecular Medicine at the National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I explored the complexity of cancer pathogenesis. Then, I moved to Italy where I obtained my PhD from the University of Padua, investigating the morphology and functions of the subcellular organelles called mitochondria during programmed cell death. I am currently performing my postdoctoral training at the New York University School of Medicine under the mentorship of Dr. Iannis Aifantis. My research focuses on understanding the role of mitochondria in leukemia progression and drug resistance. Although new targeted therapies have been discovered and approved for the treatment of various types of leukemia, in many cases patients do not respond or develop resistance to treatments. My LLS-funded studies shed light on the mitochondria adaptations which enable cancer cells escape cell death induced by the treatments, while suggesting novel therapeutic strategies.

I am an assistant professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where I treat patients suffering from leukemias and lymphomas. In my clinical practice, I experience firsthand the lack of treatment options and the poor outcomes in patients with relapsed T cell leukemias and T cell lymphomas. Therefore, my laboratory research focuses on the development of new therapies for the treatment of these T cell cancers. Using my background in T cell biology (Paul et al Immunity 2012, Paul et al Science Signaling 2014) and my collaborators expertise in antibody design, I developed therapies that selectively kill T cell cancers and spare the majority of normal T cells (Paul et al. Sci. Transl. Med. 2021). My goal is to conduct the preclinical validation of the T cell cancer targeting therapies so they can be tested in patients through early phase clinical trials. We hope that our novel therapies will provide new treatment options and improve survival in patients with T cell leukemias and lymphomas.

Markus M\u00fcschen, MD-PhD is Director of the Center of Molecular and Cellular Oncology and the Arthur H. and Isabel Bunker Professor of Hematology and Immunobiology at Yale University. Dr. M\u00fcschen's research leverages negative selection mechanisms of the immune system for the treatment of drug-resistant B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. In addition to protective antibodies, humans produce every day about 25 million \"rogue\" B-cells that express potentially harmful, autoantibodies that can cause autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. To prevent pervasive autoimmune disease, a powerful mechanism, termed \"negative selection\", is in place to eliminate autoreactive B-cells. Dr. M\u00fcschen's research group discovered that \"negative selection\" also removes malignant B-cells that would give rise to B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. His ongoing research leverages negative selection mechanisms as a new strategy for patients with B-cell malignancies. ImCheck Therapeutics is designing and developing a new generation of immunotherapeutic antibodies targeting butyrophilins, a novel super-family of immunomodulators. These \"first-in-class\" activating antibodies may be able to produce superior clinical results as compared to the first-generation of immune checkpoint inhibitors and, when used in combination, to overcome resistance to this group of agents.

His research and clinical activities are focused on the early stages of leukemia. Dr. Shlush and colleagues identified the human pre-leukemic stem cells and proved that a latent period in which stem cell acquire mutations exists. These preleukemic stem cells give rise to AML and other blood malignancies and can be identified years before diagnosis. Recently, his group was able to predict AML years before diagnosis by analyzing molecular signatures among healthy individuals. In this study specific mutations found among healthy individual predicted AML. Some of these mutations, specifically, in the spliceosome machinery can be targeted and we are now working on designing the clinical trials for AML prevention. Hello, I am Lucas Ferrari de Andrade and the principal investigator. I am from Brazil and with my wife we immigrated to the United States in 2014. We now have our two-year old son, born here in New York City. I worked for five years as postdoc at Harvard Medical School, where I developed a molecule that elicits potent anti-tumor immunity. Two years ago I started my own laboratory, to apply this molecule to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). My lab is very productive, in record timing we published our first research article. Our work is supporting a clinical trial by a pharmaceutical company, which does not financially support our lab and that will conduct the trial against solid tumors. Our research will show that AML can also be targeted. However, our research is having huge financial cost and we urgently need new awards to continue developing this potential treatment for AML. My scientific career has focused on the development of new molecules that can be used by doctors to treat cancer. Robert Z.

My laboratory is focused on determination of the role of DNA repair mechanisms in hematological malignancies, including the potential of therapeutic interventions. We found that leukemia cells accumulate potentially lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), but DNA repair mechanisms protect their survival. However, due to genetic, epigenetic and metabolomic aberrations leukemia cells may employ different DNA repair mechanisms than normal cells. We explore these differences to target leukemia-specific DNA repair mechanisms to achieve synthetic lethality in leukemia cells, with negligible effects on normal cells. These studies will lead to novel therapeutic approaches based on induction of personalized medicine-guided synthetic lethality in leukemias from individual patients.

My research is focused on understanding the genetic alterations in patients with these cancers. One of our main areas of interest is understanding the role of mutations in RNA splicing factors and developing means to target cells with these mutations therapeutically. Dr. Wong is an applied biostatistician with over 30 years of experience in cancer survivorship research and more recently in comparative- and cost-effectiveness studies. Since 2006, she has been part of the Long-Term Follow-Up Program at City of Hope which follows over 10,000 patients who received hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) there. She has analyzed and published results on the relationships between patient/disease characteristics and treatment exposures on outcomes (survival, complications, quality of life) in HCT survivors. She was the principal statistician in a study that examined racial difference in adherence to a 2-year daily oral maintenance therapy in children and adolescents treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and whether this variation could explain racial differences in outcomes. Dr. Wong's expertise extends to health services research. She examined the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of lifelong echocardiographic screening, recommended by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Guidelines, for early detection of asymptomatic heart failure in at-risk childhood cancer survivors. The study results helped revise the current COG Guidelines. She has been conducting a cost-effectiveness study of the COG Guidelines recommendation for breast cancer screening in chest-irradiated female Hodgkin Lymphoma survivors. Two manuscripts are in preparation. The findings will provide important information to help refine the COG Guidelines. Dr. Nimer has cared for patients with MDS, AML, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma for over three decades. This melding of clinical studies and care, with both basic laboratory and translational studies, reflects the fundamental focus of his career. Since coming to the University of Miami-Miller School of Medicine in 2012 and assuming the Directorship of the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, the center received the prestigious National Cancer Institute designation in July 2019. In November 2019, Dr. Nimer was named the inaugural Oscar de la Renta Endowed Chair in Cancer Research. He has been elected to the American Society of Clinical Investigators and the Association of American Physicians. He is a Fellow of the American College of Physicians and serves on the editorial board of several medical journals. In April 2021, Dr. Nimer was inducted into the Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine of Florida. Dr. Nimer is also the Chairman of the Myelodysplastic Syndrome Foundation, and the Chairman of the Medical Advisory Board of Gabrielle's Angel Foundation for Cancer Research. Dr. Justin Kline is an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago. Dr. Kline obtained his medical degree from the University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Medicine. Currently, he is a Hematologist/Oncologist specialized in the treatment of lymphoma. His clinical research interest is in developing immunotherapies for the treatment of lymphoma. Dr. Kline's laboratory research focuses on characterizing and overcoming barriers of immune resistance in blood cancers and on identifying biomarkers of immunotherapy response and resistance. As part of this research, Dr. Kline and his team develop strategies to reverse immune tolerance mechanisms in the laboratory that can be translated into early-phase clinical studies in humans. Dr. Lakshmi Nayak currently serves as Director of the Center for Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. She is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. She received her medical degree from Grant Medical College in Mumbai, India. She completed her residency at New York Presbyterian Hospital/ Cornell campus, and fellowship at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Her research includes development of novel therapies through preclinical and clinical studies for management of brain tumors including primary CNS lymphoma. She has developed several phase I and II trials using combination of molecular targeted agents and immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T cells for treatment of CNS lymphomas. She leads the international neurologic assessment in neuro-oncology (NANO) effort in collaboration with key leaders in neuro-oncology which led to the development of a standardized outcome-assessment scale to objectively evaluate neurologic function in patients with brain tumors. Dr. Jaehyuk Choi is an Associate Professor of Dermatology and of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. He received his A.B. in Biochemical Sciences from Harvard, and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale. He was a dermatology resident and a post-doctoral fellow in genetics at Yale. Since graduating from medical school, Dr. Choi is the recipient of the NIH New Innovator Award, the Damon Runyon Clinical Investigator Award, the Doris Duke Clinician Scientist Development Award, and is a recent inductee into the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Dr. Choi is a clinically active physician-scientist with a clinical and scientific focus on T cell lymphomas. His research group is interested in bench-to-bedside approaches to improve clinical care for patients with these diseases. To do so, he investigates the genetic mechanisms that underlie disease pathogenesis. This approach provides important clues as to what makes each patient unique and how to improve treatments for patients. Alex Kentsis is a pediatric oncologist and cancer biologist. He directs the Tow Center for Developmental Oncology at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where his research takes advantage of modern technologies to improve our understanding of the biologic causes of leukemias. Together with colleagues, he has made discoveries about new therapeutic targets in cancer cells, mechanisms by which cancer cells can evade new treatments, and improved strategies to overcome treatment resistance. Recently, his lab has identified new mechanisms of aberrant gene control and resistance to apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemias, and mechanisms of site-specific oncogenic mutations and DNA repair dependencies in human cancers. Combined with the development of new functional proteomic methods and therapeutics, this work is now poised to define precise molecular mechanisms that would lead to rational therapeutic strategies for patients.
