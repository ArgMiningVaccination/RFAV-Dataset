Your SP Detox Balance program delivers nutrients that activate enzymes required for Phase I reactions. It also supplies antioxidants that reduce stress on your body, such as tissue damage sometimes caused by these enzyme activities. Phase II: Neutralize The highly toxic substances produced in Phase I convert to non-toxic molecules and become even more water-soluble. Your SP Detox Balance program supplies key nutrients and amino acids needed to support Phase ll enzymes. These enzymes enhance the water solubility of toxins. Phase III: Eliminate Water-soluble toxins leave your cells, and your body eliminates them. Your SP Detox Balance program provides your body with plant-based fiber and water, which aid in toxin elimination. Your Program Based on the results of your toxicity questionnaire, your doctor will recommend either the 28-day or 10-day plan. You will follow a simple protocol that includes a tasty, all-in-one detox shake, supported by a basic meal, hydration, and exercise plan. Our goal is to help you feel your very best by supporting your body's natural ability to rid itself of toxins. Scoop. Mix. Enjoy. Depending on the day, you will drink one, two, or three delicious, nutrient-packed SP Detox Balance shakes. Just follow the daily shake schedule to determine how many shakes you need. Then, combine two heaping scoops of your SP Detox Balance powder with water (or other approved beverage), mix, and enjoy \u2014 morning, noon, or night. While this is not a meal-replacement shake, it could replace some food intake. Pay attention to your body's signals and adjust accordingly. What balanced looks like: - Fill your plate with healthy vegetables, fruits, grains, and lean meats, fish, or vegan proteins like legumes and nuts. - Achieve balance by following the outlined plate proportions and daily serving sizes for each food category. - Balance your macronutrients! The foods in your meal plan contain macronutrients \u2014 proteins, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Nourishment Guidelines Your SP Detox Balance meal plan is not meant to be restrictive.
