Summary of health -based guidance values for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances Introduction 1. The COT has previously considered per - or poly -fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on a number of occasions and has recently published a statement on the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) opinion \"Risk to human health related to the presence of perfluoroalky l substances in food\". The Committee is now asked to consider what further guidance can be provided to support human health risk assessments undertaken by UK Government Departments and Agencies. 2. An initial paper on further work on PFAS was discussed at th e October 2022 COT meeting (TOX/2022/53 ). This paper noted that a number of health -based guidance values (HBGVs) from other countries and international bodies are available for PFAS . In outlining a plan for a series of papers for COT consideration on PFAS, it was noted that a detailed review of available HBGVs would be useful. 3. This present paper contains a compil ation of HBGVs published worldwide by authoritative bodies and their derivations . Data s earches 4. A search for HBGVs published by authoritative bodies was carried out , including websites of authoritative bodies and chemical/toxicological information summary databases . Search terms included 'PFAS', 'perfluoro', 'polyfluoro', and related terms. Websites were accessed in September 2022. Searches were not 2 conducted using the individual PFAS chemical names unless th e presence of specifically relevant information was indicated within an identified data source. Exclusion criteria 5. Data listed pertain to standards set by national or international bodies; data from sub -national regions (for example, individual US states) are not included. This required dataset should exclude non -authoritative body data, for example REACH derived no -effect levels (DNELs). Results 6. HBGVs were identified 7), perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA ) (Table 8), group of per - and polyfluoroalkyl substances (GenX chemicals ) (Table 9) and mixtures of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and PF HxS (Table 10) and PFOS and PFHxS (Table 11). 7. Subchronic and chronic HBGVs were identified and included tolerable daily or weekly intakes (TDIs or TWIs), reference doses (RfDs), minimal risk levels (MRLs), chronic indicative toxicity value (iTVs), derived no -effect level (DNELs) and chronic toxicity reference value (TRVs) . 8. A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL), lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) or 95th lower confidence interval of the benchmark dose benchmark dose (BMDL) were determined as the point of departure (POD) prior to application of uncertainty factors (UFs) in order to derive the HBGV. Some organisations also used physiologically -based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling equivalent doses (HEDs (also ca lled HEQs )) as their POD. This is a preliminary paper for discussion.

However, as the chemical structure of PFOSA is very comparable to PFOS (the amide derivate of PFOS) and as PFOSA is used as a precursor for PFOS formation it was considered justifiable to apply the TDI for PFOS to PFOSA.
