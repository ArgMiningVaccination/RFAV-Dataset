Soltara will take amazing care of you. Maestra Karina and Maestra Maria-Julianna were the curanderas at my Playa Blanca retreat. I'm so grateful for their loving and compassionate care and skillful leadership with the plants. The \"Western\" Soltara facilitators were all highly experienced in their own right, all having many years of experience with ayahuasca and plant dietas, studying directly with the Shipibo in the Amazon. I understand this is required for all Soltara facilitators. This was my first experience with ayahuasca, and I was coming to the retreat with a lengthy list of worked on, yet unhealed, traumas trapped in my body. My ceremony experiences were brutal to say the least, but I felt safe and had amazing coaching and support throughout the week to get me through. The maloca is gorgeous and the bathrooms are directly connected. They have someone at the bathrooms guiding you to an empty room and keeping an eye out to make sure you return which was very helpful. There's also a security guard outside the maloca all night on ceremony nights which was so reassuring, if you stay past ceremony and eventually need help getting back to your accommodation in the middle of the night. There's also a facilitator on call on walky-talky all night if you need support. The food was also amazing - I still think about it. I'm very glad I went and can definitely see myself returning one day, perhaps to another location or perhaps to Playa Blanca.\" Highly Rated Traditional Chinese Medicine Retreats [](/events/1136-73/6-day-5-night-relax-in-nature-package) 6 Days Package Health & Wellness 6 Day/ 5 Night Relax In Nature Package Ama Tierra Retreat and Wellness Center San Pablo, Costa Rica From $1,395.00 5.00 [](/events/363-466/12-night-integrative-transportation-to-soltara-included) November 26 -

But it was the best think I did for myself. I am gonna bear fruit of this experience for a long time. The place is amazing, maestros and their ikaro is so strong. Facilitators are the most amazing people I met in my life, their hearts are pure and they are full of wisdom. I will be back for sure. Thank you very much Soltara.\" \"I would like to thank the Soltara team for an amazingly well organized retreat. We chose Sugar Beach site in Costa Rica, it was wonderful ! I would like to thank the Maestro and Maestra who did an amazing deep work allowing me to release lots of traumas. I am SO grateful ! Thank you \" \"As a physician i have experienced the struggle in treating refractory depression and/or anxiety. As a result I have become keenly interested in the use of psychedelics. After considerable research I decided to book a week with MycoMeditations. Although initially terrified, I had a profound mystical experience that is teaching me to trust my feelings and instincts more. i'm much more empathic and tactile with my patients and the reception has been favourable. my relationships overall are better both professionally and personally. The concierge experience was absolutely top notch. The villa staff were very good and the Myco staff were excellent . There is almost one facilitator/psychotherapist per tripper. I felt very safe and supported. I was exhausted at the end of this trip but yet emotionally lighter and certainly wiser. I was blown away by the power of the group therapy/integration sessions that occurred daily. They were emotional and insightful. The retreat leader Justin and the lead psychotherapist Gwen were brilliant and so warm in offering their knowledge and vast experience. It was fantastic. This is one of the best things i've ever done for myself. i'm going back again spring 2024 with several other trippers that i met on the february retreat. i look very forward to digging deeper with the same special people i tripped with in february.\" \"I have heard many good things about Robin and Darcy but still, I was so pleasantly surprised. If you want an expertly led ceremony that is perfect for those who are just wanting to get their toes wet and those who want to go very deep alike - this is for you. I felt safe, comfortably, loved, guided and at ease. I am still integrating and enjoying the learning I have received from that weekend. Highly recommended. \" \"I recently experienced a 5 day (3 ceremony) ayahuasca retreat at Soltara's Playa Blanca center. This was a life changing journey. There were 15 other participants supported by 4 experienced and humble facilitators and 2 gifted Shipibo healers, and many other support staff to make the experience a seamless one. The food was healthy and delicious, the beds are huge and comfortable, the scenery is magnificent and you can walk to a beautiful beach if you are fairly mobile person. The terrain is a little steep around the property but I kind of enjoyed that, because it was good exercise for me. There is a lot of integration support and the staff here really seam to care about each person and are very helpful. I highly recommend Soltara, Playa Blanca\" \"There are a lot of snazzy Retreat centers that try to weave opulence with experience, and maybe that works for some people. I personally like natural settings, cozy comforts and generally a deeper connection to the Earth. Star River Sanctuary is nestled in a mountainside forest, with geodesic structures that would make buckminster proud. The water is great, the gardens are luscious and even the cats that live there seem like they are in heaven. Best dreams ever. A perfect place for healing the mind, body and spirit.\" \"Robin embodies integrity and compassion. She carries an ancient light given to her by her spiritual peers. Honesty, humour, insight and love form her lantern. She will venture with you into the darkness, so that you may embrace the light. Her kindness has really helped in my healing.\" \"Darcy is called, not self appointed, to be a healer. He has a good heart and feelings of genuine compassion. My spirit is safe within his care. \" \"Life changing indigenous shipibo tribe ceremonies in clean, safe environment. Delta is also fantastic \" \"My experience at Sinchi Runa was truly so magical. The moment you enter you feel so safe and welcomed. They greet you with such a open heart and arms it feels like you have known them your whole life. They make something that can be so scary and uncomfertable feel okey. Like a big bubble of light covers you while you wander down the dark forest. I can truly recommend this place it is one of a kind. \" \"I attended a retreat in August of 2021 at Myco's Blue Marlin Location. I had a very specific intention that brought me to Myco and my experience was more than I had hoped for. I guess, in truth, it was exactly what I had hoped for - which is even more astounding. If you are reading this review you have likely done your own reading and investigation of psilocybin. My own experience squares with those who describe the transformative power of this medicine in the right setting with experienced/professional and compassionate support. The ownership and staff at Myco are getting amazing guest experiences as a direct result of their intention, ethos and experience. Guests are fully and individually supported in their personal journey while at the same time staff expertly leverages the group preparations and integrations. In short, they are doing it right and the results are a direct result. Guest health and safety are paramount and this shows up in every aspect of the experience. The post-retreat follow-up led me to a movement and meditation practice that has helped me integrate and hold the positive experience at Myco - it has become part of my life. Oh - The accomodations at the Blue Marlin were terrific, the staff effective and attentive and the food was great! The beach and the water are absolutely stunning - the perfect setting for this transformative experience. My morning swim in the bay each day was an important part of the experience along with the beautiful pelicans fishing in the bay - the backdrop to our integration. Many thanks to Justin, Abbie and the rest of the staff at Myco!!!\" \"My experience at Star River was fulfilling and was exactly what I needed. Robyn and Darcy are wonderful individuals full of light and wisdom. \" \"Experiencing the nature the jungle, Beautiful ceremony space. The space held in a way that allow me to be and explore myself in a simple and direct way, I like it, to have the space to dive in completely into myself and still felt safe to be there. Thank you Tata Mundo, Luis, and team Thank you for the beautiful Icaros and music held by Matilda and Francesco!! I'll forever be greatful... Hope and wish you the best with giving this gift to the world \" \"Cannot say enough good things about this place and the people. I am so grateful i chose this retreat! -Annie from colorado\" \"Soltara is life changing! From everything with the meetings/teachings, to the conversations, to the hang time and finally the ceremonies, Soltara provided in the fullest realm. The facility, facilitators and food is so worth the money and time. \" \"I don't even know where to start. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. The amenities are on par with the Ritz. Carlton and the staff is even better than the Ritz Carlton. And I mean all of the staff, from the cleaning crew to the landscaping crew to the kitchen staff, and most of all the facilitators. All of the facilitators were amazing, but in particular Will was my rock. I'm not going to lie, this is a very tough experience to go through so they made it as enjoyable as it could be. Kudos to Samantha for the way this place operates and the strongest of Kudos to The Rock (Will), Jude, Hector, Frieda and Stefania (Steph Phan E A). My Ayahuasca experience isn't important but each person has their experience. If I do Ayahuasca again it will be here and with Soltara.\" \"I would like to express my gratitude to the entire team that conducted this retreat. Wonderful people, gorgeous nature and swimming pool, the food is very tasty! This is an unforgettable experience that will always stay with me. I think I came back a different person. I saw and knew the universe and myself .. The experience was intense, long and mystical. It was difficult for me, but I'm glad I got through it. Thank you so much! With love Olesya \" \"It was a blessing to have attended the 10 day Shamanic Diet and Ayahuasca Retreat in June/July 2023. Much thanks, love and gratitude to the fantastic team at Sinchi Runa, Sanango our guide on the journey with the plants, Ananda, Arjuna, Mateo and Andrea, whose care and compassion create a safe space for each person attending to come into contact with themselves, through solitary immersion in nature and the deeply transforming experiences with plant medicine. Even though there was no verbal or eye contact with others and we kept to our own spaces during the diet by the end of the retreat there was a sense of unity as we had all gone through powerful experiences at the same time through the same method. Despite some challenges during my first retreat I would definitely do it again with the intention of deepening the transformational opportunity that such retreats can provide. I would say, if you truly seek a living, irrefutable event, either for healing purposes or remembering one's true self, or more accurately both, for they are in actuality inseparable; and you are willing to forego for a short time your creature comforts, Sinchi Runa will not disappoint. By creature comforts I mean the props of 21st century life which can and do divorce us from connection with Mother Nature, the cosmos and our true selves. The ayahuasca ceremonies were amazing and confirmed for me, through my own experiences during them that worlds other than the one we experience in everyday life exist and are real. We can have a strong conviction that such worlds exist and have a sense of them through our feelings, believe and gather evidence (primarily from the experiences of others) that such worlds exist but until we experience and see it for ourselves it remains unrealised. My feeling is that it is not something to be done lightly and requires a firm intention for venturing on such a journey but the possible rewards in terms of expanding the horizon of the inner world of oneself are great. Undoubtedly, with the help of the plants we get what we actually need, wherever we are on our journey.\" \"MycoMeditations created a safe and beautiful place where I was able to explore my inner self, desires, regrets, shortcomings, and future possibilities. Luckily I was able to find and choose there retreat over the others that I was looking into. I have no doubt that Myco provides the best there is to offer. With their experience, knowledge, and counseling the staff was able to help navigate my journey/experience so that I could learn about myself and grow. I am very grateful for my time spent there. I highly recommend and will be going back. Side note..the food is awesome!\" \"If you're doing this for the first time I believe Sinchi Runa is the best place, because they prepare you for this experience is the most calm, slow, careful way possible. It's not 4 nights as a lot of ayahuasca retreat are. It is 9 nights, with a lot of preparation for each ceremony. I'm trully thankful for people at Sinchi Runa for teaching me the art of meditation and surrender. These traits has changed the way I see myself and gave me an inner calmness that I've never had before. \" \"I recommend Playa Blanca without reservation for anyone exploring TAPM, especially first timers (like I was). Pros: The space is small, secluded, beautiful, and singular. The staff are amazing. Jesse and his team make great-tasting, healing food. Tatiana is a bright ray of sunshine whose purity and joy are contagious. She teaches lovely yoga and provides ancillary support. The facilitators are experienced, approachable, and accessible. Capacity is 21, which is the absolute most I'd recommend. It's small enough to really form a strong container. I'd also say with that many there's personal interaction, but not as much as I would have liked at times. If you need more than moderate support for your journey consider going where they work with smaller numbers. Cons: expensive overall. Unless you're hard core you're going to want a private room with AC and that's pricey at Soltara. I'm an outdoorsy person and I found that with the demands that TAPM makes on the body and mind it was an absolute must to have privacy and use of AC (temps were hovering in the low 100s during August). Travel to Playa Blanca- from San Jose it's a 2 hour van trip, then a 2 hour ferry ride, and another 30-45 minutes on class 4 dirt roads. Give yourself the gift of an extra night in San Jose on either end of your retreat. You'll be glad you did. \" \"I can't say anything better about this retreat. From the facilitators to the facility itself. It was a very beautiful property in the middle of the jungle with an incredible view of the ocean. I felt so supported each step of the way. The food was amazing and everything was explained and easy to understand. The group talks were so helpful and I felt surrounded by a like minded community, which made it easy to open up and be vulnerable. The rooms were cozy and the beds were incredibly comfortable. I had an open screen view to the jungle from my shower. Each day was filled with excitement and healing. I would rate Soltara a 10/10 and I would 100% return. I really feel like I got my moneys worth here. Thank you so much. \" \"Attending the La Mezquita Psychedelic Retreat Weekend was an extraordinary and life-changing experience. From the moment I arrived, I was welcomed into a warm and supportive community that felt like a second family. The setting of the retreat, nestled amidst the picturesque landscapes of Spain, provided the perfect backdrop for deep introspection and healing. The facilitators were not only knowledgeable but also genuinely caring, ensuring that every participant felt comfortable and prepared for their journey. The weekend was meticulously designed to create a balanced blend of group activities, personal reflection time, and the profound psychedelic sessions. These sessions, guided by experienced facilitators, opened doors to my inner world that I had never explored before. The music, ambiance, and expert guidance allowed me to navigate my thoughts, emotions, and experiences in a safe and nurturing environment. This holistic approach showed their commitment to not only providing a transformative experience during the retreat but also ensuring that the benefits ripple into my everyday existence. If you're seeking a profound journey of self-discovery, healing, and growth. I recommend La Mezquita . It's a truly unique opportunity to explore the depths of your consciousness, surrounded by a supportive community and guided by skilled professionals.\" \"Klara's presence, expertise, and compassion created a safe and nurturing environment for our journey. From the very beginning, Klara's deep understanding of psychedelics and their therapeutic potential was evident. She took the time to connect with each participant individually, ensuring that everyone felt seen and heard. Her knowledge about the substances, their effects, and their interaction with our personal journeys was impressive and comforting. Klara's guidance during the psychedelic sessions was truly remarkable. Her calm and soothing voice provided a sense of security and trust, allowing me to surrender to the experience fully. She skillfully navigated us through the depths of our consciousness, offering insights and support whenever needed. What stood out to me was Klara's dedication to integration. She emphasized the importance of integrating the experiences into our daily lives, helping us make sense of the insights gained during the retreat. Her post-retreat support and guidance were invaluable, as she continued to provide resources and tools to navigate the journey of integration.\" \"Soltara has thought of everything to make your experience the best it can possibly be. ALL of the staff are incredible human beings. The food is by far the best tasting and healthiest food I have had in my entire life. The plants/animals and scenery including the beach are extra magical. The ceremonies are done so perfectly and professionally that I felt beyond safe and comfortable the entire time, it allows you to truly relax and let go so you can get what you need. Soltara is very respectful to the medicine and tradition first and foremost which is very important. If you feel like you need to have this experience, then follow your intuition and go as soon as you can! \" \"Years of research about the potential benefits of psilocybin therapy for PTSD, and another year of research into the methods and practices of some of the world's premiere practitioners, led me to MycoMeditations. I was looking for a facility with stellar professionalism and top-notch facilitator credentialing where the therapeutic model is coupled with a scientific approach to best practices. And I wanted to situate myself in a location where psilocybin is legal for this purpose. As someone stepping into the experience with no history of using mood-altering substances (I don't drink, I don't smoke - heck, I don't even ingest caffeine!) it mattered to me to be in the company of licensed professionals whom I trusted to ensure my safety and comfort. MycoMeditations was a perfect choice for me. The facilitators' deep knowledge of psychotherapeutic methodology combined with an educated approach to psychedelics and a perceptive and gentle interpersonal style made for a welcoming, safe, and intellectually-stimulating experience. I learned much about myself and others, fostered deep connections, basked in a beautiful natural environment, and in every regard was well treated and cared for. The experience was not entirely easy, but it was good and enriching, and the positive outcomes far exceeded my expectations. I am remarkably glad I did this, and even happier I did it with MycoMeditations. I recommend them wholeheartedly. \" \"I experience some of the deepest feeling of love and strength while at Soltara. I watched my life do a complete 360 and every feeling of worry and self doubt dissipated quite quickly. I have had a life turning experience that is already paying off in large. I feel recharged, self confident, at peace within, and I feel a radiant energy coming from within my spirit I feel ready to take on all that life throws my way and that I can find a solution to any and every problem that presents itself. I feel beautiful, strong, wise, and fulfilled with the little pleasures in my life as a result. I feel a balance in my dopamine levels and my thoughts are crystal clear. I also feel that my front cortex is working properly again due to the rewiring that occured from the Ayahuasca. Thank you Mother Ayahuasca and many positive blessings to all that choose to go to Soltara. Your in good hands Trust the process, believe in your intentions and trust la medicina. \" \"I traveled to Jamaica for answers and guidance related to the death of my mother and sudden & tragic death of my husband one month later. I had tried mushrooms while in college and hadn't partaken since. For no reason other than inaccessibility. Jamaica has always held a special place in my heart and I have traveled there many times before. This time was different. I wanted answers and was open to anything that would provide relief. The staff at Myco are amazing. Real, genuine, and wholly knowledgeable about the medicine. The villa and surrounding scenery is beautiful. Thus, the setting was perfect. I got my answers and had the magical, connected experience I needed at the time. I continue to do the work stateside as the benefits of psilocybin can't be refuted. In a nutshell, my Myco Journey was life changing and has transformed the way I live and continue to pursue the answers I am seeking. I highly recommend this journey and hope, perhaps one day, to return as a facilitator myself. \" \"I had the most beautiful beautiful experience, the staff is caring and compassionate beyond belief...I felt safe and cared for every step of the way and the results were humbling.
