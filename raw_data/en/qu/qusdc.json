AI-related research and developmentinvolve high levels of interdisciplinary application-orientedtoolboxes, including machine learning, deep learning, ro- botics,gesture,facialexpression,andcognitiveandlanguage processing. In this way, each and every minute aspect ofbiological communication and expression patterns are usedas inputs to train the algorithm-based simulations withvarying degrees of complexity to support multipurposehuman necessities as required. ,\u00df_he concept of AI was rstformally dened at the Dartmouth Summer ResearchProject workshop in 1956 [1, 2]. Later in 1972, StanfordUniversity in California rst developed an AI-guided earlyexpertsystem,MYCIN,whichwasusedtotreatpatientswithblood infections based on the archived medical test results and reported symptoms [3]. ,\u00df_he application of AItechnologyintheeldofmedicinehasbeenbecomingmore extensive and detailed. In recent years, AI technology ndsitsextensiveapplicationsinalmosteveryaspectofhealthcareandalliedelds,suchasrobotics-mediatedcomplexsurgicalprocedures, robotics in high-throughput clinical diagnosisand therapy, telemedicine, developing universal codingsystems for exchange, storage, interpretation, and quickretrieval healthcare-associated information in an unin- terruptedand highlysecured way[4].Duringthe 1970sand 1980s, Chinese scholars attempted to combine AI tech-nologies with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for therst time to develop an AI-guided assistive diagnostic andtherapeutic system within the realm of TCM [5]. AI tech-nology has been found quite helpful to the TCM practi-tioners to promptly and precisely realize the optimizationand objectication of four diagnostic methods to providemore ecient clinical treatments and standardized healthmanagement[6-11].Despiterapidlyemergingtechnologicaladvances in the elds of data science and AI in healthcare, there has not been enough interest in modernizing TCMHindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2021, Article ID 6678958, 6 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6678958diagnosis and therapy with the help of AI-guided skills. In theera ofnext-generationtechnologicalbreakthroughs,itisof utmost importance to blend AI skills with TCM-basedtreatmentstrategiesmakingiteasilyacceptable,reliable,andaordable to all needing people to keep pace with the rapidadvancement of healthcare facilities worldwide. 2.AISystemoftheExperienceofFamousand VeteranChineseMedicine ,\u00df_hedevelopmentoftheTCMhasahistoryofinheritanceforoverathousandyears.Unequivocally,theknowledgesystemof the TCM has been highly enriched with invaluablepathological, clinical, and medical experiences of the pre- decessors and is continuously being updated with novel therapeutic information. Amongst the archived experiencesof TCM, the TCM-based clinical experience represents thetop-level diagnosis and treatment strategies for most dis-easesandacuteillnesses,whichreflectstheinheritanceoftheprofound wealth of knowledge over generations. Scholars have made substantial eorts to exploit the powerof AIinaggregating theexperience-basedknowledgefromtheverybeginningofTCMtothemodernerainorderto form a potentially influential and eective knowledgesystem that can facilitate modern-day treatments by re- trieving the information on the ancient Chinese medicine [5]. Functionally, AI can be trained on the desired humanexperiences through the databases to perform in dialecticalthinking mode mimicking human thought processes, whilesimultaneously it can also collect new information from thecontemporary diagnosis and treatment experiences toprovide more focused as well as highly enriched healthcaresolutions in a geographical location, ethnicity, and/or dis-ease-specicmanner.LiuFan[12]hasreportedtheutilityofthe knowledge mapping technology to analyze the retro-spective data of curative eects of the TCM in chronic gastritis treatments based on syndrome dierentiation, comparisons of prescribed medicines, and core symptomsby the groups of famous TCM practitioners, Drs. Yao Nailiand Zhang Runshun. ,\u00df_his analysis yielded four superiordiagnosis and treatment schemes in the form of knowledgemapping,furthersupportingthefactthattheapplicationsofAI in the TCM could eectively utilize the invaluable ex-periences of famous veteran TCM practitioners to providemore organized and precise diagnostic platforms. Further-more, the knowledge mapping technology is not only es-sential for building databases for the TCM-associated clinical diagnosis and treatment outcomes but also assists with the visualization and deep analysis of novel ideas andtherapeutic rules before their implementations. ,\u00df_he clinicalapplication of knowledge mapping can provide multiplepotential treatment options to the physicians based on thediagnostic results, thereby accelerating the treatment pro-cedures, which in turn will be automatically included in thedatabase if proven ecient, forming a virtuous circle. TCM scholars have been continuously digitizing the classic books of the TCM, literature on diagnosis andtreatment experiences, and physiological mechanisms,gradually forming for the TCM systemalongwithuser-friendlyandreliabledata-sharingplatforms. Moreover, Chen Qingwen [13] has developed an auto- matic diagnosis and treatment system based on neuralnetworktechnology.Byusingthissymptom-orientedsearchtool, physicians not only can promptly access important medical records to learn about the therapeutic outcomes of previously employed TCM in treating related diseases butalso are able to precisely execute e-prescriptions for rapiddistributiontorelevantdepartmentsandthepatientaswell.,\u00df_his system can immensely benet the physicians from allsectors to share and learn the experiences of expert TCMpractitioners in order to improve the overall diagnosis andtreatment standards of TCM. 3.AcupunctureandAI AccordingtothestatisticsoftheWorldHealthOrganizationandtheWorldFederationofAcupunctureandMoxibustionSocieties, acupuncture has been applied in 142 countries orregions by 2002. In recent years, wide acceptance of acu-puncture as a highly eective noninvasive therapeuticplatform has made it possible to amend the medicalguidelines to include acupuncture as a standard medicalpractice worldwide, which in turn has been attracting thelong-term interests of the healthcare industry to commer-cialize acupuncture globally. Moreover, with the help of the web-based learning tools, acupuncture \"cloud lecture\" has been educating people globally about its wide ranges ofapplications in treating almost all types of diseases in anoninvasive way and without worrying about long-termharmful side-eects, giving this therapy an internationalrecognition and popularity [14]. Hence, it is obvious thatblending acupuncture therapy with AI technologies willfurther improve the diagnostic precision and treatmentoutcomes at international standards. ,\u00df_he robot-controlledacupuncture (RCA) technology [15] has been developed bythe Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Tainan National Cheng Kung University, to investigatethetherapeuticeectsofacupuncturefromthreebroad perspectives: (1) localization of the acupuncturepoints, (2) timely robot arm activation for the acupuncturepointstimulation,and(3)AI-guidedautomaticdetectionoftherapeuticecacyofacupuncturepointstimulation.Todoso, an automatic acupuncture system was established with a2D monocular camera and a robotic arm determining thedegree of Qi gain by real-time monitoring of electroen-cephalographic(EEG)changes.Notably,RCAfocusesonthemost challenging aspects of facial acupuncture point lo- calization using a 3D morphable model (3DMM) for reconstructing subject's 3D facial model precisely labeledwith acupuncture points by following the sequential steps:facial image capture, labeling the facial acupuncture points,merging into an Isomap texture, and loading the 3DMMtexture along with the average model into 3D graphicssoftware to perform the precision facial acupuncture. In-deed, medical robots can perform these tasks with muchhigher accuracy than humans, allowing acupuncturists tolocate hard-to-reach acupuncture points with the help of2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicineRCAandmakethemgettheiressentialQienergy[16-19].It is worth mentioning that combining acupuncture withmodern medical technologies and AI tools can signicantlyreducethecontroversyofacupuncturesafetyissuesseriouslyconsidered in Western countries. Moreover, these inter-disciplinary approaches have prompted international medical research on acupuncture technology to develop advanced methods such as purple laser acupuncture,two-color laser needles, and ultra-thin permanent needles[20-23]. However, there are still shortcomings in acu-puncture machine-based research, such as the design of themachine model which is relatively simple yet without theincorporation of rened features and also remains unsuit-able for deep treatments. In future research, traditionalmachine learning algorithms containing clustering algo-rithms,the law of association algorithms, and deep learningalgorithms ofneural network class should be combined and extended to build targeted predictive models to mine sig- nicantidentifyingfeatures,whichhavepositiveimpactsonachieving higher accuracy in treatment prediction foracupuncturetherapy[24].Increasingtherapeuticmeansandapplications of acupuncture have enhanced the ecacy ofthe simple acupuncture methods providing the impetus forthe modernization of this therapeutic platform. 4.AI's\"PreventiveTreatmentof Diseases\"Thinking ,\u00df_he idea of \"preventive treatment of diseases\" from the Yellow Emperor's Canon of InternalMedicine [25] during the Spring and Autumn period andWarring States periods, representing the highest level ofphysicians. ,\u00df_he idea has three meanings: rst, to preventillness before it occurs; second, to discover signs and earlytreatment; and third, to prevent changes after the illness.,\u00df_hroughthewisdomofsuccessivegenerationsofphysicians,the theory of \"preventive treatment of diseases\"has becomeincreasinglyandreasonablyacceptable.Inthecase,wewant to aware our community about any upcoming disease outbreaks or keep our community under constant healthsurveillance. We need to aggregate the big data and employAI technologies to collect and analyze people's health rec-ordsonalargescale.XiaShujieetal.[26]have analyzedthehealth management model of \"preventive treatment\" usingAI to establish a key technical model and have summarizedthe process into three steps: rst, collecting macro-, meso-,and microhealth data; second, applying AI, such as Ada Boost, neural networks, and fuzzymathematicstoconstructthestateidenticationmodel;and nally,interveningintothestatetoevaluateandsummarize thedynamicstoarriveatthebestinterventionsolutionwiththe help of AI. By virtue of AI, Snowy Technology [27] hasdigitized the ancient methods of pulse diagnosis in TCMinto an AI-guided user-friendly system, like a health-tracking watch, for heart-brain function monitoring bycollecting data on heart rate, blood pressure, and othereectiveindicatorsandanalyzingthehealthstatusof14vitalorgans in the human body, which are essential to evaluatetherisklevelsofcardiovascularandcerebrovasculardiseasesin real-time. Chinese medicine believes that the develop-ment of disease follows specic transmission laws, so AItechnology will provide strong support for \"preventivetreatment of diseases\" in the future. 5.TuiNaMassageRobot ,\u00df_here have been crucial concepts about the importance ofmassagetherapyintheTCM,e.g.,theYellowEmperor'sClassicof Internal Medicine by Ling et al. [28] which has mentionedthat \"the meridians are not clear, diseases are born in theunkindness,andtheyaretreatedbymassage,\"andLuo[29]hasstated that \"massage method can dredge the hair orices andcan transport the rotation of glory and health.\" Practically, themain function of Chinese massage therapy is to dredge themeridians, harmonize Qi and blood, and improve immunity.,\u00df_he application of AI in Tui Na massage therapy is in the preliminary stage, and researchers have been continuously working to develop highly intelligent massage equipment orrobotics based on Tui Na protocol to improve its ecacy andsafety. Based on the passive impedance control technology,Huang et al. [30] and others have developed a four-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robotic arm with complete elasticjointsprogrammedwiththeTCMmassagetechniquessothatitcan implement the corresponding prioritization techniquesaccordingtotheindividualsymptom,realizingtheeectivenessof the combination of AI and traditional therapeutic methods.Intelligentsystems forTuiNamassage canprovidea wealthof functions, but their high cost and bulky structure make them dicult to apply widely. To overcome these diculties, Wanget al. [31] have introduced a portable back massage robot thatcan implement three dierent massage techniques, namely,percussion,rolling,andkneading,onthehumanback,andalsoproposedaneectivefull-coveragepathplanningalgorithmforbetter outcomes. Eventually, the proposed eective algorithmcanimprovethecoverageofthemassageareaandalsoenhancethe massage eects, as demonstrated by the path planningexperiments. Notably, the utilization of massage robots israpidlyincreasingwithhigherprecisioninmassagetechniques, which makes thephysicians availablefor more criticalmedical services and brings convenience for rational allocation ofmedical resources as well. However, the flexibility of massagerobots in the treatment of syndrome dierentiation still needsto be improved. It can be considered from the dynamicanalysis. For example, adding a series-parallel hybrid structureto the design of the Tui Na robot may be useful to achieve theflexibility of pushing, kneading, pressing, and rolling tech-niques while still having sucient stiness and precision. Infuture investigations, we need to learn and analyze criticalaspects from ergonomicsto design high-performancemassage robots with improved control, sensing, and other essential features [32]. 6.QigongIntelligence With the continuous improvement of the quality of life,people are increasingly pursuing \"green and harmless\"treatment methods. Amongst the TCM methods, Qigongtherapy has begun to receive attention in recent years.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3Qigong requires the right coordination between breathing, bodyposture,movement,andconsciousnessasthemeanstoachievebodystrengthinordertopreventandtreatdiseases.In the state of Qigong, the body's Qi forms directionalmovements through the electrical conduction between themeridians and conduction organs, which strengthens the bioenergy of the human body and signicantly increases physiological functions. Modern medical techniques can demonstrate Qigong breathing characteristics by dening disease-related vitalbreathing patterns through machine learning techniques.Combining Qigong breathing characteristics with uniquepathologies can provide AI-guided medical interventionsusing treatment index [33-35] collected using AImonitoring to summarize the specic breathing character-istics of Qigong to guide patients to stay healthy. Qigong assessment of respiratory health combined with associated therapies and biomarkers like dening VSI can be useful inestablishing tracking patterns for long-term health care. AIsummarizes the experimental results of Qigong therapy,suggesting its influences in enhancing cellular activity,boosting immune function, improving central sensitizationresponses, and delaying organ aging through respiratoryregulation, and constantly complements the functions ofQigong when applied to dierent patients. In addition, AIcritically analyzes Qigong's eects in the cellular microen-vironment,suchasmodulationofmechanosensingbetweensubcellular organelles within tissues to achieve therapeutic purposes [36]. ,\u00df_hus, AI provides more possibilities for Qigong to assist clinical treatment and nursing. 7.TheBottleneckofTCM TreatmentIntelligence TCM is an intricate and comprehensive discipline thatinvolvesawiderangeoftopics.,\u00df_hediagnosisandtreatmentmethods of the TCM are based on the physician's knowl- edge and experience levels in judging the patient's patho- logical signs and underlying conditions, which have certainsubjective elements. ,\u00df_he basic theories of the TCM diag-nosis and treatment come from abstract theories, such asYing Yang and ve elements, six meridians, and eightprinciples, which have not been widely recognized by in-ternational medical practitioners. ,\u00df_herefore, blending withAI, the scientic and objective nature of the TCM can beenhanced,making itgloballyapplicable andaordable.,\u00df_hedevelopment history of the combination of AI withhealthcare is only over fty years, while the intellectuali- zation of the TCM is still in its initial stage. Currently, the qualityoftheTCM-associateddatahasnotreachedtheideallevel, and also, the amount of curated data in the system isrelatively small, making it dicult to build a standardizedand well-correlated model. As per the essence of the TCM, the treatment plan changes according to the patient's disease symptoms.,\u00df_herefore,properapplicationofAItopredictthesymptomsis crucial in the diagnosis and treatment process. Sincediseases can be diagnosed in dierent stages ofadvancements and also there is a one-to-many correlationpattern between diseases and syndromes, how to combinethe AI application with therapeutic experiences for objec-tively and scientically accurate syndrome prediction in theTCM is an open-ended question and also the major chal-lenge for the development direction of AI-guided TCM in thefuture.Itisbelievedthatbycollectingandanalyzingdata from a large number of samples from dierent diseases andsyndrome types, the establishment of the disease-syndromemodelcanbeachievedtowardanintelligentTCMdiagnosisand treatment system. In the process of intelligent development of the TCM treatment, there are many ethical issues that need to beproperly resolved, such as the determination of responsiblesubjectsformedicalaccidents,theimpactontheauthorityofdoctors'diagnosisandtreatmentskills,andtheprotectionofpatients' privacy. ,\u00df_herefore, it is extremely necessary to establish and improve the relevant laws and regulations to protectthefundamentalrightsandinterestsofbothdoctorsand patients. ,\u00df_he insucient talent pool of interdisciplinary expertise severely limits the development of AI in the TCM eld. Infact, intelligent treatment of the TCM is related to diversescienticelds,suchasChinesemedicine,computerscience,statistics,biology,androbotics.,\u00df_herefore,theformationofacomposite talent team covering multiple elds, disciplines,and specialties is the basic requirement to guarantee thesuccessful development of the intelligent TCM system. Duetothelackofstandardized protocols and basicdata in the development of the AI-guided TCM system, morediagnostic investigations have been performed than actualtreatment methods, with relatively few clinical applications[37, 38]. Presently, the existing AI systems have a singlealgorithm and lack a shared coding system, resulting in thedevelopment of less accurate AI-TCM systems that are notsuitable for practical applications [39, 40]. ,\u00df_he possibilitiesfor secured and transparent sharing of medical the rapid intellectualization of the TCM [41]. 8.Outlook ,\u00df_he combination of the TCM treatment methods and AItoolboxes provides a modern data support system for ar-chiving the TCM experiences on diagnosis and treatmentmethods and their dialectic analyzes, as well as theTCM-based clinical thinking to provide intelligent thera-peutic solutions. Notably, this combinatorial approach hasgone through the three stages of development, namely, the TCM intelligent assistance, the TCM robotics, and the wisdomoftheTCM.Atpresent,itisintheAI-assistedstage,forfurtherdevelopment.,\u00df_herefore,itisnecessarytocollect,collate, and analyze a large amount of the TCM treatmentdatabyincreasingitsclinicalapplicationstoprovidequalitydata facilitating the research and development of the TCMintelligent projects, which eventually include the develop-ment of the all-purpose robotics integrating various ther-apeutic experiences and technologies of centralizedmedicine to simulate dialectical thinking. It can prescribe4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinesymptomatic medications and also cooperate with precise acupuncture, massage, physiotherapy, and other aspects oftreatmenttoachievesatisfactorypatientoutcomes.Withtheapplication of large numbers of TCM-programmed robots,the complete course of a patient's initial diagnosis, diseasetransmission, and prognosis can be accurately recorded, including the patient's successive follow-ups to provide long-term and reliable data for in-depth pathological in-vestigations. In the process of realizing the synchronousdevelopmentofproduction,teaching,andresearch,itbringscontinuous eorts for the intelligent development of TCM.
