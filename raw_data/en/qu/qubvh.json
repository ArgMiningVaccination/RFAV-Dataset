(Skip) Smith , Baze University CASE OVERVIEW This case invites students to play the role of Ms. Christiana Akpunonu , a Nigerian who worked for more than 30 years at Radio Nigeria and, at the time of this case, had the role of deputy director in charge of news, marketing, and programs for Radio Nigeria's Enugu National Station. At one time, Radio Nigeria had a monopoly on broadcast industry in Nigeria; however, in August 1992, private sector individuals and corporate bodies were allowed to establish radio stations in Nigeria. Almost immediately, competition emerged not only in Lagos but also in all major markets in Nigeria, including Enugu, the former administrative capital of the eastern region of Nigeria. In response to t he newly emerging competition, R adio Nigeria stations all across the country (including Enugu) found themselves havin g to compete, for the first time, for audience and market share. At this time, th e executive director in ch arge of Radio Nigeria's Enugu National S tation called Akpunonu to his office and charg ed her with developing a strategy to be executed within the next four months, so as to protect the audience and market share of R adio Nigeria's Enugu National Station. The challenge to R adio Nigeria stations all across the country (including the Enugu National Station) was made more severe by the fact that some of the newly emerging private radio stations were far better equipped than the Radio Nigeria National S tations and that it appeared that all of the radio stations (including the new ones) were competing for exactly the same radio audience. CASE SYNOPSIS Ms. Christiana Akpunonu, Deputy D irector in charge of news, marke ting and programs at Radio Nigeria's Enugu N ational S tation, has been charged by her Executi ve Director to develop a strategy to ensure that th e Enugu National S tation manage s to compete successfully for audience and mar ket share against new private radio stations which ha ve emerged as a result of the August 1992 deregulation of the broadcast industry in Nigeria. Additional data and information in the case include: 1) For Nigeria, the Nigerian environment , and the Nigerian economy : Historical background plus selected statisti cs. 2) For the broadcast industry in Nigeria: Historical background plus selected data and statistics. 3) For the Enugu National Station of R adio Nigeria : Historical background plus selected data and statistics. 4) For Eastern Nigeria (that is, the markets served by the Enugu National Station of Radio Nigeria): Background information on the region, the inha bitants, and some of the characteristic attitudes and behaviors of those inhabitants. THE SITUATION Sensing that h er meeting with the Executive Director of Radio Nigeria's Enugu National Station was ending, Ms. Christiana Akpunonu, Deputy D irector in charge of news, market ing, and programs at the Enugu National Station of R adio Nigeria, gathered up her notes. Although Page 2 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 she might, later on, need specific inf ormation from those notes, Akpunonu knew she would have no trouble remember ing the challenge the Executive Director had given her , that is , to identify (within the next 120 days) a strategy to retain and grow Enugu National S tation's au dience and market shar e, against the new private -sector broadcasters who have popped up in response to the August 1992 deregulation of the broadcast industry in Nigeria. Because she knew that some of the new private radio stations were better funded and better equipped, Akpunonu believed that developing a winning strategy would be a serious challenge. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (1 ): THE COUNTRY The Federal Republic of Nigeria is a large (one tenth the landmass of the United States) country in West Africa. Administratively, Nige ria is composed of 36 states plus the F ederal Capital Territory (FCT). These states differ in many ways, one of which is that the terrain ranges from beaches and swamps in the south to desert conditions in the north. Levels of education and income tend to be higher in the south than in the north. The dominant religion in the north is Islam while the south is predominantly Christian. Hausa is the dominant ethnic group in the north; in the east, the dominant group is the Igbo, while the west is predominantly Yoruba. A small set of statistics on Nigeria, together with comparative data for the United States , are as indicated below: NIGERIA USA Size (square kilometers): 923,768 9,826,675 of Different Languages officially, 250; unofficially, up to 500 major languages include English, Spanish, and French Religions: Muslim 50% Christians 40% All Others 10% Christian 78% Jewish 2% All Others 20% Median Age: 19.2 36.9 Life Expectancy at Birth: 52 years 78.5 years Fertility Rate (births per woman): 5.38 2.06 Infant Mortality Rate: 74/1000 6/1000 School Life Expectancy: nine years 16 year % Of Pop ulation Who Are Literate: 68% 99% GDP (purchasing power parity, or PPP): $15.04 trillion GDP per capita (PPP): $2600 $48,100 % of Population Below 70% 15% Page 3 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Poverty Line: Unemployment Rate: 21% 9% Electricity Consumption: 18 billion KWH 3.741 trillion KWH % Of Population In Urban Areas: 50% 82% % of Population Internet users 26% 78% Kilometers of 193,000 6,506,204 15% 67% Source: CIA World Factbook 2013 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (2 ): HISTORICAL OVERVIE W OF THE ECONOMY Historically, Nigeria produced large amounts of agricultural products incl uding (in the North) groundnuts and (in the south) palm oil. In the early 1950s, however, oil was discovered in Nigeria and slowly but steadily, Nigeria became an oil monoculture. By the late 1970s, oil selling at $40 per barrel was generating large amounts of money for Nigeria . At this time, t he Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) made huge investments in roads, bridges, and buildings for the public sector (admi nistrative buildings, housing estates, apa rtments, etc.). The FGN also invested huge amounts of money in a large number of \"showcase projects,\" including steel mills, paper plants, expensive hotels, and a new federal capital city called Abuja. Many peopl e moved to the oil areas, the project areas, and/or the large cities, hoping to find jobs in the oil sector, work on the private/public projects financed by petrodollars, and so on. As a consequence of the large inflows of cash and the changing opportuniti es available in Nigeria, agriculture and agricultural production were badly neglected. By the early 1980s, agricultural exports had nearly disappeared, and Nigeria no longer produced enough food to feed itself. The shortfall in food production w as made u p by importing large amounts of food , including both traditional staples and alternative foodstuffs such as wheat. In the early 1980s , the price of oil collapsed; o ver the next 10 years, the price was in the range of $10 -$20 per barrel. The annual impact of this price collapse depende d on the level of production; h owever, it is probably correct to say that during this period, each decrea se of one dollar in the price of a barrel of oil reduced Nigeria's export earnings by at least $700 million per year. O ver the decade of the 1980s, the total revenue loss for Nigeria from oil price decreases undoubtedly exceeded $70 billion. It took years for the impact on the Nigerian economy of the drying up of the oil revenues to fully manifest itself. The first econom ic consequences, caused by the shortage of foreign exchange, were the scaling back of the importation of big -ticket consumer items (for example, new cars) . Subsequently , manufacturing activity relying exclusively on importe d equipment, raw materials, and/ or supplies began to suffer. For companies in these industries, the co st of imported equipment, spare parts , raw materials, and supplies increased sharply, as large amounts of local currency chased an ever shrinking pool of hard currencies including dolla rs. The increased cost of overseas materials led many industries to substitute local materials for imported ones (for example, brewers of beer substituted locally -grown sorghum for imported malt). Companies not able to find local substitutes increased pr ices, downsized their operations, or dropped out of business entirely. Page 4 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 The drying up of oil revenues had additional negative effects on the quality of life and economic activity in Nigeria. Over time, basic services like roads, electricity, water supply, and telecommunications began to deteriorate. By the late 1980s, neither industrial nor residential customers relied exclusively on public service providers for electricity or water. Instead, both groups had invested vast amounts of money in b ack-up gener ators In addition, because Nigeria's hardwire phone equipment barely functioned due to severe overloads and lack of maintenance, numerous business persons invested large amounts of money first in dedicated radi o/microwave links and later, cellular telephone equipment. The need to make such investments increased the cost of doing business in Nigeria, and dramatically reduced the international competitiveness of Nigerian products and industry. Another effect of t he tremendous decrease in oil revenues was a very substantial increase in corruption. Due to the revenue decreases, federal, state, and local governments in Nigeria were unable to pay public sector employees. As prices of goods and services containing imported materials incr eased (most products sold in Nigeria are either manufactured overseas or include overseas components and/or materials ), and as public -sector salaries fell or went unpaid, civil service and public sector employees searched for alternati ve sources of funds to maintain their standards of living. Ultimately, many public -sector employees started demanding bribes before they would act on requests for service by individual and/or corporate customers. By the late 1980s, Nigeria (and especiall y its international a irport in Lagos, Murtala Muhammed Airport) had acquired the reputa tion of being both lawless and corrupt. For most of the decade of the 1980s and much of the decade of the 1990s as well , Nigeria was a military dictatorship. While mili tary dictatorships tend to be harsh, it must be said that from 1993 unt il the middle of 1998 the military dictatorship led by General Sani Abacha was particularly harsh and oppressive. During these years, the country of Nigeria became quite isolated inter nationally, as more and more countries backed away from Abacha and his regime. In June 1998, General Abacha died of a heart attack. In an extraordinary chain of events, Nigeria moved quite rapidly from being an outcast country under a military dictatorshi p to a democracy. In the first presidential elections, held in 1999, former general (and, under Abacha, prisoner) Olusegun Obasanjo, running on a platform which promised to tackle corruption and other major problems faced by Nigeria, was elected president. While Obasanjo's efforts to address the country's problems and move Nigeria forward met with limited success, Obasanjo was reelected to a second term in 2003. In 2007, however, when Obasanjo attempted to change Nigeria's constitution so as to be allowed to contest for a third term, the Nigerian Senate refused to support that change. Subsequently, Obasanjo stepped down and was replaced, as president of Nigeria, by Yar' Adua, a former governor of the northern Nigerian state of Katsina. For several years, Yar' Adua had been plagued by rumors of ill -health. The rumors were accurate: It turned out that he suffered from a kidney condition. Shortly before the presidential election (21 April 2007), Yar' Adua flew to Germany for medical treatment; on 23 Novem ber 2009, he flew to Saudi Arabia for additional medical treatment. Yar' Adua did not return to Nigeria from Saudi Arabia until 24 February 2010; at that time there was speculation that he was being kept alive using life support equipment. Yar' Adua die d on 5 May 2010 and (according to Islamic rites) was buried on 6 May 2010; that same day, Vice President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan was appointed President of Nigeria. In 2011, President Jonathan campaigned for re-election and in April 2011 he was (with 59% of the votes) re -elected President of Nigeria. As indicated above, since the last days of the decade of the 1990s, military dictatorship has been replaced by democratic governance. Along with the m ove to democracy, there was a Page 5 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 move in Nigeria toward pri vatization and a more market -oriented approach to managing the economy . During the decade starting in 2000, there were some huge private sector success stories in Nigeria; one of these was the telecoms industry and especially the rise of MTN, a provider o f cell phone services in much of sub -Saharan Africa including Nigeria. In January 2001, MTN purchased its first GSM license in Nigeria ; at that time the company had a subscriber base of zero. By the end of 2008, however, MTN had a customer base in Nigeri a of mor e than 20,000,000 subscribers; that base has now expanded to more than 100 million customers. Nigerians have been very eager to purchase cell phones and use cell phone service; companies such as Cadbury Nigeria, Nestl\u00e9 Nigeria, and Unilever Nigeri a (that is, companies which sell foods, beverages, and personal care items including soap and laundry detergent) have discovered that individuals with very low levels of disposable income (70% of all Nigerians are in this category) are very likely to reduc e their purchases of foods, beverages, and personal care items, so as to be abl e to afford to purchase air time for their cell phones. There is at least one additional economic development which must be mentioned. After Nigeria moved to democratic governa nce in 1999, and continuin g until up through 2008 , the average price of a barrel of oil increased most years, as indicated below: YEAR AVERAGE PRICE OF A BARREL OF OIL 2000 $27.39 2001 $23.00 2002 $22.81 2003 $27.69 Source: InflationData.com Because Nigeria had been producin g (prior to the worsening of an insurgency in the Niger Delta) somewhere in the range of 2 mil lion barrels of oil per day, an increase in the price of a barrel of oil has had (and continues to have) a huge positive impact on the revenues of the Federal Government of Nigeria. The good news i n the above figures is that for years Nigeria has benefited fr om a steady increase in the value of each barrel of oil produced. While the lower average oil price s starting in 2009 had massive negative implications not just for the Federal Government of Nigeria and its budgets but for the country and its p eople as well, the other good news for Nigeria in the data shown above is that the average price of a barrel of oil is now (that is, today) quite close to the all -time high annual average of $91.48 in 2008. Page 6 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (3): EASTERN NIGERIA AND ITS PEOP LES In 1914, the Briti sh combined two protectorates ( the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and the Oil Rivers Protectorate) to create the colony (now country) called Nigeria. By the time of independence (01 October, 1960) Nigeria had been divided into thre e administrative regions: Eastern Nigeria, Western Nigeria , and Northern Nigeria. Regarding the geography and topography of the area once known as \"Eastern Nigeria\": While Eastern Nigeria makes up a relatively small portion of the total land area of Ni geria, the vegetation and topography is quite varied. The southernmost tip of Eastern Nigeria merges with the ocean ; as one moves north, there is a 10 -40 mile area of low -lying mangrove swamps and tidal waters. As one moves further north, the next 100 mi les is dominated by tropical rain forest; after that, in the northern -most part of the region, there are grasslands. In the eastern part of Eastern Nigeria there is a r ange of hills that run to the foothills of Cameroon; in this area, elevations can be a s high as 5000 feet. Regarding the current political and administrative characteristics of Nigeria: The three administrative regions in place at independence (Northern Nigeria, Western Nigeria, and Eastern Nigeria) have now been divided up into 36 state s plus a Federal Capital Territory. The area once known as \"Eastern Nigeria\" has been divided into and Rivers. Regarding the peoples of the area onc e known as \"Eastern Nigeria\": While there are a very large number of tribes in the ten states of Nigeria formed from what used to be known as \"East ern Nigeria,\" the dominant ethnic group in this region is the Igbo. The Igbo dwell primarily in urban areas, especially the cities of Enugu (formerly, the capital of the Eastern Nigeria), Owerri, Onitsha (a political and commercial center), and Aba (also commercial ly vibrant). Other major tribes in the region include the Ibibios, Efiks, and the Ijaws. People in all of these tribes (the Igbo as well as the others listed above) have the reputation of being exceptionally enterprising, hard-working , and resourceful. Regarding broadcast -related attitudes, behaviors, and preferences, Ms. Akpunonu had (at the time sh e was give n the assignment by the Executive Director) very little information available t o her. Items she did have available to her included the sort of information shown in Exhibit #1 and Exhibit #2 , that is, (i n Exhibit #1) information on some characte ristic attitudes and behaviors of Nigerians in general and (i n Exhibit #2) information on some characteristic attitudes and behaviors of Igbos in particular. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (4) THE BROADCAST INDUSTRY IN NIGERIA Radio broadcasting in Nigeria d ates back to December 1932 when the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) set up (under the Department of Posts & Telegraphs) an experimental radio transmission of the Empire servi ce from Daventsy, in the UK. The main feature of this system (called the Radio Diffusion System, or RDS) was to receive (in Nigeria) the overseas service of the BBC and to rebroadcast that serv ice to loudspeakers in Nigeria. By 1935, the RDS system had spread from Lagos Island to Ikoyi, Ebute -Metta and Apapa (that is, several surrounding areas) with a total of about 500 loudspeakers at various official residences and offices. In 1939, the public relations office of the RDS (it later became the Federal Information Department) began providing RDS with small amounts of indigenou s programming generated in Nigeria . After the second world war, the RD S saw a period of expansion; from the 1940s to the Page 7 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 mid-1950s , rediffusion became the principal form of broadcasting in Nigeria. During that period, services were extended not only to Lagos but also to several other large cities and towns. Recognizing the strong role radio communication would play in economic, poli tical, and colonial development, Britain set up a commission \"to determine broadcasting needs and report on methods of devel opment and whether the existing facility should be incorpora ted in any proposed new scheme.\" From the recommendation of this commission of inquiry, the colonial government decided to conv ert the RDS scheme into a full -fledged system of national and region al broadcast s. In response to a request from the colonial government, the BBC provided two experts to help train Nigerian s: Mr. T.W. Chalmers (in charge of programming) and Mr. John W. Murray (in charge of technical services ). The charge to these two expa triates was: \" to integrate the existing and expanding network of wire broadcasting stations and build a broadcasting system which would enable people in any part of the country to hear news, entertainmen t, and talks.\" Messrs. Chalmers and Murray began sta ff recruitment and training immediately; the result w as the formation (on April 1, 1951) of the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS). At this time, the NBS embarked on development of a regional/national system; according to Mackay (1964) \"the emphasis was on regional consciousness, development, responsibility and the . . . Nigerian broadcasting service would have to satisfy these aspirations without losing sight of the main purpose and vision in the basic idea of \"One Nigeria.\" As the NBS evolved, it began to be perceived (in the eyes of the public) as a tool of the federal government which (in its operations) tended to disadvantage the regions. On August 23 1954, the l ate Alhaji DS Adegbenr o introduced a motion in the Nigerian parliament \"to set up a corpo ration to take over the activities of the NBS , in order to address criticism by the press that the NBS is an organ of the Nigerian gov ernment.\" On April 1, 1957, under A ct 39 of 1956 , the NBS was reconstituted as the Nigerian Broad casting Corporation (NB C). T he same day, Mr. JAC Knott (OBE) , Director General of the newly founded NBC, in a talk on Radio Nigeria, indicated that \"one of the most important aspects of the NBC is that it has no politic s of its own. This political im partiality stems directly fr om the nature of its Constitution which d oes not serve any private interest and is not directly controlled by the government of the day. The NBC is under an obligation to give its listeners news that is objective and without political bias and to ensure th at over the whole ra nge of its programs, political comment is fair and balance d. In addition, the ordinance lays specifies that the NBC must be free from commercial advertisement or interest . . .\" The division of the country into regions det ermined NBC 's initial structure, in the sense that programs for the different regions reflected the particular culture, characteristics, and needs of the area served. By 1961 the broadcasting facilities up and running in the federal and regional capitals included a s hort and a medium wave station in Lagos, a short and a medium wave station in Enugu, a short and a medium wave station in Ibadan, and a medium wave station in Kano. As indicated earlier, Nigeria now consists of 36 states plus a Federal Capital Territory (FCT); a s these states were created, NBC es tablished stations in each of them . This brought about an increase in the number of Nigerian language s used on NBC's national programs. On June 1, 1978, t he NBC was abolished and replaced by an organization call ed the Federal R adio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) . The decree establishing FRCN centralized radio broadcast and restructured the indust ry; part of the change involved NBC handing over all state - level radio servic es it controlled to the state governments . The idea underlying this change was that states should now run their local radio services in their own Nigerian languages but that FRCN headquarters would provide (in English) a national educational service plus (also in Page 8 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 English) national bulletins cover ing news worthy events in Nigeria . This structure, known as \"grassroots broadcasting ,\" has (from a national perspective) three tiers: 1) The nationwide network station at Radio House Garki, Abuja. 2) Four zonal broadcasting centers ( Enugu, Ibadan, Lagos, and Ka duna); these centers have operational autonomy for their linguistic groups. 3) State broadcasting centers which broad cast to their local areas and produce some programs to feed their zonal centers. In 1992, government partially commercialized FRCN. At this t ime, R adio Nigeria (a huge monopoly) suddenly found itself facing fierce and ruthless competition from the new private stations. These new private stations aggressively moved to poach well-trained staff from Radio Nigeria, offering them more money and b etter prospects for the future. At the new private stations, aggressive and more competent sale sman trolled the market for advertising and the related revenues. FRCN radio stations around Nigeria lost millions of listeners as new radio stations with very conducive and highly motivating work environments used state of the art equipment to provide very clear FM signals . Furthermore, listeners continued to perceive Radio Nigeria as a clearly biased voice of the Federal Government. As a result of these fact ors, c losure of FRCN stations, retrenchment of FRCN staff, and downsizing of FRCN operations became rampant. While Radio Nigeria's Enugu National Station had not yet been downsized and staff at the Enugu National Station had not yet been retrenched, the d anger that such steps could soon be taken seemed very real. ADDIT IONAL INFORMATION (5): STRATEGY OF RADIO NIGERIA'S ENUGU NATIONAL STATION AT THE TIME THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REQUESTED MS. AKPUNONU TO IDENTIFY (WITHIN THE NEXT 120 DAYS) A STRATEGY TO RETAIN AND GROW ENUGU NATIONAL STATION'S AUDIENCE AND MARKET SHARE At the time the Executive Director made his request , the strategy of Radio Nigeria's Enugu National Station was as indicated below: Target M arket The primary groups targeted for programmi ng by the Enugu National Station included: Men, women, children, young people, and farmers. Products Deli vered to t he Targeted Audiences Information regarding the products (that is, the programming) delivered by the Enugu National Station to the tar get markets listed above at the time the Executive Dir ector made his request: 1) The day -to-day programme schedule of the Radio Nigeria National Station included educational, informational, and entertainment -based programs. Because the Radio Nigeria Na tional Station did very little audience research, management did not know much about the needs, motives, and/or attitudes of any of the targeted audiences listed above. Given the dearth of kn owledge about the attitudes, preferences, and/or behaviors of the targeted audience s, management's approach was to broadcast to each audience what Page 9 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 management believed they needed . It was also true that management presumed that all the audiences uncritically consumed any and all broadca st information broadcast to them. Management did occasionally receive feedback from listeners; however, management made no attempts to systematically collect information on the attitudes, preferences , and/or behaviors of members of the audiences targeted by the Enugu National Station. 2) While a udience participation programs could have provided the Enugu National Station with insights on the radio -related behaviors, attitudes, interests, and opinions of listeners, such programs were rare. S ports commentaries originating from an outside venue (for example, \"live\" commentaries on a football m atch and/or a cultural festival) did not take place often. When such programs did take place, they were sometimes simulated. 3) On programmes featuring music , indigenous local music tended to account for about 80% while imported music accounted for the remaining 20%. As in the case of the other programmes offered by the Enugu National Station, this allocation between (on the one hand) local music and (on the other hand) imported music was based not on resea rch regarding the attitudes, preferences, and/or behaviors of the groups targeted by management but rather on assumptions by the managemen t of the Enugu National Station plus their desire to encourage local artists. Pricing of the products delivere d by the enugu national station At the time the Executive Director made his request, news broadcast s by the station were not paid for by anyone and adverts broadcast by the station were still very cheap. Advertisers (that is, not broadcasters) commissio ned whatever listener research was done . Promotion At the time the Executive Director made his request, the Enugu National Station was doing very little promotion of itself and/or its programs. Readers will remember that for many years Radio Nigeri a had had a monopoly on broadcasting in Nigeria; as a monopoly supplier, Radio Nigeria had never felt much need to promote itself and/or its products and services. Distribution As indicated earlier, a t the time the Executive Director made his request, the Enugu National Station distributed (that is, re broadcast) English language educational programmes and English language national news bulletins using state-owned stations throughout the area which had been known as Easter n Nigeria. Each state -owned station throughout Eastern Nigeria filled in the broadcast time available by preparing and broadcasting local language content to their local communities. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (6): NEW PRIVATE STATIONS IN ENUGU AND THE STRATEGIES OF THOSE STATIONS Two new private stations which came up within the Enugu coverage area as soon as the private participation in broadcasting was allowed included: 1) Ray P ower FM; and 2) Minaj FM at Obosi. These two new stations were of course in addition to the FM radio st ations belonging to the states located in what had been known as Eastern Nigeria; those states (and FM radio station locations) included Abia, Akwa -Ibom, A nambra, Bayselsa, Cross River, E bonyi, Page 10 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Enugu, Imo, and Rivers. Regarding the marketing strategy used by Ray Power FM and Minaj FM: Primary target market Adults 18 -50 years old. Product Because the new private stations not only poached staff but also copied Radio Nigeria's existing program schedules as well, the format and shape of messages on air did not deviate much from those of the Enugu National Station. The new private stations did allocate more time to music than Radio Nigeria; also, the new private stations built more audience participation into their programme schedules. One consequence of this approach was that the programming of the new private stations (whether sports -related, news -related, or entertainment -related) was very likely to be based on the needs, preferences , and attitudes of the audience. In music, for example, 80% of the pr ogramming featured foreign musi c, while only 20% of the programming featured indigenous music ; as indicated earlier, this was the direct opposite of what R adio Nigeria was offering . As for news, while local news was done in Igbo, other local content was done using the dialects of Igbo specific to various locations targeted by that local content. Pricing While Radio Nigeria did not have a well-developed pricing strategy, the new private stations established a definite cost for every package of broadca st material, irrespective of whether that broadcast material was news, sports, or entertainment. Promotion As indicated earlier, as a former monopoly supplier, Radio Nigeria had never felt it necessary to spend much time or energy promoting itself and/or its programmes. The new private stations, however, promoted themselves an d their broadcasts intensively , all day, every day. Distribution The FM broadcast technology used by the new private stations was more simple and more people -oriented than the medium-wave and short wave broadcast technology still being used by Radio Nigeria. The challenge Assume you are Ms. Akpunonu. . What strategy will you recommend to the Executive Director, so as to retain and grow Enugu national station's audience and marke t share in Enugu against the new private -sector broadcasters who have popped up in response to the August 1992 deregulation of the broadcast industry in Nigeria? Page 11 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 EXHIBIT #1 CHARACTISTIC ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS OF NIGERIANS 1) Some tribes (including the Igbo and the Yoruba) have a marketplace attitude toward negotiation: they see it as a means of achieving limited objectives through compromise and bargaining. 2) A foreign executive once observed that Nigeria is a beautiful p lace for business because \"everyon e keeps talking. . . e verything is in flux, everything is negotiable. \" 3) For some tribes (including the Igbo and the Yoruba), disputes arising out of business tend to be settled at home, through arbitration by a mutually respected or authority figure. Recou rse to courts is infrequent and signals the end of a business relationship 4) Mentor relationships and tribal ties can strongly influence whether or not an individual will be appointed to a government position . 5) Personal bearing and image are highly regarded. 6) Educational credentials are important. As with the British, individual s with a ge neralist, literary education are considered more capable than individuals knowledgeable only about a particular industry. A PhD carries great weight. 7) Relationships are likel y to overshadow prices, quality of product, and other substantive issues . for a number of reasons: Nigerians can be put off by the pushiness and strong task orientation of Americans. A style that reflects respect, empat hy, and sincerity is preferred, and friendships facilitate business dealings. 8) Nigerians generally feel proud about their country's role in Africa. 9) Elders are respected because age is equated with wisdom 10) Roles are very important. Titles, including one's degrees, are used widely. For example, one might identify an individual as C hief the Hon. Alhaji ABC, MA ( Oxford ), PhD(Ha rvard), etc. T itles generally reflect power. 11) Nigerians can be eloquent rhetoricians . In Nigeria however words may not mean much. Meanings can be subtle and internalized, and there is a high tolerance for ambiguity. 12) Emotion, experience, and intuition more than empirical reason are the persuasive basis of argument . 13) Tribal loyalty, the force of personality, and aggressiveness are very important. 14) There is a dearth of detail ed, reliable information in the country. The margin of error for reported unemployment figures, for example, has ranged from 25 -50%. 15) Many Nigerian businessman -perhaps the Igbo in particular -have been described as \"get rich quick me n.\" 16) The ties of individu als to their tribe are strong. When government adminis trations change, the new leader often brings in members of his own tribe. Stealing within one's tribe may be condemn ed while stealing from outsiders may be condoned. 17) Nigerians generally attempt to get to know their counterparts before making business transactions. Once friendships develop, even a foreigner can be considered a member of the family and looked upon with favor during negotiations. 18) At least among the I gbo and the Yoruba, individuals do not s eem risk -averse. Members of these groups have taken great risks for large short -term gains. 19) Time is generally treated casually; even the simplest transactions require a great deal of time . Foreigner s who hurry through a negotiation -even after a very late start-may be suspected of cheating. 20) Decision -making is highly centralized. P owerful individuals make the decisions and they tend to do so without consulting others. In Nigerian organizations, it is common t o postpone decisions because the incumbent off icial is on leave and no one else can act for him. Additionally, any business venture of significance must involve government officials . 21) Although Nigerians do prepare written agreements ( a pra ctice encouraged by the British), many agreements are spontaneo us and verbal. The key to commitment is not legal enforceability but an understanding under which the obligations of each party are clearly defined and matched with respective rewards.

One impli cation of this is that p ersonal efforts and the use of one's abilities can lead to a rise of status. 3) Igbo society may be characterized as an open society wherein high status may be attained on the basis of occupational skill, enterprise and initiative, wi th achievement being one of the highest values. 4) Igbos have a reputation for being w illing to take any sort of job (no matter how menial) when they first enter a town and then working their way up, living frugally and accumulating resources until they beco me wealthy. 5) The I gbo are clearly a group of great entrepreneurial activity whose drive for achievement and self - improvement has made them seek opportunities wherever they were and take advantage of any new situation that presented itself. Although the Igb o came in contact with Western education much later than the Yoruba, from the early 1920s upward, in what Coleman (1971) has called 'the Igbo awakening', the Igbo strove to catch up. While up to 70% of Igbos live in rural areas, and as many as 70% of them may be illiterate, the above comments suggest that members of the Igbo tribe (that is, the major tribe in what used to be known a s Eastern Nigeria) may be especially interested (both as regards work and leisure) in activities with the potential to increas e their abilities, accomplishments and skills.

THE CASE OF THE RICE TABERNA CLE CHU RCH Beverley J. Alley ne, Belmont University Raymond J. Elson, Valdosta State University CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject mat ter of th is case is the importan ce of understand ing the tax consequences of busin ess decis ions in nonprofit organizat ions. The case is appropr iate for a senior or gradua te level governm ent and nonpro fit accounting course. It could be us ed in the nonprofit portion of the ad vanced a ccount ing class. The case is d esigned to be taught in one class hour and is e xpected to r equire approx imately one hour of outs ide preparation by students. The events de scribed in this case are based on r eal world e xperiences, but all nam es have been disguised. CASE SYNOPSIS The case conce rns the challenges fac ed by religious organizat ions when they add activities that might negativ ely impa ct their tax exempt statu s. Rice Tabernacle Church (the Churc h) is a 2,000- member \"mega-church\" locate d in Brandon Hi ll, Kentucky. The church has experienced a 75 % growth in the past y ears and i s literally 'bursting at the seams. In order to handle this gro wth, chu rch lead ership decided to ex pand the c urrent san ctuary by adding 120,000- square structure which in cluded a fitness center, a boo kstore, and a caf\u00e9. The church's prop erty tax exemption only applied to the original s tructur e; therefore it appl ied to the taxing authori ty for e xpansion of the exemption to inclu de the addit ional structure. The exemption was denied since the inc ome from the n ew busin esses was consid ered unrelat ed to its miss ion. The church appe aled the ruling and needs to de velop a stra tegy in case its app eal is denied. INTRODU CTION Reverend Polk rose from prayer, turned to h is wife and p artner in the ministry, and shared with h er the challenges he hope d his prayer would answer. He had spok en with the church leadership about the property tax decis ion, and th ey could not imagine how the church could p ay the current pr operty tax bill of $325,000. This fi gure was expected to increa se in future years. The choices were limited - retrench from its goals, reduce services to the community, or ask for a special o ffering from the congregation. Cle arly, careful planning would be required in ord er to se e them throu gh these challenging times. A look at the e stablishment and growth of the min istry might help to illustrate how thin gs progressed to this point. Page 16 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 BACKGROUN D The Rice Tabernacle Church (\"the church) was started in1989 wh en a young couple, Anthon y and Mary Polk, felt they were called by God to establish a Pentecostal church in their Brandon Hill, Kentucky neighborhood. A fter mu ch prayer they found and acquir ed a large foreclosed si ngle-level brick build ing, a few block s from their hom e. Alth ough the build ing was foreclosed, it was located on two acres of land m aking it an ideal and attractive investm ent. The Polks us ed the p roceeds from a home equity line of credit to acquire the bu ilding and to purchase basic furniture such as folding chairs. T hey estimated th at as the church grew they could repay the lo an and expand the facility to accommodate as ma ny as 400 congregants. As a religious organization, the c hurch applied for and received property tax exemption from its State Board of Equalization for the church property. The Polks advertised the church in the local newspaper and soon o pened the doors, and prepared to welcome people from the neighborhood and sur roundi ng areas, to come and wo rship together in their church. On the first Sunda y, the Polks stood at the front of the church at approximately 930a m and nervous ly waited for the first people to arrive for the 10am se rvice. They were overjoyed when an entire family of eight w alked th rough the d oors to wo rship. Th ey were followe d by 25 oth er newcomers for a first day attendance of approximately 40 people, including the Po lks' family memb ers. This was a sign to them that they made the right de cision in starting the min istry and in s electing a building wi thin their low er middle class c ommunity. Each subseq uent Sunda y seemed to b ring more and more visitors. R everend Polk w as particul arly pleased with the div ersity in terms of age of his new 'flock' which ranged from babies in a rms to senior citizens. The location w as particularly attractive to the senior citizens from the neighborhood who walked ov er to the church, not on ly to worship but to inquire about the \"new church\" they heard had started. Pastor Polk w as so app reciative and elated by their dedication that he used his personal funds to pu rchase a used vehicle to transport any senior that neede d a ride, especiall y on rainy and sno wy days. The church continued growing as the younger members started to marry and have their own f amilies so that by 1999 it h ad ov er 500 members. With su ch memb ership growth, Reverend Polk f elt that the church should provide services oth er than spiritual that were not available in the area. He also realized that to su ccessful ly accomp lish this v ision he would n eed some consistent administrative assistance. To assist in the a dministration and ov ersight of church activity, Pastor Polk appointed one assistant minister and two d eacons. An administrative assistant and a bookkee per were also h ired to perform dai ly administrative and accounting duties. The Reverend Polk reported to a five-mem ber board of directors (or elders), who a re elected at the annua l memb ership meeting for two-year staggered terms. Page 17 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 The church's organization stru cture appears below: Rice Tabernacle Church Organization Chart Board of Directors Rev Anthony Polk Pastor Administrative Assistant Assistant Pastor Deacon I Deacon II Bookkeeper By the year 2000, the church had experienced o ver a 75% increase, as membership reached ov er 2,0 00. While some of the growth was org anic, the major increase was from individuals outside the community who were drawn to the m essage and ministry of the now \"mega church\". The blessings of rapid increase in membe rship howe ver, presented accom modation is sues. Memb ers had to arrive earlier than usu al to secure seats as the d eacons were kept bu sy setting up chairs against the already overflowing pews. In the weekly pastora l meetings with the pastors and d eacons where church business w as conducted, the issue of inadequate accom modation w as always a priority agenda i tem. Ho wever, this issue was discuss ed for nume rous months without a ny meaningful solu tion. In addition, the p astor's vision of providing additional s ervices to the community was also not bein g realized. Finally, after consult ing with the board of elders, the Chur ch leaders decided th at expansion w as necessary to accom modate the rapid growth and growing community. The church leaders then di scussed the e xpansion idea with the church memb ership during one of the annua l membership meetings, and received the ir unanimous approval. All agreed that they had a respons ibility to minister to the needs of the community. THE EXPANSION The church acqui red an available five acre lot that was next to its current location whi ch provided adequate sp ace for expansion. The church memb ers were excited about the acquis ition and h eld sev eral benefits to raise mon ey for the building fund. The plan was to remodel the current structure and to add approximately 120,00 0 additional square feet. The new sp ace would provide classrooms f or bible stu dy and oth er religious activities for diverse memb ership g roups . The west end of the new space would house a fitness center, a booksto re, and a caf\u00e9, all to provide comfo rt and s ervices for the congregants and community memb ers. The constru ction Page 18 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 was complet ed in 2007 through the building fund proceeds and a small b ank loan w hich was used to equip the fitness center and pr ovide ini tial invento ry for the books tore. Three offices were added, one for the Pasto r, another for the assistant pastors, and the third for use by the boo kkeepe r. The bookk eeper's role was also expanded to include the account ing for the new business es. Five classrooms w ere constr ucted for the v arious Sunda y school cl asses. The smallest of whic h was conve rted into a nursery, staffed by volun teers, for use by the youngest members (i.e. the b abies), during the w orship s ervice. The fitness center was spacious and was promoted to the church memb ers and community as a pl ace to work on their physical health while p roviding the oppor tunity to fellowship with membe rs from the congregation. It was opened seven days a week from 6am - 9pm for m embers and the general pub lic's use. The fitness center's mem bership fees were reasonable, reflecting the community's income l evel, and we re transferrable to a fa mily memb er or friend if not bei ng fully utilized. In fact, by providing such a s space to the c ommunity, several non -members had formally joined the congregation as membe rs. The booksto re was expansive and includ ed space for a caf\u00e9. The booksto re was well stock ed with r eligious books and other items such as bibl es, and special bi ble covers, ornaments, mugs, ba nners, bracelets, stuff animals, just to name a few. The church anticipate d that th is would generate additional revenue and so two cash registers were purchased to be uti lized by the booksto re. The caf\u00e9 offered various hot and cold drinks, sandwic hes, and snacks, and served as a place for the community to meet and fe llowship. These auxiliary services were welcome d by the membe rship sin ce they provid ed additional income for the church (approximately 15% of total income ). THE CHU RCH AT A CROSSROAD In the fall of 2007, the church applied to the State Board of Equalization (The board) pursu ant to the S tate's code for property tax exemption for relief on the additional stru cture. An initial site vis it by a board inspe ctor d etermined that most of the n ew build ing appeared to meet the ta x exempt status. By the summ er of 2009, the church received an official response from the board denying tax exemption for the po rtion of the bui lding that containe d the booksto re and caf\u00e9, and the fitness cente r. The board consid ered them to be retail/comme rcial in natu re and not us ed for religious pu rposes. Since the board's ruling w as denying the tax-exempt status, it ass essed th at seven percent of the total facility should be subject to loc al prop erty taxes. The board decided that the bookstore /caf\u00e9 was totally commercial o perations and the f itness center was 50% commercial. The church was assessed a property tax bill of $325,000. Rice Tabernacle appealed the bo ard's decision and filed a motion for extraordinary relief. The church presented that it is entitled to a tax exemption s ince it be lieved that its facilities are used for carrying out the purpose of the church. The Polks r ealized that the min istry was now at a c rossroad and th ey needed divine intervention to r esolve t he tax issue. Since the church had always operated on a tight bu dget, it did not have the reserve funds to p ay the current and any future tax assessments. Reverend Polk recognized the n eed to schedule another meeting with the leadership team, including the bo ard of directors with in the n ext week, to p lan for an unfavorable out come from the appeals pro cess. In the meant ime, the Polks agreed to continue praying for guidan ce to help the l eadership te am Page 19 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 develop an appropriate action plan tha t they could pre sent to the congregation at the next membe rship me eting which was thre e weeks away.

Cepeda, University of Guam Kristine D.R. Gerardo, University of Guam Karri T. Pere z, University of Guam John J. Rivera , University of Guam CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case concerns a manager's discovery of fraud. Specifically, this case discusses credit card fraud committed by trusted supervisors and cashiers from within the org anization . The case has a difficulty level of three and higher , appropriate for junior level and beyond. The case is designed to be taught in two to three class hours in a management, auditing, or ethics course, and is expected to require three hours of outside preparation by the students. This includes reading the case, understanding the concept of purchases and financial transactions in a retail environment , recogni zing the importance of internal controls, observing ethical practi ces in the business en vironment, as well as makingdecisions for recourse once transgressions have been discovered by management. ABSTRACT According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), fraud is defined as, \"a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or conce alment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment\" (2013 , para. 2 ). In general terms, fraud is perceived as a crime for gain , Fruad includes any intentional or deliberate act to deprive another of property or money through decepti on or unfair means. Different types of fraud exist. Perpetrators seek to defraud organizations and individual s alike; leaving both victims . Fraud within an organization can be committed either internally or externally . ranging from employees to managers and from venders to the owners themselves. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners' (ACFE) 2012 Report to the Nations , quantifies the impact of occupational fraud , with losses of five percent in revenues . This equates to $3.5 trillion in global loss, after being applied to the 2011 Gross World Product (2012). In particular, United States merchants lose approximately $190 billion a year to credit card fraud (Shaughnessy, 2011). This paper opens with a case of fraud in a retail industry setting. It then follows with a background of the history of credit card use and how financial transactions are processed when using credit cards . Specifically, this case illustrates a manager's discovery of rampant credit card fraud by trusted supervisors and employees of the organization . Instructor 's notes are provided for background on this topic . The reader is invited to put himself or herself in the place of the m anager , make decisions on how to resolve the current situation , as well as identify what could have been in place or could be implemented in the future to Page 22 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 preclude credit card fraud in this retail organization. CASE STUDY Mr. Williams, General Manager of GTS Department Store was performing one of his favorite rituals in the morning ; walking through the retail store right before opening to greet all of his employees by name . He prided himself on being a \"people person\" and no w considered his l ong-time employees as family. Mr. Williams had been in retail since starting as a part -time cash ier in high school and now , only five years away from retirement , he had been put in char ge of one of the largest depar tment stores in the chain , located in the Western Pacific . Originally from Pennsylvania , this promotion , however, required him to move to a small island in the Pacific with his family . Mr. Williams immediately adapted to the island life . He quickly developed many friendsh ips with local island professionals. In such a tight knit community, many of the island 's residents were related to each other and one did not have to look far to make a connection . Here, strong family ties and bonds were central to the culture . The island culture was hard to ignore; having significant impact on the organizational culture of the company as well. Mr. Williams felt right at home as the relationship oriented w ork culture fit his personal leadership style. His store was one of two department stores on the island and at 80,000 square feet required a staff of 120 full and part -time employee s. The store consisted of 22 departments , including a variety of products : from housewares and furniture to clothing, as well as jewelr y and shoes. There were 24 individual cash register stations throughout the store all monitored by an in -house security force using cameras and an undercover roving patrol. GTS Department Store made 70% of their annual sales between the months of November and December due to strong sales from the holiday season; Black Friday and Christmas boasting significant revenue . The holiday shopping season was one of Mr. Williams ' favorite times of the year . Mr. William did not mind the extra work and long hours required . This was when he felt at his best. He believed that it was times such as this that really brought out th e best in his employees and was very appreciative all the hard work and effort that everyone put in. The sales floor's team in his opinion, played a key role in the store's success . One morning after his daily rounds on the sales floor, he received a visit Alice, a friend of the family. Alice was in the same civic organization as his wife, Sarah , and was a loyal customer of GTS Department Store . She apologized for bothering him during the busy holiday season rush, but was curious about a double charge on her credit card. Mr. Williams welcomed the opportunity to review it with her. Alice had saved her store receipt from the week before . On the receipt she had circled the total amount as well as the one item in question . The store receipt showed that Alice had made a single couch purchase with a credit card transac tion. She then pulled out a copy of her credit card statement and showed Mr. Williams . The credit card statement showed not one purchase, but two separate, identical transactions on the same day. It ha d appeared as if she had purchased two couches , in two different transactions , on the same day. Clearly this was a simple mistake. He apologized for the error and told her he would take care of it by having her card credited back for the additional transaction. The next day, Mr. Williams went to his accounting manager , Doris , with a copy of the Page 23 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 store receipt and the credit card statement and asked her to credit back Alice's card for one of the transactions . Doris did so and decided to just double check the inventory records . Doris pulled up the inventory sheet to verify the stock level s of the coach that had been purchased . She was surprised to find that the inventory listing showed zero left in stock . If this credit card charge was a mistake she would have expected to see one couch still in inventory from the original two couches that were ordered and delivered from the ven dor to their warehouse . When she looked at the store's copy of all the receipts for that day, she saw that there was another transaction and receipt for the seco nd couch only hours after the first couch was purchased. Alarmed, she walked downstairs to Mr. Williams' office to let him know about the situation. Mr. Williams met with his security manager, Dave , and his assistant store manager , Jeff, to discuss the sit uation in confidence. It was the Security Department's duty to ensure that all merchandise released was properly documented. Dave made the point that the warehouse or security staff would not have noticed anything wrong as there were two receipts show ing that two couches had been bought and paid for . Upon investigation and tracking of the sales receipt s and merchandise pick up slips, it was discovered that two couches had been physically removed from the warehouse and loaded onto a delivery truck . The delivery slip noted that the coach es had been delivered to Alice's house . The investigation turned to Joe, the warehouse employee who had signed the delivery slip. Joe admitted that he had instructed Alvin, the deliv ery truck driver , to deliver one couch to Alice 's address , and the other couch to an employees' house . This was despite the fact that the delivery slip , with the two receipts attached , had Alice's name and address on them . This was a clear indication that both couches should have been delivered to Alice's house . As it turn ed out, the second couch was not delivered to Alice's house; it was delivered to Stephanie Jackson's house. Stephanie was the supervis or for the furniture department at GTS Department Store . The investigation now shifted focus to Marcy, the cashier who had initiated both the sale transaction s. As Marcy was being questioned , she was told that Joe from the warehouse already admitted to instructing the driver to take a second couch to another employee 's house based on the receipt s that had been generated under Marcy's employee number . Marcy adamantly claimed that she did not remember ringing up two transactions for this merchandise and that she would have reme mbered the purchase of two identical couch es. \"There must have been some mistake\" she said. She claimed that maybe someone else must have inputted her employee number into the cash register to ring up the transaction so that it would look like she had made the transaction . This was doubtful as the employee numbers were only issued by management directly to the cashiers and each cashier had their own identifying number. Dave spent that evening reviewing the security tapes and came across a transaction at 6:10 p.m. on the camera that clearly showed Marcy ringing up a purchase by Alice , with Marcy proces sing her credit card through the register. The security tape also showed Marcy ringing up a transaction two hours later, but with no c ustomer present. When Dave and Mr. Williams confronted Marcy the next day she realized that management had enough information to prove that she had been involved in theft . She immediately beg an telling \"her\" side of the story and blamed most of the problem on her supervisor , Stephanie. Marcy said that Stephanie put pressure on her to participate in this scheme . Marcy said that she \"honestly\" was not comfortable participating, and did not even want to go along with the scheme . Marcy defended her actions saying that other employees , Page 24 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 in other departments , were doing the same thing. She claimed that it was, in fact, another employee who had shown her how to save the credit ca rd information and then use that information to later transact a \"purchase\" so that when merchandise was taken out of the store or warehouse through security, there was a paid receipt attached. According to Marcy, \"several other employees including supe rvisors knew this was happening and were involved or was 'looking the other way'\". Mr. Williams was devastated and felt horribly betrayed. This was happening under his watch and those who were involved were some of his most trusted and longest tenured employees. He was committed to their professional development and career growth ; they were treated like family. \"How could they do this ?\" he thought. Moreover, how many other customers ha d been a victim of these employees and had not yet complained ? How many other customers in the past few months had been victims and had not even known that their credit card had been compromised because they did not compare their receipts to their credit card statements ? At this point, all Mr. Williams could think was, \" How can I stop this from ever happening a gain?\" Page 25 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 THE GOLDEN GUP: IDENTIFYING THE INVENTORY CHANGE VARIANCE Elizabeth Cole, USC Upstate Cathy Claiborne, University of Colorado Colorado Springs CASE DESCRIPTION Why don't the numbers add up? When you purchase a different quantity of inventory than you use in production, the cost variance does not equal the price and efficiency variance. The difference can be attributed to the inventory change variance, a new conce pt in variance analysis. In the Golden Gup Case this change in inventory variance is introduced, explained and calculated. The case, which has been used in both upper division cost accounting and MBA managerial accounting courses, addresses the functional, personal and broad business perspective core competencies as identified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). CASE SYNOPSIS In the Golden Gup case, the traditional direct materials price variance plus the direct materials qua ntity variance does not equal the total cost or flexible budget variance. This occurs because the price variance uses actual quantity of materials purchased and the quantity variance uses actual quantity of materials used. Traditional managerial/cost textb ooks note that different quantities are used in these calculations but are silent on the actual calculation under such circumstances. Therefore, students cannot reconcile the total cost or flexible budget variance for direct materials and they are not prep ared for real world applications where inventories do in fact change. Students find this frustrating both because the numbers don't add up and because they realize that this is a common phenomenon in the real world and they are not ready to deal with such a situation. In this case we do the calculations and name the variance as an inventory change variance. Once we do that, the price variance plus the inventory change variance plus the quantity variance actually reconciles the flexible budget variance. THE GOLDEN GUP Gupper Gascoigne (aka the Golden Gup) is the Cadillac of Oldies Mobile DJs. He has a weekly radio program, restores and sells jukeboxes and classic cars, and has a Jukebox Rental business. He runs his many and varied businesses out of the 20 car garage at his home in Boonton, NJ. You can get additional information about his various business lines at http://www.goldengup.com. Over the years Gup has b een collecting small Jukeboxes that had been in diners at individual tables. He has been shining them up, inside and out, and selling them. Gupper's Page 26 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 success has come from artistry and passion, rather than planning. His love of the R&B music that he plays, and his passion and energy, have made him a success without much need of careful planning. Recently the Golden Gup married the Lovely Lulu. Lulu had a business background and took a look at Gup's varied businesses and thought she could make improvements. \"Let's take a closer look at some of your product lines to see if we can make them better\" she said. She was sure that with planning and budgeting as well as some performance evaluations at the end of a cycle, they would be able to identify Gup's strengths and weaknesses. Recently at an antique car show Gup ran into a manager of a large diner chain (the Dashing Diners). The manager was interested in Gup's various businesses, particularly his interest in jukeboxes and how they gelled with his diner theme. He had plans to open a new diner in New Jersey and asked Gup for a bid on 120 custom mini jukeboxes and music for booths in the diner. Lulu saw this as an opportunity to start a new business line, and turn it in to a profitable venture. She did the footwork in pricing out the components and figuring out the assembly process. She identified the following costs associated with the new product. Shell: $18 Innards: $15 45s: $20 (50 45s at about $0.40each) From experience in putting together earlier jukes Gup estimated that it would take about an hour to put together each jukebox. Gup wanted to do it himself, but Lulu insisted his time was better spent on other business endeavors and that they should hire so mebody. They figured they could hire somebody at $12 an hour. Using this data, Lulu put together a budget so that they would have a cost figure to use for their bid. After preparing the budget, Gup and Lulu sat down to think of what an appropriate pricing strategy would be. Lulu thought they should mark up costs 100% so they would be certain to cover any hidden costs they had not accounted for. Gup thought they should have a profit margin of 50%, because he heard somewhere that was an acceptable profit mar gin. Gup and Lulu gave their bid to Dashing Diners who immediately accepted it and they went to work ordering parts and looking for someone to hire. Their neighbor had asked Gup if he had anything his son Ryan could do for him this summer. Ryan was just completing his junior year at State U. He was majoring in accounting and even though he had a 3.85 GPA he did not get one of the coveted summer accounting internships. Ryan's dad told Gup that although Ryan seemed a bit disappointed he said he'd just as so on hang out with Gup for the summer anyway. Gup and Lulu thought this would be a win win situation for everyone so they arranged to hire Ryan to assemble the parts. Part way into production Dashing Diners called to say they had increased the size of the Diner and would like to increase their order from 120 units to 150 paying the same unit price. Lulu quickly put together a flexible budget for selling 150 units and Gup and Lulu agreed to supply the additional jukeboxes. Page 27 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Additional information that Gup and Lulu found as they ordered parts and continued production is given below. Shell The shells were ordered from Ali Express. The price of an order (including shipping) was very subject to the lot size. If you ordered 1 unit, the cost was $25. If you ordered 100 units, the cost went down to $18 per unit, and if you ordered 500 units, the cost went down to $16 per unit. Gup was certain the endeavor would be a success and more orders would come in. Therefore he ordered 500 units for a total cost of $8000. When the order arrived from Singapore, 5 of the units had been damaged in transit and were thrown out. At the end of the job there were 345 units on hand. Innards The innards were contracted through a nearby electronics firm. Gup had been using this firm for years while restoring his old jukeboxes. He likes the firm because they have very high quality and if something doesn't work right, they replace it immediately. He originally contracted for 120 units at $15 per piece, for a total of $1800. When the added o rder for an additional 30 units came in, he went back to the electronics company and they said they would have to charge $18 each to get the units in time since they would have to pay overtime. Gup agreed. 45s Gup had a large stock of 45s (2000 45s at an average cost of $.40 each) on hand, as he collected them and bought them at estate sales. However, to take care of the entire batch of 150 units, he needed a total of 7500 45s. On EBay Gup was able to purchase 6000 45s in good condition at a cost of $2,52 0 ($.42 each). A number of 45s needed to be thrown out due to scratches. A physical count of 45s after the project was complete showed 300 45s on hand. Labor They hired Ryan to assemble the units. They offered Ryan $12 an hour, but Ryan's mother wouldn't let them pay him more than $10. Even though Ryan was about to complete his accounting degree he was one \"cool cat\" and had admired Gup for years, hanging out around the garage whenever there was any activity. This was Ryan's dream job. He arrived early ev ery morning and stayed late every afternoon. Whenever Gup showed up Ryan would follow him around asking questions about the business. Gup enjoyed Ryan and liked having these \"mentoring\" chats with him. Ryan ended up working 200 hours at $10 an hour. Page 28 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Profi ts When all was said and done, Gup and Lulu earned cash profit of $4,640 on the Dashing Diner job. They are trying to understand why their profit was $4,640 when they thought it would be $9,750. That was what they had budgeted. They knew the revenue came in at budget and that some of their costs were even less than planned. For example, they paid Ryan $10 per hour and had budgeted $12 per hour. They were perplexed. Knowing Ryan was a great accounting student they asked Ryan if he could explain it to them. Additionally, thy wondered if they should continue with this venture. Their time was very valuable and they expected to make at least a 40% profit margin on their projects.

INTRODUCT ION It is Decemb er 2004, Mr. Michael F. Gold en, the newly appoint ed President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director of Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation has been on the job for two weeks. Mr. Golde n is new to the firearms and security indust ry having served in executive positions for Kohle r Company, Stanley Works Company, and Black & Decker Corporation. A Page 30 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 closer look at Mr. Golde n's resume reveals that he has a strong m arketing background with little knowle dge about the firearms indust ry. He holds an MBA from Emo ry Univ ersity in Atlanta, Georgia, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing from Pennsylvania State Univer sity (Bloomsbu rg BusinessWeek, 2014) . Upon his arrival at Smith & Wesson, one of the initial tasks facing Mr. Golde n is to re-energize the Smith & Wesson brand using his requisi te knowle dge of marketing and sales management. As he pulled into the parking lot of Smith & Wesson, his thoughts turned to the morning meetin gs with Mr. Tom Taylor, Vice President of Marketing, and their marketing team. After spending the last several days reviewing research reports and company data, it was time to discuss market opportuniti es. M r.Golde n is grappling with the future of the company, whic h had remained relatively stagnant over the past decade. As stated in the 2004 Annu al Report, Smith and Wesson is \"...the l argest manufacturer of handguns, whic h includes revolvers and pistols, in the Unit ed States and the l argest U.S. exporter of h andguns. We manufac ture handguns and related produc ts and accessories for sale primarily through our distribution network and to public safety and milita ry agencies in the United States and throughout the World.\" In line with this statement, prior management had viewed Smith and Wesson's strategy as one of being a \"big fish\" in a small pond, suffering from classic signs of myopic market vision (Leavitt, 1960) . Shortly after joining the company, Mr. Golde n is quoted in a local Springfield newspaper \"When I joined the company we did not have a dime of busin ess with the federal government, whi ch was amazing to m e. But it is a huge oppo rtunity for our company\" (Blomb erg, 2004 ). The company was unde r increasing pressure for a growth strategy given the low g rowth na ture of the handgun m arket and an increasing numb er of international competitors. COMPANY OV ERVIEW Smith & Wesson Corporation is located in Springfield, Massachusetts, a city having a long histo ry with the firearms indust ry. The company was founde d in 18 52 by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson and has experienced several changes in ownership over the years. After 21 years, Daniel B. Wesson purchased Horace Smith's share of the company. The Wesson family later sold Smith & Wesson Corp. to Bangor Punta Corporation in 1965. Bangor Punta Corporation purchased Forjas Taurus in 1971, another firearms manufacturer and at the time, the two companies shared propriety firearm design and manufac turing information. The relationship between these two companies ended in 1977 when Bangor Punta sold Forjas Taurus. The ownership of these two companies is relevant today becaus e Taurus International Manufac turing Incorporated (known as Taurus USA), is a competitor of Smith & Wesson and has ties to Beretta a long-standing competitor and Rossi firearms. In 1984 Lear Siegler Corporation located in Greenwich Connectic ut purchased Bangor Punta and assum ed ownership of Smith & Wesson. Smith & Wesson Corporation changed ownership two mo re times before it was finally purchased and renamed Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation in February 2002 (Annua l Report on Form 10K For the Fiscal Year Ended Ap ril 30, 2004 ). Smith & Wesson Corporation competes in international and domestic markets, with net sales revenue of $117 million (see Table 1), a 19.7 perce nt increase over 2003; opera ting in come was $5.2 million (Smith & Wesson Form 10-K Annu al Report, 2004) . They are one of the Page 31 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 world's largest manufac turers of handguns. Firearms account for approximately 87 percent of sales in 2004, with revolver sales about 47 percent of firearms revenue. The remaining company sales revenue was generated from non-firearms produc ts and services (handcuffs, apparel, accessories and collectibl es). Table 1 SMITH & WES SON O PERATING PERFORMANCE Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation, Form 10-K Annual Report for fiscal year ended April 30, 2004, United States Securities Exchange Commission. Smith & Wesson was a domin ant player in the handgun market. This focus was clearly stated in their 2004 annual report: \"We manufac We have never manufac tured or sold inexpensive conceal able firearms, sometimes known as 'Saturday Night Specials,' and we do not produc e 'assault weapons as defined in the Viol ent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. We offer a compl ete line of handguns to m eet the needs of discriminating shoot ers. We currently offer more handgun models, in more calib ers, for more applications than any oth er handgun manufacturer. We currently offer 73 different standard models of handguns with a wide variety of calib ers, finish es, sizes, composi tions, ammunition capaci ties, barrel lengths, grips, sights, actions, and other features. In order to enhance our competitive position we continually int roduc e new handgun models. We introduced five new revolver and four new pistol models in each of fiscal 2004 and 2003\" (2004 Smith & Wesson Annu al Report, pg. 1-2). Smith & Wesson maintains an overa ll 18 perce nt unit share in the Pistol and Revolver segments (see Table 2). As of 2003, they had a 35 pe rcent sh are of revolvers and an 11 pe rcent sh are in pistols. Page 32 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Table 2 DOMESTIC SUPPLIER S Pistols 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Small Anns (2004): A TF(1999-2003) Page 33 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 INDU STRY OV ERVIEW The small firearms industry has seen moderate, at times stagnant growth since the mid 1990s. M arket size in 2004 was $4 billion in revenue and 5.4 million units (SBI, 2007) . It had experience double digit growth from 2002 to 2003, but on ly 4 percent from 2003 to 2004. The emergence of the firearms indust ry in the United States dates back to the indust rialized revolution. At that time, many U. S. busin esses either started a new venture busin ess produc ing firearms or converted existing busin esses to firearms manufacturing facilities. The majority of the original busin esses were in the Northeastern United States where they were in close proximity to numerous mill towns with iron-ore and skilled-labor resources. Many of the original firearm busin esses that started at that time still exist today. The most notable companies in the New England states in alphabetical order include Colt Manufacturing Company, Remington Arms Company, LLC, Ithaca Gun Company, Sturm, Ruger & Company, Marlin Firearms, Savage Arms Company, Dan Wesson Firearms, M assach usetts Ar ms Company (founde d by Arthur Savage, Horace Smith and Daniel Wesson), O.F. Mossberg & Sons, Smith & Wesson, Springfield Ar mory, Stevens Arms, and Winchester Repeati ng Arms Company. A numb er of factors make competing in this indust ry very challenging. For many consum ers firearms purchases come from discretionary spending, thus when the econom y is good unit sales increase, when bad they decrease. A second factor is consum er feelings about security. If consum ers generally feel safe, there is a reduced likelihood of purchasing firearms than when they are concerned for their safety. Finally, government actions directly affect indust ry performance. Milit ary actions around the world such as in the Middle East deplete the domestic supp ly of firearms and firearms related produc ts such as ammunition. Calls for increased laws and regulatory actions affect the availability of firearms and ease of purchase. Of interest at this time is the call for taxing firearms purchases to pay for social spending policies of the federal government. Politics plays an impo rtant role when consum ers adjust their firearms purchases based on which party wins national elections, usually due to the fear of repeal of the 2nd Amendment. There are three, broad user segments that include Civilian, Law E nforcement and Milit ary/Gover nment markets. Produc t segments include h andguns (pistols and revolvers), long guns (rifles), shotguns and muzzle loading (black powd er) guns. Handguns account ed for about one million of the 5.4 million units sold in 2004, whic h is about one-third of the domestic produc tion of sm all firearms. It is estimated that the Civilian/consumer segment owns approximately 230 million firearms, with an addition al 5 million guns purchased every year (Small Arms Survey, 2004). This segment consists of hunting, shooting and sports enthusi ast, and personal protection markets. The incidence of gun ownership has declined over the years, with approximately 34 percent of people report having a gun in the home. The greatest demand is for pistols, rifles and shotguns. Hunter s account for about 60 perce nt of firearms sales, target shoot ers another 25 percent and 15 percent goes to the personal protection segment. As noted above , Smith & Wesson h as a domin ant position in handguns, but does not compete in other segments such as rifles and shot guns (see Table 3). Page 34 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Smith & Wesson has virtually no presence in the Milit ary/Government sector. Their position in the Law Enforcement segment has precipitous ly declined from a dominant 95 perce nt share, to less than 10 percent. The foreign competitor, Gloc k has a dominant 65 percent share, mainly due to the acqu iescence of Smith & Wesson. Gloc k is known for their lighter, high capacity pistol made from plastic materials, creating a lighter pistol with more fire power. When first introduced Smith & Wesson ignored the competitor think ing th at police departments would not trade their trusted metal S&W revolvers for plastic Gloc ks. The y were wrong, police preferred the lighter firearm whe n having to carry them around on a daily basis. Table 3 SMALL FIREARM S COMPETITOR SE GMENTS, 2004 Smith & Wesson competes against other manufacturers of firearms, including dom estic companies such as Colt, Sturm, Ruger and Springfield Armory. Foreign competitors included Beretta, Gloc k and Taurus. Foreign competitors had recently becom e a significant force in the small firearms sector, accounting for approximately 40 p ercent of handgun sales. Sales of firearms to the Milit ary and Law Enforcement segments are direct, B2B purchase relationships. The Civilian/Consum er segment must purchase firearms from licens ed retailers, who are suppli ed by authorized and licensed whole salers. Gun purchases are regulated Page 35 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 and affected by governmental regulations related to waiting p eriods and back ground checks. While there are some large dealers, the firearms channels tend to be domin ated by sm aller and merchandisi ng capabiliti es. The numb er of firearms dealers has been declining over the last ten years. While it is difficult to predict the future, the market is expected to lag due to slow economic growth a nd a number of high profile lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers. SCENARIO The market data indicated that the Smith and Wesson Company was not taking full advantage of its strong brand equity built over 152 years of handgun manufacturing. Given the lacklust er market growth and continu ed attack by forces outside of the handgun and firearms indust ry, the management team had to develop a turn-around strategy to not just grow revenues, but also revitalize the company. Smith & Wesson decid ed to hire Mr. Golde n because of his extensive brand management and marketing experience at Stanley Works and Kohler . Likewise, Tom Taylor joined the company in July 2004 after having held marketing positions at Coca-Cola and Frito Lay. Both were newcomers to the firearms indust ry. The two individuals found themselves in a very simil ar situation. Both were newly hired, both had extensive marketing experience from other indust ries, neither had extensive marketing experience in the indust ry where they now held senior-level marketing positions. One of Tom 's first decisions was to recount a funda mental marketing rule - informative decisions start with sound marketing data. Tom decided to collect market data he could use to analyze potential viable markets. What he found would be useful to help re-energize the brand. Is the challenge before Golde n simp ly applying his knowle dge of marketing gained from vastly different indust ries to an indust ry unlike any he has seen? How can he use the marketing skills that he has learned in other indust ries? What basic marketing knowle dge does he rely on to re- energize this brand? It was an exhilarating challenge th at would require major changes to the corporate ideology and new marketing practice s were about to be introduced to Smith and Wesson.

Snipes, Columbus State University Jennifer Pitts, Columbus State University CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case is a competitive forces analysis of a specialty retail company. Secondary issues examined include choosing an appropriate competitive strategy and leveraging technology an d social media to build customer relationship s and deliver a unique value proposition to customer. Students should develop a more in -depth understanding of the impact of external factors and the underlying drivers that affect competi tive control and profi tability. The case has a difficulty level of three and up, making it appropriate for junior level courses in management information systems, marketing strategy or business strategy. The case is designed to be taught in one or two class sessions and should require approximately 2 -3 hours of outside preparation for students, primarily reviewing the case and reading articles related to the competitive forces framework. CASE SYNOPSIS The Big Dog Running Company is a running specialty store operating in the highly competitive and growing running shoe and apparel retail industry. The company started in late 2010 in the middle of an economic recession and against formidable odds in an industry dominated by large retailers and price competitive Internet -based co mpanies. In this case, students analyze the specialty running store industry using Porter's Competitive Forces framework and assess trends in the industry that affect profitability. Examining the structure of an industry and the competitive forces that influence profitability will help students develop an understand ing of the impact of external factors and the underlying drivers that affect competi tive control and profitability. THE \"BIG DOG RUNNING COMPANY\" STORY It was 2009 and in the middle of the g reat recession. John Teeples and Reggie Luther were discussing the possibility of opening a new retail store in Columbus, Georgia spe cializing in the running sport. Not onl y were they running enthusiasts who had participated in multiple \"ultramarathons\" (i.e., marathons that are more than 26.2 miles) and \"ultraruns\" (i.e., unusually difficult running events such as those involving ma ny hills and/or mountains), they were also experienced entrepreneurs who had successful business es in the Columbus, Georgia market. Page 38 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 John Teeples was a local building contractor and Reggie Luther owned a website design business located in downtown Columbus. Consistent with national trends, they noted that running participation was increasing significantly in the Columbus area. Both John and Reggie noticed that other cities had new specialty store s dedica ted to the sport of running, but not Columbus. This led them to the conclusion that there was a gap in the local market for a full service retailer catering specifically to the running sport . Also, John and Reggie felt that the recession may actually help to increase participation in the running sport since, compared to other sports like golf, it was a relatively inexpensive one. And they knew that the increase in health co nsciousness in the U.S. meant that the number of people choosing an activ e lifestyle was trending up -- in a recession they would be more inclined to choose a sport that was less expensive like running. John a nd Reggie felt that there was a window of oppor tunity for a location in the city's newly revitalized downtown area. Like many cities across America, Columbus' downtown area was going through a renaissance. Many of the city's young professionals had started moving back downtown, and more and more reta ilers and restaurants were relocating to the downtown area to cater to them. More importantly, the Columbus Riverwalk brought tourists and sports enthusiasts downtown. Built in 1992, t he Riverwalk is a paved trail that stretches 22 miles alongs ide the Ch attahoochee River which runs straight through the heart of the downtown area. It provides a scenic public trail for the locals to use to walk, run, and bike. To add to the already growing downtown traffic, in 2009 the city announced plans for a $42 milli on white water rafting course through do wntown to be complete d by 2012. It was being touted as \"the world's largest urban whitewater course.\" It was expected to significantly increase tourism in the Columbus area and, more specifically, the retail custome r traffic in the downtown area (in 2013, USA Today named this whitewater rafting course one of the \"top 12 greatest man -made adventures on the planet\"). Additionally , Columbus is located right next door to Fort Benning, Georgia, home of one of the army's largest traini ng installations in the country with about 35,000 soldiers on active or reserve duty. This would provide the retail store with a constant influx of young soldiers in need of proper e quipment for their PT training. On the weekends, many of the Fort Benning soldiers go to the downtown area for shopping, entertainment , and socializing , making it an attractive locatio n to target military personnel. In anticipation of the new sports - minded traffic in the downtown area, other sporting goods stores had recently opened along the Columbus Riverwalk catering to fishing , biking, and water sports, but none catered specifically to runners. After an initial assessment of the potential m arket for a running specialty store in Columbus, John and Reggi e needed to decide on the appropriate strategy. With the revitalization of the downtown (\"Uptown\") area, and the proximity of downtown to the Riverwalk and Fort Benning, John and Reggie believed the downtown area would be the most desirable location for their target market. They found a suitable downtown location and then debated a name for the store. John Teeples' wife, Melissa, w as a local veterinarian who loved animals, especially dogs (his fami ly included five rescue dogs!). It can also be assumed that many (if not most) Americans also love th eir dogs since Americans spend upwards of $61 billion annual ly on their Page 39 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 pets (Kurtzleben, 2013) . This gave John an idea for the store name. After doing some focus group research and conducting a trademark sea rch, John and Reggie decided that \"Big Dog Running Company\" would be the name of their new retail store. It was per sonal, memorable, unique , and appropr iate. It would also give their target market the \"warm fuzzy\" feeling that may help them relate to th e store on a personal level. Their next step was to decide on the store's competitive strategy. SPECIALTY RUNNING STORE RETAIL INDUSTRY TREN DS John and Reggie knew that their main competition i n the local market area would include online stores such as Zappos and Amazon, and brick -and-mortar chain stor es such as Dick's and Academy Sports , all of which carried apparel for many outdoor sports including running. However, in 2009 there were no retailers in the local area who specialize d exclusively in runni ng apparel. In fact, nationwide, privately -owned specialty running stores made up a relatively small percentage of suppliers of running shoes and apparel, numbering approximately 800 stores in the U.S. (Metzer , 2014). Providing expertise, custom shoe fit ting, and a sense of community have long defined the niche supplier who caters primarily to a core group of dedicated sports enthusiasts . Competit ion in the sporting apparel industry, however, was undergoing significant change driven by a growing and more diverse market, industry consolidation , and challenges from catalog and online merchandisers who are able t o provide popular brand shoes at competitive prices with added conveniences such as free shipping and return guarantees ( Metzer, 2014). The top sports apparel manufacturers had begun to put more restrictions on small retailers rega rding pricing and online sales. By 2009, n ew specialty retailers were no longer allowed t o sell products online anymore (current online retailers were \"grandfathered in\" and allowed to continue to sell online, however). Additionally, suppliers of the top s elling brands such as Nike had also begun to put more limits on retailers' ability to redu ce the price of their products. This is because t he top manufacturers wanted to h ave more control over the marketing and image of their products. A key variable in the volume of sales of running shoes and apparel is the number of participants in the sport. Over the past decade there has been a \"second running boom\" that has continued robustly with more non -traditional running events and record numbers of finishers (Running USA, 2014). Over the last five years (2004 to 2009), total running participation (defined a s the number of peopl e who participated in a t least one running event over the year) increased from about 25 million participants in 2004 to about 32 million participants in 2009 -- a 28% increase. Analysts attribute the record growth in participation to a number of factors including the rise in the number of running destination vacations that offer participants the opportunity to combine running with leisure activities, frequent charitable and socially -oriented running events, and an interest in new wearable technology and ap ps that provide running enthusiasts new ways to measure their progress and share their training and results with others. Although growth in the industry is expected to continue as the economy improve s, future sales are predicted to increase primarily in the higher quality performance -geared shoes and Page 40 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 apparel that are the focus of the specialty running store industry (Shaftoe, 2013). Leisure Trends Group, an industry research provider, however, e stimates total specialty running store industry sales at less than $1 billion annually (SportsInsight, 2013) . Despite the estimates, manufacturers and large sporting goods stores are increasing ly entering the market with their own version of brand- specific specialty runni ng store . Asics recently opened a running -focused retail store in New York City offering their running shoe and apparel line complimented by state -of-the-art \"Foot ID\" technology to help runners select the best fit (Sports Insight, 2013). Dick's, a large sporting goods retailer, also recently opened its second specialty running store, \"True Runner\" in St. Louis, MO with plans to expand to other markets. DEVELOPING COMPETITI VE STRATEGY THROUGH THE USE OF PORTER'S COMPETITIVE FORCES A NALYSIS Michael Porter, one of the nation's leading strategy experts, developed an analysis tool to measure the impact of the basic competitive forces driving competitor control and industry profits. Companies use this tool to carefully scan the environment in order to determi ne the amount of competitive intensity (or rivalry) , control, and potential profitability of a new business opportunity . According to Porter (2008), the important competitive forces that drive control and profitability are: (1) the potential threat of ne w entrants, (2) the rivalry among existing firms, (3) the threat of substitute products or services, (4) the bargaining power of suppliers, (5) the bargaining power of buyers, and (6) the power of other stakeholders such as the government and the local com munity. Using his model, a high force would be regarded as a threat because it is likely to reduce the amount of control and, thus, reduce profit potential. In the short run, these forces may act as constraints on a company's activities, but in the long run it may be possible for a company to adjust its strategy in order to change or dilute the strength of one or more forces (Wheelen and Hunger, 2010). Based on the analysis of these six important competitive forces, a company can choose a competitive str ategy that allows it to most effectively compete by diluting the effects of certain forces or creating barriers to market entry that buffer it from potential new market entrants. Before choosing a competitive strategy, companies need to assess their stren gths versus competition and then ask two questions: (1) should (can) we compete long -term on the basis of lower cost, or should we differentiate based on something else such as our products or services?, and (2) should we aim at a broad target market or f ocus on a more narrow market niche? Answering these two questions points the company in the direction of one of the following five generic competitive strategies: (1) Cost Leadership (example: Walmart); (2) Broad Differentiation (example: Saks Fifth Aven ue); (3) Cost Focus (example: The Dollar Store); (4) Differentiation Focus (example: specialty retailers); or (5) Best Value or Best Cost (example: Target ). The \"cost leadership\" strategy targets a broad mass market and requires \"aggressive construction of efficient -scale facilities, vigorous pursuit of cost reductions from experience, tight cost and overhead control, avoidance of marginal customer accounts, and cost minimization in areas like R&D and marketing\" (Porter, 1980, p. 35). Differentiation str ategies (broad and Page 41 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 focused) involve the creation of a valuable uniqueness in the product or service. This uniqueness costs the company more money to develop, but it allows the company to charge a higher premium for its product that can lead to higher prof itability and customer loyalty (think Apple!). The \"Best Value\" strategy, or sometimes referred to as \"Best Cost,\" can be focused or broad and is a blend of both the different iation and low cost strategies. In a best value strategy, the company makes a p roduct or delivers a service that is more upscale, or more valuable, when compa red to the low cost competitor. Therefore, competitors using a best value strategy charge higher prices overall than low cost competitors, but customers feel they are getting m ore overal l value for their money spent. If Walmart is an example of a broad low cost strategy, then Target would be an ex ample of a best value strategy. Target's merchandising and service are a little more upscale and their overall prices are a little higher. However, Target customers keep coming back because they value this difference and are willing to pay more for it. DEVELOPING BIG DOG'S COMPETITIVE STRATEGY THROUGH THE USE OF PORTER'S COMPETITIVE FORCES ANALYSIS The choice of competitive stra tegy is determined through an analysis of the company's strengths and the six competitive forces. Firms should choose a competitive strategy that matches their strengths and allows them to dilute high forces and gives them the potential to create barriers to market entry. Based on an analysis of the cur rent local market , John and Reggie need ed to develop an appropriate business strategy that capitalizes on their own strengths and reduces their competi tive weaknesses. Since they were going to be a small retailer with limited resources, they need ed to decide where to focus their resources and efforts. John and Reggie were faced with the challenge of figuring out how to allocate their limited resources in a way that would allow them t o carve out a niche and effectively compete with the large sporting go ods chains, like Dick's, and established online retailers , like Zappos or Amazon . And since they couldn't sell their products online due t o supplier agreements, they were also trying to determine exactly what role technology should play in th e company's business strategy. They felt that even on a limited budget they would somehow be able to effectively differentiate their store to bring in new customers and develop customer loyalty in the local market. But, they knew it was not going to be an easy task. John and Reggie began to wonder if it was possible.

Eisner, Pace University Helaine J. Korn , Baruch College , CUNY CASE DESCRIPTION This case is primarily intended for use in the corporate strategy section of a busine ss policy or competitive strategy course. It can be used as an overview of the many decisions and actions that an organization has to undertake to sustain a competitive advantage. This case can also be used to augment discussions of strategic analysis, spe cifically both internal and external environmental analysis and strategic formulation. The case is rich enough for advanced and graduate students, and has been developed in a manner that will allow students to diagnose the root(s) of the company's issue(s) as detailed in the case, and then form opinions and suggestions for any strategy that the company should pursue. In doing this, students should consider the activities, history, and goals of the company as presented. It would be effective at the business strategy level, especially, to discuss the implications of industry life cycles, and at the corporate strategy level to discuss implications of diversification. The case also lends itself to discussions of strategic implementation and the effect of leaders hip on innovation, especially when trying to maintain a mature brand. CASE SYNOPSIS Starbucks entered the Indian market in October 2012 by forming a 50:50 joint venture with the Tata Group . The Indian Caf\u00e9 market offered a lot of potential for the new Tat a Starbucks alliance. While India was a nation known for its tea drinkers, sipping coffee and socializing at coffee shops was becoming increasingly popular. Domestic consumption of coffee had risen up 80% in the past decade. The joint venture appeared to be at the crossroads of an important strategic decision. It could either revert to a plan to grow its store count aggressively muc h like it did in the US. It is possible that this was the original intent. After all, the initial launch pricing had been set to be competitive with Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day's (CCD) pricing (coffee drinks available for as low as Rs 100 a). Alternately, it could choose to embrace a premium -priced, niche approach similar to the one it had used successfully in other Asian countries like Japan and China. The premium offering would then cater to an older, business elite with higher spending power. This would result in less rapid growth with a cherry -picked list of high profile, business -friendly locations that could also allow it to buil d a premium brand with premium pricing. a Assumed 50 Rs = 1 US Dollar Page 44 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Would Starbucks and Tata under Davda's leadership finally be able to crack the code for sustained success in the competitive and complex Indian market? While Davda appeared proud of what the alliance had achieved a t the 2014 Starbucks annual shareholders meeting, some critical strategic choices would need to be made to ensure the long term success of Starbucks in India. HOW TO ACHIEVE LONG TERM SUCCESS: THE MILLION RUPEE QUESTION Starbucks had had its eye on the la rge Indian market for a while. An attempt to enter the market in 2007 had failed due to complications with the Indian government and foreign direct investment (FDI) restrictionsb. The company had withdrawn its application then and was an eager responder when India's esteemed Tata Group knocked on its door with a partnership opportunity. A 50:50 joint venture was formed and Starbucks coffee was introduced to the Indian market in October 2012 with a generous initial investment of $80 million. (Bahree, 2012 ) In the 2012 annual report for Tata Global Beverages c, the Board o f Directors expressed a lot of excitement about the potential of the newly formed joint venture between the company and Starbucks. \" Through Tata Starbucks, your company offers the legendary Starbucks coffee experience, backed by the trust of the Tata name, to the Indian consumer, \" announced Cyrus P. Mistry, Chairman, Tata Global Beverages. (Tata, 2012 ) The Indian caf\u00e9 market offered a lot of potential for the new Tata Starbucks alliance. While India was a nation k nown for its tea drinkers, sipping coffee and socializing at coffee shops was becoming increasingly popular. Domestic consumption of coffee had risen up 80% in the past decade. Given these encouraging trends, Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz, believed that India could one day rival the company's successful venture in China. With its store count exceeding 40, the Tata Starbucks joint venture had clearly come a long way since it was kicked off in January 2012, but it was too early to celebrate. Continuing to succeed in the Indian caf\u00e9 market would not be an easy task due to two key challenges - competition and profitability. The market was intensely competitive with multiple domestic and foreign players. The most formidable competitor was domestic giant, Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which had already adopted a strategy of flooding the market with its cafes, closely mimicking what Starbucks had done in the US. Another critical challenge before companies was the ability to break even. High real estate costs and rental rates, along with competitive pricing pressures and India -specific cultural preferences, made it extremely difficult for coffee companies to recover their initial investments. Tata Starbucks CEO Davda admitted the initial consumer experiences had b een a humbling experience. Tata Starbucks had opened its first store with a lot of fanfare in the trendy b The Government of India at the time permitted foreign retailers a maximum ownership stake of only 51%. c Tata Global Beverages is the Tata Group subsidiary that manages coffee and tea sales. Page 45 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Horniman Circle area of Mumbai in October 2012. Despite having a high profile local partner, Starbucks was unable to use its name to secure any disco unted rates in renting real estate. The first store was eventually opened in a Tata Group owned 4000 square foot site that had been lying vacant for a while. By Q 3 2014, it appeared to have expanded to nearly 50 locations across the country in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Bengaluru (PTI, 2014 ). Yet, this was well short of the initial expectations - the target at launch had been set at 50 stores by end of the 2012 launch year . Clearly, something had changed in management expectations of the size or pace of growth from the venture. Quarterly earnings presentations since had boasted of rob ust store profitability with no numbers provided, possibly pointing to a slower and more selective approach to expansion (Tata, 2014 ). The j oint venture appeared to be at the crossroads of an important strategic decision. It could either revert to a plan to grow its store count aggressively much like it did in the US. It is possible that this was the original intent. After all, the initial launch pricing had been set to be competitive with CCD's pricing (coffee drinks available for as low as Rs 100d). This approach was putting it in direct price competition with CCD, the domestic caf\u00e9 market leader. However, gaining market share among th e youth of the country would allow it to tap into a large demographic segment. India's population showed a pronounced skew to younger age brackets (see Exhibit 1) and lower incomes when compared to other countries like Japan and the US. Building a presen ce within these segments as CCD had done, could be critical to succeed in the long term . Alternately, it could choose to embrace a premium -priced, niche approach similar to the one it had used successfully in other Asian count ries like Japan and China. The premium offering would then cater to an older, business elite with higher spending power. This would d Assumed 50 Rs = 1 US Dollar Page 46 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 result in less rapid growth with a cherry -picked list of high profile, business -friendly locations that could also allow i t to build a premium brand with premium pricing. Would Starbucks and Tata under Davda's leadership finally be able to crack the code for sustained success in the competitive and complex Indian market? While Davda appeared proud of what the alliance had a chieved at the 2014 Starbucks annual shareholders meeting, some critical strategic choices would need to be made to ensure the long term success of Starbucks in India. SCHULTZ & STARBUCKS | CULTIVATING A COMP ANY FROM AN IDEA Starbucks started out in 1971 w ith a single coffee roaster and retailer store in the Pike Place Market in Seattle. Since then the company had expanded its global footprint considerably with over 17,000 coffee stores in more than 50 countries (Starbucks, 2014 ). The visionary behind this international success story was CEO, Howard Schultz. Schultz had joined the co mpany in 1981 and quickly assessed its growth potential after visiting coffee houses in Italy. He envisioned his coffee houses offering much more than just a cup of coffee. They were to become a third place for people to meet and socialize, in addition t o home and work. In addition to serving coffee, the coffee houses would help people connect with other people and their local communities. Employees would be recruited and trained on coffee, company products and customer service to deliver a positive \"S tarbucks Experience\" to each and every customer. The company also quickly acquired a reputation for being an employer of choice and a socially responsible player. When the company went public in 1992, all employees were made \"partners\" in the company and given a share of company equity (aka bean stock). Comprehensive healthcare coverage was also provided to both full time and part time employees. Further, efforts were made to ethically source products and establish strong relationships with coffee pro ducing farmers all over the world. In later years, the company began to utilize reusable and recyclable cups in its stores. Last but not least, its employee partners contributed several hours of volunteer work to help with community causes. After the 2008/2009 recession and the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, several companies began to cut employee benefits to manage costs. Schultz refused to reduce benefits for his partners arguing that this was a short term reaction and not in the interests of a company in the long term. The company's mission was to inspire and nurture the human spirit one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time. The company had plans of doing this not just in the US but across the globe. The Starbucks name had be en taken from a character in Herman Melville's classic adventure novel, Moby Dick. It was felt that the history of the coffee trade and Seattle had a strong association with the sea. In keeping with the sea theme, the image of a Norse twin tailed siren w as also adopted as the company logo. (Starbucks, 2014 ) Page 47 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 The company under Schultz' s leadership had performed remarkably well financially over time. Performance in 2013 showed total revenues up 12% to $14.9B, same store sales up 7%, and $2.9 billion in cash flow. Operating income, however, was hit due to a one -time litigation charge w ith Kraft Foods Global, which resulted in a pretax charge to fiscal 2013 operating results of $2.8 billion. When excluding this one -time charge, operating income would have grown 23% to $2.5 billion (Starbucks, 2013 ). INITIAL EXPANSION IN TO ASIA | TARGETING THE WESTERNIZED AND THE WEALTHY The first store outside North America opened in the fashionable Ginza district in Japan in 1996. Within the next few years, Starbucks had become a well -known brand name in Japan. Like Starbucks shops in the United States, those in Japan featured comfy sofas with American music playing in the background. Unlike most Japanese kisaten , or local coffee shops, Starbucks did not allow smoking. The policy pro ved popular with women who didn't smoke as much as men in Japan. Men eventually followed the women to Starbucks locations and business started humming. Given the strong performance, the stock of Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd. made its debut on the NASDAQ Ja pan exchange and has performed strongly ever since. ''Any way you measure it, we've exceeded our wildest expectations,'' CEO Howard Schultz announced jubilantly, at the initial public offering in Tokyo, October 2001. Tea-drinking Japan was not a total str anger to coffee. Dutch traders first brought coffee to Japan in the 17th century, but the shogun prohibited them from traveling freely in Japan, so very few Japanese were exposed to coffee mainly in port cities like Nagasaki. Coffee penetrated Japan furth er in the 1850s with the arrival of American ships. Soon after, Japanese started to travel overseas and brought back elements of the European coffee culture. The first coffee shop opened in 1880s in Tokyo's Ueno district, and drinking the brew became as sociated with the wealthy classes. Over the next few decades, coffee increased in popularity within Japan and a number of coffee chains entered the market. As business flourished between the US and Japan, many Japanese traveled to the United States. Wes t Coast cities like Seattle were popular destinations. So when Starbucks finally entered Japan in 1996, many Japanese were already familiar with the brand. Starbucks soon cultivated a loyal clientele of wealthy Japanese who considered it to be the origina l gourmet coffee shop and aspired to emulate the Western lifestyle. Starbucks Coffee Japan turned its first profit in 2000, nearly four years after its initial launch. Clearly Starbucks entered markets with a commitment to win them over the long haul. Starbucks now has over 1000 stores in the country. For a while, sales volume per store was twice as high as in the United States . (Belson, 2001 ) Between 1996 and 1999, Starbucks expanded to additional markets that had a high number of international travelers and a growing segment of Westernized and wealthy locals. These were countries with high or growing per capita incomes (see Exhibit 2). Page 48 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Starbucks Singapore opened its first store in December 1996 at Liat Towers, strategically locat ed along the nation's renowned Orchard Road shopping belt. It then entered the Philippines (1997), Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia (1998), and South Korea (1999), once again selecting premium locations frequented by the country's growing Westernized, affluen t classes and international travelers. (Starbucks, 2014 ) Happy with its initial su ccesses, Starbucks began planning expansions into countries with more entrenched cultures and large, diverse populations. NEXT EXPANSION WAVE | CRACKING THE CULTU RAL CODES Unlike Japan, tea -drinking China had little prior experience with coffee. In addit ion, the emerging superpower had deeply entrenched cultural traditions with regards to food and drink. Succeeding in China would be a critical challenge and opportunity for Starbucks. Cracking the cultural code here, could provide for conquering other em erging markets like India. Starbucks had opened its first store in Beijing in 1999. The company figured out there was a universal need for being respected for our differences and feeling connected with others. Starbucks was catering to this need with its culture and values in a way that was conducive to local values and tastes. Within China, instant coffee accounted for upwards of 80 percent of all coffee consumption. Given the average Chinese consumer's limited prior exposure to coffee, this proved to be a highly effective and affordable way of expanding consumption. Starbucks has taken a different approach and targets the affluent Chinese consumers with beverages priced up to 50 percent higher than the prices at its US stores. Most Starbucks beverage s in China will cost upwards of 30RMB (or about US$5). In contrast, Nestl\u00e9's Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee can cost as little as RMB1.5 (US$0.10) per packet. Page 49 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Fueled by Starbucks, the wealthy commercial capital Shanghai, quickly became the coffee culture capital of China. The o wner of Shanghai -based Caf\u00e9 del Volc\u00e1n, one of Shanghai's popular coffee retail outlets, noticed an interesting phenomenon in the initial days after opening his cafe. The prices had not yet been displayed, and most customers just ordered their beverages with only a few inquiring about prices. Clearly the Shanghai elite were not price sensitive. Much like Starbucks, the caf\u00e9 then began to focus primarily on achieving the highest level of quality and service. In 2011, a Starbucks outlet in Ch ina averaged US$600,000 in annual revenues. The strategy proved to be successful with Starbucks' Chinese outlets becoming more profitable than those in the US market. China/Asia Pacific operating margins in the last quarter of 2012 were 33.7 percent in c omparison to 20.8 percent in the United States. \"It's no doubt that one day China will become our second largest market after the United States, and it's possible that, over many years, potentially the largest one,\" mused Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz in a n interview with China Daily. While Nestl\u00e9 and Starbucks had radically different methods for getting the Chinese to drink coffee, both succeeded. This success in part can be attributed to segmenting the market and recognizing the Chinese as unique consumer s with different tastes and habits than those of American consumers. For instance, Chinese consumers did not like the bitter taste associated with black coffee or espresso, so both players have tailored their beverages accordingly. Nestl\u00e9's Nescaf\u00e9 packet s include sugar and powdered milk, while Starbucks emphasizes milk -based drinks like frappuccinos, lattes and mochas in their stores. Starbucks' Chinese menus also added some local flavor, with customized choices like green tea tiramisu and Chinese moon cakes. In addition, Starbucks localized its outlets by offering large seating areas since Chinese tend to not like to take their drinks to go. Local Chinese customers began to enjoy the \"Starbucks experience\" while sitting with friends and having somethin g to munch on along with their coffee. Further, \"family forums\" were introduced to explain to parents the merits of having their children working at Starbucks. Large lounges with couches were provided at stores to accommodate the need for working custome rs to relax for a bit during afternoons. Menus were modified to include foods that were tailored to local tastes e.g. a Hainan Chicken sandwich and a Thai-style Prawn wrap (Burkitt, 2012 ). By the end of 2013, it had opened its 1000 th store in the country. It was this success in China that made Schultz pa rticularly eager to venture into India. Like China, India was another large market with culturally entrenched tastes (Barlow, 2013 ). \"Our stores domestically and around the world, have become the third place for customers between home and work. The environment, the store design, the free Wi -Fi \u2014 everything we've been abl e to do has created this primary destination. That is the same in Honshu, (China), in Beijing, in Shanghai, in Spain, in Tokyo or in New York City. We've cracked the code on universal relevance,\" CEO Howard Schultz later reminisced in an interview in 2013( Bartiromo, 2013 ). Page 50 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 CONQUERING UNFAMILIA R MARKETS | SEEKING THE MAGIC FO RMULA With Starbucks' stellar performance in its initial expansion into Asia, numerous industry analysts speculated on the best practices that could be used by the company to penetrate other markets or emulated by other companies (Wang, 2012 ). Three key themes emerged ... 1. Be Tactful in Marketing the Brand: Once Starbucks decided to enter China, it implemented a smart market entry strategy. It did not use any advertising and promotions that could be perceived by the Chinese as an American intrusion into the local tea -drinking culture. It just quietly focused on c arefully selecting premium locations to build its brand image. Further, Starbucks capitalized on the tea -drinking culture of Chinese consumers by introducing beverages using popular local ingredients such as green tea. It also added more milk based bever ages, e.g., frappuccinos, since the Chinese did not like the taste of bitter coffee. 2. Find a Good Local Partner: Working with right partners can be an effective way to reach local customers and expand quickly without going through a significant learning c urve. China was not one homogeneous market. There are many Chinas. The culture from northern China is very different from that of the east. Consumer spending power inland is not on par with that in coastal cities. To address this complexity of the Chinese market, Starbucks partnered with three regional partners as part of its expansion plans. In the north, Starbucks entered a joint -venture with Beijing Mei Da coffee company. In the east, Starbucks partnered with the Taiwan -based Uni -President. In the south, Starbucks worked with Hong Kong -based Maxim's Caterers. Each partner brings different strengths and local expertise that helped Starbucks gain insights into the tastes and preferences of local Chinese consumers. 3. Make a Long Term Commitment: Long term comm itment means patience. It took Starbucks time to educate the market and gain customer loyalty. Starbucks also did an excellent job in recruiting and training its employees. This turned out to be a win -win strategy because employees were after all the face of the Starbucks brand and at the heart of delivering the \"Starbucks Experience\" to customers. These learnings armed Starbucks as it prepared to penetrate an even more complex and competitive market - India. Page 51 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 PASSAGE TO INDIA | T ATA GROUP A WORTHY P ARTNER Founded by Jamsetji Tata in 1868, Tata's early years were inspired by the spirit of nationalism. It pioneered several industries of national importance in India: steel, power, hospitality and airlines. In more recent times, its pioneering spirit had been s howcased by companies such as TCS, India's first software company, and Tata Motors, which made India's first indigenously developed car, the Tata Indica, and the world's most affordable car, the Tata Nano. The Tata Group comprised over 100 operating compan ies in seven business sectors: communications and information technology, engineering, materials, services, energy, consumer products and chemicals. The group had operations in more than 100 countries across six continents, and its companies exported produ cts and services to 150 countries. Along with an increasing global footprint of Tata companies, the Tata brand was also gaining international recognition. In 2010, BusinessWeek magazine ranked had Tata 17th among the '50 Most Innovative Companies' list. Brand Finance, a UK- based consultancy firm, valued the Tata brand at $18 billion and ranked it 39th among the top 500 most valuable global brands in their BrandFinance\u00ae Global 500 2013 report. Like Starbucks, Tata had a strong belief in social responsibi lity. The company had created national institutions for science and technology, medical research, social studies, and the performing arts. The trusts had also provided aid and assistance to non -government organizations (NGOs) working in the areas of educa tion, healthcare, and livelihoods. Individual Tata companies had also been known to extend social welfare activities to communities around their industrial units. The Tata name had been respected in India for more than 140 years for its adherence to str ong values and business ethics. The total revenue of Tata companies was $97 billion in 2012 -13, with nearly two thirds coming from business outside India. Tata companies employed over half a million people worldwide. Every Tata company or enterprise opera ted independently. Each of these companies has its own board of directors and shareholders. The major Tata companies were Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Tata Power, Tata Chemicals, Tata Teleservices, Titan Watches, Tata Communi cations, Indian Hotels, and Tata Global Beverages. Much like Starbucks, the Tata Global Beverages unit was looking for a retail partner to sell its coffee products. Its broad product portfolio also included tea and bottled water. Much like its Tata Group parents and Starbucks, Tata Global Beverages also prided itself with having strong values and purpose as a company. Thus a promising partnership was formed, and Starbucks was ready to make a grand entry into the market. (Tata, 2014 ) COFFEE IN INDIA | AN EXISTING BUT LESSER KNOWN TRADITION Unlike China, tea -drinking parts of South India did have some historical experience with coffee. The cro p was first cultivated in Ethiopia, and by the 1600s was hugely popular Page 52 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 throughout the Ottoman Empire. The Turks boiled or roasted coffee beans before they left the Yemeni port of Mocha to keep them from being grown elsewhere, according to coffee historian and author Mark Pendergrast. That is why, according to legend, a 17th -century Muslim pilgrim named Baba Budan taped seven coffee beans to his stomach and smuggled them to India. The hills where he planted those beans are now known as the Bababudan Giris . When the British arrived in the 1600s, looking at first to break a Dutch monopoly on the spice trade, tea and coffee were \"backyard crops\" in India. Over the centuries, the British installed plantations and established more organized production processe s. Tea, which was a much larger crop, was grown mostly in the north, while coffee was grown mostly in the south. For decades, the Coorg (aka Kodavu) region in South India had been home to coffee plantations. The British began planting coffee here in the 1 9th century. When India gained independence in 1947, the original British planters sold their estates to the locals (aka Kodavas) and other South Indians. Since the Indian government changed its policies and allowed farmers to take control of their own sa les in the mid -'90s, India's coffee industry had seen a boost in quality and profits, and had taken a seat in gourmet coffee circles. (Allison, 2010 ) With the alliance, Starbucks gained access to locally produced premium quality beans from Tata owned plantations in the Coorg region. Tata Coffee, a unit of Ta ta Global Beverages, produced more than 10,000 metric tons of shade grown Arabica and Robusta coffees at its 19 estates in South India (Badrinath, 2012 ). A strategic asset for Starbucks as it prepared to do battle with the domestic giant, CCD. INDIAN CAF\u00c9 MARKET | DOMINATED BY CAF\u00c9 CO FFEE DAY By 20 14, the Indian coffee house market was $300M strong and growing at a robust 20% rate from year to year. While the market was crowded with international and domestic players, Starbucks' true competition came from a domestic giant, Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (aka CCD ). The presence of international coffee chains was significant but the cumulative number of these outlets put together was only about a third of the 1,500 outlets operated by home -grown CCD. (Madonna, 2013) CCD had been the market leader since its beginnings as a \"cyber caf\u00e9\" in 1996. As the retailing arm of the nearly 150 year old Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Company Limited (ABCTCL), it had the benefit of sourcing its coffee locally from a network of ABCTCL owned coffee plantations and using ABCTCL manufactured cof fee roasting machines. These allowed CCD to insulate itself from global price fluctuations and serve coffee at lower prices than the competition. Most of the foreign competitors relied on imported coffee and foreign roasting machines. (CCD, 2014) ABCTCL 's charismatic CEO, V. G. Siddhartha, rapidly expanded CCD stores across the country. The mission of the company was to provide a world class coffee house experience at affordable prices. This had made the stores ubiquitous, much like Starbucks stores in the US. It also made CCD the destination of choice for the youth in the country who had limited money to Page 53 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 spend and were looking for socially acceptable places to socialize. The majority of India still disapproved of socializing at bars, and cafes offered a respectable alternative. A 2014 industry study showed the CCD brand was synonymous with cof fee for most coffee drinkers in India. (Kaushik, 2011 ) After CCD, the next b iggest player was the Barista's chain which started in 2000. Tata Global Beverages had briefly explored the option of partnering with Barista (2001 -2004) to sell its coffees, but eventually sold its stake. In keeping with its premium positioning, most of Barista's products were imports and its coffee roasted in Venice, Italy. In 2007, it was acquired by Italian coffee company, Lavazza. However, profits had proven elusive despite several years on the market and heavy investments. In 2013, Lavazza announ ced it would sell the Barista's business. Industry watchers say that the business is becoming difficult to turn profitable even after years of operations. High rental expenses and intense competition had made most foreign players struggle to achieve pro fitability despite years of trying. According to industry estimates, rentals could account for 15 -25% of the cost of running a cafe chain. Typical monthly rental market rates were Rs 200 -300 per square foot of real estate (Srivastava, 2012 ). Then, there was the investment in making a store appealing to cu stomers with its interiors, finding people to run them and building a food and beverage menu that was hip enough to keep 18 -24 year -olds \u2014 the target market for many coffee chains \u2014 coming back for more. CCD had found a way around this problem by entering into a revenue- sharing deal, paying 10 -20% of a unit's proceeds as a fee. Error! Bookmark not defined. Coffee through bars was a sit -in concept in India where consumers generally hung around such outlets for hour s compared to the global phenomenon of grabbing coffee on the go from generally tiny outlets and kiosks (Sachitanand, 2014 ). Industry experts argued that coffee chains in India must maintain elaborate and plush outlets - and not kiosks - to give Indian consumers what they are looking from a coffee chain even if the proposition turned out to be very expensive, which is making it difficult for many companies to stay in the business and hard to scale up. Unlike countries like the US where purchasing coffee was often a quick transaction at a counter or kiosk for customers on the go, the culture in India was to sit down and socialize for hours over coffee or tea (Bailay, 2014 ). Some frustrated customers stopped frequenting stores because it was so hard to find a free table (Kaushik, 2011 ). This made it much harder for coffee retailers to churn a profit. According to Manmeet Vohra, the Tata Starbucks marketing and category chief, peak hours in India were 2 pm to 6 pm (compared to 5 am to 11 am in the US) and takeout orders accounted for barely a fifth of their business in India (compared to 80% in the US) (Sachitanand, 2014 ). Other international entrants like the UK's Costa Coffee, the US based Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Company, and Australia's Gloria Jean's Coffee experienced similar profitability challenges (Bailay, 2014 ). Costa Coffee had entered the market in 2005 and soon found its stores were too smal l to handle the peak time crowds. The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Company had started out in 2007 and tried to entice customers by offering new menu items each month. Gloria Jean's Coffee had entered the market in 2008 hoping it could crack the profitabil ity code Page 54 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 by serving coffee in more kiosks, which required a lower capital investment. However, achieving profitability continued to remain elusive for most international players. Starbucks appeared to be doing well in its initial stores. In quarterly i nvestor presentations, Tata Global Beverages reported robust profitability in its stores. While no numbers were shared by the company, the information was corroborated by industry experts. The 4000 square foot Horniman Circle store was estimated to be ge nerating Rs 8.5 lakhs in daily sales, which compared to Rs 1 lakh generated by the 400 square foot CCD store at the Mumbai airport. Top Indian store revenues in US dollars were comparable to those generated out of the stores in China (~$600,000 per year since the real estate was obtained from the Tata Group, it is clear that at least the first store was percolating a healthy profit. QUICK SERVICE RESTAU RANT CHAINS | A LOOM ING THREAT In addition to traditional coffee chains, the Indian caf\u00e9 market was b eing encroached upon by other quick service restaurant (QSR) options like McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts. These players threatened to steal market share with lower priced options to drink coffee at existing quick service establishments. One of the major a dvantages for these over Starbucks and other competitors was the already existing network of locations in the country that allowed ready access and an ability to bring down establishment costs. Further, this ubiquity and lower pricing would allow these players to tap into the larger demographic segments that made up a large section of the Indian population. \"McDonald's has the advantage as their ability to expand is better, considering that they have a larger footprint now, \" Amit Jatia, Vice -Chairman and C EO, Hardcastle Restaurants which is the McDonald's franchise for South Indian operations. Price is another factor where McCafe is expected to hold an edge over Starbucks and other giants. Getting a cappuccino for Rs. 90 at a global brand like McCafe sounds more appealing than spending in excess of Rs. 110 for the same drink at Starbucks. Much like Starbucks, McCafe will source its coffee from Chikmagalur in Karnataka (Unknown, 2013 ). TATA STARBUCKS | CHA LLENGING DECISION A HEAD \"We have studied and evaluated the market carefully to ensure we are entering India the most respectful way. We believe the size of the economy, the rising spending power and the growth of caf\u00e9 culture hold strong potential for our growth and we are t hrilled to be here and extend our high -quality coffee, handcrafted beverages, locally relevant food, legendary service and the unique Starbucks Experience to customers here, \" said John Culver, president, Starbucks Coffee China and Asia Pacific (Bhattacharya, 2013 ). Page 55 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 The business looked simple - have a standardize d decor, choose a suitable location and offer good coffee and food - but ensuring that a customer's cappuccino tasted the same as it did yesterday and a service that did justice to the iconic Starbucks brand name every single day, was far more complex. Wh at it required were carefully selected partners (store managers and stewards who went through intensive training) and an incredibly complex planning effort. That's why Starbucks had decided to avoid the franchisee route that could have seemed like the obvi ous choice for rapid expansion. Also, Starbucks had to make sure to meet the expectations of its world -travelled customers, who were aware of the Starbucks experience. Many of these customers would check whether the coffee tasted the same as it did abroa d, and whether the store ambience was equally comfortable. If the experiences matched up, they would become regulars. But for sustained success, Starbucks needed to penetrate the domestic young and middle income markets. Starbucks laid out plans for d ifferent formats, such as \"abbreviated stores\" that would be smaller in size and stores at college and school campuses. The stores in India also began experimenting with their food menu. While Starbucks globally offered blueberry and chocolate muffins, it wanted to serve local innovations at its Indian locations. Coinciding with its first anniversary, the company launched a new local India Estates blend. This blend was Tata Starbucks' special country -specific coffee, developed thoughtfully with Tata for the Indian market and reflected the high quality Arabica coffee available in India. Additionally, the company launched the Indian Espresso Roast which was sourced locally through a coffee sourcing and roasting agreement between Starbucks and Tata. It was fel t that the coffees captured the essence and rich heritage of the Indian coffee history. The challenge ahead of Davda and Tata Starbucks was a difficult one. How could it maximize the long term success of the venture in India? This would mean going beyo nd the \"westernized and the wealthy\" targeting that had worked so well in relatively older and more affluent Asian markets. While the partnership with Tata was occasionally helping in negotiating for good real estate, it also would still need to figure o ut how to leverage the partnership to win over the larger young and middle income demographic segments. Store financials would need to be figured out to maintain profitability. These questions would need to be answered quickly as the company prepared to expand into the next tier of Indian cities.

Secondary is sues examine d include counter -party ri sk and explo iting a comparat ive advantag e. The case requires students to have an introdu ctory knowledge of account ing, statistics, finance and international busin ess thus the case has a difficulty level of four (senior level) or higher. The case is designed to be taught in one class session of appro ximately 3 hour s and is expected to require 3-4 hours of preparation time from the stud ents. CASE SYNOPSIS St. Louis Ch emical (SLC) is a regional chemical distributor, h eadquart ered in St. Louis. Don Williams, the Pr esident and primary owner, b egan SLC ten years ago af ter a suc cessful career in chemical sales and marketing. The company has gradually expand ed its produ ct line and network of manufa ctures. Five years age, SLC comple ted a joint venture with a German chemical distributer that include d the opt ion purchase the r emaining 49% interest in the foreign subsidiary at a pred etermined price. SLC is currently consid ering whether to exercise the option and more spe cifically, how to financ e the debt needed to comple te the purchase and reduce the additional curren cy risk that would accompany the conversion of the joint venture to a whol ly owned subsidiary. BACKGROUN D St. Louis Chemical (SLC) is a regional chemical distributor, h eadqu artered in St. Louis. Don Williams, the President and primary own er, began SLC ten years ago after a successful career in chemical sales and marketing. The company reported small losses during its first two years of operation but has since reported eight consecutive years of increasing s ales and profits. The growth has required the acquis ition of additional land, e quipment, expansion of stor age capacity and more than tripling the size of the work force. SLC has become the leading distributor in the St. Louis area. Since beginning his career in the chemical distribution indust ry Williams has developed solid customer contacts in the St. Louis metropolitan area, as well as with major customers in Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana and Tennessee. He h as also developed valuable contacts with k ey chemical m anufacturers. A chemical distributor is a whole saler. Operations may vary but a typical distributor purchases chemicals in large quantities (bulk - barge, rail or truckloads) from a number of Page 58 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 manu facturers. They store bulk chemicals in \"tank farms\", a number of tanks surrounded by dikes to prevent pollution in the event of a tank failure. Tanks can receive and ship mate rials from all modes of t ransport ation. Packaged chemicals are store d in a warehous e. Other dist ributor activities include blendi ng, repackaging, and shippi ng in ler quantities (less than truc kload, tote tanks, 55-gallon drums, and other small er package si zes) to meet the needs of a variety of industrial users. In addition to the tank farm and warehous e, a distributor needs access to specialized delivery equipment (specialized truck transports, and tank rail cars) to meet the handling requirements of different chemicals. A distributor adds value by supp lying its customers with the chemicals they need, in the quantities they desire, when they need them. This requires maintaini ng a sizable inventor y and operating efficiently. Distributors usual ly operate on very thin profit margins. RMA Annual Statement Studies (2012-2013) indicates \"profit before taxes as a percentage of sales\" for Wholes alers - Chemicals and Allied Products, (SIC number 5169) r anges from 1.6 to 3.2% with an average of 2.7% . In addition to operating efficiently, a successful distributor will possess 1) a sol id customer base and 2) supplier contacts and contracts whi ch will ensure a complete product line is available at competitive prices. THE SITUATION In January, 2014, Don Williams returned from a week-long vacation in Mexico knowing he had a big decision in make. Back in 2009, Williams had received a phone call from Ruth Odar, the president of RMO International, a division of a much larger conglomerate Heidelbur g GmbH . RMO International is a regional chemical distributor loc ated in Frankfurt, Germany. Williams had first met Odar at the Asso ciation of Chemical Distributors annual trade show a few years earlier. Odar and Williams h ad spok en on nume rous o ccasions reg arding current ry conditions, since both were in similar busin esses. However, this phone call was a solicitation for a joint venture to buy a 51% stake in RMO International. The recent econom ic recession in Europe had left RMO Internationa l's conglomerate parent wi th liquidity issues and this pa rticular offer also included the right to buy the remaining 49% in 5 years at a predetermined price. After a series of negotiations, SLC had closed on a joint venture with Heidelburg on July 1, 2009 and as a result of the t ransaction, SLC will now h ave to make a decision whether to exercise the option to purchase the remaining 49% stake in RMO International or keep the existing joint venture agreement in place. Williams was reviewing the financial report prepared by the corporate finance division concerning the conve rsion of RMO International from a joint venture to a wholly owned subs idiary. On the surface , the fin ancial analysis favored the conve rsion of RMO International into a wholl y owned subsidiary. However, one of the most prominent uncert ainties in the analysis is the si gnificant foreign currency exchange rate exposure that would be transferred to SLC. Future euro cash flows generated by RMO would be remitted back to SLC and conve rted into US dollars at exchange rates that are not known today. If the euro strengthens in value from its current level, SLC will benefit from the higher conve rsion value and the return on investment increases. If the euro weakens in value from its current level, SLC will receive fe wer dol lars per euro and the return on i nvestment de creases. Page 59 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 The report contai ned a scenario analysis related to exchange rate risk. Under a mode rately neutral exchange rate fluctuation simulatio n, the conve rsion of euros to US dollars would result in a posit ive net present value with an 85% confid ence level (holding all other operational risk factors constant). However, under a mode rately weak euro exchange rate simulation, the positive net present value confidence level drops to unde r 65%. The p ersistently weak euro exchange rate scenario, while not highly probable, indicated a successful outco me will only occur about 35% of the time. There was a note at the end of the scenario analysis suggesting a currency swap agreement as a possible w ay to mitigate the exchange rate risk but no formal a nalysis had been completed to da te. In the capital requirements section of the report, it was suggested that SLC would need to borrow the equivalent of about $135 million in order to raise the 100 million euros necessary for the deal at the current exchange rate of $1.35/EUR. SLC's US invest ment bank had estimate d SLC could conservatively raise $135 million by issuing 5.9% annua l coupon bonds at face value with a 5 year matur ity. Zeutsche Bank (which had handled the joint venture between SLC and Heidelbur g five years ago) had propos ed a 5-year 100 million Eurobond d enominated in euros that would need to carry a 6.1% annua l coupon in order to sell at face value. The report did note that althoug h the coupo n rate was higher, future euro cash flows from RMO would likely be sufficient to cover the Eurobond coupon payments. In addition, this would significantly reduce the amount the euro cash flows remitted back to SLC and thus significantly reduce the exchange rate risk emb edded in the deal. After reading the entire report, Williams knew there were other important factors in the analysis to discuss with the corporate finance division such as demand forecasts, pricing pressure and margin variations, but it was the exchange rate risk that was particul arly troubling to Williams. Williams had a firm grasp of the operational risks of the chemical distribution busin ess, but his unde rstanding of the foreign exchange rate market was limited. While the foreign exchange rate risk was significant, Williams w asn't su re he wanted to pay 20 basis points on a loan equiva lent to $135 million for five years to reduce the exchange rate risk. What he really wanted was the lower borrowing costs in the US dollar market and a reduction in the future exchange rate exposure . Williams decide to explore the earlier sugg estion of a currency sw ap a little further. Williams did a quick search on currency swaps and according to Wikipedia, the currency swap has three main uses: 1) to secure cheaper debt, 2) to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations, and 3) to defend against financial turmoil by allowing a country beset by a liquidity crisis to borrow money from other s with its own currency. Williams also read that currency swaps were originally conceived in the 1970s to circumvent foreign exchange controls in the United King dom. They had also been used extensiv ely by the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis of 2008 and a more recent currency swap agreements worth about $10 billion had been established by South Korea and Indon esia. According to the Bank of International Settleme nts, the notion amount of currency swaps has risen from $14 trillion in 2007 to $26 trillion by 2013. Williams had not been familiar with the concept of a currency swap before, but was interested in learning more about them. Page 60 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Williams went in to the office of his CFO, James Black, to discuss the possible advantages and disad vantages of borrowing euros to finance the acquisition. Black had commented that while Williams was on vacat ion, Zeutsche Bank had contacted him regarding a possible currency swap transaction with one of Zeutsche Bank's European customers, Eagle Aero. Eagle Aero, an aerospace firm with produc tion and a ssembl y plants in both France and the United States, is interested in making a substantial upgrade to its largest US subsidiary div ision located in Dallas, TX. Eagle Aero would prefer to borrow US dollars but has found it is relative ly expensive to issue debt denominated in US dollars. Eagle Aero plans to use the US dollars generated by its US subsidiary to repay the US denominated debt. Eagle Aero could issue a 5-year 100 million Eurobond denominated in euros with a 6.3% annual coupon if sold at par value. If the bonds were denominated in US dollars, Ea gle Aero bonds would n eed to carry a 6.7% annua l coupon payment for a $135 million face value issue. Zeutsche Bank had propos ed that SLC issue the $135 million bond issue at 5.9% and swap it for a 5-year 100 million euro interest only loan at 5.8% with annua l interest payments. Eagle Aero would issue a 100 million euro denominated bond at 6.3% and swap it for a loan of $135 million at 6.5%, with Zeutsche Bank acting as the broker-dealer. Black had sketched out a few details of the swap agreement in order for Williams to gain a b etter understanding of the d eal. Company Name Cost of US $ deno minated debt Cost of \u20ac 6.70% 6.30% Black began his overview of the currency sw ap propos al by laying out the costs of borrowin g for SLC and Eagle Aero based on the denomination of the currency. Black conveyed to Williams that the cost of borrowin g for Eagle Aero was higher than SLC's cost of borrowin g regardless of the currency denominating the debt, but it was substantially higher for Eagle Aero to bor row US dollars. The swap agreement called for SLC to borrow $135 million by issuing a 5.9% annua l coupon bond in the US. The $135 million would be exchanged for 100 million euros setting the initial exchange rate at $1.35/1 euro. Using RLO International's euro cash flows, SLC would pay 5.8 million euros each year to Zeutsche Bank, while Zeutsche Bank would pay $7.965 million to SLC so that the US dollar bond payments can be met. In short, the currency swap would mean that SLC would borrow $135 million today, exchange it for 100 million euros and repay 5.8 million euros each year. From SLC's point of view the cost of borrowin g in euros would now be 5.8% . At the end of five years, SLC would repay the 100 million euro principa l and receive $135 million from Zeutsche Bank, thus being able to repay the principa l on the bond offering. Black noted that since Zeutsche Bank was acting as the broker-dealer in this transaction, there was no counte rparty risk associated with Eagle Aero. In essence, as long as Zeutsche Bank remain ed solvent, the currency sw ap would allow SLC to lowe r their cost of borrowin g relative to borrowing directly in euros and eliminate the exchange rate risk associated with the conve rsion of RMO from a joint ventur e to a w holly-owned subs idiary.

What is the role of Zeutsche Bank in the swap transaction and how are they compensated? How is Eagle Aero going to benefit from this swap? Why would they want to particip ate in this currency swap? Are there any additional risks associa ted with the currency sw ap that Williams should be consid ering? Williams asked Black to lay out the details of the currency swap in laymen terms so that he would be prepared to answer questions from the board if SLC decided to exercise the option to purchase the remaining 49% interest in RMO and utilize the currency swap as part of the financing option. Williams left with a series of tasks for Black to complete by the end of the week. THE TASK The most important consid eration for Williams is to be able to explain to the board how the currency sw ap might help SLC reduce their borrowing costs and reduce their exchange rate exposure if they decide to covert RMO International from a joint venture into a wholl y ow ned subsidiary. 1) What is the anomal y in current market conditions that makes the currency swap a viable alternative? 2) Assume SLC borrows locally by issuing a $135 million face value 5.9% annua l coupon bond with a matu rity of five years at par and engages in a currency swap with Zuetsche Bank for a five-year 100 million euro interest only l oan at 5.8% . Simultaneously, Eagle Aero borrows locally by issuing a 100 million euro denominated bond with a 6.3% annua l coupon and engages in a currency swap with Zuetsche Bank for a five year $135 million interest only loan at 6.5% . Describe the initial exchange of cash flows related to SLC, Zeutsche Bank, and Eagle Aero. Page 62 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 3) Describe the annual interest cash flows that occur each year over the next five years related to SLC, Zeutsche Bank, and Eagle Aero and discuss any additional risks that SLC may occur o ver the five year period . 4) Describe the princip al repayment cash flows that occur at the end of five years related to SLC, Zeutsche Bank, and Eagle Aero and discuss any additional risks that SLC may occur when the pr incip al repayment is due in five years. 5) How does the currency swap reduce the cost of borrowing for both SLC and Eagle Aero? 6) How does Zeutsche Bank profit from the currency swap if it has no exposure to the initial exchange of cash flows nor does it have exposure wh en the principa l repayment of cash flows are made at year five? 7) Calcula te Zeutsche Bank's profit (both as a dollar amount and as a percentage of the $135 million notional amoun t) per year assuming it is able to hedge its exposure to the currency swap agreement by takin g a long posit ion in a series of one- to five-year forward contracts each with a forward rate of $1.35/euro. 1 year forward rate = $1.35/eur o 2 year forward rate = $1.35/eur o 3 year forward rate = $1.35/eur o 4 year forward rate = $1.35/eur o 5 year forward rate = $1.35/eur o 8) Calcula te Zeutsche Bank's profit (as a dollar amoun t) per year assuming it is able to hedge its exposure to the currency swap agreement using a series of one- to five-year forward contracts where the f orward rate is determin ed from interest rate parity. The current exchange rate is $1.35/1 euro and the applicable yield curve available to Zeutsche Bank is flat with US dollar interest rates at 3% per year and euro in terest rates at 2% per year.

CORPORATE WELFARE Stephen C. Henr y, SUNY Plattsburgh CASE DESCRIPTION The case of Timberline Energy is designed to encourage students to think about an investment decis ion in the context of value creation. Is the proposed wind-energy project a value-creating investment? Under what circumstanc es will it be a good investment? Who benefits? Who bears the costs? And what are the impl ications for public po licy? The case is aime d at MBA or advanced undergraduate students of financ e who are well- versed in the process of making capital investment decis ions. It is designed to be taught in a single 75-minute class period, after 3-4 hours of student preparat ion. The firms, ind ividuals, and projects desc ribed are fictitious, though they are based upon a c omposite of real-world entit ies. CASE SYNOPSIS Over the past few years, an incre ase in public awareness and co ncern over sus tainab ility, combine d with a sharp runup in energy prices, has made t he developme nt of renewable energy sourc es a top priority for many privat e- and public-sector entities. Ene rgy compani es are te mpted by the pros pect of profi table n ew markets, and policymakers are thrilled by the promise of creating \"green\" jobs f or their consti tuents. Ind eed, the potential economic and environm ental benefits of such developm ent er,when pol itics are financial de cision-making pro cess, less-than-desirable out comes can occur. Timothy Albright is the founder and strong-willed CEO of Timberline Ene rgy, a Midwestern develo per of wind energy installations (\"wind farms \"). In early 2014, Albright is faced with a potential project that carries with it both new obsta cles and new opportuni ties. With more than a decade of successf ul wind farm developme nt to his credit, Albright is confident of his ability to navigate this new environm ent. How ever, a chance encounter with an elected official and an economic s pro fessor casts his investment de cision in a new light. INTRODU CTION Timb erline Energy, Inc. was founded in Rochester, Minn esota in 2002 by Timot hy Albri ght, a professional electrical engineer with more than 10 years of consult ing experience in the energy sector. Although oil prices were relativel y low at the time, Albri ght was convinc ed that renewable sources of energy would become increasingly important in the future, and sought to gain a foothold in this emerging line of business. Early on, Timb erline's specialty was smal l- scale wind turbi ne ins tallations, whic h provided powe r for homes, farms, and other facilities in remote locations. Over the next few years, Timber line's busin ess expanded and evolved into designing and building larger and larger \"wind farm\" installations for various customers (electric utilities) thr oughout the upper midw estern United S tates. Page 66 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 In 2008, Albri ght was approached by the Brazilian energy firm Energia do Brasil (\"EDB\") regarding a possible acquis ition. By the end of that year, EDB had acquir ed a controlling in terest in Timb erline, with Albright remaining in the posit ion of Chief Executive Officer. The infusion of capital enabled Ti mber line to shift its focus from by-contract constru ction to direct wind farm development. Timberline's first compa ny-owned wind farm, a 50-megawatt installation in north ern Illinois, went online in late 2009, generating electricity to be sold into the national grid at prevailing ma rket rates. The project was consid ered a success by Albri ght and his partners at EDB, and they continued to seek out oppo rtunities for additional wind energy developments. Consolidat ed financial statements for EDB are provided as Exhibits 1 and 2. One of the factors driving Timb erline's success during this time was the existence of the Production Tax Credit (PTC). The PTC was enacted by congress in 1992 with the goal of foste ring the development of n ew, sustainable sources of energy. In particul ar, the PTC provid ed a tax credit of $0.022 per kilowatt-hour generated for op erators of commercial wind farms. Althou gh the cost of produc ing electricity with wind turbin es was still relative ly high (consid ering the capital costs and mainten ance costs), the PTC had made wind farm installations attractive investm ents for many operators. The Production Tax Credit had originally been slated to expire in 1999; however, over the subsequ ent 14 years, the PTC was repeatedly renewed and extended by congress in 1- and 2- year in crements. At the end of 2013, tho ugh, the PTC was allowed to expire, and in the present political climate , prospects for its reinstateme nt were uncertain at best. In any case, there would be no su ch tax break for projects started in 2014. THE SAGINAW PROJECT The oppor tunity that is the focus of Albright's attention is a propos ed 240 megawatt wind farm to be constr ucted in a rural area west of Saginaw, Michigan. The area is known to have fairly steady winds from the north west, and Timberline is in the process of negotiating a lease agreement with a lando wner. Albr ight has developed a plan for t he site that involves the installation of 133 wind turbines, each nearly 400 feet tall, and with a namepl ate capacity of 1.8 megawatts. This is a fairly ambitious project for the young firm, over four times the size of its largest project to date. The installation would eventuall y generate enough electricity to power almost 50,000 homes. The si ze of the p roject meant that it would r equire a f ar greater investm ent of capital than his own budg et authori ty allowed, so Albri ght knew he would have to make a stron g case for it to ED B's bo ard of directors. The d etails of the le ase agreement for the land h ave yet to be finalized, but Timb erline's usual practice is to seek a 30-year lease, in exchange for an annual royalty payment of $0.45 per megawatt-hour (1000 kilowatt-hours) produc ed, in addition to an initial payment. The amount of the up -front payment is still unde r negotiation, but Albri ght is expecting a figure of about $25 million. The cost of construc tion would be considerable; Timb erline's engineers have estimate d the initial cost to be approximately $1.3 million per turbin e, and it would take almost 12 months Page 67 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 for the constru ction to be completed. Production of electricity would begin about one year after breaking ground on the project. Once operational, the costs of running a wind farm are fairly modest. Timb erline would expect to keep a staf f of about 15 individuals on-site to monitor the operation, at a total labor expense of about $1,20 0,000 per year. Regular maintena nce of the facility should cost about $40,000 per turbine per year. Oth er overhead expenses for the facility should total no more than $100,000 per year. The only wo rking capital involved in this project would be a small inventor y of mainten ance supplies and ha rdware, a negligible investm ent. As for project revenue, the local electric utility has agreed to a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) at a fixed price of $0.035 per kilowatt hour. Although this is a competi tive price at the current time, future market prices for electricity are some what unpredicta ble, and no assurance can be given as to the prevailing price after the PPA expires. The PPA provides stabili ty for both Timb erline and the local power compa ny, reducing the risk of the project consid erably. As mentioned p reviousl y, the turbin es used for this project would have a n amepla te capacity of 1.8 megawatts; however, this is the maximum possible output of the units. In practice, wind turbi nes rarely generate electricity at the limit of their capaci ty (the wind doesn't always blow that f ast). Av erage power outp ut is me asured by the capacity factor, whi ch measures the actual realized output of a facility as a percentage of the theoretical maximum. For wind farms, capacity factors range from 20% to 50%; based on his experience with wind installations in the uppe r Midw est, Albright believes that an assumed capacity factor of 37.5% is appropriate. Wind turbin es are typically designed to have a 20-year life expecta ncy, and this is the customary assumption for the lifespan of an installation. Individual units may last longer, but beyond 20 years, it is expected that major components will begin to fail, and complete (expensive) ov erhauls would be neede d in order to remain in service. At the end of their s ervice life, the turbine components could be sold for recycling; in today's market a large wind turbine would ha ve a scrap value of about $100,000 a fter tax. As a wholl y-owned subsidiary of Energia do Brasi l, Timb erline's practice is to evaluate potential investm ent projects against EDB's cost of capital. The Saginaw project is fairly typical of the wind energy projects in EDB 's portfolio, so based on recent experience, Albright expects that it will be deemed an average-risk project for cost-of-capital purposes. Selected capital market information p ertaining to EDB is provi ded as Exhibit 3. Timb erline currently assumes a combined marginal income tax rate of 33% for U.S.- based projects. Because EDB and Timb erline file a consolidat ed tax return, any project losses can be used to offset EDB's current income from other sources. The current tax law provides one benefit for wind energy development; despite their 20 year life expectanc y, wind turbines qualify for a 5-year MACRS depreciation schedule. Becaus e this system enables the cost of the project to be expensed over a relative ly short time, the tax savings from depreciation are realized soon er, thereby benefitting the developer. MAC RS depreciation percentages are provided as Exhibit 4. Page 68 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 THE PUBLIC-SECT OR INCENTIVE With Timb erline's legal department still in the midst of negotiating the lease for the Saginaw project, Albright took time to attend a fundraising dinner for the benefit of his alma mate r, Michigan State Univ ersity. At the dinner, he found himself seated next to Ma rcia Gutfeld, Michigan's recently elected Lieutenant Gove rnor, and a former classmate from MSU. Albri ght was aware that the process of obtaini ng the necessary bui lding permits for a project of this scale was going to be a challenge, so he seized upon the oppor tunity to \"talk shop\" with the elected o fficial. \"It's great to see you again, Marcia. Congra tulations on your new job! Even though I don't live in Michigan anymore, it was exciting to watch the results come in for you on election night.\" \"Thanks, Tim. It's been a wild ride, but I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of it. As you know, Governor Quinc y has set some pretty lofty goals for his first term, so we have our work cut out for us.\" \"I can believe it. Michigan took quite a beating during the financial crisis. Have you made much progress on the unemployment rate yet?\" Albri ght asked, cleverly ste ering the conve rsation in h is direction. \"Some, but we're not where we'd like to be. It's still about two percentage points above the n ational average.\" \"Maybe that's somethi ng I can help you out with. Have you heard of my compa ny, Timb erline Energy?\" Gutfeld listened intently as Albright spent the next half hour telling her about the compa ny, the renewable energy busin ess in general, and the Saginaw project in particul ar, making certain to mention the staff that Timb erline expected to hire locally. He knew that Governor Quinc y had posit ioned himself as the \"environme ntally conscious\" candidate , so he was hope ful that a little support from the administration might speed things along at the Public Service Com mission. \"Wow, Tim, that's great news! Renewable energy was a big part of our campa ign platform, and this is just the kind of development we w ant to support. In fact, I've been working on a new program that your firm mi ght quali fy for. Want to hear a bout it?\" \"Sure, I'm all ears.\" \"I'm sure you know that the expiration of the Production Tax Credit has made life a lot harder for renewable energy produc ers, all over the country. Around the beginning of next month, the Governor is going to announ ce a plan that's intended to help offset the loss of the PTC for companie s doing busin ess in Michigan. We're going to offer interest-free financing for wind and solar energy projects for up to five years, with guaranteed renewal at market rates after that!\" Before Albright could respon d, a voice from across the table groaned: \"Oh no, not another corporate welfare boond oggle!\" It was Professor Ar rington, t he longtime chair of MSU's department of Econom ics. \"Weren't you in my Public Policy course , Gutfeld? Don't you know better?\" Page 69 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 \"Nice seeing you too, Dr. Arrington\" she replied. \"Quite a memor y you have. That was twenty-plus years ago! But yes, I was in your class. In fact it helped inspire me to get into politics!\" \"Serves me right for being so darned inspirational, I guess. How much taxpayer money are you planning to throw away on this lunacy?\" Arrington was highly esteemed in econom ics circles, but he was not known for his agreeabl e personali ty. \"Well, we don't think it's being 'thrown away', because it's going to help with reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and create good-paying jobs for the people of Michigan. Furthermore, it's not really taxpayer money. The state will issue up to $600 million worth of bonds, with the proceeds being used to fund the loans. We're just leveraging the state's tax-free borrowin g capacity in a way that helps grow the econom y, and preserves the environme nt to boot.\" \"Those bonds might be free of federal income tax, but they're not going to be free of interest, are they? Who's g oing to pay the inte rest on them? The windm ill fairies?\" \"Now you're being silly. Of course the state will have to service the debt, but we feel that the econom ic benefits will outwe igh the cost. We'll have new wind farms and solar arrays generating electricity, making money, paying taxes, and hiring workers. We're confid ent that the expense is ju stified.\" \"We'll see about that. Have you projected the tax revenue that you're going to get from these outfit s? That's assuming, of course, that th ey'll make any money to owe tax on.\" \"Not yet, but -\" \"And who's going to be on the hook if your borrowers default? The taxpayers, that's who!\" Arrington bellowed. \"If it's such a great busin ess, why can't this guy get his own financing in the public markets, like everyone else? Who are you, anyway?\" Arrington asked, pointing at Albr ight. \"Tim Albri ght, sir, with Timb erline Energy. Class of '90. Nice to meet you\" he said, shaking Arrington's hand. He had been quietl y watchin g the battle between the professor and the poli tician, more than a little annoyed by the inter ruption. \"Look, Albright, I'm not oppos ed to windm ills or solar panels, or even subsidies, for that matte r, as long as it's a viable busin ess that can s ustain itself. C an your operation do that? \" \"We have a five-year track record of success in operating wind farms, so I think so. We're still wo rking out the details for the S aginaw project, though.\" \"Well, you need to figure it out. It's simple, really. I assume you've taken at least an introductory finance course?\" Albri ght nodde d. \"It's all about creating econom ic value. An investm ent project either creates value, or destroys it. If the benefits outwe igh the costs, it's a good investm ent, and you don't need any subs idies to convince you to take it. If the costs outwe igh the benefits, value is being destroyed, and we taxpayers don't want to help you pay for your mistakes.\" \"That's why we're going to offer this incentive program,\" Gutfeld interjected. \"To make sure that these new, 'green' busin esses can flourish. If the state can give a new busin ess a boost to help it get off the ground, wh at's the h arm?\" Page 70 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 \"There are situations where I might agree with you,\" the professor replied. \"But here, there's no eviden ce that this is a value-creating busin ess, absent some kind of government handout, like a tax credit. Even your hero, Warren Buffett, just recently made a public comment to the effect that 'wind farms don' t make sense without a tax credit'. \"The bot tom line is this,\" he continued. \"A bad investm ent is a bad investm ent, regardless of who's paying for it. If the state tries to subsidize a bad investment into a good one, all that happens is that the cost is shifted onto the public sector. The only ones who benefit are the o wners of the busin ess!\" Albri ght bristled at this. \"I don't think it's fair to call the Saginaw project a 'bad investm ent' just yet. We haven't even finalized the cost fi gures!\" \"Maybe, maybe not\" Arrington replied. \"You need to work out the net present value of this operation for yourself. In any case, I'm opposed, on principle, to using taxpayer funds to prop up pr ivate busin esses.\" Albri ght leaned back in his chair, thinking quiet ly to himself while Gutfeld and Arrington continued sparring. They seemed to be having fun. At the end of the evening, he exchanged busin ess cards with Marcia, each promising to keep the other updated via email. But he left the dinner feeling somewhat confli cted. Would the Saginaw project be \"viable ,\" as Arrington put it? If not, would the interest- free loan make it viabl e? Althou gh the interest subsidy would expire after five years, the promise of free capital during t he critical construction and startup phase of the project was extremely enticing. But what if the project turned out to have a negative NPV? Would it even be right to accept taxpayer support in that case? These were some of the questions Albright wrestled with as he headed back to h is hot el for the evening.

The case involves Overstock.com's decision in January 2014 to start accepting Bitcoin as payment for goods. Students are required to examine the accounting implications from accepting Bitcoins. Students are asked to research the relevant accounting pronouncements and make recommendations. Due to the new and unique nature of Bitcoins, students must employ critical thinking as they apply accounting principles to a new and evolving financial situation. Students are required to produce a short memo that addresses the accounting issues. Alternatively, this case works well for class presentations. The instructor could assign groups/individuals one of the questions and have the group present the issue, possible accounting treatments and a recommendation to the class. The case is appropriate for a senior level or graduate level accounting course. The difficulty of the case is 3/5. CASE SYN OPSIS Bitcoin is a new and unique type of asset. It is possible to view it as a currency, a commodity, an investment or an intangible asset. Each of these possible classifications present their own unique accounting issues. When Overstock receives a Bitcoin, a key issue is if the earnings process has been completed to the extent that it would be appropriate to recognize profit at the time of the sale. If Overstock then holds the Bitcoin, accounting issues are presented regarding how to present Bitcoins on the Balance Sheet, as well as how to account for the change in value of the Bitcoins over time. The student is in the position of a junior accountant working at Overstock performing research for the CFO. The junior accountant is asked to perform research related to some financial accounting issues that will arise if Overstock.com decides to hold Bitcoins. The junior accountant is asked to present relevant passages from the Accounting Codification and make recommendations for how Overstock should account for Bitcoins. COMPANY HISTORY On January 9, 2014 Overstock.com started accepting Bitcoin as payment (Metz, 2014). The initial day indicated that accepting Bitcoins could lead to significant new Page 76 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 business for Overstock. The success of the rollout can be seen from the following tweet from the CEO of Overstock.com, Partick M. Byrne: \"#Bitcoin's first full day on @overstock.com was a huge success: 840 orders, $130,000 in sales. Almost all new customers. #stunned.\" More than $5,000 in sales occurred within the first thirty minutes of Overstock.com's acceptance of Bitcoins. The first full month brought continued success with over $870,000 in sales stemming from 4,000 orders. (Hill, 2014) \"For Byrne, a rather opinionated libertarian who's unafraid to take his company places others fear to tread, embracing the cryptocurrency is as much a political statement as a business decision. Like so many others, he believes Bitcoin can break the world from the control of big banks and big government. It helps us fight the machine he said\" (Wired ). According to Forbes.com, to further demonstrate his optimism for Bitcoins Byrne recently, \"cashed in several million dollars worth of gold\" for the digital currency. In addition, Byrne has publicly stated an interest in paying his vendors as well as his employees in Bitcoins in the future if they so choose. Byrne started Overstock.com in 1999 and the company went public with an IPO in 2002. The company is an online retailer, based out of Salt Lake City, Utah that specializes in selling excess inventory discount prices. With diverse product offerings ranging from clothing, furniture, and fine jewelry to automobiles, the Consumer Usage Report rated Overstock.com as one of the five most visited mass merchandiser websites. Overstock prides itself on its high level of customer service, with the NRF/Foundation/American Express Customer Choice Awards ranking Overstock.com in the Top 10 in customer service among all U.S. retailers. The company currently has nearly 1,300 employees and offers nearly one million products at prices that have saved Overstock customers millions of dollars. In the most recent year, Overstock reported more than $1 billion in revenue, up from $1.1 million at the company's inception. Byrne feels that the decision of Overstock.com to accep t Bitcoin could help Overstock.com compete against other online retailers such as Amazon, in the $60 billion market. (Murphy, 2014) \"Yes, I actually think that this forces the hand of Amazon and some other big players. They have to follow suit. You will see them follow suit. I'll be stunned if you don't, because they can't just cede that part of the market to us, if we're the only main, large retail site taking Bitcoin, Either they have to start taking it, or they're just giving away a piece of the market.\" Forbes (Phillips, 2014). In addition, the strategic decision appears to be attracting a different clientele to Overstock.com, which could ultimately increase market share. A recent list of the top 25 products customers have bought with Bitcoins differs greatly from the top 25 products purchased by all Overstock.com customers during the same time period. For example, sheets were the most prevalent purchase for customers paying with Bitcoins, while area rugs were the most common purchase for all Overs tock.com customers. Only a few Page 77 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 products made both lists. The most common products purchased with Bitcoins includes: cell phone accessories, A/V accessories, appliances, computer accessories, computers, men's shoes, hard drives, bedroom furniture, keyboard s & mice, and men's watches. Byrne describes his rationale for Overstock.com's acceptance of Bitcoins. He states, \"We are on a crazy strategy with our central bank. It's good to have alternative ecosystems. It's not that the dollar will go away, but we need other options if it crashes or wildly inflates.\" Former U.S. Congressman and Presidential Candidate, Ron Paul has a stronger opinion, telling CNNMoney, \"There will alternatives to the dollar, and this might be one of them. If people start using Bitcoins en masse , it'll go down in history as the destroyer of the dollar.\" Overstock entered into an agreement with a San Francisco Company called Coinbase. When a customer purchases an item from Overstock and indicates that they will be paying with Bitcoin, Overstock's system will communicate with Coinbase. Coinbase sets an exchange rate, and that exchange rate is used to immediately convert the buyer's Bitcoin into dollars, and transfers the dollars to Overstock. Currently, Overstock never holds Bitcoins, but customers are encouraged to pay with Bitcoins and are even offered 1% back on purchases made with Bitcoins in the form of \"Club O bucks\". In addition, paying with Bitcoins is as convenient and easy as paying by more traditional methods. See the Bitcoin checkout option (shown above) available to purchase products at Overstock.com. BITCOIN HISTORY Bitcoins were developed by an anonymous programmer and are an emerging digital currency with no government backing. Bitcoins utilize cryptogra phy (a form of mathematics used in computer science for the purpose of data integrity, confidentiality and security for passwords, electronic commerce and on-line banking) to prevent or at least mitigate double -spending, which is a common problem for digital currencies. BTC is the unit of measure for Bitcoins, similar to a U.S. dollar, but only in digital form. Bitcoins exist only as a numerical and alphabetical sequence and are not a physical currency. Bitcoins are stored in digital Bitcoin wallet, which is a Bitcoin application on the owners personal computer or cellular phone in which a unique Bitcoin address is created. Bitcoin wallets Page 78 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 have a public address that can be given to send Bitcoins to an individual. Bitcoin wallets also have a private addre ss, also known as the private key, that is necessary for an individual to send his or her Bitcoins. Bitcoins are transferred by the scanning of QR codes (a type of barcode), similar to other monetary exchanges. The Bitcoin wallet has a balance of all the Bitcoins and allows Bitcoins can be broken up in any denomination for easy spending. Unlike credit cards, there are little to no transaction fees (usually 1% or less) associated with the use of Bitcoins. Bitcoins have fluctuated in value from less than 1 U.S.D. to over 1,000 U.S.D. The above shows daily closing values of Bitcoins in U.S.D. from inception. Bitcoins can be acquired in several ways. An individual receives Bitcoins through the scanning of QR codes as described above as payment for a good or service, by purchasing them from exchanges, visiting sites that provide free samples or offers, or trading cash for Bitcoins. In addition, individuals can participate in mining pools, which is how Bitcoins are initially created. Mining, allows individuals to receive new Bitcoins when they complete complex mathematical problems, which verifies Bitcoin transactions of others. Individuals who successful solve an equation can currently receive 25 Bitcoins, with the creation of Bitcoins halving every four years until the market cap is reached. ACCOUNTING ISSUES The CFO of Overstock has learned overtime that CEO Byrne often likes to be on the cutting edge of business practices. The CFO is concerned that CEO Byrne will decide that Overstock should start holding Bitcoins. The CFO would like to be prepared to discuss the relevant accounting issues related to holding Bitcoins, if the CEO should decide to hold Bitcoins. The CFO has assigned you as a junior accountant at Overstock to research and report on the financial accounting issues related to holding Bitcoin. REFERENCES Hill, Kashmir. (2014).

Vulcan and Martin Marietta were number one and two respectively in the U.S. aggregates industry. They had entered int o friendly merger negotiations, but the talks were discontinued. Subsequently, Martin made an exchange offer of its stock for each share of Vulcan's stock, and litigation from both companies soon ensued. As the June 2012 meeting approached, Lynne tried to sort through the myriad claims to reach her decision. CASE DESCRIPT ION The primary subject matter of this concerns the legal use and interpretation of Non - Disclosure Agreements (NDA) and Joint Defense and Confidentiality Agreement (JDA) executed by the c ompanies when they were on good terms. Secondary issues examined include proxy fights, hostile takeovers, and the aggregates industr y dynamics . The case has a difficulty level appropriate to senior -level undergraduat es or first year MBA students. The case designed for the business law courses is designed to be taught in a single 75 -minute class period and requires no more than 2 hours of outside preparation by students. CASE SYNOPSIS In May 2012, Lynne Davis, an extremely small investor in Vulcan Materials, was faced with a proxy vote on a hostile takeover offer from Martin Marietta Materials. Vulcan and Martin Marietta were number one and two respectively in the U.S. aggregates (sand, rock, gravel) industry. They had entered into friendly merger negotiation s, but the talks broke down in June of 2011. In December 2011, Martin made an unsolicited exchange offer of 0.50 shares of its stock for each share of Vulcan's stock, and litigation from both companies soon ensu ed. By February 2012, both companies initiate d lawsuits, with some shareholders doing the same. Lynne had followed the litigation and reviewed the exchange offer but was undecided whether to vote her proxy for 4 new directors proposed by Martin Marietta or with Vulcan's nominees. As the June 2012 mee ting approached, Lynne tried to sort through the myriad claims to reach her decision. Page 80 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 CASE BODY As she walked down her drive way on a windy spring day, Lynne Davis cringed at the sight of the large envelope protruding fro m her mailbox . She took a quick glan ce at the return address titled Vulcan Materials Company which confirmed this was more proxy material related to Martin Marietta Materials hostile takeover of Vulcan . She had acquired 8 shares over 20 years earlier as a young employee at Vulcan's Birmingha m, Alabama headquarters. Since that time she never gave much thought to the shares except each year when she received the notice of th e annual shareholders' meeting. However, since the beginning of 2012 bo th companies had waged a proxy fight for the votes of Vulcan shareholders. In early 2010 , the companies had entered talks to discuss the merger of the two largest firms in the aggregates industry. After the talks broke down late in 2011 Martin Marietta made an unsolicited exchange offer for all outstandi ng shares of V ulcan's common stock at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.50 shares of Martin Marietta common stock . Vulcan's board immediately rejected the offer, and the proxy fight began with both companies filing lawsuits prior to t he 2012 shareholders' meetin g. Lynne opened the packet as she walked back up her driveway. A white proxy card was on top of the proxy material. She knew that the contents of the packet would include Vulcan's request to vote this white card just as Martin Marietta's material asked her to vote the blue card included with its proxy. She decided to review the events leading up to the June 1st vote before deciding how to vote her proxy. AGGREGATE S INDUSTRY Aggregates were used in a variety of industries, but primarily in construction pro jects. Aggregates included c rushed stone, sand and gravel . Demand for the industry's products was derived from different construction projects including airports, highways, water and sewer systems, manufacturing facilities, railroad track ballast, resident ial and commercial buildings. The industry consisted of over 5,000 companies in the U.S. In recent years, growth was typically accomplished through acqui sition of existing facilities. The regulatory environment of aggregate producers often required dozens of permits to operate a single facility. Producers needed to navigate state and Federal regulations related to air quality, water qual ity, noise, zoning and safety. The ten largest producers accounted for 30 -35% of the total U.S. aggregates production. The industry revenue changes from 2006 -2011 are shown in Table 1: Table 1 AGGREGATES INDUSTRY REVENUE Year Revenue $ billion Growth % 2006 16.645 11.4 2007 16.766 0.7 2008 Sour ce: Crompton, 2013. Page 81 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Annual consumption reached 10.4 Mt per person in 2006 before falling to 6.3 Mt in 2009. Housing construction fell in excess of 70% from 2005 which accounted for much of the decline industry revenue. The remainder of the decline coul d be attributed to the 42% decline in Commercial and nonresidential building and the reduction in bank lending for construction projects. VULCAN MATERIALS COM PANY In 2011, Vulcan Materials Company was the largest U.S. producer of construction aggregates (i.e. crushed stone, sand , gravel) employing over 7,000 people Vulcan Materials Company. Vulcan controlled less than 10% of the mark et. The company also produced asphalt mix and ready -mixed concrete. As an aggregate producer the company sales fluctuated w ith the demand for highways, commercial and residential construction. The company's stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VMC. Vulcan Materials traced its beginning to the Birmingham Slag company, a family -owned construc tion co mpany, founded in 1909. The company grew steadily under the leadership of Charles Ireland and his sons. The passage of the National Highway act under the Eisenhowe r administration catapulted its growth as the company supplied aggregate s for interstate high way construction. In 1956 the company merged with the publicly -traded Vulcan Detinning Company of Ne w Jersey. The company continued to grow through mergers and acquisitions reaching $783 million in sales and number 367 on the Fortune 500 list by 1981. Vulc an divested its Chemical Division founded in 1957 to Occidental Chemical in 2005. The company celebrated its 50th year as a publicly -traded company in 2007. That same year the company completed its largest ever acquisition by acquiring Florida Rock Industr ies, Inc. in a $4.6 billion deal consisting of cash and stock. Vulcan paid a 45% premium for the stock of Florida Rock. Since 2008 the company' s sales and earnings had languished . Selected financials are shown in Appendix 1a. As of 2011 Vulcan generated ne t sales of $2.4 billion producing a loss of $70.8 million. Prior to the merger talks with Martin Marietta, the stock price reached a high of just over $128 per share in 2007. The stock price and dividend (see Table 2 below) had de clined since 2007. Table 2 VULCAN MATERIALS STOCK Year High Low Dividend 2007 $128.62 Vulcan operated over 300 aggrega tes facilities across the U.S. In 201 1, its top ten revenue - producing states were: Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Page 82 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 South Carolina, Tennessee, T exas, and Virginia. It estimated its proven and probable reserves at 15 billion tons. MARTIN MARIETTA MATERI ALS CO MPANY In 2011 Martin Marietta Materials Co mpany was the second largest U.S. producer of construction aggregates . The company employed nearly 5,000 employees in 28 states, Canada, the Bahamas, and the Caribbean. Its net sales in 2011 were $1.5 billion wit h net income of $82.4 million. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol MLM. The company traced its roots to S uperior Stone founded in 1939. Superior merged with American -Marietta Corporation in 1959 and in 1961 with Glenn L. Ma rtin Company to form t he Martin Marietta Corporation The company completed its in itial public offering in 1994. The next year Martin Marietta Corporation merged with Lockheed Corporation to for m Lockheed Martin Corporation. Lockheed Martin disposed of its interest in Mart in Marietta Materials in 1996. The company continued to grow primarily through acquisitions reaching $1 billion in sales by 1998. Selected financials are shown in Appendix 1b. EVENTS UNFOLD Lynne sifte d through the stacks of proxy material and news clippings she had collected recently and constructed the following timeline of events leading to the current proxy vote (see Table 3). From what she had read the talks initially stemmed from the e ver-growing consolidation within the aggregates in dustry. The market development through acquisition was a natural given the fragmented nature and the environmental concerns associated with quarries.

April 26, 2012 MLM Proxy materials sent April 30, 2012 VMC proxy materials sent June, 1 2012 VMC Annual Shareholder Meeting to be he ld HOSTILITIES BEGIN On December 12, 2011, Martin Marietta offered to exchange 0.50 share of Martin stock for each share of Vulca n common stock. According to Martin Marietta this offer represented a 15% premium over the closing price as of December 9, 201 1. The $4.7 billion stock for stock deal va lued Vulcan at $36.69 a share. In a letter to Vulcan shareholders, Martin Marietta asserted that the merger would create a company with a strong balance sheet and reduce the risk with the current Vulcan balance sh eet. The deal promised a quarterly dividend of $0.20 a share, twenty times the penny a share being paid by Vulcan. Martin Marietta believed it could achieve $200 to $250 million of annual cost savings as a result of the merger. Vulcan countered that t he offer was \"opportunist ic, inadequate and uncertain.\" As evidence, Vulcan asserted that on 62.5 percent of the trading days over the last three years , the historical exchange ratio exc eeded Martin Marietta's offer. Vulcan asserted that Martin Marietta's claim s of synergies in the range of $200 -250 million were uns ubstantiated and self - serving. Vulcan highlighted quotes from various Wall Street analysts who agreed with Vulcan's position. As an example they quoted Craig Hodges of Hodges Capital Management I nc. who said, \"If you're a long -term shareholder, you definitely believe [the Martin Marietta offer] is low. There's a l ot of value in Vulcan. Martin Marietta is being smart and they're kind of buying at the trough of the industry.\" However, some prominent shareholders disagreed with the Wall Street analysts. Glenn Ireland II, whose family owned Birmingham Slag for many years, wrote a letter to Vulcan's board stating the offer from Martin made \"excellent business sense.\" LEGAL MANEUVERS The critical legal issue s between the parties involve d the use of confidentiality agreements in Martin Marietta's unsolicited exchange offer and proxy contest for Vulcan. The referenced agreements were comprised of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and joint defense and conf identiality agreement (JDA) effective between the parties as of May 3, 2010 and May 18, 2010 , respectively . These agreements were executed in contemplation of exploring a \"business combination transaction\" between the parties . Martin Marietta Materials, In c. v. Vulcan Materials Co ., 56 A.3d (Del. Ch. May 4, 2012) . There was no standstill agreement. Subsequently, for reasons stated above, Vulcan became disinterested in combining resources with Martin Mariet ta and accused Martin Page 84 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Marietta of relying on confidential material contained in the NDA and JDA to launch its unsolicited exchange offer and proxy contest. The content of the agreements included material subject to protection. This material was described in the agreements as either evaluation material (NDA, Preamble, p. 1) or confidential material (JDA, Common Interest, joint Defense and Confidentiality Agreement). Martin disclosed the content of the evaluation and confid ential material to further its exch ange o ffer and proxy contest . Vulcan alleged that this use violated the non -disclosure agreements. To that end, Martin Marietta filed suit to obtain a declaratory judgment that the confidentiality agreements did not bar its e xchange offer or proxy contest. Related lawsuits were filed from December 11, 2011 through February 28, 2013 to determine the legality of Martin's use and disclosure of information contained in the non-disclosure agreements. (See Table 1 above for more detailed dates.) Vulcan asserted t hat the only lawful use of the confidentiality agreements was to further friendly negotiations \"between \" the parties ; or, if an \"external demand\" compelled disclosure then disclosure would be authorized . Vulcan relied on the NDA's use of words \"transaction \" and \"between\" as evidencing mutual negotiation and not an unsolicited exchange offer or proxy contest. Vulcan took issue with Martin Marietta's use of the confidentiality agreements to further its unilateral pr essure strategy against Vulcan. Further, Vulcan claimed that Martin Marietta had not received an external demand requiring disclosure of th e material. Hence, Vulcan claimed that Martin Marietta's disclosures \"flagrantly breached\" the confidentiality agreements (Martin, p. 1079) . Vulcan noted that it was Martin Marietta's legal counsel who drafted the relevant language in the agreement, and that it was Martin Marietta who expressly coveted confidentiality during the 2010 -2011 merger discussions. In fact, Martin Marietta appeared more concerned about the confidentiality of the 2010 merger discussions than was expressed by Vulcan. Martin Marietta's counsel edited the NDA to make it stronger in the \"sense of broadening the information subject to restrictions and limiting permissible uses and disclosures o f the covered information \". (Martin, 56 A.3d 1072, 1082; 2012 Del. Ch. LEXIS (Del. Ch. May 4, 2012) . The evidence indicated that Martin Marietta sought to design heighten ed protection from disclosures when the confidentiality agreements were drafted in 2010 . At one point, a Martin Marietta counsel locked up the confidential material in a \"sealed box\" in her office, and she told Martin's advisors not to use \"any Evaluation Material\" (Martin, p. 1119) . Vulcan asserted that the JDA and NDA were harmonious documents, both drafted to protect material from public disclosure, and that Martin Marietta's conscientious behavior during the 2010- 2011 merger discussions wa s at odds with the position that they assume d in their lawsuit seeking a declaration that their use of the material to further their unsolicited exchange offer was legal . Martin Marietta argued that V ulcan was trying to insert a non-existent \"standstill\" provision into the agreements. A standstill provision would explicitly prevent t he parties from launching an unsolicited tender or exchange offer during a specific time. Martin argued that the agreements did not include such a provision and therefore, Vulcan should not be permitted to rely on a non-existent standstill provision (Marti n, p. 1078). Martin further argued that it initially Page 85 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 only disclosed that which it was \"legally required\" to disclose to the SEC when it launch ed the exchange offer. Vulcan countered that Martin Marietta subsequently made generous disclosures of protected m aterial that was not \"legally required\" to be disclosed (Martin, p. 1079). Vulcan maintained that the protected information necessitated disclosure to the SEC only because of Martin Marietta's unilateral decision to launch a hostile bid . Vulcan asserted that a unilateral decision to launch a proxy contest and unsolicited exchange offer was not consistent with the language in the agreements which limited the protected material to discussions concerning transactions \"between\" the parties. Vulcan further conte nded that even if some of the information was \"legally required\" to be provided to the SEC, that Martin Marietta went too far by disclosing additional protected material to investors and to the press (Martin, p. 1078). Some of the information that Martin M arietta disclosed included core confidential material such as \"Vulcan's nonpublic information shared at a March 8, 2011 meeting between Lloyd [Martin Marietta's CFO] (Martin, p. 1136). BLUE OR WHITE ? Martin Marietta's blue proxy stated, Despite the clear and compelling business logic our proposal and the urging of major shareholders, the Vulcan Board rejected our offer and refus es to even discuss it with us. But you now have an opportunity to communicate your wishes directly to the Vulcan Board. We believe the quickest path for Vulcan shareholders to realize the benefits of a combination is to elect independent directors to the Vulcan Board. To this end, we have commenced a proxy s olicitation to elect four new, highly qualified and independent directors who we believe are neither beholden to Vulcan Chairman & CEO Don James nor entrenched in opposing a business co mbination with Martin Marietta These four directors, who would constitu te a minority of the Vulcan Board if elected, also are independent of Martin Marietta and would owe a fiduciary obligation only to Vulcan and you, the Vulcan shareholders. Vulcan's proxy material dated April 30, 2012 was titled \"URGENT: PROTE CT YOUR INVEST MENT IN VULCAN.\" In part, Vulcan's letter to shareholders stated, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., one of our competitors, is attempting to install four members on the Vulcan Board in support of its grossly inade quate offer to acquire Vulcan. Vulcan's Boar d has always been open to serious conversations about maximizing value for Vulcan shareholders. In fact, Vulcan held extensive discussions with Martin Marietta in the past but was unable to come to an agreement on terms that would enhance value for Vulcan shareholders. Now Martin Marietta has launched a hostile, opportunistic offer in an attempt to acquire your company at a price substantially below its long -term value. The board nominees from bot h companies are shown in Table 4. Lynne felt that the vote on Martin Marietta's nominees to the board of Vulcan was really a vote on the attractiveness of the exchange offer. She was unsure of how attractive the offer was , but somehow Martin's offer just didn't sit well with her . She remembered the heady days not so long ago when Vulcan's stock traded at over $100 per share, and she felt that the industry wa s \"rock solid\" if unglamorous. However, Vulcan had struggled since the do wnturn in the economy in 2007. Lynne wa s also concerned about Vulcan's legal allegation s concerning breaches of Page 86 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 confidentiali ty by Martin Marietta, but she wa s unsure about the impact that such a breach would have on the value of the company. Besides, Martin Marietta was trying to obtain a legal declaration that it legally used the confident iality agreements to further the exchange offer. She laid the Blue and White Proxy cards on her desk and decided to sleep on it before deciding. Table 4 BOARD NOMINEES Vulcan Nominees Martin Marietta Nominees Phillip W.

Lapoint, McMurry University Carrol R. Haggar d, Fort Hays State University CAS E DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case concerns project manag ement. A secondary issue examined is team politics. This case can be used in Project Management, Operations Manag ement, or Quality Manag ement courses. The case has a difficulty level of four. The case is designed to be taught in two class hours and is expected to require four hours of outside preparation by students. CAS E SYNOPSIS After 10 years at Design Prototypes, Inc., Raef Conley is leading his first major project team. Raef has assembled a highly qualified, diverse yet cohesive team and has the full suppo rt of his boss on the project, the regional Electrical Engineering (EE) Director, Jonathon Wright. It has been almost 6 months since the Alpha C306 project was green lighted by top manag ement. Raef and other members of the project team have met several times during those 6 months to track the progress of the project activiti es and from Raef's perspective the team works well together and is still highly motivated. Initially, the project was envisioned as taking a year and a half (548 days) to complete. However, Raef and his team had devel oped a Work Breakdow n Schedule (WBS) that projected completion in 515 days, giving the team 33 days of slack time. Developing a 515 day plan was a very fortunate decision, as at this point the project is in the concluding stage of activity K (product testing) and due to unforeseen delays the 33 days of slack time have been expended. Thus the team is using the 515 day WBS for the just unde r one year remaining to complete the project. Top manag ement is requesting that the project be shorted by a month (480 day schedule) or preferably two months (450 day schedule). In addition, the VP of Engineering's son, Simon, has been added as a team member. Simon, who has been with the company only 2 years and lacks techni cal qualifications, is attempting to use the project as a way to demons trate his value to uppe r manag ement. Therefore, Simon 's agenda is very different from that of the other team members, creating a source of conflict. The case revolves around the questions of: Can the team devel op workable shortened time schedules for completing the project in 480 and 450 days? Are the added costs of reducing the schedule econom ically sound? How do Raef and the other team members cope with the late addition of a divisive, politically connec ted team member? Page 90 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 DESIGN PROTOT WHE TO SHORTEN A PROJECT SCHEDULE Raef Conley's tenth year at Design Prototypes, Inc., has been challenging, but largely enjoyable. Raef is leading his first major project team. He has assembled a highly qualified, diverse yet cohesive team and has the full support of his boss on the project, the regional Electrical Engineering (EE) Director, Jonathon Wright. It has been almost 6 months since the Alpha C306 project was 'green lighted' by top management. Raef and other members of the project team have met several times during those 6 months to track the progress of the project activitie s and from Raef's perspective , the team works well together and is still highly motivated. Initially the project was envisioned as taking a year and a half (548 days) to complete. How ever, Raef and his team had developed a Work Breakdown Schedule (WBS) that projected completion in 515 days, giving the team 33 days of slack time to complete the schedule. Developing a 515 day plan was a very fortunate decision, since at this point the project is in the concluding stage of activ ity K (produc t testing) and due to unforeseen delays the 33 days of slack have been expended. Thus the team is using the 515 day WBS for the just unde r one year remaining to complete the project. Raef's boss, Jonathon Wright, asked Raef to stop by his office before wo rk on Friday for a brief conver sation about the project. Raef knew that nothing good could come from a meetin g with his boss on Friday, the thirteenth. He would not be disappointed. Jonathon: \"Thanks for dropping by before work. I only have a few minutes as I have an 8:00 meeting with top brass, so I will get right to the point. Can you expedite the Alpha C306 project completion date by a month, preferably two?\" Raef: \"Is there a reason for the reduction? \" Jonathon: \"There are a couple of reasons. First, one of our major clients is requesting as much lead time as possible so that they can market the produc t for the upcomin g lucrative Christmas season. Second, there are rumors that Expert Electronics Design Solutions (EED S) our chief competitor is working on a similar product. You obviously recognize the impor tance of our beating them to the market.\" Raef noddi ng in agreement asked: accuracy of the rumors?\" Jonathon: \"The information comes from Simon Wright who had overheard two EEDS executive s talking after a round of golf at the country club.\" Follow ing a long pause, Jonathon added \"I have some additiona l information for you. It seems that since over hearing this information, Simon had been talking to his dad (VP of Engineering Thomas Wright) about the project. As you will remember, Simon was one of your finalists in selecting the original team. It seems that Simon, who was very upset at not being selected for the project, has been closely following the project and has convinced his dad that not only would being a part of the project advance his career, but that due to his connections and background, he could make valuable contributions to the project. Thomas agrees and while he is not demanding that Simon be placed on the team, he is suggesting that you give it strong consideration.\" Raef: \"What do you think that I should do?\" Page 91 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Jonathon: \"I know my big brother, and onc e he makes up hi s mind, he is pretty inflexible. 'Strong consideration' means that, if it were me and I had any hope s of remaining in charge of this project not to mention having any future with this company, I would add Simon to the team. But, ultim ately, it is your choice.\" Raef: \"OK, Thanks for your candor . I will add Simon ... \" Jonathon interrupting: \"I think that is a wise decision. Quite frankly, Thomas has some concer ns about your ability to lead this project.\" Raef: \"Oh, really.\" Jonathon: \"Yes. He has been follow ing the team's progress very closely, more closely than any of the other projects in development. While he would never 'interfere' with a project, he has demonstrated in the past when a project wasn't going as well as he thought that it shou ld, heads would roll - meaning that he would demand that the project leader be replaced. Not having worked with you as closely as I have, Thomas doesn't have as much faith as I do in your ability to successf ully complete this project on time. He feels that you and your team 'squandered' the 33 days of slack, you had built into your WBS. That, and he was disappointed in your initial decision to not include Simon as a member of your team.\" Raef: \"But, but, Simon has no techni cal qualifications.\" Jonathon: \"I think that Thomas recognizes that, and that is why he didn't insist that you put Simon on the team from the get go. How ever in retrospect, and this is just my guessing, as you know Thomas is almost 20 years my senior and with retirement looming in the not too distant future, I think that he views this project as one of the last, if not the last, opportunity he will have to help Simon get hims elf firmly established as a valued member of the management team. So, ... At this point, Jonathon's assistant reminde d Jonathon that his meeting starts in 5 minut es. Raef: \"Thanks for the information. I will get back to you on the shortened schedule options.\" Jonathon: \"I need those options within a week, and they need to be good. To be blunt, you will recall that when I was manager of the EE division, I was the one who hired you. After I was promoted to Regional EE Director, I have kept a close eye on your development. I was the one who selected you to lead this project, so my neck is on the line as well. If you go down, then I am right there with you. Don 't let me down.\" Raef: \"I appreciate your continue d confidence in me, and I will check with my team to develop a couple of options for you. We will get them to you within a week. I won't let you down. Have a good weekend.\" As he left Jonathon's office, Raef reflected back on Simon's comm ent whe n he told Simon that he would not be part of the Alpha C306 team: \"You are making a HUGE mistake by not including me on the team. We will see how the budget and timeline work out for you.\" Simon's words kept echoing in Raef's mind. Is it possible that Simon was orchestrating the shortened schedule so that he could be a part of the team? Once back at his office, Raef arranged an emergency meetin g of his team. Raef expected some resistance from his team to this aggressive action and was not looking forward to broachi ng the subject with them. Since it was on such short notic e and on a Friday afternoon, Page 92 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 availability of his team members was limite d, but Raef knew that it was important to give them the news as soon as possible. As luck wou ld have it, everyone was available at 3:00, but only for 30 minut es. Friday meeting to discuss shortening the schedule timeline Raef: \"Good afternoon everyone! Happy Friday the thirteen! I know that this meetin g was not on our regular schedule and I appreciate everyone rearranging their schedules to come today. Let's get down to it. I had a meeting with Jonathon Wright before work this morning in which he asked that the project team develop 2 options to shorten the project schedule. He is requesting that we accelerate project completion by at least a month, preferably two months. In round numbers that means a 480-day and a 450-day schedule. Remember that activitie s A - K (see Table 1) took longer than we had originally estimated, so we no longer have an extra 33 days. So any revisions to the WBS must be based on our 515-day schedule.\" Billy: \"How can management ask us to shorten this schedule? We have spent the past 6 months putting together a realistic and fea sible schedule for this project. This is unbe lievable!\" Pierce: \"Raef, did you explain to Wright how difficult it was to develop the 515-day schedule, and that we have already cut it to the bone? We cut our original WBS of 578 days to 515 days, and we can't reasonably be expected to reduce it anymore. The fact that we have already used up the 33 days of slack should be an indication that additiona l cuts aren't realistic. Did you also remind him that management approved the 515-day schedule? What has changed?\" Raef: \"Jonathon indicated that some preliminary marketing results from several large potential customers suggested that they needed the produc t sooner. And, Simon Wright has obtained some information that Expert Electronics Design Solutions is working on a similar produc t. I can't stress enough how impor tant it is that we beat EEDS to the marketplace.\" Billy: \"What does Simon Wright have to do with our project?\" Daniel: \"Perhaps I might be able to shed some light on this issue. Developing new produc ts is not an exact science; there is a lot of uncertainty especially for those projects with a long timeline. It has been my experience that many timelines have some 'fudge\" built into them. Perhaps the excess we built into our timeline is not sufficient to meet the 480 and 450 day requests, but perhaps there is some compromise we could make. In any event, we may need to recalculate the shortened time frames and ultim ately the subsequent related costs from our original estimates. Many times the additiona l costs are sufficiently high that they are prohibitive to the company's rate of return.\" Raef: \"Thank you for your comme nts, Daniel. I know that this request by management is not popul ar and both are aggressive, but we do not have a choice but to develop the proposals. As Daniel points out, it will be their choice based on the additiona l costs. Projects never go in a smooth straight line. I would like to reassemble the team for a Monda y meeting to develop these 2 sho rtened schedules. Does Monda y at 1:30 work for everyone?\" All members of the team agreed that Monda y works. As the team is getting up to leave, Raef adds: \"Oh, one last thing, because of Simon's uncann y access to information and his unique skill set, I have decided to add Simon Wright to Page 93 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 the team. He will be joining us on Monda y. Have a GREAT weekend, and see you M onday with your ideas regarding the shortened schedules.\" As they are walking do wn the hall, Billy and Pierce discuss the bombshell that Raef just droppe d on them. Billy: \"I can see where Friday the thirteen gets its bad name. Can you believe what is happening to this project?\" Pierce: \"What a mess. I knew that things had been g oing too well.\" Billy: \"It is bad enough that management wants to shorten the schedule, but I can't believe that upstart Daniel lecturing us on how project planning wo rks. 'In my experience' hogwash! He has been here, what 4 years, and that makes him an 'expert.' I guess my 32 years here don 't count for anything, and what about you and all of your experience. His 'I know it all' attitude really bugs me.\" Pierce: \"I agree, but I think that he can be handled, and actually, Raef is doing a pretty good job in holding him in check. Other than the shortened schedule what has me very concer ned is the addition of Simon Wright. I knew that that little worm would find his way on to the project.\" Billy: \"Why is that?\" Pierce: \"To be blunt, Simon is an incompetent playboy. The only reason he has a job here is because his dad is VP of En gineering, and I am sure that daddy is the real reason that Simon is being added to the team. All Simon does is play golf and hang out at the country club; that is why they put him in Public Relations, so that he could 'relate.' His 'information' was probably something he overheard at the bar. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me at all if he were bragging about the Alpha C306 to someone who then stole our idea. I just don't trust the guy.\" Billy: \"Good to know. I will keep an eye on him.\" Rae Beth who had been walking only a few steps behind the pair said \"Maybe we shou ld give Simon the benefit of the doubt and allow him to prove himself.\" Billy: \"That's right. I would expect you to take his side. You are always talking about how 'wond erful' his mom Mary Beth is. You and Simon got something going on?\" Rae Beth: \"Only an impoverished demented mind could say something like that, or have you been smoking something, Billy?\" At that point, they had reached the end of the hall, where the three parted in their separate directions. Monday meeting to finalize proposals Raef: \"Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for again rearranging your schedules so that we can meet. As you will recall, I mentioned on Friday that Simon Wright woul d be joining our team, so I would like to introduc e Simon to those of you who don't know him.\" Simon: \"I am delighted to FINALLY be a part of this project. I think that you will see that I have much to add as we go along.\" Raef: \"Thanks, Simon. Well, let's deal with the aftermath of Friday the thirteen.\" Page 94 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Alison: \"I hope no one minds, but I took the liberty of organizing some of our data. Based on where we are currently in our timeline, Activiti es A-K are completed (see Table 1). The remaining activiti es are L-T; all of these activities are on the critical path (see Figure 1) and are sequentially linke d. This will make shortening the time frames much easier since the critical path will not change for either of the shortened options.\" Table 1 Normal Table for the 515 Day Completion Time TASK / ACTIVITY NORMAL TIME NORMAL COSTS A Develop Prototype: Specifications* 0 NA B End-User Requirements 60 $ 25,000 C Application Requirements 80 $ 78,500 D Go/No Go D ecision 6 $ 2,500 E Prototype Review 14 $ 25,200 F Financial Review 20 $ 12,500 G Schedule Review 46 $ 63,750 H Technical Capab ilities Review 52 $130 ,000 I Financial Commitment Review 10 $ 12,500 J Go/No Go D ecision 6 $ 1,250 K Testing 82 $ 91,500 L Results/Analysis 30 $ 18,750 M Correc tive Actions 10 $ 4,000 N Re-tests 95 $106 ,000 O Re-tests Results/Analysis 25 $ Trial-Test 40 $162 ,500 Q Results-Test Market/Analysis 50 $ 83,500 R Integrate Test Market Results into Product Design 85 $125 ,000 S Final Product Specifications Review 20 $ 37,500 T Go/No Go D ecision 6 $ 2,500 TOTAL PROJECT COSTS $999 ,050 *These activities have already been accomplished; not part of the team's timeline Raef: \"Thanks, Alison. You are correct; according to our WBS we are currently in the final stages of Activity K, which means that starting with Activity L we have 361 days remaining. Let's deal with the 480-day schedule first. The 480-day schedule requires a reduction of 35 days. Let's see which of the time frames for activitie s L-T can be crashed?\" Rae Beth: \"I suggest we consider crashing those activitie s which have longer task times; for example, I recall from our earlier discussions that Activity N (Retests) had some excess time built into it. We said earlier that the 'N' activi ty woul d take 75 days, but could we shorten it by 25 days? Perhaps, do we even need to do the retests at all at this stage?\" Pierce: \"Are you kidding? If there is not enough time to test and retest the prototype, chances are we will wind up with an inferior product. Then what will management say about that!\" Robert: \"Do you think it is possible to conso lidate some of these tests. Activity 'O' (retests results/analysis) might also be able to contribute to the 35-day reduction.\" Page 95 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Philip: \"How about a compromise here. Let's reduce Activity 'N' by 20 days and Activity 'O' by 5 days. Looki ng ahead to the 450-day schedule, we might even be able to reduce the 'N' Activity by a total of 25 days. Does this seem reasonable?\" Pierce: \"How 'reasonable' it is depends on how much extra management is willing to spend to shave time off of the project. Remember 'time is money' and in this case we are talking about pulling engineers off of their current project to work on the Alpha C306, so not only is there expense for their time, but there is staff time, suppo rt opera tions, etc. Therefore, to simplif y matters I suggest we add in a flat $7,500 per day for the added expenses.\" Philip: \"That seems a little high to me, how about we go with $ 5,000 per day.\" Simon: \"I agree with Philip, the lower the cost, the more likely the brass will approve this. But, $5,000 per day still seems steep, what about $1,500 per day.\" Billy: \"Simon, that is laughable; you are show ing your total lack of knowledge of the testing process.\" Simon: \"I resent that, my back ground in economics tells me that ...\" Pierce, interrupting: \"While you are right, Philip, my estimates might be a bit on the high side; we don't want to put ourselves in hole here. Remember it is management who wants a shorter time frame and don't forget that our overly optimi stic estimates in the early stages, A-K, put us in a hole time wise, as we have already used up all of the 'spare' days we had built into the schedule.\" Raef, wanting to ease the tension, but also acutely aware of VP Wright's concerns suggests \"how about we compromis e, rather than applying a flat daily rate, what if we make reasonable estimates for each of the targeted activities? That way we can have reasonable cost estimates that won't put us in a bind in meeting the time commitm ents.\" Philip: \"That seems like a reasonable suggestion. Now all we have to do is determine what is a 'reasonable estimate' for each of the activities.\" Alison: \"Activity N involves retesting, so while that will obviously involve some engineering time, it will probably also take staff time in the preparing reports and documentation. How about $2,900 per day for Activity N?\" Pierce: \"Let's see, engineers, plus replacement costs, plus suppo rt staff, given that initial testing has already occurred, $3,000 per day shou ld do it.\" Philip: \"How about we split the difference and go with $2950 ?\" Alison: \"Ok, now on Activity O, Re-tests Results/Analysis, shou ld take much less engineering time and more time from the statistics guys in produc t research, so this activi ty shou ldn't be as expensive.\" Rae Beth: \"I agree. Since I work closely with those guys I think that $1600/day seems reasonable.\" Philip: \"I think that we should defer to your expertise Rae Beth and go with that.\" Raef: \"I would like to gain a consensus from the group on Philip's propos al. If we agree to this propos al, this will give us 25 days towards the 35 days required, and add a total of $4550 for each day reduced. If we agree, then finding the other 10 days shou ld result in less impact to the other remaining activ ities. What do you think?\" Page 96 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Somewhat reluctantly, Pierce agreed to go along with the others, indicating that it was not a \"deal breaker.\" Raef: \"OK. Now let's find the other 10 days. Any thoug hts?\" Daniel: \"I suggest that we capture the 10 days from the 'R' Activity (Integrate test market results into Produc t Design). We had originally allocated 85 days in the 515-day time line. By the time we get to this point, many of the integration efforts from the test market data will have already been considered. The test market data is for the most part a confirmation. Ther efore, I believe we could realistically cut Activity 'R' by a total of 10 days for the 480-day schedule. I am not sure, however, if we can c ut more days from the 'R' Activity for the 450-day schedule.\" Raef: \"Does anyone else have anything they to add?\" Billy: \"I also concur with Pierce' s concerns. In my 32 years with the company, I have seen management flip/flop on decisions and set some unrea listic expectations and deadline s. We are at risk, as Pierce said, of developing an inferior product that we cannot manufacture and distribute to the marketplace. W e run the risk of making promis es to the large customers and find out that we cannot deliver on those promis es. We must be caref ul here to not set expectations unrea listically. Raef, I think it is your job to make sure management understands how strongly we feel about produc ing a quality product, one that reflects well on the company.\" Pierce: \"To that end, time reductions at this stage in the process will be very expensive as this step involves primarily engineering expertise, very skilled engineering expertise. Daniel is correct that much of the integration efforts will have already been accomplish ed. How ever, changes at this point will involve highly techni cal fine tuning, thus requiring focused attention by engineers who have both skills and experience with this process, and those effor ts are expensive. That is why I was suggesting the $7,500 /day.\" Simon: \"Are you back to that unrea listic still think that $1,500/ day is adequate.\" Billy: \"Simon, Simon, Simon... you really don't have a clue, do you?\" Rae Beth: \"There is no need to get personal here. Pierce is right, reductions at this stage will be expensive, but $7,500 /day does seem a bit high. How about $4,500/ Philip: \"That seems like a reasonable estimate.\" Pierce: \"OK, I can see the writing on the wall; however, I can't suppo rt anything less than $5,000/ day.\" Philip: \"That seems like a reasonable compromis e, one that I can supp ort.\" As Raef looks around the room, he sees everyone but Simon noddi ng in agreement. Raef: \"Other than Simon, there seems to be general agreement on a reduction of activi ty R by 10 days at an added cost of $5,000/ day. Is that correct?\" Everyone nods in agreement. Simon: \"While I am obviously outnumbered, I want to go on record as being oppos ed to an excessi ve, extravagant and totally unrealistic cost estimate.\" Raef: \"Thank you Simon, your position is noted, however, since there seems to be general agreement, let's use those numbers for finalizing the 480 day schedule and move on to the 450 day schedule.\" Simon: \"Do what you want; I guess we will see how 'reasonable' this estimate is as we go along.\" Page 97 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Rae Beth: \"Perhaps, we could include a probability analysis for each option. Management needs to know what the risks are. What better way than to provide them with a Decision Table for the risk.\" Alison: \"That's a very good suggestion Rae Beth.\" Raef: \"Ok, then, for the 480 day schedule, we will shorten Activity 'N' by 20 days, Activity 'O' by 5 days, and Activity 'R' by 10 days, at an added total cost of $9,500/ day. Let's turn our attention to the 450-day schedule. We need to find another 30 days reduction from the 480-day schedule. What... \" Billy: \"With all due respect Raef, you are asking the imposs ible. Even Daniel stated that he was doubt ful that the \"R\" activity could be reduced further. Philip indicated that we could 'squeak' another 5 days from Activity 'N'.\" Robert: \"Perhaps, we could find smaller cuts in some of the other activities. For example, we might cut 5 days from Activitie s 'P' and 'S' respective ly (see Table 1).\" The combination of cuts from Activitie s 'N', 'P', and \"S' would total 15 days. That gets us half way to the 450-day schedule.\" Daniel: \"There seems to be few activ ities we can shorten to reach a 450-day schedule. How ever, it has been my experience with test markets results/analysis, we could possibly gain an extra 10 days by crashing the 'Q' activity (see Table 1). I do not see the produc t development department personnel analyzing the test market data any quicker than 40 days; as you recall in our original 515-day schedule, we said it wou ld take 50 days to complete the 'Q' activ ity. I think we can get 10 more days, but that means the schedule would be a 455-day schedule, not a 450- day schedule.\" Raef looks around the room at the team and asks for additiona l thoughts on the propos ed 455-day schedule. No one responds. Everyone's body language tells the mood of the team. Raef: \"OK, let's propos e a 455-day schedule rather than a 450-day schedule. We still need to come up w ith cost estimates for those cuts.\" Alison: \"Since we are propos ing cutting 5 additional days from Activity N, \"Retests,\" we need to recognize that the additiona l time will be more expensive than the initial reductions. An additiona l $250/ day above the initial reduction costs shou ld cover it.\" Simon: \"Since this will probably mean adding one junior staffer, how about $200/ day additiona l?\" Philip: \"That seems a little low, even for a 'junior staffer.' I think it woul d be safer to go with an additional $230/ day.\" Simon: \"While you folks seem to want to price this project out of existence, an addition al $230/ day seems more reasonable than anything else you have propos ed.\" Raef: \"Ok, we are making progress, Activity N reduced an additional 5 days by an additiona l $230/ day. Other suggestions ?\" Rae Beth: \"The 5 day reduction for Activity P, Trial-Test Market, will involve a number of different departments - engineering, statistics, marketing, and various suppo rt staff, thus making this one of the more expensive areas for reduction. This may be another of those $5,000/ day reductions.\" Page 98 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Daniel: \"While you are correct that the step will involve a number of different departments, the primary ones will be statistics and marketing. While marketing activities, with their related costs with graphics, design, etc., take time, they can be items that can be 'fast tracked.' Therefore, I would propose that $4,400/ day shou ld be adequate.\" Philip: \"Since Daniel is from marketing, I think that we shou ld defer to his expertise.\" Raef: \"Alright, we are really making some progress. We can propose another 5 day reduction a t $4,400/ day. That gives us estimated costs for a total of 10 days. Any other suggestions ?\" Daniel: \"The 10 days from Activity Q Results-Test Market/Analysis, while including other departments are also heavi ly related to marketing activiti es and statistical analysis. This shou ld be able to be accomplish ed with an additional $ 1,890/ day.\" Philip: \"Again, I think we have to defer to Daniel.\" Raef: \"That leaves us with estimates for Activity S, Final Produc t Specifications Review. Any thoughts here?\" Philip: \"This is another activi ty that involves multipl e departments, but primarily engineering. Since precision is extremely impor tant at this stage, any time reductions which can be achieved will require multipl e doubl e checking by 'fresh eyes.' Therefore, l $3,000/ day seems reasonable here.\" Simon: \"There you go again, trying to jack up the costs. Why wouldn't $1,500/ day work here?\" Pierce: \"Philip explained the reasoning, the step requires precision. This is a place we don't want to 'cut corners.' How ever, in an effort to respond to your cost concer ns, what's say we compromise at $2,20 0/day?\" Philip: \"I am not sure that will be enoug h.\" Simon: \"I agree, I am not sure that will be enough of a cut.\" Alison: \"Pierce seems to have offered a reasonable compromis e, I woul d vote to go along with him.\" The others nod in agreement. Philip: \"While I am not sure that this funding level will be adequate, for the sake of winding this up, I am willing to go along with the majority.\" Simon: \"This is another case where I think that the group is being extravagant.\" Raef: \"OK, Simon, your objection is again noted. So, in summa ry, we are propos ing a 455-day schedule, with an additiona l 5 days cut from Activitie s N, P and S and a 10-day reduction in Activity Q at an additiona l cost per day of $8,720 over the 480-day schedule. Is that correct?\" All nod in agreement. Raef: \"There is no doubt that a risk/probability analysis will have to be conduc ted for both the 480-day and the 455-day schedules. The risk analysis and the additional costs will most likely dissuade management from seriously considering the 455-day schedule. Who knows, perhaps they will be happy with a compromise schedule somewhere between 480 and 455 days. My report to management with our analysis and recomme ndation will be strongly sugg estive that the 455-day option is not realistic, but the 480-day may be feasible. This of course assumes that Page 99 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 the results from the risk analysis confirm my opinion. Facing management's deadline for our analysis gives us very little time to be as thorough as we might like. I also have to work up the cost tables based on these changes to include in the report.\" As a result of the discussion, R aef knew that the team was reluctant to make reductions to achieve a 480-day schedule and were openly hostile to a 450-day schedule. How ever, they seemed to be willing to at least offer up a propos al. Raef knew that he was in a difficult pos ition as he was trying to balance the desires of his bosses while at the same time maintain the confidence of his team so that they could complete the project. His negative comme nts about the 455-day schedule were, in part, an attempt to placate the team as he suspected that his bosses would prefe r to complete the project as quickly as possible, assuming it was economical ly feasible to do so. Therefore, Raef moved toward ending the meeting by saying: \"Listen folks\u2014I know that this is not ideal. Our job is to provide the best analysis to management that we can and that includes our concerns and re servations. Are we in agreement?\" The group reluctantly agrees with Raef. Raef: \"Thanks everyone for your assistance on developing the two shortened schedules. I will work up the report for management and send you all a copy. If you see anything in the report that needs revision, let me know by Wednesday.\" Over the next couple of days, Raef developed the report for management. Included in the report are three tables: 1) Normal Table 515-Day Schedule, 2) Crash Table\u2014480-Day Schedule, 3) Crash Table\u2014455- Day Schedule; and 2 Figures are included: 1) Activity Network and 2) Decision Tree. Given the analysis, management woul d have to decide if shortening the schedule, and by how much, made economic sense.

Loy, Eastern Kentucky University Kambiz Tabibzadeh, Eastern Kentucky University ABSTRACT This case concerns issues related to an inter -governmental joint venture comprised of a regional state university, a county government, and two city governments, in overseeing a jointly funded operation. The case describes the resulting ambiguous chain of command, failure to provide top management support, and power conflict. Secondary issues involve the failure to implement secure information processing procedures. After months of conflict, a compromise that smoothed over the organizational structure prob lem without resolving it was reached. The case is suitable for graduate and advanced undergraduate business management and management information systems courses. The case has a difficulty level of four. Students should spend from eight to ten hours outs ide of class analyzing the case, depending on the breadth and depth of the analysis the instructor desires. CASE SYNOPSIS The Mid South University (MSU) Center for the Arts had its grand opening in September 2011. The $32 million facility was a long -time dream come true for MSU and its surrounding communities that could enhance their national and international image and brand. The Center for the Arts is a 2,016 -seat facility with a Broadway -quality theater, a grand lobby suitable for multiple events, and a configurable \"black box theater,\" with a capacity of 250 for small events. It is the largest performing arts center in the state . An experienced and regionally well -known arts administrator, was hired to be the Center's Executive Operations Direct or six months before the grand opening. There were twenty -one performances the first season, and revenues exceeded expectations despite internal accusations that the Center was seriously mismanaged. After a six month long internal investigation, the MSU president publicly announced his intent to fire the executive director for: \"...fiscal misconduct and falsification of university records and documents. Violation of human - resources policies (e.g., improprieties such as submitting inappropriate meals and items on expense reports, and directing students to falsify time cards, creati ng a discourteous and unfriendly work environment, inappropriate behavior toward students (e.g., student workers, such as stagehands, ushers, and parking valets) , improper handling of customers' credit card information, and the misleading of university off icials ...\" (Copley, 2013c). The Center's executive director denied the accusations claiming she misunderstood, or was unawa re of, the university policies. To avoid being fired, she submitted a letter of Page 104 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 resignation to the Center's Community Operations B oard which had recruited and hired her. Surprisingly, the Board rejected her resignation, and rejected the university president's claim of authority to fire the executive director without the Board's approval. Thus, the stage was set for a battle between the university and the Board over who has authority over the Center's executive director. BACKGROUND MSU is the fourth largest public university in Kentucky and located in the state's fastest growing county. In 2003, MSU adopted a strategy to repositio n itself from a regional brand to a national and international brand, and a first -class performing arts center was seen as a way to enhance the status of MSU and its surrounding communities. In September 2011, Center for the Arts opened on the MSU campus. It is a 2,100 -seat Broadway -capable, Broadway -quality theater with a \"fly system\" and a 60 -foot by 24 -foot stage proscenium, as well as a configurable \"black - box\" theater with seating up to 250. The nearest performing arts center is the Flagship Universit y Center for the Fine Ar ts, 25 miles away , which was built in 1979 and has a seating capacity of 1200. The next closest is t he Marti n Center at Central College , 45 miles away, which is an internationally acclaimed performing arts center with a sea ting cap acity of 1470. The Marti n Center hosts outstanding guest artists, touring productions, symphony orchestras, and hosted Vice Presidential Candidates debates in 2000 and 2012. POOLING RESOURCES From the beginning, MSU included local government official s in developing plans for the Center for the Performing Arts. MSU 's share of the construction cost had to be appropriated through specific authorization by the state legislature. Since, the financial situation of the state was in poor shape at the time, wi th no likelihood for improvement in the foreseeable future, a strategy was developed to pool funding from two city governments ( Richland and Bergen ), one county government ( Macon ), and the state government via MSU . The state legislation authorized the crea tion of a 13 -member Community Oversight Board for the Center with representatives of MSU , the cities of Richland and Bergen , and Macon County to oversee the design, construction and operations of the Center. The joint organization of the Center was the sub ject of a presentation at the fifth annual Best Practices in Building University/City Relations Conference, hosted by the International Town & Gown Association and Iowa State University. (\"Center for the Performing Arts ...,\" 2010) MSU had two powerful alli es in the state legislature, Harry Matherly and Ed Wardl y. Matherly was the MSU Vice President for Finance & Administration and Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and Wardly , a Richland native and MSU alumnus, was the minority leader in the state senate. Matherly and Wardly , ushered th e bill through the legislature. During the drafting of the bill, Matherly inserted a provision stating that oversight control of the Center would be jointly shared by a Community Operations Board comprised of representatives from Page 105 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Macon County, City of Richland , City of Bergen , and MSU , and that the Board would be responsible for hiring the Center's Executive Director. After the bill was signed into law by the governor i n the spring of 2009, a 13 -member Community Operations Board was created to oversee construction of the Center and to hire an executive director. Composition of the Board is as follows (\" MSU ...,\" 2011): Two members appointed by Mayor City of Richland One member by Mayor City of Bergen Four members appointed by Macon County Judge -Executive Six members appointed by MSU President One ex officio member representing MSU Construction of the Center began in the fall of 2009. Once construction was underway, a national search for the Executive Director was conducted which resulted in the hiring of Carolyn Engstrom. Engstrom assumed the duties of Executive Director on January 1, 2010. She had eleven years of experience as execut ive director of a Community College Performing Arts Center and four years of experience as director of community develo pment for the state's Arts Council (Mandell, 2009). When the executive director po sition was created, the director was classified as a non - contract MSU employee for payroll purposes and depicted on the university's organization chart as subordinate to the university president despite, by state law, being hired by and reporting to the Bo ard, which is independent of the university. As an MSU employee, the university administration demanded that she clear her decisions and actions through them, and to follow its complex set of accounting policies for expenditure approvals, expense document ation, and personnel management policies. The Board, on the other hand, was concerned about \"big picture\" issues like construction costs and construction progress. In October 2011, Engstrom resigned. Officially, the stated reason was to family health issues, but colleagues knew she was frustrated about with the university's confusing accounting and budgeting procedures by herself. She had expected the Board would hire a business operations director to handle accounting and budgeting tasks, but the Board ha d yet to hire one. With Engstrom 's resignation, the Board acted quickly to hire a new executive director to make decisions about the Center's interior designs and furnishings, and to book acts for the first season that was scheduled to begin September 20 12. After a month long search, the Board hired a new Executive Director. The new director started work on February 1, 2012 without a written contract. (Robinson, 2012) The new director, Johnson , had eighteen years of experience as the assistant direct or fo r the Marti n Center for the Arts at Centr al College. She had exce ptional energy and initiativ e, and brought many extrao rdinary events to the Marti n Center, but she had no experience in managing day-to-day business operations, such as payroll, processing ticket sales, budget management, etc. When the Marti n Center executive director job became open in June 2011, she applied for the position but did not get it. After conducting a national search, Johnson was not offered the Marti n Center executive directo r position . Shortly afterward, she submitte d her resignation. (Copley, 2010). Page 106 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 In an interview, she said she resigned because \"Thin gs feel like t hey are going in a different directio n, and it felt like it was time to move o n...If you are goi ng to make a care er change, you need to do it whe n you a re still young and smart enough to make the right moves.\" (Copley, 2010) THE GOOD AND THE BAD The Center's first season was considered success ful due to the high quality of acts that performed. More than 50,500 tic kets were sold which generated more than $2 million in revenue. However, the first year operating loss was $486,000. From the very first performance, business process problems were apparent. At the grand opening, a long line for tickets at the will -call window delayed the performance by nearly an hour. The executive director explained that the Center's online ticketing system hand not been set up yet, which meant all credit/debit card transactions had to be entered by authorized personnel. The executive director was only one at the Center authorized to access the university's credit/debit card transaction processing software. Without an online order and payment system, patrons had to phone in their order, or buy their t ickets in person at the Center. Those who purchased by phone had to provide their mailing address and credit/debit car d numbers to a Center employee. The executive director often took these calls on a cell phone as she attend to various tasks around the building and recorded the ticket re quest and credit/debit card numbers on a notepad to be processed later. When other Center employees took phone calls, they wrote the card information on Post -it Notes for later entry by the executive director. Patrons, who did not want to give their card numbers over the phone, had to go to the Center in person to purchase tickets. Patrons had the option to have tickets mailed to them, or to pick them up at the Center in advance or at the will -call window. As the first season progressed, the university a dministration received complaints about personnel and operational mismanagement of the ticket sales and other problems, which prompted the university president to authorize an investigation. The findings of the investigation were compiled in a 740 -page re port. Report Findings The report listed the following financial management problems. (Copley, 2013b) The Center did not accurately pay production companies for 12 out of 26 performances. After these underpayments were discovered, payments in full were immediately issued. For the year, they overpaid performers by a total amount of $46,622, which was not returned. Weak internal cash handling controls allowed errors or irregularities to occur that might make it impossible to pinpoint responsibility for the loss on one individual. For example, cashiers were not required to reconcile their cash drawer at the end of the shift, and sales reports were not routinely compared with bank deposits. Recorded ticket revenue for the season was nearly $1.8 million, but t he ticketing sales system showed nearly $1.9 million in sales, a discrepancy of $104,731. All box office desks were inundated with slips of paper containing patron names, ticket request information, and credit card numbers. It was impossible to determine a ny system for collecting, processing or managing this information for ticket sales and payment collection. Page 107 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Calculations on some invoices from some production companies were altered so the amount billed would match the amount actually paid. 6,899 complimen tary tickets, valued at $389,039, were distributed free of charge. There was no record of who received 3,125 of those tickets. A \"Save Your Seat\" fundraising program placed 74 engraved plaques on the seats in the main auditorium, but records indicated that only 29 patrons made the designated $500 donation. Irregularities in the director's university issued procurement card (ProCard). There were 98 transactions, totaling $14,564, either by unauthorized individuals or for disallowed meal purchases. Violation of various HR policies and procedures, including but not limited to falsification of time cards by directing students to inaccurately report time worked, allowing individuals to \"work\" at the Center prior to being hired by the University pursuant to estab lished HR procedures; and inappropriate conduct in violation of the Staff Handbook work rules for employees; and Inappropriate conduct by maintaining credit card information provided by ticket holders in an unsecured area, in direct violation of PDI Date S ecurity Standard (PCI DSS) and 16 CFR Part 314 as well as intentionally misleading University officials as to the existence of this information. Director's Response The director responded by saying manual ticket sales process was not an unusual method for taking orders, and that the late arrival of the Center's online ticketing and purchasing software and lack of computers for box -office workers forced her to create the manual processes. The director also claimed to not know others should not use her unive rsity issued ProCard. \"The university bureaucracy was overwhelming because I had never worked in state bureaucracy before. But, as I was told of these policies and procedures, they were implemented ... As I told the Board when I was hired, I'm no financial m anager \u2014 that's not my strong suit.\" (Copley, 2013b) Johnson claimed that when she accepted the job, there was an understanding that the Board would hire an operations director to handle the financial, personnel, and details for the Center. Twice, the Boa rd conducted unsuccessful searches for an operations manager. However, no one applied for the position presumably due to the low advertised salary. (Copley, 2013b) After reading the report's findings, the university president sent a letter to the Center's director to notify her that her employment was being terminated and that she was to vacate her office immediately. In response, the director immediately submitted her letter of resignation to the Board. Surprisingly, the Board rejected her resignation a nd declared the university president did not have the authority to fire the Center director. Thus, the stage was set for a battle between the university president and the Board over the management control of the Center's director. WHO'S IN CHARGE? The B oard based its claim for management control on the section in the state law that authorized the construction and partial funding of the Center. That section placed authority regarding personnel with the Board, not the university. \"... a majority of the cent er Board disagreed with the university's action, saying the Board had authority over personnel decisions at the center. Board member Harry Matherly cited state law regarding the center which states the Board \"shall make all decisions regarding personnel.\" At the June 14 meeting, the Board Page 108 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 voted 8 -3 for a resolution to retain (the current Director) . The resolution said the university did not have \"authority to take unilateral personnel action\" against employees at the center.\" (Copley, 2012) Reluctantly, a fter several contentious days, the Board accepted the director's resignation and appointed an interim director. Then, the university president and the Board began grappling over the wording of a formal agreement to clarify who has authority over the Cente r's director. Meanwhile, job availability announcements for the full -time director position were posted in newspapers and relevant trade publications. Eight months passed without a resolution of the conflict between the Board and the university president. The committee in charge of conducting the search for director candidates received about 90 applications. However, the selection of candidates to interview was put on hold until the Board and the university resolved their conflict , because the comm ittee wanted to know to whom the new director would report before interviewing applicants. (Copley, 2013a) Eventually, the MSU President agreed that the Center's executive director would report to the Board and perform duties in compliance with university accoun tability standards, regulations, policies and procedures. \"We cannot let this go on another six months. University guidelines and policies can be adhered to within the parameters of the Board, and (we) trust that everybody will act in good faith.\" (Copley, 2013a) NEW DIRECTOR The Center was managed by an interim director during its second season. Attendance and revenue were down. An online ticket sales processing software was installed for the Center's website. However, the software was not compatible w ith the university's transaction software. This incompatibility meant that credit/debit card data had to be manually transcribed from the Center's online processing software to the university's online processing software. During the second season, the Boa rd conducted a national search for a new executive director. Ninety candidates were considered for the director position before the Board hired Joel Aalberts. Aalberts was the Director of Bloomington (Illinois) Center for the Arts. His prior experience included assistant marketing director for the University of Iowa's Hancher Auditorium, arts marketing assistant at the University of Michigan and University of Arizona, and public affairs officer at Dartmouth College. (Copley, 2014) Aalberts was well awar e of the problems he faced, but they didn't bother the seasoned veteran. \"From looking from the outside, (and) the areas that needed work, I felt like I knew how to fix those. I had gone through the same process at my last center, so I feel like it's somet hing I could get right for here.\" One of the first changes he made was getting an online transaction software installed that is compatible with the university's software. Thus, eliminating the need to manually transcribe data from one system to another wh ile substantially improving the card/debit card security for patrons. \"I've read the reports. I kind of know the stuff that's been out there. In some ways, the politics of it really doesn't matter to me that much. It's all done. I need to be aware of it so I can address those problems. I need to be aware of it so that if there is anyone who was pushed to the side, in all of the things that happened, if there are opportunities we missed, I need to go find Page 109 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 those people and introduce myself and talk about what it is that we want to do... In some ways, it's like going back to square one. There's a bit of baggage that I need to clean up to get things going. There's a great group of peo ple in the staff at the Center. We need to regain peoples' confidence and to be a stronger economic engine for the community.\" REFERENCES \"Center for the Arts Receives Vision Award from Bluegrass Tomorrow.\" (October 28, 2011).

Page 110 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 EXHIBIT A Page 111 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 JUHEL NIGERIA LTD. Basil Okoli, Baze University CASE OVERVIEW This case challenges students to develop alternatives for (within the next 12 months) very substantially increasing the revenues of a pharmaceutical company in Nigeria called Juhel Nigeria, Ltd. The case is appropriate for senior -level undergraduates as well as students in MBA and Executive Development programs. It is designed to be taught in a one hour and a half class session, and is likely to require at least a couple hours of preparation by students. CASE SYNOPSIS Dr. Ifeanyi Okoye is the founder and promoter of Juhel Nigeria, Ltd., a pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer in Nigeria. At its inception, the company focused on manufacturing and selling pharmaceuticals in Eastern Nigeria; now, however, the company sells its pharmaceutical products not only in Eastern Nigeria but all across Nigeria. While the company is already believed to be one of the top five pharmaceutical manufacturers in Nigeria, Dr. Okoye is eager to dramatically increase the pharmaceuticals - related sales and revenues of the company. Additional data and information in the case include: 1. Regarding Nigeria: Historical overview, a sample of recent demographic statistics from the World Bank, (and for benchmarking purposes, comparable statistics for the United States), plus information on the economy of Nigeria. 2. Regarding the company: Business model, current marketing strategy, current performance, and numerous factors impacting that performance. 3. Additional information: Information on the pharmaceutical -related activities and behaviors of members of the market the company has targeted, information ab out competing products and companies, and information about the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria. THE SITUATION Sensing that his meeting with D r. Ifeanyi Okoye, founder and promoter of Juhel Nigeria Ltd. was ending, Professor Ben Odu gathered up his notes. Although he might, later on, need specific information from those notes, Odu knew he would have no tro uble remembering the challenge D r. Okoye had given him, that is, to identify (within the next 30 days) a set of alternatives for (over the next 12 months) dramatically increasing the revenues of JUHEL NIGERIA LIMITED, a pha rmaceutical manufacturer headquartered in Enugu, Nigeria. Page 112 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (1): THE COUNTRY The Federal Republic of Nigeri a is a large (one tenth the landmass of the United States) country in West Africa. Administratively, Nigeria is composed of 36 states plus the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). These states differ in many ways, one of which is that the terrain ranges from beaches and swamps in the south to desert conditions in the north. Levels of education and income tend to be higher in the south than in the north. The dominant religion in the north is Islam while the south is predominantly Christian. Hausa is the domin ant ethnic group in the north; in the east, the dominant group is the Igbo, while the west is predominantly Yoruba. A small set of statistics on Nigeria, together with comparative data for the United States, are as indicated below: NIGERIA USA Size (square kilometers): 923,768 9,826,675 40% 2% All Others 10% All Others 20% Median Age: 19.2 36.9 Life Expectancy at Birth: 52 years 78.5 years Fertility Rate (births per woman): 5.38 2.06 Infant Mortality Rate: 74/1000 6/1000 School Life Expect ancy: nine years 16 year s % Of Population Who Are Literate: 68% 99% GDP (purchasing power parity, or PPP): $509 $15.04 trillion GDP per capita (PPP): approximately $48,100 % 21% 9% Electricity Consumption: 18 billion KWH 3.741 trillion KWH % Of Population In Urban Areas: 50% 82% % of Population Internet users 26% 78% Kilometers of 193,000 6,506,204 15% 67% Source: CIA World Factbook 2013 The implications flowing from the information provided in the statistical comparison between Nigeria and the United States in clude the fact that Nigeria is characterized by high birth and death rates, a high percentage of population in rural areas/ agriculture, low per capita income, and high illiteracy, According to Onah and Thomas (2004), additional characteristics of the population and/or the environment include: Poor sanitation and health practices, poor housing, weak feelings of nat ional cohesio n, tradition -directed behavior, low s tatus for women, inadequate communications, power, transportation and water infrastructures, export of raw (rather than value added) materials, low saving s and low net investments, very low agricultural yields, wealth in the hands of few landlords, poor credit facilities and high Page 113 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 interest rates, prevalence of non -monetized production, vast productive land in small holdings, wealth concentrated in one or two large cities (or exported to \"safe\" developed count ries), and family (and/or tribal) centered concerns and orientations. Onah and Thomas (2004) indicate that \"t hese prevailing conditions affect all facets of economic and social activities.\" ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (2 ): ECONOMIC OVERVIEW OF NIGERIA Before the discovery of oil 1956, Nigeria's economic growth and development depended primarily on export of primary agricultural commodities such as cocoa, palm oil and palm kerne l, groundnut, cotton and so on. These agricultural commodities provided the m ajor revenue base upon which the three regional governments (Eastern, Western and Northern Nigeria) then constituting the Federal Republic of Nigeria generated funds to pay for the development of the country. Oil revenue began to play significant role from 1970's onward especially after the Arab - Israeli conflict (Yon -Kipur war) of 1973. As a consequence of the war, Middle East supply of world oil needs was disrupted and Nigeria benefited from the resultant hike in oil prices. Historically, manufactured goods including medicines and allied products principally were imported from abroad and major trading firms in Nigeria were the sole importers and distributors of such goods; In those times, Nigerian businessmen then were involved more in the retail end of the value delivery chain. The Federal Government of Nigeria became concerned about the situation, and this prompted government deliberate policy thrust to effect a change through enactment by the military government then of the indigenizati on laws that were aimed at transferring 100 percent ownership of some of the hitherto less technical businesses held by foreigners to be controlled by Nigerians. But the 60 -70 percent of the manufacturing sector businesses that were capital intensive cou ld be controlled by foreign interests. The First and Second National Development Plans, 1971 through early 1980's pursued import substitution policy which tried to set up industries in Nigeria with raw materials, and in some cases parts, being supplied fro m abroad. That was the period motor assembly plants such as Anambra Motor Manufacturing Co. (ANAMCO -Mercedes) for Mercedes trucks, National Motor Manufacturing Company Co. Ltd, Kano for (Fiat trucks) and Volkswagen Plant, Ibadan, (for Volkswagen vehicles), were set up. In the same manner other foreign firms involved in the manufacturing of other goods allowed some form of Nigerian participation in order to remain in business in Nigeria's huge market. However, industrial production in Nigeria has not shown significant impact in the overall development of Nigeria. At 2.5% annual growth rate (2010 estimates) many industries are facing challenges arising from poor infrastructural facilities such as poor electricity power supply, bad roads, water supply, and in addition corruption and general insecurity and terrorism. Havi ng said all this, it seems worth noting that according to African Development Bank (2014) in the wake of the recently announced figures of Nigeria's rebased GDP of $509.9, \"the economy still fa ll short of being a knowledge economy given the domination of informal sector activities. The new data also show that the industrial sector contribution declined from 46.1% to 25.8%. While the oil and gas contribution has fallen to 15% Nigeria still remain s highly dependent on crude oil as its main export. But there was a modest increase in manufacturing contribution to 7% from 4%\". P laced side by side with the high degree of poor infrastructural facilities and other issues that tend to make doing business in Nigeria costly, one can agree with those who commented on the release of the new GDP figure that the country was \"growing in the dark\". That is, growth was recorded despite poor electric power supply plus other deficits . Page 114 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Regarding electric power: Niger ian's quest to provide a r obust electricity power to the economy commenced in April 1972 with the formation of a national power monopoly, the National Electric Power Authority (that is, NEPA). For many years, NEPA was responsible for generation, transmiss ion, distribution, and sale of electricity to all parts of the nation. The idea was to propel the nation's technological and industrial growth through robust energy supply. Over 40 years down the line this mandate has not been realized and the manufacturin g sector has suffered from this failure to the extent that some firms that earlier established factories in Nigeria preferred to move to neighboring countries in Africa especially Ghana which have a relatively more stable electric power supply. Companies such as Michelin Nig. Plc, Dunlop Nig Plc, and others to name just a few have moved over to Ghana. The aftermath of this trend is the low contribution of the manufacturing sector to the country's GDP, only about 6.83 percent and low employment for the yout hs of the country. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (3): HEALTH & HEALTHCARE -RELATED CHARACTERISTICS OF NIGERIA As noted by UNIDO 2011, \"the determining factor in the pharmaceutical business is the disease pattern and West Africa is no exception to this dictum. Malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis, coupled with widespread malnutrition and poverty, represent a double burden of disease on the population. In addition, heart -related diseases are also on the increase. Consequently, over the counter medicines such as an algesics, antimalarials and multivitamins make up a large share of the market. Antiretroviral (ARV), artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), anti -TB and antimicrobial antidiarrheal agents are life saving for patients in Nigeria.\" Another approach to loo king at the health & healthcare -related characteristics of Nigeria is to look at the statistics regarding diseases contributing to morbidity; the statistics are as indicated below: Contribution to Morbidity Disease conditions Contribution 1 HIV/AIDS 16.0% 2 Respiratory diseases 14.0% 3 Malaria 11.0% 4 Cardiovascular diseases 10.0% 5 Childhood diseases 9.0% 6 Diarrheal diseases 7.0% 7 Injuries (Road accidents, drowning, violence) 7.0% 8 Perinatal conditions 4.0% 9 Others (cancer, urinary diseases, TB, etc.) 22.0% Source: Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja, 2010, as shown in UNIDO 2011 Regarding the major disease conditions contributing to morbidity the following observations can be made: Malaria UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"malaria is responsible f or 60 per cent of all outpatient attendance, 30 per cent of all hospital admissions and 300,000 deaths annually (FMoH, 2010). Artemisinin CombinationTherapy (ACT) is the first line treatment in accordance with the national malaria treatment guidelines. The cumulative prevalence rate for malaria Page 115 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 infection in most parts of the country is 100 per cent in any 10 month period. It is estimated that at lea st 10 per cent of all childhood deaths are due directly to malaria and up to 25 per cent indirectly. As of 200 3, the volume of economic output lost because of incapacity through malaria was estimated at 4 per cent of GDP per annum (Amos Petu, 2004). Undoubtedly, malaria is one of the principal causes of morbidity and mortality in Nigeria and imposes an enormous so cio-economic burden on the country.\" Tuberculosis UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"TB is a major public health problem in Nigeria with the country ranking fourth among the 22 high TB burden countries which collectively account for about 80 per cent of the global burden of TB. According to the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), the number of TB cases notified in the country increased from 31,264 in 2002 to 90,307 in 2008. There are some 374,000 estimated new cases annually. In view of the magnitude of the bu rden of TB in Nigeria, the FMoH declared TB to be a national emergency in 2006. The public health burden posed by TB is becoming increasingly onerous as the count ry's HIV/AIDS epidemic unfolds. WHO estimates that more than a quarter of new TB patients are HIV positive. Collab orative TB-HIV/AIDS services are being scaled up and t he number of TB patients tested for HIV increased from about 7,500 in 2006 to 27,850 in 2007 (FMoH, 2010).\" HIV/AIDS UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"According to a UNAIDS Report published in 2009, the HIV prevalence in Nigeria has been steadily contracting from 5.8 per cent in 2001 to 3.1 per cent in 2007. This is a much lower figure than in other African countries, such as South Africa and Zambia, but the size of the population means that by the end of 2009 there were 3.3 mi llion Nigerians living with HIV (AVERT). Nigeria is one of 15 focus countries, which collec tively represent 50 per cent of HIV infections worldwide. . . . (there is a large gap) between those who need ART and those receiving ART. It also indicates the increasing trend in the number of HIV positive births, underlining the additional challenge of preventing mother -to-child HIV transmission.\" Regarding the h ealth care system in Nigeria, UNIDO (2011) indicates that: \"The country's health system was ranked 187th out of 191 member states by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000. The Government has acknowledged that the healthcare system is poorly organized and resourced and that this has contributed to an overall decline in health status indicators over the past decade. Government actions with respect to the pharmaceutical industry include: 1) A tariff structure designed to discourage the import of those essen tial medicines which are manufactured locally; the list of several medicines for which installed capacity of drug man ufacturers in Nigeria is high is as indicated below: Installed Capacity of Drug Manufacturers in Nigeria Products Installed capacity/year 1 Analgesics: Tablets 40 billion , Syrup/suspension 70 million liters , Ointments/Balms 700 million tubes 2 Antimalarials : Tablets 8 billion , Capsules 5 billion , Syrups 50 million liters 3 Antibiotics: Tablets 20 billion , Capsules 20 billion , Syrups 40 m illion liters 4 Antiretrovirals: Tablets 20 billion , Syrups 30 million liters 5 Vitamins: Tablets 50 billion , Capsules 40 billion , Syrups 80 million liters 6 Antitussive syrups : 45 million liters 7 Infusions: 500 million liters Page 116 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 8 Antacids : Tablets 30 billion , Syrups 50 million liters 9 Antiseptics / Disinfectants 60 million liters 10 Injectables : 400 million vials Source: PMG -MAN, Lagos, 2010, as cited in UNIDO (2011) 2) Import prohibition of the 18 medicines listed below; for these medicines, local manufacturers are believed to possess adequate capacity to meet domestic demand .

During the colonial period, British pharmaceutical firms such as May and Baker, Glaxo Smith Kline, and Pfizer (USA) and others were in charge of importing drugs for use in hospitals and sale to numerous drugs marketers in the country who are indigenous traders sometimes not really trained as pharmacists. Local manufacture of drugs , in the real sense of it, appeared in the Nigerian business environment from the 1970's when some indigenous entrepreneurs went into partnership with some foreigners to set up pharmaceutical companies producing various types of drugs for the Nigerian market and other A frican countries. But still, Nigeria produces less than 25 percent of the drugs needs of the country; as indicated below, the market share of the various therapeutic classes of medicines locally produced in Nigeria varies considerably. It seems worth not ing that the class of analgesics/antirheumatics/antipyretics has the largest share due to their affordability and availability in both urban and rural communities, as well as widespread use and misuse of these products for a wide range of symptoms. Page 117 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Estima ted Market Share of Local Manufacturers by Therapeutic Class Name Market share 1. Analgesics/antirheumatic/antipyretics 25% 2. Antibiotics + antibacterials Antihypertensives 8% 6. Cough and cold preparations 5% 7. Antiretroviral medicines 6% 8. Ex ternal/topical preparations 5% UNIDO 2011 UNIDO 2011 also observes that \"the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used in Nigeria are imported, mainly from India and China. Companies need to make careful forward planning for the import of APIs because of lengthy delays (three months or more) at the seaport due to clearance, customs and NAFDAC formalities. In most cases, both primary and secondary packaging materials are obtained locally. In addition, about 25 per cent of excipien ts are locally sourced. Most of the machinery and virtually all the quality control analytical equipment are imported, mainly from Asia and Europe respectively. Some of the drug manufacturers fabricate a few spare parts but most are imported. Some companie s, which are using similar machines supplied by the same foreign companies in India and in Europe, also join together to contract expatriate engineers and to organize workshops on machine maintenance. As indicated below, estimates regarding the current size of the pharmaceutical market in Nigeria vary significantly: 1) UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"In 2009 the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group of the Manufacturers' Association of Nigeria (PMGMAN) estimated the size of the total pharmaceuticals and healthcare products market to be in excess of US$ 2 billion annually. The estimated market for prescription ethical pharmaceuticals is US$ 500 million and that for over the counter (OTC) pharmaceuticals about US$ 900 million. Furthermore, PMG -MAN estimates the Nigerian market for biological products (including vaccines, insulin, interferon, etc.) to be worth about US$ 100 million. In addition, related healthcare and lifestyle products account for about US$ 500 million.\" 2) UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"Business intelligence services estimate the pharmaceutical market in Nigeria at US$ 600 million (Business Monitor International BMI 2010) for 2009. Out of this figure, BMI attributes the largest share of US$ 418 million to generic medicines, US$ 121 million to ove r the counter (OTC) products and US$ 61 million to patented products. Frost & Sullivan estimated a pharmaceutical market value of US$ 740 million in 2009. Out of this figure, US$266.4 million were attributed to generic medicines, US$ 177.6 million to brand ed products and US$ 296 million to OTC products (Frost & Sullivan 2010).\" Page 118 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Regarding industry constraints and issues, UNIDO (2011) indicates that \" Drug manufacturers in Nigeria are up against several constraints, including low capacity utilization, under capitalization, a weak financial base, high production costs as a result of the high cost of inputs, poor infrastructure, difficulty in meeting WHO prequalification criteria, low level or obsolete technology, high interest rates and unstable demand. The fl uctuations in demand are a reflection of prevailing low purchasing power within the population and the fact that drug dis tribution is still a challenge.\" Regarding distribution, UNIDO (2011) goes on to observe that \"The reality regarding supplies of medic ines in Nigeria is that those who are not trained and registered as pharmacists are actively involved in supplying pharmaceuticals, using unregistered premises. Rural and poor communities, which have no healt h facilities, receive medicines from patent stor es and vendors in open market places.\" According to UNIDO (2011), other characteristics of the pharmaceutic al industry in Nigeria include: 1) UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"According to the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN), there were 128 registered drug manufacturers, 1,534 retail pharmacies, 724 drug distributors and 292 drug importers in Nigeria in 2010. Nigeria has a total of 14,607 publi c and 9,034 private healthcare facilities (National Bureau of Statistics, 2006a). However, it has been estimated that there are over 10,000 unregistered patent and proprietary medicine stores, which are thought to sell Over The Counter (OTC) products only. Most such stores are located in villages and poor communities throughout the country, in areas where fully fledged pharmacies do not exist.\" 2) The average plant utilization rate for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Nigeria is 40%. UNIDO (2011) indicates th at \"The low capacity utilization in the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector is attributed mainly to the current lack of competitiveness with imported products and to unpredictable demand for the products. A major challenge faced by local producers is the c ost of importing all their active pharmaceutical ingredients and virtually all their pharmaceutical excipients. The burden is then multiplied by the fact that local manufacturers must pay Value Added Tax (VAT) on the imported raw materials whereas there i s no VAT on imported finished medicines. Furthermore, some foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as those in India, produce both pharmaceutical raw materials and the finished products. Such companies have an added advantage when they export both the r aw materials and medicines to Nigeria through pricing that will favor their finished products.\" 3) The number of workers employed in the manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceuticals in Nigeria is about 500,000; of these, most are semi -skilled (that is , they have received training for the skills they need so as to be able to perform their jobs. 4) 60% of the pharmaceuticals produced in the Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS) are produced in Nigeria. Given that the population of ECOWAS is about 60 0 million, the ECOWAS subregion represents a huge potential market. UNIDO (2011) indicates that the Nigerian companies exporting to ECOWAS include: PZ Cussons Plc May & Baker Nigeria Plc Fidson Healthcare Plc Evans Medical Plc Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals GlaxoSmithKline Nigeria Page 119 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Mopson Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd Emzor Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd Drugfield Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 5) Most pharmaceutical manufacturing companies are not fully automated, although some are working toward that goal. 6) Additional strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) characterizing the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria but not already mentioned include: \\ a. Strength s: i. Some pharmaceutical manufacturers in Nigeria are working toward attaining World Health Organization ( WHO ) current Good Manufacturing Practice) cGMP and prequalification status ; once they have attained those qualifications, they will be able (for the first time) to participate in international tenders for supplies of antiretrovirals, antimalarials and anti -TB medicines . ii. Technical skills, trained manpower and basic manufacturing infrastructure already exist; clearly Nigeria does have the potential to become a leading manufacturer and distributor of essential medicines in sub -Saharan Africa. b. Weaknesses i. As indicated earlier, Nigeria is characterized by p oor infrastructure (power, water, transportation) ; the infrastructure problems increase manufacturing and distribution costs and impact negatively on growth . ii. As indicated earlier, n o Nigerian medicine manufacturer has yet attained WHO cGMP or WHO prequalification status; the result is that no local firm is able to participate in international tenders for pharmaceutical supplies . iii. High bank lending rates (more than 20% per annum) mean that funds required for working capital and upgrading of facilities are limited . c. Opportunities i. In addition to increasing the percentage of treatments for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS produced locally, there is an opportunity to manufacture and market treatments for \"neglected childhood diseases.\" ii. Increases in purchasing power should increase the percentage of individuals able to afford to purchase medical care including pharmaceuticals. iii. There is an opportunity to increase exports within (or perhaps even outside) ECOWAS. iv. The initiative by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to establish a National H ealth Insurance Scheme (that is, to provide universal healthcare ) offers the prospect of a hug e increase in funding for medical services and supplies. d. Threats i. The high level of poverty and the lack of purchasing power undermine the market for locally produced medicines. ii. Substandard and/or fake health products affects both international and domesti c prospects for the marketing of medicines produced in Nigeria. Page 120 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 iii. The uncontrolled/chaotic distribution system for pharmaceuticals and The presence of large amounts of low cost imports from Asia. iv. Corruption within the distribution and/or regulatory system s. 1) Regarding the efficacy of different treatments for malaria, UNIDO (2011) indicates that: * 2002 Drug Efficacy Study ** 2004 Drug Efficacy Study Source: National Policy on Malaria Diagnosis and Treatme nt, Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja, 2010. 2) Regarding severe attacks of malaria, UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"The most recent version of the National Policy on Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment indicates that injections of Quinine Dihydrochloride, Artemether and Artesunate are the medicines of choice for severe attacks of malaria.\" Malaria Medicines Dosage form Strength Quinine Dihydrochloride suppository Suppositories if Artesunate is used only as pre -referral treatment Regarding medicines for tuberculosis: UNIDO (2011) indicates that in Nigeria, it is the international aid partners who supply these pharmaceuticals. Regarding the antiretroviral medic ines (ARVs) for HIV/AIDS: UNIDO (2011) indicates that: (ARVs) in Nigeria are as 50Mg + Stavudine + Nevirapine) Tablets May & Nigeria Plc Lamar (La mivudine) 100% 100%Page 121 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Nevipar (Nevirapine)Tablets Gemini Pharmaceuticals Nigeria Limited Viramune virapine) Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd Nevirapine Arved Tablets (Lamivu + Zidovudine) Arved - N Tablets Regarding HIV/AIDS t reatments: UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"The first line antiretroviral combination was Stavudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine but this was subsequently changed to Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine because of side effects from Stavudine\". ADDITIONAL IN FORMATION (5): THE COMPANY Juhel Nigeria Ltd. is a 100 percent Nigerian indigenous company incorporated in 1987. As indicated earlier, t he promoter and founder of the company is Dr. Ifeanyi Okoye, a pharmacist by training. The company was formed with the vision to \"produce cost -effective generic products to fill the gap left by multinational companies operating in Nigeria\". It seems worth noting that various national and international organiz ations are highly supportive of the idea that generic pharmaceuticals can and should be produced locally in Less Developed Countries; UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"Since 2006, UNIDO, with funding from the Government of Germany, has been conducting a projec t on strengthening the local production of essential generic drugs in developing and Least Developed Countries. The objective is to help the pharmaceutical sectors in developing countries realize their potential role of acting as a pillar of public health and contributing to economic and social development.\" In any case, Juhel Nigeria Ltd. commissioned its factory in 1989 and started (at that time) producing tablets. At present th e product range has grown; the current range includes \"therapeutic classes su ch as antibiotics and anti -infective cardiovascular, anti - diabetics, anti -malarial, cough and cold, vitamins a nd minerals, a anti-histamine , etc.\" Juhel (hence, JN L) started as a company focuse d on serving a regional market, specifically, the eastern region of Nigeria. Now , however, JN L has grown to become a national brand in Nigeria. While JN L's factory is located at Emene near Enugu, the ca pital of Enugu S tate and the former capital of Eastern Nigeria, the company has depots in Aba, Lagos, Abuja and ot her places to serve its customers nationwide. Regarding JN L's marketing strategy, the following comments can be made: Page 122 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Target market The company's p rimary market target s for drugs include direct and indirect customers throughout Nigeria. Direct customers (that is, customers to whom JHL sells directly) include: Wholesalers, large retailers, hospitals, clinics, pharmacists, doctors, and so on. Indirect customers (that i s, the customers who purchase JN L produc ts from the direct customers) include small retailers, market ladies, and individual consumers needing medication, including both adults and children. Naturally for a drug firm, some of the business is funded by federal, state, and/or local governments ( that is, public money); in Nigeria, however, UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"74.7% of expenditure on health is made by the private sector, underlining the low contribution of Government to the health sector.\" Products As indicated earlier, t he major pharmac eutical products on offer by the company include: Antibiotics and anti -infective drugs ; analgesics, steroids and antispasmodics; vitamins, minerals and -helminthics; and i nfusion products whic h include also infusion water, ear and eye drops, etc. These pharmaceutical products are meant to deal with common diseases that plague not only Nigeria but also tropical Africa in general. In other words, they are meant to serve markets not only in Nigeria but also beyond the boundaries of Nigeria. Price Price of the products are usually determined by market forces of demand and supply. The h ealth care situation in Nigeria is not good: M any peopl e are poor, sanitation is problematic , sickness and disease are rampant, and pharmaceuticals can be expensive. Elaborations on the above points which can be made include: 1) While d emand for manufactured drugs is high, prices are also high. UNIDO (2011) indicates that \" A national survey on medicine prices was undertaken in 2006 by the Federal Ministry of Health in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the UK's Department for International Developme nt (DFID), the European Union and Health Action International. The results of the survey (include): Patients pay between 2 -64 times the international reference prices for medicines at various health facilities in both the private and public sectors Prices in the public sector were almost identical to those in the private pharmacies Private health clinics charge about 184 per cent more than the public health facilities and about 193 per cent more than private retail pharmacies Innovator brands cost between 2 -7 times the lowest priced generic equivalents The 2006 survey concluded that 90 per cent of Nigerians who live below the income level of US$ 2 per day, as well as Government workers who earn a minimum wage of US$ 1.4 per day, cannot afford medic ines.\" 2) Alternative methods of treating diseases by use of herbal medic ine are still highly patronized, especially by lower income consumers and in rural areas. 3) Sometimes faith -based healing solutions to ailments prevail to an astonishing degree, particularly for low income earners. Faith preachers (both Christians and Muslims) abound in both urban and rural environments. Page 123 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Promotion Pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria tend to promote their products by adopting a combination of strategies that include: personal selling, media selection, advert copy and sales promotion . JNL uses combinations of the above strategies to create awar eness of and influence demand fo r its products . Place (i.e. Distribution) Regarding private sector sales: Many pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria have adopt ed selective distribution strategies, that is, they appoint selected drug stores located in different cities of Nigeria to market their products to open market and other retailers. In such a system, t he select ed drug stores are the entities who sell the products of the manufacturer to end consumers. While JNL uses the same method, the company also sells directly to hospitals and clini cs. To service its growing numbers of retailers , JNL currently maintains depots in cities such as Lagos, Onitsha, A ba, Port Harcourt, and Abuja. It seems worth noting that in the private sector, and as indicated above, manufacturers and importers have their own distribution channels and can sell to wholesalers, retailers and hospitals. One implication of this system is that medicines and medical s upplies are often sold by unregistered and unlicensed premises and, in some cases, by non -pharmacists. Regarding sales to government, the following observations can be made: 1) The Government (including Federal, State and Local Government Areas) supplies pharmaceutical products to its various health institutions. The Federal Government is responsible for policy formulation and technical guidance to all healthcare providers. In addition, the Federal Government supplies drugs and medical supplies to tertiar y healthcare centers (University Teaching Hospitals) and Federal Medical Centers located in all 36 states. State governments are responsible for providing healthcare to state hospitals as well as offering technical support to the Local Government Areas (L GAs). The LGAs take care of healthcare services at primary healthcare level. As indicated earlier, the private sector, traditional health practitioners and non -governmental agencies provide healthcare services at all three levels of the healthcare system. 2) At one time, under a government initiative to deliver health care to Nigerian citizens, JNL was involved in the contract production of drugs for government. 3) Nigeria's HIV/AIDS supply chains - many of which include sep arate procurement, warehousing, and distribution systems - are owned and operated by various federal, state, nongovernmental and faith -based stakeholders with oversight from the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and the National Agency for t he Control of AIDS (NACA). ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (6): PHARMACEUTICALS -RELATED ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOURS OF CONSUMERS IN NIGERIA Investigations and research carried out over the years on health -care in Nigeria to ascertain the attitudes and behaviours of majority of Nigerians regar ding treatment of diseases and medicine consumption generally, the following informat ion collected tended to support a general belief that every member of the Nigerian society irrespective of his or her socio -economic class is interested in finding the be st way to treat or prevent an actual or perceived ailment confronting him or her. 1) Upper -class Nigerian s, on being confronted with sickness of any kind (both of themselves or of any members of their families ) will first consult a doctor (or Page 124 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 qualified pharmacist) to investigate and prescribe drugs for the treatment of the sickness. 2) Middle class and lower class members of the society, upon becoming sick, will first on their own go to drugstores or the open market to buy drugs perceived to be adequate f or the treatment of the suspected ailment, having learned from varied experiences (word -of mouth , television or newspaper advertisement , and/or shared interaction with someone who suffered something akin to what is happening to him or her). On failure t o get alright through their own direct purchase of drug in an open market or drugstore , members of the middle socio -economic class may then approach a doctors' clinic or hospital for investigation and treatment. 3) Regarding members of the very lowest soc io-economic class: UNIDO (2011) indicates that they \"tend to approach traditional herb providers for further treatment. In other words traditional medicine still command huge patronage particularly for low income individuals and in rural communities.\" In this lowest socio -economic class (and for some members of the middle and/or lower class as well) there are people who rely on prayers provided by \"acclaimed men and women\" who are perceived to be able to \"deliver\" people from their troubles (including hea lth-related issues) through prayers to God. It seems worth noting that t he National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated in 2010 that 69% of the population of Nigeria are poor. This is reflected by the following observations on the ability of patients i n Nigeria to pay for pharmaceuticals: a. Regarding malaria: UN IDO (2011) indicates that \" about 15 per cent of the population can afford to purchase ACTs (that is, antimalarial drugs) on their own, 30 per cent can afford them with some assistance, and 55 per cent need to obtain them free of charge.\" b. Regarding tuberculosis: UNIDO (2011) indicates that \"under the NTBLCP more than 450,000 TB cases have been successfully treated free of charge since 2005 in Nigeria. This is necessary because, according to the Mi nistry of Health, \"only about 5 per cent of the population can afford anti -TB medi cines on their own. Furthermore, about 35 per cent of TB patients can afford the medicines if supported, while 60 per cent cannot afford them at all.\" c. Regarding HIV/AIDS: UNIDO (2011) estimates that 5 per cent of the population can afford ARVs without financial assistance, 15 per cent can afford them with some assistance, and 80 per cent cannot afford them. UNIDO (2011) goes on to observe that at 2009 levels, HIV/AIDS would cost somewhere between US$ 530 million to US$ 650 million per year with prevention, care, and treatment constituting 35 per cent, 20 per cent and 45 per cent of the total cost respectively. Scaling up HIV /AIDS services over the next five years would cost an additional US$ 113 million per year ; by 2014 the total annual funding level would be US$ 1.1 billion . According to NACA, \"over US$ 2.5 billion per year will be needed to achieve universal coverage throughout the country and the scaling up of services w ill require funding not only for direct provision of services but also for the development of infrastructure for training and retraining of health workers. The present level of funding is only 11per cent of what is needed for universal coverage of preventi on, care and treatment and the possibility of innovative funds Page 125 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 mobilization strategies, including cost -sharing mechanisms, grants, private contributions, and increasi ng national contributions need to be explored.\" One of the implications of the above behaviors is that for upper -class and many middle class consumers, affordable high quality drugs and efficient medical delivery are highly desired. As it happens, the challenges associated with the above statement include not only the issue of affordability (as pointed out earlier, in Nigeria pharmaceuticals can be very expensive) but also the issue of quality. Ela borations on this point include: 1) In an interview in the Guardian Newspaper (______ 2007) , Akunyili indicates that \"fake drugs were first noticed in Nigeria in 1968, The situation progressively got worse and even deepened during the import license saga (of 1980 -1984) until about 2001 when Nigeria became rated as one of the countries with the highest incide nce of fake drugs. We had about 41 percent of drugs in circulation then as fake. In 1990, Adeoye Lambo,(sic of WHO) reported 54 percent of drugs in Nigeria (as fake).\" 2) The Nigerian government set up National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Con trol (NAFDAC) by a Decree in 1993 to regulate and control the production, importation, exportation, advertisement and sales of all drugs, medical devices, foods, cosmetics, chemicals and all drinks including water. 3) The existence of the Agency was never fel t until 2002 when the body was headed by Professor Dora Akunyili. Long before then the drugs and regulated products market in Nigeria was described as \"dumping ground for fake and adulterated products .\" Indeed, no regulation was going on. Drugs were being sold in open markets and shops by unqualified personnel that often get involved in faking and adulteration in order to make stupendous profits at the expense of the lives of their consumers. 4) The regulatory activities of NAFDAC commencin g from 2002 help ed to sanitize the food and drug sector in Nigeria. According to the Director of the Agency and collaborated by many manufacturers \"...lives have been saved and genuine local industries are booming, investors are also encouraged to invest in Nigeria and th e incidence of fake drugs have come down from 41 percent to 16.7 percent, unregistered drug from 58 percent to 19 percent;...local industries are revived and they are booming. They were 70 in number before but they are now 150 and all of them are producing at high capacity, multinationals that left Nigeria in frustration are coming back, our drugs that were banned in the West Africa countries are also back t here\" (Newswatch Magazine 2007) 5) The problem of fake pharmaceut icals is not completely solved; it appears that some 17 per cent of essential generic medicines as a whole are routinely faked and also as much as 30 per cent of anti -malarials in the Nigerian market (PMG -MAN). One way of tackling this problem would be through the introduction of Radio Frequency Identification Technology for Logistics and Tagging.

Osborn, California State University CASE DESCRIPTION The following is an accounting case designed to integrate f inanc ial account ing and internal control principles with a practical busin ess environm ent so that the relationships can be analyz ed by account ing students. The case is designed for junior and senior level account ing students. The minimum le vel of account ing knowledge should be the c ompl etion of Finan cial Principles and the first semester/quarter of Intermediate Account ing so that students have been exposed to financ ial accounting and in ternal control ru les. The case was created to fill a need of a large numb er of students who, even at the s enior level, had not worked with scenarios sufficient to pro vide experience with \"big p icture\" account ing and busin ess issues. Small busin esses, especially as they begin operations, may employ relatively few employ ees and may experience difficulty with internal controls, including segregat ion of duties among employ ees, providing an environm ent contributing to employee fraud. The case provid es insights at both fundamental and deepe r levels on how financ ial information can contain indicators, i.e. dange r signs, of which account ants and other users of financ ial information should be awa re. Students must be able to analyze financ ial data based on relationships contained in the f inanc ial data and compariso ns with other financ ial and busin ess data to ascertain the a ccura cy of the financial sta tements and their compon ent part s. The sugg estion for the time required for solution by students is two hours for require ment one and another two hours for require ments two and three togeth er for a total of four hours total for the three requirements. The three parts of the case can easily take another four hours for the instructor to discuss in class. Because of the time required to complete each part it is recom mended the parts be ass igned separat ely. It is also recom mended part one be covered first as it is the most time consuming and requir es the most co mprehe nsive anal ysis of the three parts. CASE SYNOPSIS Al B. Seeinyou was emplo yed for many years in the agricultural pump sales industry. Two years ago he sta rted his own busin ess, consist ing of the sale of pumps to agricultural companie s in the central valley of California. Big Al's Pumps just concluded its second year of operations and is experiencing real-world busin ess and financ ial issues. The issues are brok en down in three parts, co nsisting of require ments. The first require ment of the case is the analysis of financ ial informa tion, including two years of comparati ve financial information, in o rder to identify current year accounts that should be fur ther analyz ed because the account balance may not be a ccurat e. The identi fication of accounts for further analysis is based on information provid ed in the case. The in formation includes inconsis tencies between related accounts in the current year, the comparison of the current year account balances of certa in accounts to the account balance of the same account in Page 128 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 the prior year, and the relationship of current year's a ccounts to other busin ess and f inanc ial information pro vided in the case. The second require ment of the case is the analysis of the case's financial and busin ess related information to determine what fraudul ent schemes may potentia lly have been taking place by the emplo yees. Small busin esses with relatively few emplo yees have an inherent disad vantage with regard to the application of appropr iate internal control because of the difficulty segregat ing duties prop erly. This case provid es an opportuni ty for students to apply some basic concepts of internal control to a busin ess that contains weaknesses that occur in real world situations. The third require ment of the case provides additional facts detailing a theft of cash by one of the employ ees who covers the theft by lapping accounts receivable. Students must first determine the f inanc ial effects of the theft on spe cific elements of the financial statements. After determining the e ffects of the theft on the sp ecific elements of the financ ial statements students must compare those financial effects of the theft of cash and lapp ing activity to the financ ial information provid ed in the case. The comparison provid es eviden ce whether the actual f inanc ial information confirms or contradicts the solution to the first part of the r equire ment. INTRODU CTION A ND FA CTS Al B. Seeinyou began operating his new busin ess January 1, 2012 in the central valley of California. The area containe d many agriculture busin esses, most having a substantial need for pumps. Al, known as Big Al, had worked for one of the large pump manu facturers located in the area. He began with the pump manu facturer on the produc tion line but eventuall y moved into sales. His employer only sold pumps to large retailers that resold to the consum er, the agricultur al bus inesses. Based on his knowl edge of the local pump market, Big Al knew the local pump retailers maintaine d a full line of pumps and received multi pump orders from their best customers, the large, local agricultural companie s. The retailers gave generous discounts and excellent customer service to these large volu me customers. The pump retailers also received o rders from small and medium sized customers but provided minimal customer service and either small or no discounts to them be cause they order ed relative ly few pumps. The busin ess Big Al opened, Big Al's Pumps, consisted of selling the more popular pumps to small and medium sized agricultural compani es in the area. By b uying large quantities of the bestselling pumps directly from the pump manufac turer he received large discounts on his purchases and his invento ry could be kept reasonably small because he wouldn 't carry pumps other than the bestselling on es. He could resell the pumps at twice his cost, prices that would be as low as, or lower, to his customers than what they would pay to the large pump retailers and he provided much better customer service. For example, Big Al provided the service of takin g orders over the phone and delivering the pumps to the customer, a service not offered by the large pump r etailers. Big Al located and leased commercial space for Big Al's Pumps. He signed the lease agreement October 1, 2011 with the sixty month lease period beginning January 1, 2012 and Page 129 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 ending December 31, 2016. The lease agreement provided for a monthly payment of $4,000, payable at the beginning of each month, and an additional two percent of annua l gross sales revenue, payable on or before February 1 of the following year. T he agreement also include d Big Al's payment of a deposit consist ing of the payment of rent for December 2016 on October 1, 2011, the date the lease was signed. The period October 1 throu gh December 31, 2011 was rent free and allowed Big Al to make the improvements needed to convert the space to his warehous e and small retail area. The rented space already includ ed two moderately sized offices but he needed to make some leasehold improvements. The free rent period also allowed him the time neede d to purchase inventor y and equipment and hire employees so he could open for busin ess on January 1, 2012. Employees of Big Al's Pu mps Big Al decided not to incorporate Big Al's Pumps. He will operate the busin ess as a sole proprietor. Because the busin ess was operated as a proprietorship instead of a corporation Big Al was not an employee of the busin ess. He did plan on the busin ess becom ing successful enoug h that he could eventuall y take cash withdr awals from time to time as he would eventuall y need cash withdra wals to cover his living expenses. The three employees began work Mond ay, January 2, 2012. Little Al Big Al hired his son, Al B. Seeinyou, Jr., known as Little Al. Little Al has had trouble getting and keepi ng a regular job. Big Al thought all Little Al needed was some direct ion so he hired Little Al and gave him the title of Store Manag er and a weekly wage of $800. Little Al was put in charge of sales at the store , both over-the-counter sales and taking tel ephone orders. Big Al's Pumps receives very good walk-in traffic because the area where the store is located contains other agricultur al supp ly stor es. At the end of every day Little Al gives the bookkeepe r, Martha, the checks and cash from the sales to customers who have dropped in the store to buy pumps. Approximately one-half of the walk-in customers pay for the pump(s) with cash. Little Al fills out a s ales invoi ce for each sale. Henry In the initial stages of the busin ess formation Big Al mentioned to Little Al that the busin ess would need an employee to manage the inventor y in the warehous e, pick up pumps ordered from the manu factur er, and make deliveries of pumps to their agricultur al customers. Little Al to ld his dad that he knew som eone who was looking for work and who would be perfect for the job. Big Al interviewed Henry and thought Henry's qualifications were acceptable . When Big Al mentioned to Little Al he planned to call the busin esses Henry listed as previous employers Little Al became upset and asked his father why he didn't trust his judgment. Big Al agreed to not make the calls to Henry's past employers and called Henry on the phone that afternoon and hir ed Henry for $700 pe r week. Page 130 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Martha During the interview with Henry, Big Al mentioned that he was also looking for someone who could do the books, do all the banking, pay the bills, and all other office related duties. Big Al joked with Henry that he knew nothing about accounting, and had never even prepared a bank-reconc iliation, that he wasn't even sure what a bank-reconciliation was. Henry told Big Al that his mother-in-law had been a bookkeepe r for the last 25 years and he had heard her talk about doing everything Big Al wanted. Henry said Martha was available and would send Martha by the next mornin g. When Big Al got to the store about ten minutes before 8 the next morning Martha was waiting outside the front door. Big Al immediately thought Martha looked very much like his deceased mother and was very impressed with her apparent promptness and motivation. During the interview Big Al didn' t understand enough about account ing or what need ed to be done in the office so he asked Martha what she had done on her previous jobs. Martha's answers assured him that she could take care of all the account ing and banking and whatever other office related functions were required. Martha opens all the mail, makes the b ank deposit slips from the customer checks received in the m ail and checks and cash received by Little Al from walk-in customers. Martha pays all the bills, with either her or Big Al signing the check. Martha performs all account ing functions, including preparing the financial statements, us ing Quic kBooks softw are. Big Al hir ed Martha at $600 per week. Accounting Policies and Procedures Martha performs all the account ing functions requir ed for Big Al's Pumps. She also prepares all the financial statements for all purposes, including the b ank. Martha told Big Al she applied the accrual meth od of account ing using QuickBooks and applied other accounting rul es, as follows: Cash All cash received by Big Al's Pumps is deposited into the Cash-Operating account. Martha opens all the incoming mail, fills out a deposit slip, and takes the deposit to the bank. She told Big Al she is too busy to go to the bank every day so the deposit sometimes contains more than a single day's receipts. She told Big Al the deposit usually contains less than a week's receipts. Martha also writes the checks for the bills from Big Al's vendors and mails them out. She sometimes pays bills of small amounts with the cash receipts. She told Big Al paying bills with cash receipts doesn't make any dif ference becaus e the revenue and expense just cancel each other out. Martha keeps track of the balances in all three cash accounts and makes transfers to and from the Cash-Operating account, the Cash-Payroll account, and the Cash- Mon ey Market accounts as needed. M artha receives the b ank st atements in the m ail monthly and prepares the bank reconciliations for the three cash account s. After Martha prepares the bank reconciliations she puts them in her file cabinet. Page 131 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Accounts Receiva ble/Bad Debts Expense All Sales are recorded on a Sales Invoice form. The form was designed by Martha and includes the sales detail such as types of pump sold and price per pump along with the customer name and other detail. Each Sales Invoice has a box at the top right of the form so whoever is makin g the sale, whether an employee or Big Al, can in itial it. Martha believes that it is more important to know who made the sale than keeping track of the sales invoi ces with any numb ering system. Whoever makes the sale makes a copy of the sales invoice for the customer if they want one. The collection terms for sales on account are 1/10, net 30. Martha told Big Al most customers pay within ten days and take the discount. She added that the customers who dont get the cash discount pay within 30 days, with only a few customers who end up not paying their bill. The allowance method, using the percent of accounts receivable method, was applied for the estimation of bad debt expense. Martha told Big Al she w rote off uncollectible accounts totaling $5,636 durin g 2012 and $7,893 dur ing 2013. Inventory The FIFO method was applied for the cost flow assumption. Big Al makes sure the order sizes are large enough to receive quantity discounts from the manuf actur er. Big Al estimate s the order size for each type of pump was enough to last for six to eight weeks. When Henry informs Big Al they are low on a particul ar pump Big Al calls in the order and when it's ready, usual ly in a day or two, Henry picks it up in the company van. Big Al talke d to Henry about the two of them taking a physical inventory at December 31, 2012 and 2013 but Henry said he was too busy. Property, Plant, and Equipment During 2012 , Big Al purchased two compa ny vehicle s, a van for the pick-up and delivery of pumps and a small truck for himself. Both v ehicle s will be used o ne hundre d percent for bus iness purpos es. He also purchased a small fork lift for the warehouse and office equipment including three desks, two computer work stations, and filing cabinets. Big Al also installed some leasehold improvements such as storage shelv es in the warehouse and a sales counter and two display cases in the sales room. Depreciation is comput ed using the straight line method over various years depending on the type of asset. Big Al n either purchased nor dispos ed of any long lived assets during 2013. Accounts Payab le The large supplie rs of pumps that Big Al's buys from offers payment te rms of 1/10, net 30. Big Al instructed Martha to pay all the bills immedi ately as they are received and to take the cash discount when available. He tho ught it was a good idea that p ayments to vendors and employees be signed only by him or Martha. Martha reassured Big Al re gularly that she was paying all the bills as they were received and was taking all the cash discounts. Page 132 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Long Term Debt Big Al signed a note to the Valley Bank for the receipt of $100,000 on February 1, 2012 and another $100,000 on October 1, 2012. The loan arrangements were for the p ayment of interest only, at 6% per annum, u ntil January 1, 2015 at which time the remaini ng principa l balance would be converted to a mortgage. Financial statements must be provided to the Valley Bank annua lly by March 1 following the close of the year. The terms includ e immedia te principa l repayment if certain financial conditions weren't met. Al B. Seeinyou, Capital To start the busin ess Big Al invested $100, 000. He didn't withdr aw any cash from the business durin g 2012 or 2013, ins tead l iving off his s avings. Neither has he m ade any additional capital contr ibutions du ring 2012 or 2013. Sales and Cash Colle ctions Sales were approximate ly evenly spl it between cash sales and sales on account. Cash collections, whether from current sales or from accounts receivable , are deposited into the Cash- Operating account. Martha said sales increased only slightly from January through December 2012 and in creased steadily during 2013 . Wage s All employees are paid for a five-day work week and paid weekly on Friday for the Mond ay through Friday work week just ended. As of December 28, 2012, a Friday, there were 52 full weeks paid during 2012. Empl oyees were paid Friday, December 28, 2012 and again Friday, January 4, 2013, both checks for a full week. Empl oyees were paid Friday, Decem ber 27, 2013 and again Friday, January 3, 2014, both checks f or a full week.

Pitts, Columbus State University Robin L. Snipes, Columbus State University CAS E DESCRIPTION The primary subject matters of this case are (1) choosing an appropriate gro wth strategy and (2) leveraging technology and social media to build custome r relationships and deliver a unique value proposition to custom ers. Students should develop a more in-depth unde rstanding of how to strategically position a company by developing market-specific strategies and effecti vely using technology to gain sustainable competitive advantag e. The case has a diffi culty level of three and up, making it appropriate for junior l evel courses in manag ement information systems, marketing strategy or business strategy. The case is designed to be taught in one or two class sessions and should require appro ximately 2-3 hours of outside preparation for students, primarily reviewing the case and reading articles related to the competitive forces fram ework. This case can be used as a follo w-up to the Part A case or as a stand-alone case focused on strategic positioning using t echnolog y-based initiati ves. CAS E SYNO PSIS The Big Dog Running Company is a running specialty store o perating in the highly competitive and growing running shoe and appar el retail industr y. The company started in late 2010 in the middle of an economic recession and a gainst formidable odds in an industry dominat ed by large retailers and price competitive Internet-based compan ies. Base d on an external market analysis, students evaluate and \"tweak\" a competitive strategy for a retail location that is not currently su ccessful. Students will also recom mend one of Ansoff 's generic Prod uct-Market Growth strategies to enable the company to continue to grow. Students assess the compan y's strategies and tactics to identify and unde rstand how the compa ny continu es to deliver a unique value proposition to th eir custom ers in oth er distin ct mar ket lo cations. THE \"BIG DOG RUNNING COMPANY\" STORY It was September of 2014 and Big Dog Running Company ow ners, John Teeples and Reggie Luther, were contemplating th eir next competitive move. Overall, their running sp ecialty store concept had been successf ul. In fact, Big Dog Running Company (BDRC ) now had three locations: two in Columbus, Georgia and one in Aubu rn, Alabama (about 40 miles from Columbus ). The business venture had been a success in two of the three locations, but the owners were having problems with the Aubu rn location. In fact, John and Reggie were seriously contemplating leaving the Aubu rn area. The strategy just didn't seem to work in Auburn. They currently have an eager buyer for their Auburn location, so they could sell the store and be out of the area quickly. How ever, the potential buyer seems so eager that it is causing th em to question their hasty decision to leave. Was it possible that the Aubu rn location just didn't deliver on all of the key strategy areas that make the other two store locations successful? If that was the case, it Page 136 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 was not clear to John and Reggie whether the Auburn store strategy could be effectively \"tweaked\" to transform the store and make it as successful as the two C olumbus lo cations. The company's story begins in 2009 when John Teeples and Reggie Luther both came to the realization during a conver sation that there was a gap in the local market for a full service retailer catering specifically to the running sport. John and Reggie were both entrepreneurs and running enthusi asts who had known each other for several years. During their discussion, they both agreed that there was a window of oppor tunity for a location in the city's newly revitalized downtown area. Columbus, Georgia is also located right next door to Fort Benning, Georgia, home of one of the army's largest training installations in the country with about 35,000 soldiers on active or reserve duty. Fort Benning provides BDRC with a constant influx of young soldi ers in need of proper equipm ent for their PT training. In fact, Fort Benning soldi ers now represent about 50% of BDRC revenues in th eir downtown Columbus location. The company opened its first store in downtown Columbus in August of 2010. After some trial and err or, the Columbus location became a success by all accounts. The owner s realized from the beginning that the key to their success was to differentiate themselves from the \"big box\" and online retailers by focusing more on lo cation, custom er service, and merchandising. Through trial and error, the owners eventually discovered a successful formula for their store that included five \"key success factors\": (1) location, (2) store ambiance, (3) knowledgeable sales staff, (4) event tie-ins and programmin g with the local commu nity (to build custom er relationships ), and (5) inventory management (i.e., having the right products at the right time) . According to the store's website, Big Dog Running Company offers custom ers a \"comfortable store and friendly, knowle dgeable staff who will make you feel right at home as they assist you in selecting the best running g ear to suit your needs .\" Their current mission is li sted as follows on th eir website: \"At Big Dog Running Compan y, we pledge to consist ently provide excellent custom er service and qu ality produ cts to our community in an environm ent that is welcoming, c omfortabl e, and fri endly. We realize that we have a responsibility to do more than just s ell a produ ct. We take very seriously our role in helping our community become healthier and happi er through the ALFA (Active Lifestyle For All) principle.\" After an evaluation of each of the five \"success\" factors in the Aubur n location, they realized that it was lacking in at least three of them. The owners discovered that simp ly having a store located next to a large university and a young popul ation is not enough to bring in the custom ers -- the store has to successf ully deliver on each of the five success factors. For starters, unlike the two Columbus lo cations, the Aubu rn store is not in a prime location. It is more than a mile away from the downtown area and in an unattractive strip. On Auburn football weekends, the numb er of people in the downtown area more than triples. So, possibly relocatin g to the downtown area could significantly increase Auburn's store traffic, and the feel and ambience of the store. Secondl y, Auburn's current employees are not as knowle dge and enthusi astic about runnin g. John and Reggie both make frequent visits to the Aubu rn store, but it is a 40-minute drive from downtown Columbus. So, they are not present in the Aubu rn sto re as often as they are in the other two Columbus locations. They need a full-time manager who is as enthus iastic as they are in the Aubu rn store. Lastly, they would need to come up with a more unique relationship -building strategy to spread the word among college students, who are the primary target market in the Page 137 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Aubu rn location. The current social media and event strategy doesn't seem to be as effective in Aubu rn. SPECIALTY RUNNIN G STORE RETAIL INDUST RY T RENDS BDRC's main competition in the lo cal market area includes online sto res such as Zappos and Amazon, and brick-and-mortar chain stores such as Dick's and Academy Sports, all of whic h carry apparel for many outdoor sports including runnin g. The top running apparel manufacturers have begun to put more restrictions on retailers regarding pricing and online sales. New specialty retailers, like the BDRC, are not allowed to sell products online anymore. Addition ally, suppli ers of the top selling brands such as Nike have also put more limits on retailers' ability to reduce the price of their products. This is because the top manufac turers would like to have more control over the marketing and image of their produc ts. This means that there is very little price variance between online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores, whic h is good and bad for small retailers like BDRC -- on the one hand they no longer have to compete on price, but on the other hand they also can't manage inventories by running special price promotions on th eir products wh en needed. Recent trends have been positive for the running indust ry as a whol e. According to the latest National Sporting Goods Assoc iation 's data, total sales of runnin g/jogging sho es climbed from $2.3 billion in 2010 to over $3 billion in 2013, an increase of over 33% (see Table 1). The numb er of running shoes sold in the U. S. grew from 37 million units to over 46 million in 2013, driven in part by customers' frequent replenishm ent cycle with consum ers purchasing an average of three pair per year (Shaftoe, 2013) . Likewise, growth in running apparel has also reached record heights over the last decade. With record numb ers of new runners participating in the sport in the last decade , the running shoe and apparel indust ry has enjoyed steady growth in the sales of shoes, appare l, running a ccesso ries, and event attendance. Table 1: Joggi ng & Running Footwear Sales in U.S. 2010 2011 2012 2013 Running Shoe Units 37.16 million 38.02 million 44.62 million 46.25 million Running Shoe Dollars $2.32 billion $2.46 billion $3.04 billion $3.09 billion SOUR CE: National Sporting Goods Association (2014) A key variable in the volume of sales of running shoes and apparel is the numb er of participants in the sport. Over the past decade there has been a \"second running boo m\" that has continu ed robust ly with more non-tradition al running events and record numb ers of finish ers (Running USA, 2014) . Continuing this trend, in 2013, the total number of running participants in all categories increased by 5% over the previous year to almost 40 million runners (see Table 2). Adventure racing, a relatively new category of the running sport, recorded the highest growth with a total increase in participation of almost 30%, and the hi ghest concent ration of runner s is in the south eastern states. Analysts attribute the record growth in participation to a numb er of factors including the rise in the numb er of running destination vacations that offer participants the Page 138 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 oppor tunity to combine running with leisure activiti es, frequent charitable and socially-oriented running events, and an interest in new wearable technolo gy and apps that provide running enthusi asts new ways to measure their progress and sh are their training and results with oth ers. The general sporting goods retail indust ry is expected to continue to grow overa ll due to strong d emand for sporting goods from more health-conscious individu als. According to the National Sporting Good s Asso ciation (NSGA), runnin g/jogging contin ues to show st rong and consist ent growth annua lly as running total participation (defined as running at least six days out of the year) was up 2.5% overa ll in 2013 versus 2012. How ever, nationally the demand for running appare l is expected by many to flatten out as the econom y continu es to recover from the recession. Some have suggested that the sport of running m ay be counter-cyclical to the econom y. Since it is an inexpensive sport, it is believed that running participation may increase during an economic recession to replace other, more expensive, sports. That means that running participation may decline as the econom y improves. How ever, current running participation data shows a continu ed increase in participation and does not suppo rt this assertion at this point in time. Figures 1 and 2 illust rate the growth in participation overa ll and by gender over the past ten years. Interestingly, female participants continue to outnumb er male participants primarily in the Age 25-34 age group category.

Disconcer tingly, sales from specialty athletic footwear stores, or the \"brick-and-mortar\" stores, decrea sed slightly in 2013 from 18% in 2012 to 14.1% in 2013. Addition ally, sales in general sporting goods and department Page 141 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 stores has remained flat for the past four years and is not predicted to grow significantly. However, not surprisingly, internet and web-based stores show the strongest gains in sales, captu ring almost 18% of total sales in 20 13 with p redicted continu ed growth in the segment.

Following national trends, local running participation was growing at a rapid pace and runners of all abiliti es were participating in droves in running events, group runs, and corporate sponso red wellness programs. Serving this growing and diverse market with an alternative to the big box sporting goods and department sto res was a key goal of the owners who so ught to create a place where the running communi ty could not only get expert advice on purchasing running shoes but also engage with each other through sponso red events and activiti es. How ever, they have now reached a \"strategic inflection point,\" whi ch occurs when external events result in the need for a change in the strategy of a company. BDRC would like to continue to grow and increase its store presence in other cities, but the Aubur n, AL sto re isn't working. The owners know that they want to keep moving forward. They have an eager buyer for their Aubu rn location, but they are hesitant to sell. As John Teeples points out, \"we are always looking at our formula -- we know that what's working today won't necessarily work tomo rrow .\" BDRC' s Val ue Proposition BDRC's value proposit ion in its two Columbus lo cations can be seen in the various custom er-oriented initiatives and events that provide on-going oppo rtuniti es for runne rs, not only to meet to run but also to provide a venue for like-mind ed individu als to congregate. Unlike Internet-based companies and mass-market retailers, specialty stores are uniqu ely position ed to offer a more personalized experience for their custom ers. One way they achieve this is by providing a place where runner s of all abiliti es can gain knowle dge, suppo rt, and advice from other runner s through a combin ation of programs and activiti es that compl ement the sto re's produc ts. This is known a s developing a \"fourth place.\" In 1999, Ray Oldenburg identified the need of human beings for social gatherings to have a feeling of belonging to a group. He propos ed that most of us have th ree places in our lives that define us: our home (first place), our work (second place), and a \"third place\" whic h encompasses informal public so cial gatherings other than home or wo rk where people can meet and just \"hang out,\" such as local coffee shops, bars, or libraries on college campus es. In 2005, Fleener extended the concept by suggesting that retailers can create a \"fourth place\" that serves a simil ar function, but is centered on a shared common interest targeted to a specific consumer group. Successf ul independent specialty store retailers have embraced the concept of the \"fourth place\" with a strategy and minds et that focuses on developing and nurturing relationships with custom ers to whom th ey can s ell products to as oppos ed to a focus on just s elling produc ts. Page 143 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Creating a sense of communi ty by providi ng a venue to congregate and activiti es that engage the running communi ty has enabled specialty running stores like BDRC to thrive in a market where other small local retail stores have closed shop, victims of big dis count chains and online retailers who can often underc ut prices. Unlike early running specialty sto res that catered primarily to a core group of dedicated runners, the new model of specialty running stores that opened during the second \"running boom\" in the United States were designed to cater to a more diverse group of fitness-mind ed individu als who enjoyed the sport of running and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. Spandorfer (2013) describes the new mod el of specialty running stores as ones owned by busin ess people who enjoy running but also under stand how to grow their custom er base by making the sport more accessible and inclusive to runner s of all ages and abiliti es. From the beginning, BDRC has embrace d this mod el through its mission statement and st rategies that were custom er-focused, inclusive, and designed to bring together a diverse communi ty of experienced and ne w participants to the sport. Creating the \"Fourth Place\" In the BDRC Columbus locations, the own ers constructed space in the store to create a venue where runners not only felt comfortable \"hanging out\" but could also obtain expert advice on runnin g-related topics. Year-round, each store hosts a series of educational workshops and seminars on running related topics such as injury-prevention, nutrition, and proper running form. The events are open to the public and free to encourage new and experienced running enthusi asts to attend. This compl ementary service helps BDRC build relationships with existing and potential custom ers and helps ensure that runner s not only have the right equipm ent but also learn how to stay injury-free and pr operly trained for the activiti es they engage in. Unique to each store are also various events that bring runner s together to train and socialize. For example, the company hosts a popu lar \"Pancake Run\" at their Columbus downtown (\"Uptow n\") location, which starts with a group run and end with a free pancake breakfast at the store. The 2nd Columbus location (\"Columbus Park\") hosts group training runs and a \"Couch to 5-K\" program that provides training and suppo rt to new runner s with the goal of running a 5-K race at the end of the program. On a larger scale, the store sponso rs the \"Jeff Galloway Training Program\" designed for runner s to train for a marathon or half-marathon in a structured group program with a focus on injury-prevention and training suppo rt. The goal is for runner s to participate in one of Columbus' biggest events, the highly successf ul \"Solider Marathon\" held annua lly at the National Infantry Museum in neighboring Fort Benning, Georgia and sponso red by BDRC. A growin g segment of BDRC's custom er base in Columbus are the milita ry stationed at nearby Fort Benning. Social Med ia and Database Marketing Initiatives Creating a sense of communi ty and value for their custom ers extends beyond the store's physical lo cations. Capitalizing on co-owner Reggie Luther's expertise in social media marketing and professional web design, BDRC has developed an engaging and effective online strategy that suppo rts and extends the company's mission. The BDRC website is designed to provide information about the s tore and its products as well as promote t he sto re's numerous activiti es, events, and services. An event calendar by store location provides information on group runs and education al workshops, and a blog provides running and fitness related information and comm entary. The website does not offer sales of produc ts and is designed as an information only Page 144 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 forum. BDRC also does not advertise its stores or produc ts through traditional outlets, relying instead on grass roots marketing from positive word-of-mouth, repeat custom ers, and viral marketing through its social media outlets. BDRC's point -of-sale system allows the company to captu re and maintain customer information, manage inventory, and provides valuable s ales data for analyzing sales trends. The system also facilitates notifications to custom ers to remind them they are due for new shoes based on th eir running mi leage. Figure 3: Big Dog R unning Co mpany on Facebook SOU RCE: https://www.facebook.c om/bigdogrunning The BDRC's Facebook page shown in Figure 3 is activ ely maintained with postin gs about upcoming events and photos of running activiti es, races, and custom ers engaged in store-sponso red events. The Aubu rn store maintains a separate Facebook page tailored to its own local market and events. A Twitt er account is also part of the company's social media strategy and follow ed by over 1000 of the company's custom ers. All three sites (Facebook, Twitter, and BDRC 's main website) encourage custom ers to sign up for the company's email newsletter, \"Big Dog Bites,\" (Figure 4), sent weekly to custom ers with timely information about happenings in the running communi ty as well as stories of interest. Figure 4: Big Dog B ites (BDRC N ewslette)Page 145 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Social media is also used to grow BDRC's custom er base by attracting new runner s to its \"Couch to 5-K\" programs, running s eries, and themed events such as the popul ar \"Color Runs\" that are increasingly non-competitive and designed to promote participation and fun over achieving personal records. Information from local races managed by BDRC and affiliation with the lo cal running club help BDRC gain new customers and promote p articipation in its activiti es and events. With only 5-7% of the total U.S. population currently participating in the sport, there is limited upside market potential, making the developm ent of new participants in the sport impo rtant to the company's long-term growth. BDRC'S STRATE GIC IN FLEC TION POINT By paying close attention to the \"Five Key Success Factors\" identified by the owners, BDRC has been very successf ul in captu ring the local market in the two locations in Columbus, Georgia. In these two locations, the company offers custom ers a compelling value proposition with the combin ation of a prime location, well-designed stores that facilitate a sense of communi ty, knowle dgeable employees, effective and accessible events and programs, and finally, having the right inventory on hand to meet the needs of each location 's custom er base. As the company enters Page 146 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 its fifth year of operations, the owners recognize that to stay competitive in the indus try and continue to grow the company's custom er base, it must continuous ly adapt to meet the changing needs of its market. However, John and Reggie are seriously contemplating leaving the Aubu rn area since it doesn't seem to be working. But, th ey are hesitant sin ce they have already invested a lot of time and energy developing the Auburn market. Is it possible to turn the Aubu rn store around? John and Reggie know that the strategy for each separate retail location needs to be \"tweaked\" differently depending on the target market and the local competitive environment. They are looki ng for unique relationship -building st rategies that might spread the word among college students and appeal more to that target market. For example, they would like to come up with a \"fourth place\" concept in the Aubu rn sto re location th at appeals to the local target market (mainly college stud ents). Anothe r concern of the owner s is how to continue grow their current busin ess in light of recent national forecasts for the specialty running shoe market. Althou gh running shoe apparel sales continue on the upswin g, sales from the \"brick-and-mortar\" store segment decreased slightly in the past year. Addition ally, sales in g eneral spo rting goods and department sto res has remained flat for the past four years and is not predicted to grow significantly. Furthermore, the national demand for running apparel is expected by many to flatten out as the econom y continu es to recover from the recession, since it is believed that the sport of running may be counter-cyclical to the econom y. In light of this, John and Reggie are debating how to grow BDRC 's busin ess while protecting (buffering) the two Columbus locations from potential revenue declines in the future. They know there are many ways to attempt to grow the company, but would like to choose the most cost-efficient and least risky methods to expand their market presence and increase revenues.

Rarick , Purdue University Calumet Claudia C. Mich , Purdue University Calumet CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subje ct matter of this case involves the rise of the American whiskey industry after decades of stagnation and the sustainability of the industry's popularity. Secondary is sues examined include globalization and ethical concerns. The case has a difficulty level appropriate for junior level students. The case is desig ned to be taught in one class hour and is expected to require three hours of preparation by students. CASE SYNOPSIS American made whiskey is once again a hot product, especially in the premium priced segment of the market. Fueled in part by the popularity of American movies and television shows, along with changing tastes and preference and good product promotion , the American whiskey industry is experiencing a boom in sales. American whiskey is not only popular among drinkers in the United State s, but international sales are exceeding all expectations . The case looks at the rebirth of this American industry and its prospects for the future. INTRODUCTION Whiskey making has a long history in the United States. Even President George Washington owned a whiskey distillery. In the early days of American whiskey making , many distillers were farmers who also produced and sold whiskey as a source of additional income. In 1791, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton , placed a 25% tax on whiskey distillers in order to generate revenue for the young country. Most of these distillers were operating small production facilities and many were located in Pennsylvania . They greatly objected to a tax imposed by the federal government. By 1794 the hostility grew into a rebellion, called \"The Whiskey Rebellion\" which caused the federal government to send troops to enforce the tax (video ). The result was the relocation of whiskey distillers t o the West, most notably to Kentucky. Over time whiskey was being produced in a number of states, including Tennessee which produced the famous Jack Daniel 's brand. The popularity of whiskey grew over the years and reached its heyday in the 1950s in the U. S., but soon the drink lost popularity and sales declined. During the past decade American whiskey has experienced a renaissance, both in the United States and internationally. Whiskey is once again a popular drink and that popularity is growing exponentially in foreign markets. Whiskey producers have expanded capacity and new entrants have entered the market. Whiskey distillers in the United States can now be found from Alaska to Florida, many producing popular small batch lines . The general feeling in the industry is that this popularity will continue, however, it is yet to be seen if this surge will be long -lasting or simply a fad. Page 150 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 WHISKEY , BOURBON , OR SCOTCH ? The word whiskey, or whisky, has a Gaelic origin meaning \"water of life.\" There is often some confusion about the differences among whiskey (or whisky), bourbon, and scotch. In the end they are all whiskey but their contents and location of production make them different products . They are all alcoholic drinks distilled with gra in. While there are a number of nuances that make each different, the main differences can be briefly summarized. As far as the difference in spelling, the term \"whiskey\" is used for products produced in the United States and Ireland, and \"whisky\" is used for products produced in Canada and Scotland. Bourbon, by law, must be produced in the United States, and most of it is produced in the state of Kentucky. Since bourbon can only be made in the United States, the drink is sometimes referred to \"America's whiskey.\" Bourbon must be produced from a mash of at least 51% corn, distilled at a level no higher than 160 proof, stored in new charred oak barrels, and aged for a minimum of two years (although most bourbon is aged longer). Tennessee Whiskey is not bourbo n and has its own legal requirements. While similar to the requirements of bourbon, Tennessee Whiskey must be made in the state of Tennessee and be charcoaled filtered using sugar maple charcoal . Scotch is a whiskey produced in Scotland and malted barley a s the main ingredient . All whiskey goes through a six -step process which includes preparation, mashing, fermenting, distilling, aging, and bottling (Figure 1). Figure 1 Source: www.whiskydram .co.za The preparation phase involves crushing and then cooking grain. The mashing process adds water to the crushed grain. Fermentation involves adding yeast , which converts to alcohol and through distillation, the alcohol is turned into a vapor. Water is added to the vapor runoff and stored in barrels for aging. After the whiskey has aged to the desired number of years it is then bottled and is ready for sale. Unlike some spirits, whiskey requires aging and therefore has a long lead time between production and a vailability for sale. A ten -year bottle of whiskey requires ten years of aging . While some blending of younger and older whiskey is not an uncommon practice, ramping up production still requires years until the product is ready for sale (video ). The increased demand for whiskey has generated a number of companies selling spirits which contain the \"moonshine\" name. The product is sometimes labelled whiskey or \"natural spirits.\" While some \"moonshine\" is sold in impressive cantors, many are sold in Mason jars to enhance the rebel image of the product. Page 151 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 INCREASING DEMAND Whiskey was a popular spirited drink in the 1950s and 1960s in the United States. Over time demand dropped as consumers began to perceive the product as something old - an old drink for old men. Other spirits like vodka and tequila gained in popularity, along with American beer and wine. During the late 1990s whis key started to once again become popular, especially a brand with a strong image of heritage like Jack Daniel's which advertised its unique history. Premium and super -premium branded whiskey was starting to grow even more in popularity. By the early 2000s whiskey sales were on a steep upward trend (Figure 2). Figure 2 While sales of value -based whiskey (less expensive) account for the most volume, revenue from high -end whiskey far exceeds that of the value -based product. Image, uniqueness, and heritage appear to be very important in whiskey sales. Whiskey labelled reserve, single batch, or single barrel have a special ap peal to modern consumers. The age of the whiskey and the story behind it also produce a premium price. What was once a shelf -sitter gathering dust can be almost impossible to buy now . For example, Papa Van Winkle 20 -year-old bourbon can sell for over $100 a shot in a bar or restaurant , if you can even find it. Page 152 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 It would be easy to conclude that higher priced whiskey commands a higher price due to its superior quality. In a sense, it does , but only moderately . Age influence s the quality of whiskey to a point , but could marketing, image, and product placement be more important in driving sales? In a study of quality versus price for five spirits (vodka, gin, tequila, rum, and whiskey ), liquor experts blind taste tested various brands and rated them on a 100 -point scale for quality. It would be expected that those priced high would be rated high However, this was mostly not the case. In fact, of the five liquors, only whiskey had even a \"modest\" correlation between quality and price (Figure 3). It appears that quality, even for whiskey, is not the entire story. Figure 3 Source: B. Taylor, Business Insider 2013. Not unlike the vodka industry , which uses premium packaging to sell its product, the image of quality portrayed through advertising and product placement appears to be driving price differentials in the whiskey industry. Product placement, also known as brand placement, is a specific form of marketing communication that embeds brands into entertainment media such as movies, T.V. shows, books, computer games , Broadway musicals, and even artwork . The advantage of product placement over advertising is its ability to interweave brands into compelling plots such that audiences do not feel \"sold to .\" Since customers learn about brands through associations (colors, jingles, characters, etc.), a brand strategically placed in a film could be perceived as cool, evil, or innovative depending on the way it is integrated into the plot (i.e.; evil if used by a villa in). Whiskey has crept into American movies and television shows such as Mad Men , Breaking Bad , The Internship , and others, increasing the image of a drink that is desirable. The globalization of entertainment media helps promote American products internationally. The image of something Amer ican has strong appeal abroad ( video ). Page 153 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Regardless of high prices , the demand for premium American whiskey continues to rise, especially in foreign countries. Approximately half of the production of Jack Daniel's is exported to over 130 countries. Rival brand Jim Beam likewise exports heavily to over 100 countries. Master distillers from these and other companies appearing at promotional events abroad draw huge crowds seeking pictures and autographs of these \"celebrities\" . The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States , which conducts whiskey promotional events around the world , is sponsored in part by federal funds used to promote American products. The Coun cil also brings foreign journalist s to tour popular distilleries in the United States. These activities, coupled with creative advertising and packaging , create the special status that seems to be driving foreign demand for whiskey. American whiskey sales have exploded internationally, not only in traditional international markets like Japan, Germany, and the U.K., but also in markets previously not considered very important. For example, f rom 2002 to 2013, sales of American whiskey increased over 6,500% in Mexico, over 13,000% in Colombia, over 10,000% in Estonia, and over 4,600% in Nigeria . American whiskey is part of a growing globalization trend with increasing numbers of consumers seeking universal products. While whiskey is produced in many countries, the American brands seem to be commanding most of the attention and sales. WHAT 'S DRIVING DEMAND AND WILL IT LAST? The rise in demand for American whiskey, both domestically and abroad , doesn't seem to have one clear cause. Things American sell well abroa d and declining tariffs and a weaker dollar help sell the product overseas. As developing economies continue to grow , their purchasing power increases and allows for the consumption of more expensive foreign products, including American whiskey. Additional ly, innovation in flavored whiskey products has attracted drinking populations previously not targeted, including women. A very popular whiskey in 2013 was a whiskey called Fireball. This cinnamon flavored whiskey, with a sweeter taste, attracted a female following in a liquor segment that traditionally has been dominated by male consumers. The ability of the industry to create an image of \"coolness\" associated with the product may be enduring , particularly if associated with a concrete occasion such as Champaign with celebrating . Therefore, it can be difficult to ascertain how long whiskey's popularity will last. On the one hand, the industry wants to be careful not to label an enduring trend a fad, as Schwinn did with mountain biking in the 1980s, resul ting in huge losses. On the other hand, it can mean financial disaster to label a passing fad a trend. Marketing strategy recommends three essential questions to distinguish between trends and fads: What is driving the behavior? Trends suggest underlying lifestyle, technology, or demographic shifts, while fads are based on what is currently popular or in fashion. Is it accessible to the mainstream market? If the behavior requires major changes in habits or a substantial investment of either time or money, it is not accessible by the mainstream market and might be a fad. Page 154 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Is the base broad in scope? Can the behavior be expressed across industries or product categories? If so, we could be looking at an enduring trend, as with Eastern influence in food, health, medicine, etc. Promoting an image that sells the brand is critical to keeping whiskey a strongly demanded product. Companies in other industries have succeeded in building strong brand communities around their products. Harley Davidson and Jeep have provi ded loyal consumers a place to connect and interact with other loyal consumers, deepening customer involvement with and loyalty to the brand. Whiskey producers may be similarly effective. Currently, d ifferent producers use different messages and motives i n their promotional material . American whiskey distillers have recurring themes of auth enticity, tradition, and quality in their advertisements. Not always, but generally the product has a story and a history to tell. A sampling of video advertisements for American whiskey , along with a commercial from Fireball (Canadian whisky) and Jameson (Irish whiskey ) can be seen using the hyperlinks below . * SELECT WHISKEY TELEVISION COMMERCIALS Jack Daniel's Knob Creek Jim Beam Jim Beam in Japan Wild Turkey Maker's Mark Fireball - Canadian Jameson - Irish One problem with increasing demand of a product that takes years to make is the ability to supply that increased demand. With no way of speeding up the aging process , if demand continues to soar, prices will rise to allocate the scarce product. If the price rises too fast and too far, the mass appeal of the product will decline. While there are innovative ways of speeding up the aging process being considered, including placing barrels on moving ships in tropical climates to use tempera ture and the motion of the seas to age whiskey faster, no sure method has been accepted as practical. Besides, part of the ap peal of a premium whiskey is the number of years it has been aged. A number of American distillers have begun huge expansion projects to meet future demand, however, this strategy assumes whiskey demand will continue to grow for years to come. If the popul arity of American whiskey is a passing fad , these producers will once again be sitting on an asset they cannot sell. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1.

The primary issue of the case is the lack of user acceptance and the steps that can be taken now to turn a struggling investment around and eventually into a competitive advantage . Students should have an introductory level understanding of business strategy, marketing, and general business issues. The case is primarily designed for junior or senior -level undergraduate students majoring in marketing or management and has a difficulty level of three or higher. The ca se is designed to be taught in less than 1 class hour and is expected to require approximately 2 hours of outside preparation by students . CASE SYNOPSIS The case tells the story of Get Fit Gym, a fitness facility in an area housing approximately 6 7,000 people . The facility implemented virtual fitness class programming to phase instructor led fitness classes out while continuing to provide similar services as their competition . The project was implemented under the di rection of the facility manager in reaction to corporate budget cuts with no input from affected stakeholders nor plan for helping customers to embrace the classes. Now that the investment has been made, the manager needs to st art crafting a plan to turn their virtual class programming in to a competitive advantage and prevent similar situation s from occurring in the future. BACKGROUND Bob Baxter has been the facilities manager at Get Fit Gym in Peach Grove , Illinois for the past five years. Peach Grove has a population of about 47,000 people with surrounding communities adding another 20,000. There are currently five gyms within Peach Grove 's city limits with the majority of fitness member s enrolled in Total Fitness Gym, Get Fit Gym, and the local u niversity's gym in that order. FACILITY DESCRIPTION Get Fit Gym is a full service facility offering workout equipment, for fee trainers, swimming pools, saunas, whirlpools, and instructor led classes in cycling, weight lifting, aerobics, yoga, water aerobics , and for fee Cross fit training . Get Fit offers classes at various times throughout the day based upon member interest and instructor availability. The gym has one large exercise studio for aerobics and weight lifting classes, a smaller studio that is use d for yoga, a room dedicated for cycling classes, and another room dedicated for Cross fit training classes. The gym is open during the week from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. with shortened operating Page 160 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 hours during the weekends when fewer people work out ( 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.). Gym members receive a swipe card that they must swipe at the front desk in order to gain access to the gym. As members swipe their car ds for entry, they are usually g reeted by front desk staff. Gym member s pay an activation fee to join the gym and then a monthly fee of $45 thereafter. A member must remain a member of the gym for one year and then can cancel his/her membership within a month's notice to avoid a deactivation fee . Get Fit caters to a variety of customer s covering a number of age brackets and fitness levels. In general, Get Fit's customer base may lean a little more heavily toward young professionals in their late 20's to early 40's. Get Fit strives to provide state -of-the-art equipment in an attractive, comfortable setting. Their vision is to ... \"... equip members with the tools they need to achieve their fitness goals .\"(Get Fit's Web site) THE COMPETITION Overall, Total Fitness Gym is very similar to Get Fit Gym. Total Fitness offers similar services for the same price as Get Fit. H owever , the facility is bigger; t hey have one more pool ; and they offer more instructor led courses using an additional exercise studio . Total Fitness' hours of operation are the same and they cater to a very similar clientele as Get Fit Gym . However, a greater number of older customers seem to patronize Total Fitness as compared to Get Fit. Total Fitness' vision is to ... \"...provide fitness programs, equipme nt and guidance in a fun and caring environment to help members meet their health goals .\" (Total Fitness' Web site) The university' s gym caters to college students, university employees, alumni, and community members with a majority of the patrons being college age. The university gym offers a weight room, instructor led fitness classes, a swimming pool, and fee based personal training. The overall cost for membersh ip is about half that of the other two gyms for community member s and is automatically built into the fee structure for students. CLASS OFFERINGS Like every organization facing budgetary restrictions, Get Fit ha s been trying to provide more services with fewer resources. Since one of Bob's bi ggest expenditures ha s always been staffing, cuts in this area have been able to provide the greatest influ ence on the facility's budget. Bob has considered himself fortunate to have not had to fire any o f his employees. Over the past five years, some of his staff members have moved on to better paying positions at other businesses and he has addressed his budgetary needs by not refilling their positions. (Class instru ctors get paid $25 per class.) However , this has come at a cost as some of the classes taught by the former employees are no longer being offered. A noticeable difference in class offerings has becom e increasingly apparent between Get Fit and its biggest competitor , Total Fitness, causing customers to start to grumble. Page 161 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 VIRTUAL CLASSES Bob had read about virtual classes offered by the professional exercise organization with which Get Fit was affiliated. Other fitness facilities were offering virtual classes during off -peak time slots and to extend their class offerings at a low cost. One of the testimonials that Bob read regarding the use of virtual classes indicated that a facility was using virtual classes to offer a little variety during a lunchtime time slot. Bob thought that virtual cla sses would be a great solution for address ing the increasing difference in class offerings between Get Fit and its biggest competitor . After talking to representatives at a few of the facilities that were utilizing virtual classes, Bob enroll ed Get Fit in virtual classes to supplement the instructor led courses. He purchased , and had installed , a presentation system for broadcasting the classes in Get Fit's exercise studio at a cost of approximately $ 11,000. The projection system wa s expected to last 4 years and had an estimated monthly maintenance cost of $300. He also purchased a subscription to a variety of canned, professionally generated virtual classes to be offered on a daily basis including aerobic dance, weight lifting, body core buildin g and yoga . (The virtual classes are, in essence, exercise videos. You will see the exact same video no matter which day and time you attend. So, the banter between instructors that you hear during your class on Monday at noon will be the same banter that you hear on Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. , and any other day, for the rest of the month until a new release is programmed into the schedule .) The subscription for the classes cost s approximately $300 per month but varies based upon the number of classes offered . A schedule of virtual classes was created around the current instructor led courses (Table 1). The number of class offerings more than doubled with classes being offered throughout the day and late into the evening. Although more classes were being offered to gym member s, few were taking advantage of them. Most classes were empty and when they did have participants, they usually would c ontain just one or two members. Bob overheard the following conversation between gy m members who ha d been patrons of the gym for several years: Sue: \"Have you tried the new virtual classes yet?\" Lisa: \"Yes, I have taken a couple of classes, but I was the only person in the classroom each time. The classes are very good and I could ge t a good workout, but I come to the gym for the social aspect of talking and working out with others. I don't work out as hard when I am by myself. I think I would rather just work out on the machines. \" Another comment Bob overheard was from a new member: Abby: \"I really like the virtual classes. I was the only person in class and I didn't feel intimidated by other people watching me.\" Page 162 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Table 1 GET FIT GYM VIRTUAL CLASS SCHEDULE Monday /Wednesday Tuesday /Thursday Friday Open - 9:00 Virtual classes Open - 9:30 Virtual classes Open - 9:00 Virtual classes 9:00 - 11:00 Instructor led classes 9:30 - 11:00 Instructor led 9:00 - 11:00 Instructor led classes 11:00 - 12:00 Virtual class 11:00 - 12:00 Virtual class 11:00 - to 5:30 Virtual class 12:00 - 1:00 In structor led class 12:00 - 1:00 p.m. Instructor led 5:30 to 6:30 Instructor led class 1:00 - 4:00 Virtual classes 1:00 - 4:00 Virtual classes 6:30 to Close Virtual classes 4:00 - 7:30 Instructor led classes 4:00 - 6:30 Instructor led 7:30 - Close Virtual classes 6:30 - Close Virtual classes Saturday /Sunday Open to 11:00 Instructor led classes 11:00 to close Virtual classes SECOND GUESSING The virtual classes are still new and Bob is hoping that, with summer right around the corner, member s will take advantage of the greater flexib ility of course offerings. However, he is starting to wonder if the investment in the resources to offer the virtual classes and the monthly subscription fees a re worth the costs. In regards to the goals of the gym, Bob questions whether or not he made the right decision in implementing virtual cla sses into the gym's programming? He also wonders if he followed the appropria te steps in making his decision. However, it is too late to turn back and the inv estmen t has already been made. He needs to find ways to increase attendance in the virtual classes while not hav ing the budget to create a big advertising campaign. He is wondering if there is something that he can do with Get Fit's current marketing channels and technology (occasional flyers, instructor announcements, a monthly newsletter, a web site, social media and a membership database ) to better advertise its services to members that would respect customers' privacy , yet increase the number of members attending virtual classes. Bob would like to see this investment become a competitive advantage for his facility. Page 163 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 GLOBAL TRAVEL, INC. D.K. (Skip) Smith , Baze University CASE OVERVIEW Ever wi shed you had a case on negotiation which young adults (i.e., the kinds of people you are probably teaching) should find very easy to relate to? This case describes a situation where a young adult attempting to purchase an airline ticket for a friend using her uncle's credit card has been rejected by an online travel agency (O TA) but then uses a framework she learned at university to persuade the OTA to reverse the earlier decision and approve the credit card purchase of the airline ticket for her friend. The case is appropriate for senior -level undergraduates as well as students in MBA and Executive Development programs. It is designed to be taught in a one hour and a half class session, and is likely to require at least a couple hours of preparation by students. CASE SYNOPSIS Ms. Millicent Buhari and her good friend Ms. Ester Mgba are students at the University of Wurundi, in Africa. Last week Ms. Buhari's uncle in Houston, Texas invited the two young women to come and visit him in Houston, Texas; earlier this week, the uncle in Houston sent (by courier) a return ticket from Wurundi to Houston for Ms. Buhari. Regarding a Wurundi to Houston (return) ticket for Ms. Mgba: the uncle has given the details on his U.S. credit card to Ms. Buhari and urged her to use that credit card to purchase a ticket for Ms. Mgba from an online travel company called Global Travel Inc. (hence, GTI). When Ms. B uhari attempts to purchase a Wurundi to Houston (return) ticket for Ms. Mgba from GTI using her uncle's U.S. credit card, however, she encounters a series of problems and rejections. Ultimately, however, Ms. Buhari succeeds in getting GTI to accept her u ncle's U.S. credit card and issue the Wurundi to Houston (return) ticket for Ms. Mgba. Additional data and information in the case include: 1. Regarding the situation: Information on the series of problems and rejections which Ms. Buhari received from GTI is provided. 2. Regarding Online Tr avel Agencies (OTAs): I nformation is provided on the OTA industry. 3. Regarding the company: Information is provided on an online travel agency and its operations. 4. Regarding the online travel purchase -related beh aviors o f consumers: I nformation is provided. THE SITUATION Ms. Millicent Buhari and her good friend Ms. Ester Mgba are students at the University of W urundi, in Africa. Last week Ms . Buhari's uncle in Houston, Texas invited the two young women to come and v isit him in Houston, Texas while he is recovering from a major surgery ; earlier this week, the uncle in Houston sent (by courier) a return ticke t from Wurundi to Houston for Ms . Buhari. Regarding a Wurundi t o Houston (return) ticket for Ms . Mgba: Because h is doctors have told him that for the time being he must do nothing more than rest, the uncle has given the details on his U.S. credit card to Ms. Buhari and urged her to use that credit card to purchase a ticket for Ms . Mgba from an Online Travel Agency ( OTA) called Gl obal Travel Inc. Page 164 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 (hence, GTI). Acting on her uncle's suggestions, Ms. Buhari went to the GTI website and submitted the travel information for her friend Ms. Mgba, including the destinations, the days of travel, the name of the traveler, and t he credit card details which her uncle had provided her. After submitting that information, Ms. Buha ri received back the following email from GTI: From: GTI Service order number XXX391 Dear Ms. Buhari: Your reservation has been set up for ticketing. You should be receiving an E -ticket email for the flights you requested within 24hrs. Passenger: Ms. Ester Mgba Kind regards, Global Travel Inc. Customer Service THE SITUATION Within 15 minutes o f receiving the above email from the company, two developments took place: 1) Ms. Buhari noted (on her uncle's online credit card statement) that GTI had charged her uncle's credit card both for the tickets for Ms. Mgba and the commission which GTI would ear n for issuing those tickets 2) Ms. Buhari also received a second email from GTI. The text of that second email to Ms. Buhari is as indicated below: From: GTI . Buhari: Thank you for booking your trip with Global Travel Inc . In order to process your payment we must be able to match the cardholder billing telephone you provided online with the telephone on record with the card issuing bank. We are unable to match the provide d credit card billing telephone at this time. Please provide us with the telephone number registered with your card issuing bank and ensure that you are reachable at this number for the purpose of online payment authorization. If you are not av ailable to answer calls at your billing telephone during normal business hours please let us know a good time to call. We must be able to verify your telephone with the bank and obtain verbal charge authorization at the same telephone number before process ing your payment and reservation. PLEASE NOTE: You must submit thi s information within the next 24 hours.\" Page 165 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Global Travel Inc. Customer Service THE SITUATION After thinking a bit about the above email and considering alternative ways to respond to it, Ms. Buhari sent GTI back an email explaining that; 1) She was attempt ing to purchas e a Wurundi to Houston (return) ticket for her friend Ms. Mgba using a credit card belonging to her uncle in the United States . 2) Because she was located outside the United S tates, she would not be able to call GTI using the U.S. telephone number associated with her uncle's U.S. credit card. THE SITUATION Shortly after she sent her explanatory email to GTI, Ms. Buhari received the following response from \"Dear Ms. Buhari: We understand that you are unable to call us from the billing phone number since you are outside the US. However, in order to process the payment, we must provide the credit card company with the correct information, including the billing phone number. Thank you. With best regards, Global Travel Inc. Customer Service THE SITUATION After thinking a bit about the abov e email and how best to respo nd to it , Ms. Buhari sent GTI an email which (as indicated below) included two telephone numbers which her uncle had assured her were assoc iated with the U.S. credit card information he had provided her, so that she would be able to use his card purchase t he Wurundi to Houston (re turn) air tickets for Ms. Mgba. A few hours after she sent this information to GTI, Ms. Buhari received the following response from GTI: Page 166 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 From: GTI Customer Service order number XXX391 Dear Ms. Buhari: Thank you for booking your trip with Global Travel Inc. Your payment has been flagged for additional screening because you are either paying for travelers who do not bear your last name or because the reservation falls into our scr eening category. CLICK HERE to learn more about payment screening and cardholder authentication. In an effort to fight widespread international Internet credit card fraud we kindly ask that you supply us with additional credit card payment authentication d ocuments as follows: Fill out the attached credit card payment authorization form Attach a clearly legible copy of your credit card's front and back Attach a clearly legible copy of your government issued photo identification (driver license or passport) Attach a clearly legible copy of your most recent credit card billing sta tement's first page as received from your bank (if you do not have a paper document you may also submit your online banking credit card statement screenshot).

You can avoid the screening only by cancelling this reservation and using a traveler's own credit card for payment. Why credit card copies are required Your type of reservation fits into a high risk payment category according to our sales records. This could be due to the itinerary's origin or destination, travel date(s), your Page 167 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 physical location, lack of billing address verification capability and lack of secure online payment authentication (e.g., Verified by Visa), because you are paying for other travelers than yourself, or for other reasons. Global Travel Inc. Customer Service THE SITUATION (7 ) After considering the above (and most recent) email from GTI, and after collecting a bit of documentation from her uncle in the U.S., Ms. Buhari sent GTI the following response: From: Ms. number XXX391 \"Gentlemen: As you requested in the most recent email you sent me , I have provided you with: a. The GTI form you requested that I complete. b. A clearly legible c opy of the front and back of the U.S. credit card which my uncle provi ded me so that I would be able to purchase a plane ticket for Ms. Ester Mgba. c. A clearly legible copy of my passport d. A clearly legible copy of the first page of the latest credit card statement sent by Bank of the Mid/Southwest (that is, the U.S. bank w hich issued my uncle his U.S. credit card) to my uncle in the U.S. Please note: As I mentioned to you in an e arlier email, before placing my order for the ticket for Ms. Mgba, I called (using Skype) Bank of the Mid/Southwest to alert them to the fact that I would be using my uncle's U.S. credit card to purchase a plane ticket for my friend Ms. Mgba. The person at Bank of the Mid/Southwest with whom I spoke indi cated that she had made a note of my upcoming purchase, and that the bank would be expecting (an d would approve) my purchase of the plane tick et for Ms. Mgba using the U.S. credit card which the bank had issued to my uncle. In conclusion: Given all the documentation and other information I have provided to GTI, and given that there is now not enough time for me to attempt to purchase the Wurundi to Houston (return) plane ticket for Ms. Mgba from any other travel agency, I do hope that GTI will now take the act ion which you indicated on the form which I have filled out for you , that is: a. GTI will IMME DIATELY charge my uncle's U.S. credit card upon receipt by you of the documents you requested and which I have now sent to you. b. GTI will IMMEDIATELY issue the Wurundi to Houston (return) plane tickets for my friend Ms. Ester Mgba. Sincerely, Ms. Millicent Buhari Page 168 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 THE SITUATION In response to the above email , GTI sent Ms. Buhari the following email: From: Global Travel Inc. Customer Service Sent: 07 June To: Ms. Millicent Buhari Subject: XXX391 GTI order number Dear Ms. Buhari: Until now, none of the phone numbers you have provided matched with the phone number your bank has on file.

Metasearch companies often make use of \" screen scraping \" to ge t live availability of flights; \"s creen scraping\" is a way Page 169 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 of crawling t hrough airline websites to get content from those sites by extracting data from human -readable HTML feeds. 3) \"Fare aggregators\" are another subset of OTAs; these companies redirect users to an airline, cruise, hotel, or car rental site or another Online Tra vel Agent for the final purchase of a ticket. Aggregators' busin ess models include collecting information from major OTAs and then displaying to the user all of the results on one screen; from the options identified, the OTA selected by the user (for exam ple, Expedia or Priceline or Travelocity) then fulfills the ticket. Aggregators generate revenues through advertising and charging other OTAs for referring clients . Examples of AVEL -RELATED CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS Wikipedia indicates that travel -related customer data and behaviors include those listed below: 1) The average consumer visits 3.6 sites when shopping for an airline ticket online, according to PhoCusWright, a Connecticut -based travel technology firm. 2) Yahoo claims 76% of all online travel purchases are preceded by some sort of search function, according to Mr. Malcolmson, director of product development for Yahoo Travel. 3) A 2004 Travel Consumer Survey published Jupiter Researc h noted that \"nearly two in five online travel consumers say they believe that no one site has the lowest rates or fares.\" Thus a niche was created for aggregate travel search which seek to find the lowest rates from multiple travel sites, obviating the ne ed for consumers to cross -shop from site to site. Source: Based on material from Wikipedia ADDIT IONAL INFORMATION: THE COMPANY On its website, Global Travel, Inc. (hence GTI) indicates that it is an Online Travel Agency (OTA) that is passionate about developing advanced airfare search te chnology , in order to provide customers with the lowest airfares available. Other comments and/or claims made by GTI on its website include: 1) When customers purch ase from GTI, they buy the best deals on the market from a company that has served hundreds of thousands of domestic and international air travelers through its own extremely efficient search engine since 2012. 2) GTI operates a world -class travel reservation system that powers this website and all Customer Servi ce operations, from automated ticketing, billing, and airline schedule change processing, to Customer Call Center Support.

Source: Based on material from the GTI website ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: THE COUNTRY OF WURUNDI Wurundi is a country in Africa whose name must remain disguised. The country has about 5% of the landmass of the United States, and the terr ain is diverse, ranging from beaches and swamps to desert conditions. Large deposits of both oil and natural gas have been discovered. Even though much of the gas was discovered by accident (in many cases, the gas was discovered by companies prospecting fo r oil), Wurundi's proven reserves of gas are worth (at any reasonable price per standard c ubic foot) billions of dollars. In other words, Wurundi is richly endowed with energy resources. Data collected by Wurundi's Bureau of Statistics indicates that 70% of Wurundi's population is classified as \"poor,\" It is also true, however , that Wurundi's Gross National Product (GNP) exceeds $100 billion. In report titled \"Lions on the Move\" and published by the McKinsey Global Institute, Roxburgh et al. (2010) claim that \"the continent (that is, Africa) is among the world's most rapidly growing economic regions\" and that \"the rate of return on foreign direct investment in Africa is higher than in other de veloping countries.\" As for the country called (in this case stu dy) Wurundi, each of the last five years the economy has grown by more than 5%. In other words, the economy is not only quite large but is growing much more rapidly than most developed world economies. For several countries which export food products, Wuru ndi is one of their top 5 export markets in the world. A final point about Wurundi involves the level of financial fraud a nd corruption in the country and the economy. In its annual rankings of the most and least corrupt countries in the world, Transparenc y International in Berlin (TI) has always ranked Wurun di in the bottom quartile (that is, the most corrupt quartile) of all countries in the world. While i t is viewed as less corrupt now than in the past, Wurundi is still ranked in that bottom (that is, most corrupt) quartile. THE CHALLENGE Assume you are Ms. Buhari. What will you now say to or do with GTI, so as to attempt to get them to r everse their decision and allow you to use your uncle's U.S. credit card to purchase the Wurundi -Houston (return) air ticket for your friend Ms. Mgba?

This case is useful in an entrepre neurship class as it contains most parts of a feasibil ity plan and allows students to work up the nu mbers and determine whether to proceed or not. In addition, this case could be us ed in a stra tegy class or a t echnology manage ment class. This case would be usef ul with junior level or senior level courses. The pertinent points can be easily covered in a one hour period and depending on how much emphasis the ins tructor wants to put on the numbers would require probably take 1-3 hours of outside class work preparat ion. CASE SYNOPSIS Students should find this case interesting. This case is set in spring 2013 as the US is faced with falling natural gas prices, gas fracking contro versi es and rising gasoline prices. A young man four years after college graduation with an engineering degree is faced with a dilemma. He has an excellent well-paying job, but part of him would like to return home. There are no jobs with his current company in Pennsylvania so the young entrepreneur begins to think about starting his own busin ess. He has no real mentors, but can't shake the idea that this maybe his ticket ho me. He has always been fascinat ed with the possibilities of alternati ve energy sourc es. He wond ers if he has missed th is oppor tunity or if the busin ess model he has in mind is just different enough to allow him success. He decides to create a busin ess plan and hopes that this will help him with h is decision. BACKGROU ND OF ENTRE PRENEUR Dave Roberts is 26. He graduated from a prestigious engineering school and went to work for a large corporation in an energy related field. He really liked the compa ny he worked for but always thought the idea of ownin g his own busin ess would be something he would like to do. He also liked the idea of something related to renewable energy sources. Dave knew a lot about e ngineering, but n ot a lot about busin ess, but he did know he needed a busin ess plan. The decis ion must be made soon. The compan y he is with has just offered him a transfer and promotion. If he takes it and then changes his mind, he will owe the compa ny his moving expenses along with his $5000 bonus to move. He must tell the company in the next few weeks whether or not he will take the tra nsfer and promotion. Page 172 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 OVER VIEW OF ENER GY INDUSTRY The electric powe r industry is a $298 -billion-plus indust ry that provides the nation with the most common energy form know n\u2014electricity. It is also a very fragmented indust ry includes any compa ny produc ing, selling, or distributing electricity. These energy m arkets include the \"traditional\" electric utilities, such as shareholder-owned companie s, electric coope ratives, and government-owned utilities. Fossil fuels, uranium and water are the most common sources of energy that are conve rted into electricity About 66 percent of generation in the United States came from fossil fuel in 2013. Coal and natural gas are currently the dominant fossil fuels used by the indust ry. Nuclear contribut es approximately 20 percent, while the contributi on from conve ntional hydroelectric fluctua tes between 6 and 8 pe rcent. Electricity generation from renewable sources other than water is growing in importance. Electricity generation from wind, in particul ar, has been growin g rapidly in recent years, with wind c ontributing about 4% in 2013. Some othe r renewable sources of energy that are conve rted into electricity include: Geothermal energy, Solar thermal energy, Photovoltaic energy, and Biomass While much wo rk has been done to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels to generate electricity, still some gases and particul ates are not captured by the pollution control equipment and are released into the atmosph ere. Among the gases emitted during the burni ng of fossil fuels are sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) contributing to global warmin g. Electric power plants emit more than two bi llion tons of carbon dioxide each year, or roughly 40 percent of tot al emissions. Renewable energy sou rces\u2014such as solar power, wind, geothermal, and biomass\u2014 produc e minimal environmenta l impact and generally have low or no fuel costs. But there are issues with these as well. Many renewable sources are not available at all times or not readily available when electricity is required immedia tely. Renewable sources of energy also face their own environme ntal a nd siting concerns. OVER VIEW OF THE SOLAR PANEL IN DUSTRY History of Solar Energy Solar energy is not as new as you may think. According to the US Department of Energy, solar energy has been around since 7th Century B.C. when man first used glass to magnify the sun's rays and make fire. Some sources say that in 212 BC, the Greek scientist, Archimedes, used sold ier's bronze shields to focus sunli ght and set fire to woode n ships from the Roman Empire whic h were besieging Syracuse. What is perhaps more interesting is the Greek Page 173 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 navy recreated the experiment in 1973 and did successful ly set fire to a wooden boat at a distance of 50 mete rs. Roman architectur e as far back as early 1st century A.D. shows that Roman bathhous es had large south facing windows p resumab ly to let in the sun 's warmth. The first patent was applied for in 1816 by Ro bert Stirling applied for his econom izer at the Chancery in Edinbu rgh, Scotland. Robert Stirling was actually a minister in the Chur ch of Scotland whose hobb y was build ing heat engines in his home workshop. Albe rt Einstein was also interested in solar energy and published a paper on it in 1905 and in 1921, wins the Nobel Prize for his theories on the photo electric effect. The first silicon solar cell, whic h as really the beginning of all solar-powered devices, was built by Bell Laboratori es in 1954.Not surprising, the space indust ry was an early adopter of solar technolo gy. It was solar technolo gy that powered spacecrafts beginning in the 1960s. The Vanguard 1 -- the first artific ial earth satellite powe red by sol ar cells -- remains the oldest manma de satellite in orb it - log ging more than 6 billion m iles, accor ding to the E nergy.gov site. Solar Energy Indust ry Today The current solar p ower market has three main types of solar related businesses. There is the hardware that goes into the solar power array and that comes from component manu facturers. Solar p anel installers, who are respons ible for the physical installation of the solar systems.. In addition, the last major solar related busin esses are the solar utility companies who use massive arrays of sola r power systems to produce electricity and sell it to the consum ers. Germany has historically been the leader in solar power. In 2013 China, who has over 50% of the world's manufacturing capacity, realized its own need for a clean power source and really inc reased its use of solar power. China has becom e the world leader in the use of photovo ltaic solar and there is no reason to believe th is will change anytime soon. In the last several years, both Japan and the United States have also come on strong with significant installations. The solar indust ry is one that has performed very well in recent history in the US. Sales of solar p anels have grown a minimum of 40% per year since 2000. The five year growth rate from 2007 to 2012 was approximately 55% per year! In the first quarter of 2012, developers installed 85 percent more solar panels compared to the first quarter of 2011. During 2012, over 80,000 hous eholds ins talled sol ar panels on their property. Tot al U.S. installations w ere projected to reach 3,300 m egawatts in 2012 - making the US the fourth la rgest solar market in the world. Solar Panel Technology There are two main types of solar technology currently in use. Photovo ltaic (PV), uses the photovol taic effect to generate electricity by capturing the su n's rays via solar panels. According to Nasa Science News, photovo ltaic works at the atomic level by dir ectly conve rting light into electricity. The photoel ectric effect causes certain mate rials to absorb photons of light and release electrons. When these free electrons are captured they create an electric current that can be used a s electrici ty.

These panels are squ are in shape, and their surface resembles a mosaic due to all the different crystals that make up the modu le. Those made with silicon crystals may appear smooth and even and are called monocr ystalline modules. Monosc rystalline panels made from a single crystal are more efficient than polycrystalline solar modu les but, polycrystalline panels are much simpler to produce, and cost far less to manufacture. They are just as durable and have a similar life span as the monoc rystalline systems therefore they are less expensive for consum ers. LOCATI ON Dave wanted to return to his hometown of Pittsburgh, PA. So he began his research looking at that as an option. Weather would be a primary factor in the feasibility and profitability of DR Solar since the primary commodity that the compa ny is dealing with is solar energy. Pittsburg was sunny during the day 45% of the year and had clear skies 59 days throu ghout the year with an average amount of sunli ght of 2021 hours. It appeared that Pittsburg h also had 3 companie s specializing in installing solar power. They were Honeycomb Solar, LLC - Pittsbur gh , Vox Energy Solutions - Allison Park , and West Penn Energy Solutions - Pittsburg h. The housing ma rket would also be important. Pittsburg h has roughly 589,201 homes occupied by 58.65% of the population and a med ian hous ehold income of $49,000. CUSTOMER DE MOGRAPHICS Energy costs have been rising. Between 2004 and 2007, the national average price of electricity increased almost 20% percent from 7.6 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2004 to 9.1 cents per kWh in 2007. As fuel costs continue to rise so did the cost to produc e electrici ty. In doing his research, Dave found out some facts about who buys solar power. 84% of solar electric systems installed are for residenti al customers. While these systems are much small er than commercial systems, they actually represent only 33% of grid-tied PV systems in megawatts. Who Buys Solar Power? The Solar Electric Power Assoc iation conducted a survey of about 600 households who made the d ecision to pursue solar systems and f ound some interesting facts: Half of the respond ents do not have childr en or no longer have childr en in the home. Most had a hous ehold income over $100 K, however about 1/3 of respond ents had an income between $50Kand $100 K. A strong m ajority of households also said that they have joint financial decision makers so both parties had to agree to making this decision. Educated. Most have an undergraduate degree and over half have a post-graduate or professional degree. Page 175 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Why Did Cons umers Decide to Purchase a Solar Panel System? Environme ntal concerns were chosen as the top priority for most hous eholds, althoug h respond ents were also motivated to decre ase the dependence on foreign oil, produc e their own electricity, and reduce their current ele ctricity rates. A different survey of 200 solar home owners conduc ted by Pure Energies show ed some different results though. This survey found men were initially most interested in solar power. While me an hous ehold average was about the same (76,000-100,000) , these customers surveyed said they did it for the money. Without the econom ic benefit of going solar, nearly 3 or 4 homeo wners say they wouldn 't have done that large companie s are continually entering/exiting the market on a daily basis becaus e of the volati le nature that is associa ted with a new solar busin ess. The primary reason for this is because many companies take on more customers and millions of dollars in de bt. Dave found 3 competi tors. They were Honeycomb Solar, LLC - Pittsburgh , Vox Energy Solutions - Allison Park , and West Penn Energy Solutions - Pittsburg h. This did not seem like a large number of competi tors given P ittsburgh's size. BUSIN ESS MODELS Selling vs. Leasing There are two main business models available from the ins tallers point of vie w. The installer has the option to sell the panels directly to the consum er or lease the panels and retain ownership. Th ere are pluses and m inuses to both op tions. In the leasing option, DR Solar would own the panel and any electricity generated. The consum er would then pay a fixed fee to have the solar energy cut down on the consum er's electric bill. The main advantage of this aspect for the consum er is the ability to lock in a fixed rate on energy bills in deregulate d states where energy bills are expected to greatly increase. The main advantage for DR Solar was the ability to maintain and control the solar panels throu ghout the process but will the solar panels last long enough to regain his investm ent. DR would earn cash by selling the extra electricity back to the grid. There are also many legal issues involved when a consu mer sells their home and must transfer the lease to the new home ow ner. In the selling opt ion, DR Solar would sell the panels to the consum er. From DR's perspective, this shifts the burden of paying for the system to the consum er. The consum er then is in a posit ion to r eceive tax benefits if any are available Page 176 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Costs As a busin ess, DW Solar could have four different sizes of solar panels that would be distribut ed to the consum er. The solar panels have si zes from 3KWh, 5KW h, 7KWh, and 10KWh. The 3KWh solar panel system will cost DW Solar $12,000 but he intended to add an additional $3000 or a 25% markup, while it will only cost the consum er $10,500 (after tax incentives) plus installation. The hourly output for the 3KWh solar panel will be 3KWh, depending on the location of the panel. The daily produc tion of the 3KWh solar panel is around 10.5K Wh, whic h would bring it to 315K Wh monthly and 3,780K Wh yearly. This would bring consum er monthly revenue to $34.64 and yearly revenue to $415.80. What split would he need to make a profit? Would the remaini ng be enough to make the sale? And how many sales would it take to make a profit? Dave had many reasons to return home. Most of his family and friends were still in the Pittsburg h area and Dave loved the city. He had saved quite a bit of money already and he tended to live simply so money was not a huge motivator for him. But a decision had to be made soon. If he accepts the promotion, then it becomes very costly to leave the compa ny. If he is going to leave, it shou ld be now. \"I just don't know whether this is the right move,\" Dave thought to himself but knew time was runnin g out.

A startup wind turbine manufacturing company faces these decisions unde r an initial funding cash constraint as they plan the compan y's first two years of produ ction capac ity. Secondary issues are to understand 1) the elements of a manufacturing facility lease, 2) the rationale and motivations for subcontracting all or a subset of the product's compon ent parts, 3) the financial forecasts necessary to determine the cash burn associated with various levels of produ ction capac ity, and 4) the complexities of integrating these decisions and forecasts in developing the optimal initial prod uction capac ity for the startup. The case has a difficulty level of four, appropr iate for senior level. The case is designed to be taught in three or four class hours, depending on the student proficiency in finan ce and accounti ng, and is expected to require three hours of outside prepara tion by students. CAS E SYNOPSIS Wind Po wer is a wind turbine manufacturing company found ed by an American executiv e from General Electric, an executiv e from a large German electric utility, and a young Norwegian scientist just gradua ted from MIT, with a Ph.D. in aeronau tical engineering. The two executives bring to the startup a combined $7 million in cash. The scientist brings with him a patent for a two-blade, flexible hous ing turbine that will generate an energy efficiency yield higher than any wind turbine on the market. The compa ny has received interest in their wind turbine from wind farms in the U.S. and Europe . However, these farms are reluctant to place orders with the new company without being sure of their produ ction capacity. Therefore, they ask the WindForc e founders how many turbines they can prod uce and sell to them in the next two years. The WindFor ce found ers are now faced with selecting the manufacturing site and size of facility as well as the compon ents that will be produ ced in-house and will be subcontracted, which in a recurs ive fashion affect the size of the facility. These decisions need to be made under the constraint of the initial cash availabl e for use in the company and the desire to not only maintain a minimum monthly cash balance but have sufficient cash at the end of the two years to accel erate produ ction beginning in year three. A relational set of financial models are used in the case to facilitate the unde rstanding of how these decisions are inter-related and of the implications of these decisions on cash burn. Page 178 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 THE NEW VENTURE In 1915, the British scientist Frederick W. Lanchester provided scientific evidence that the maximum kinetic energy in wind that can be extracted in open flow, independent of the design of the turbine extracting the energy, is 59.3%. Publish ed scientific papers indicate that the German physicist Albert Betz came to the exact same conclusion four years later in 1919. A year after Betz's publication, research publish ed by Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovs ky, a Russian scientist and the foundi ng father of modern aero- and hydro-dynamics, reported exactly the same results. The 59.3% turbine maximum kinetic wind energy extraction conclusion came to be known as Betz's Law, and the percent limit becam e known as the Betz coefficient. In his capacity as an aeronautical engineer and V ice President of the Energy Management Division at a major U.S. wind turbine manufacturer, Sal Turner knew of and unde rstood the implications of Betz's Law. The maximum wind power extraction efficiency of his company's turbines is around 35% which is at the high end of the efficiency scale for current comme rcially available wind turbines. Sal position provided him with a rewarding platform to learn about the renewable energy indus try and with the opportunity to travel the world observing innova tions in sustainable energy produc ts and practices. In his travels he spoke with entrepreneurial scientists who were passionate about their innov ations and who had built businesses to provide their produc ts and services to the world. Over time, he discovered that he wanted to be one of those entrepreneurs. THE OPPORTUNITY Sal had just attended a conference on wind power held in Beijing and sponso red by Greenpeace Internationa l and the Global Wind Energy Counc il. At the conference he learned that economic experts in the indus try are forecasting that wind power could supp ly up to 12% of global electricity by 2020, creating 1.4 million new jobs and reducing CO2 emissi ons by more than 1.5 billion tons per year, more than five times today's level. By 2030, wind power could provide more than 20% of global electricity supp ly. Based on those forecasts he concluded that the success of a new venture in the wind energy indus try sector would be based on three key elements: (1) a compelling, innova tive produc t idea, (2) a team with highly-skilled and diverse talents to build a business model around that idea, and (3) significant funding. He had neither of the first two. As for the third, he knew that venture capita lists are reluctant to invest in a venture at its inception, especially in the very speculative sustainable energy indus try. So his venture could get off the ground only if a foundi ng team could be organized and he funds the venture hims elf. His professional career has been lucrative for him, with escalating s alaries and generous bonus es. With his savings and an inheritance from his grandfather, also an entrepreneur, Sal had $8 million in the bank and was willing to invest half of it in his new venture. Further thinking had him realize that he wou ld not be able to attract to his venture highly- talented people who had secure and lucrative positions elsewhere unless he demonstrated that he was willing to take the risk of forgoing his own position. He also did not want to struggle with the ethical issues of pursuing a new venture while still working at his current company, although many entrepreneurs have successf ully and ethically navigated through those issues. So he gave his four-week notice. A month later, at the age of thirty-eight, he was unemployed...but he was also about to becom e an entrepreneur. Page 179 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 He wanted his new venture to be special, with a produc t that was able to harness the force of wind and capture its inhere nt energy. He began planning for his new venture. His first decision was to name it WindFor ce. Sal's prelimina ry business idea for WindForce was to design, manufacture, and market a new and innova tive wind turbine. He knew the design would have to come first. Since Betz's Law set the maximum efficiency of wind turbines at 59.3% and that the most efficient turbines on the market provide a maximum of around 35% efficiency, he thought if he could design a turbine that could move energy-capture efficiency a few percentage points closer to the Betz coefficient, and if he could manufac ture it at a cost that would allow a very competitive price, he would not only have a profitable company but also forge forward in his primary passion\u2014t o expand the frontie r of sustainable energy. So he drew upon all his know ledge of aeronautical engineering and his experiences in the sustainable energy indus try to begin the process of designing a wind turbine that would meet his WindForce venture's success criteria. A few weeks into his design effort, he had made no progress. He soon realized that he had been out of the product design area for too long, having devoted his effor ts at his former company to managing the business of manufacturing and distributing wind turbines. So he started looking at past and current patents and patent applications related to wind technol ogy. THE INNOVATOR - JO SAND BERG A recent patent grant caught Sal's attention for two reasons. First, elements of the technol ogy described in the patent were very innovative in nature and addressed many of the turbine design problems currently constraining wind energy extraction efficiency. Second, one person owned the patent which would make discussions on that patent easier than dealin g with multipl e inventors or a company. The name on the patent was Jo Sandbe rg. Sal searched the Internet for Sandber g and found that he was pursuing the same degree that Sal had earned (a Ph.D. in Aeronautical Engineering) from the same university (MIT). Sal calle d Sandberg and told him about the WindForce venture and that he wanted to talk to him about his patented technol ogy. Sandber g agreed to meet Sal at a Starbucks on Harvard Street just a couple blocks from Sandbe rg's apartment. In their meeting, Sandberg explained to Sal that his turbine technol ogy is based on a 2- blade, horizontal axis design with the rotor orientation downw ind of the tower . The reason for the downw ind design is that the wind will drive the rotor blades away from the tower so that the rotors do not have to be as rigid as an upwind design which needs to be concerned about the rotors bending and hitting the tower. Therefore, the down -wind rotors and the turbine tower and hous ing can be lighter in weight and therefore less expensive to manufacture than 3-blade upwind turbines. Sandbe rg explained to Sal that his innova tion\u2014one that no one had thought of before\u2014is in the mechanism that attache s the turbine blades to the rotor shaft. Drawing from the design of the latest milit ary stealth helicopter blade design, Sandbe rg's design for the turbine's flexible coil rotor shaft uses a new, environmentally friendly, extremely flexible, and super-strong material calle d nanocellu lose. A is that the nanocellu lose coil is not in the form of a spring, but in a series of latticed, multi-angled figure eights that allow the rotor blades to efficiently capture the kinetic energy from wind coming at the turbine from any angle within a 180 degree radius. Sandber g told Sal that this innova tion will allow turbines using his design to have an energy extraction efficiency much closer to Betz's limit of 59.3% than any current comme rcial Page 180 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 turbine. An additiona l benefit is that his design virtually eliminates the fatigue loading factor on the turbine tower and rotor hous ing that exists in the current rigid rotor blade design. This allows for lighter, less expensive materials to be used in the tower and hous ing manufac turing process as well as the founda tion and mooring devices. Sandbe rg told Sal he believes the produc tion cost, including tower, could be twenty-five percent less than the average cost of current wind turbines of $1.0 milli on. Since the average cost of a wind turbine is $1.0 million, Sal was sure Sandbe rg had not built one to test his design. So he asked Sandberg if he was able to verify his energy extraction efficiency claims. Sandberg said he used outside contractors to build a mini-version of the blade- rotor configuration assembly. The results were exactly as he stated. Sal was convinced that Sandbe rg's technology was just what the wind energy indus try was waiting for\u2014a means to make the capture of wind energy more efficient and more cost- effective. Sal also was convinced that Sandbe rg's technol ogy could be the founda tion for the success of WindForce. He was pleased to see the Sandbe rg was excited about the WindForce venture being the means by which his innova tion could make a difference in the generation of sustainable energy. Sal's next step was to convince one other very important and influential person to join the WindForce venture's founding team. THE EURO PEAN CONNE CTION- CHRISTA HOFFMAN Christa Hoffman was a thirty-nine year old Senior Manager for the Strategic Planning Unit at one of Germany's largest electric utility service provider. Christa is also a senior member of EREC, the European Renewable Energy Council. EREC is the umbrella organization of the major European renewable energy indus try, trade and research associations active in the field of photovolta ics, small hydropow er, solar thermal, bioenergy, geothermal, solar thermal electricity and ocean energy. Sal had known Christa professionally for five years. As Europe generates almost twice as much wind power as all of the U.S. and is more receptive to the development of efficient wind energy, Sal saw it as a primary market for a WindForce product. With Christa part of the WindForce team, the venture would achieve instant credibility within Europe. She could open doors for the sale of WindForce turbines that otherwise would be very expensive, and maybe imposs ible, for a new, unknown company to open. Sal calle d her and asked if he could meet with her the next day to discuss an exciting professional oppor tunity for her. At their meeting Sal asked her to join the WindForce venture found ing team on a full- time basis. Without hesitation, Christa decline d. Then Sal show ed her Sandbe rg's patented turbine design. Christa had never seen anything like it. Retro two blades instead of three; flexible and made from a material she had never heard of and attache d by a coil design that looked like it came from a science fiction movie. She asked Sal if the design resulted in an impr ovement in wind energy extraction efficiency. Sal told her Sandberg had shown him the engineering design, the physics of the energy capture, and mathematical calculations on the turbine efficiency, all of which indicate that the design was feasible and that the efficiency of the turbine would be 48% rather than the current 35% achieved by the most efficient currently available turbines. Christa was shocked by the number. Even an improvement of two or three percentage points would have been big news in the indus try, but thirteen perce ntage points would be an indus try game-changer, if it were possible. When Sal told her about the cost reduction made Page 181 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 possible by the new design, Christa agreed to join the WindForce venture . Two weeks later, Sal, Christa, and Jo signed a founders' agreement and WindForce was launched. Sal brought $4 million to the venture, Christa brought $3 million, and Jo brought his patent. PRODUCT ION PLANNING The next four months were busy for Sal, Christa, and Jo. They agreed to the terms of the founder s' agreement (35%, 35%, 30% equity and $175K, $175K, $120K annual compensation, respective ly). During that time, Sal worked diligently on preparing for the launch of WindForce. He started the legal process of incorporating WindForce as a C-corporation with twenty milli on shares authorized and one milli on of those authorized shares issued to the founder s as a group and allocat ed according to their perce ntage ow nership. Each share will have a $0.01 par value. The group also decided to value Jo's patent (now WindForce' s patent since Jo gave ownership to the company in exchange for his WindForce equity ownership) at $3.5 milli on, the mid- way point between the cash investments of Sal ($4 milli on) and Jo ($3 million) . All admitte d that the patent value was subjective, but they reasoned that if the company is successful, the patent could easily be the reason for $3.5 million in cash flows to the company on a present value basis. Jo received his 20-year patent grant on October 1, 2012, so the first day of WindForce will mark the one year anniversary of the patent. The company was going to be debt free, at least for the first few years. The initial efforts of the foundi ng team were on two front s: business development and produc tion planning. Business development had progressed very well, with Christa gaining strong interest from European wind farms located in the United Kingdom, France, and Romania. Sal had concentrated on business development in the U.S. and had received interest from wind farms in Oregon, Washington, and Arizona. Sal and Christa believe that those wind farms will be placing orders for WindForce turbines. How ever, Sal and Christa know that the produc tion capacity of WindForce will be limite d by the cash available to start the company and fund opera tions (Esper , Ellinger, Stank, Flint, & Moon, 2010) . They do not want to promise delivery of turbines the company is unable to produc e due to the cash constraint. Therefore, to manage customer expectations, at least for the first two years of WindForce operations, Sal, Christa, and Jo decided to foreca st their produc tion capacity. In determining the production capaci ty for WindForce turbines for the first two years of production, the founde rs need to consider several different factors that impact that capacity (Alvarez & Barney, 2005; Umble, Haft, & Umble, initial produc tion capaci ty is constrained by the initial cash balance of $7 million (Sal's $4 million and Christa's $3 million ). An additiona l constraint is that the founder s have decided to maintain a minim um cash balance at all times of 5% of sales. Sal is also concer ned with the dynamics of cash flow as embodied in net cash build or net cash burn. He under stands that young companies usually bu rn through cash in their early years but the successf ul ones eventually turn that cash burn into cash build (Simi, Simi, & Svirevi, 2011 ). Page 182 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Net Cash Build (Burn) The calculation of net cash build or burn is in three parts. The first is the calculation of cash burn, the second is the calculation of cash build, and the third is the net of the first two calculations. Cash Build = Net Sales (Revenues) + Accrued Liabilitie s + Accounts Payables (1) Cash Burn = CGS (Variable/Direct Costs) + Accounts Receivable + Inventory + General & Administrative Expenses + Lease Rent + R&D Expenses + Interest + Prepaid Expenses + Lease Security Deposit + Gross Fixed Asse ts + Taxes (2) Net Cash Build (Burn) = Cash Build - Cash Burn (3) If Cash Build is greater than Cash Burn, there is Net Cash Build. If Cash Burn is greater than Cash Build, there is Net Cash Burn. The Average Net Cash Build (Burn) can be found by dividing Net Cash Build (Burn) by 12. Production Time Sal and Jo plan to have produc tion facilities and the labor force to be able to produc e and deliver on all orders one month after an order is received. If an order is too large to be filled in one month, Sal will work with the customer to segment the order so that production and delivery can take place over several months. Credit Terms An additiona l cash constraint is the restrictive credit terms imposed upon WindForce by customers and vendors. Customers pay nothing up front (0% in Month 1) and 50% on the first day of Month 2 (when delivery is made on the turbine order) and 50% on the first day of Month 3. WindForce makes full payment to vendors on the first day of the month (100% in Month 1). Price Markup Sal and Christa decided that WindForce shou ld price the WindForce turbines within the indus try average range of 20% -25%. Cost of Production and Capital Expenditures Equipment pu rchases will be made in two areas: produc tion and R&D. Each compone nt has its own cost, including compone nt cost and direct labor costs ($45 per hour including benefits), space requirement, produc tion manpow er days, and capita l expenditure requirement, as shown in Table 1 below. Research and development will have its own CapEx budg et of $100,000. Capital expenditure s for both produc tion and R&D are expected to increa se in the second year at the same rate as cost of goods sold increa ses and have an average depreciable life of ten years. Page 183 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Table 1 PRODUCTION Cos ts , CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND SPACE REDUCTION FROM SUBCONTRACTING Component [1] Component Costs per WindForce Wind Turbine ($000s ) [3] Direct Labor Allocation (Manpower Days ) per Turbine [4] Direct Labor Cost per Turbine [5] Total In- Hous e Cost per Turbine [6] Capital (Equipment) Expenditure Required for In- House Production [11] Reduction in Required Space if Component Production Subcontracted 00 8.00 $2,88 0 $84,880 $23,0 00 5.0% Yaw & 0 $5,04 0 $19,040 $45,0 00 $15,0 5.0% $30,0 10.0% Control, Safety s ys Condition $25,00 0 8.00 $2,88 0 $1,000, 000 100.0% In-House Production vs. Subcontracting The found ers discussed the pros and cons of subcontracting. They decided the pros of subcontracting are 1) reduction by 10% the direct cost of manufacturing a compone nt, 2) quick ramp-up of produc tion, 3) reduction of equipment capita l expenditure, 4) reduction of manufac turing space requirements and, therefore, lease-based cash outflow, and 5) subassembly done closer to the client wh ich reduces shipping costs for both WindForce and the customer. The cons are 1) design and utility features are revealed to the subcontractor, 2) potential schedulin g problems may occur, and 3) WindForce relinqui shes some degree of quality control (G\u00f6rg & Hanley, 2004; Oke & Onwuegbuzie, 2013)). Sal and Christa like the idea of subcontracting. How ever, Sal is concerned on three counts. First, he wants WindForce to be known as a manufacturing company and not one that only licens es out the technology for contract manufacturers to completely build the turbine. He believes that WindForce will have more value as a manufacturer. Second, he is concerned about others becomin g proficient in buildi ng Jo's design into the turbine manufac turing process. For that reason, he wants to keep in-house as much of the component manufacturing that relates to the proprietary design features that give the company a competitive advantage. Third,Page 184 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 manufac turing those critical compone nts in-house will provide a greater degree of qu ality control on the turbine produc t. Sal wants WindForce turbines to have the reputation of extremely high quality and reliability (Salimath, Cullen, & Umesh, 2008 ). Sal asked Jo which compone nts he believes are most critical to the functioning of his design. Jo replied that all the rotor compone nts as well as the shaft and bearings, the gearbox, the mechanical break, and the yaw drive and bearing are unique to the design and an integral part of the patent. The blades and tower are unique to the WindForce turbine, but there is nothing proprietary or secret about them. They differ from other turbines only because of the reduced stress on the turbine frame and tower made possible by the flex rotor design. All other compone nts are standard. The team has decided that due to the extensive space required to manufacture the turbine blades and towers and the resultant significant cost of leasing that space, the best solution would be to subcontract the manufac ture of those two compone nts. They still need to decide on which of the other components will be manufac ture in-house and which subcontracted. Operating Expenses Sal estimated that the opera ting expenses in the form of General & Administrative expenses will be $516,0 00 in the first year of operation and then doubl e in year two. Research and development expenses in year one are expected to be $60,000 and then triple in year two. Spac e Requirements The WindForce found ers will need to decide on the location of their manufac turing facility as well as the size of the facility. Sal plans to sign a four-year lease, but will base his estimates of the space requirements on the projected produc tion in Year 2 (Beatty, Liao, & Weber, 2010) .

Given these decisions, the found ers will be able to determine the total per unit turbine cost (including d irect labor), the capital expenditures required to supp ort in-house production, and the space savings from subcontracting. 2) Determine the production capacity of the company for the first two years of operation by making the two- year forecast of monthly sales and production subject to the cash constraints of the company. Corollary to that decision is the inventory decision resulting from greater production than sales on a monthly bas is (Protopappa -Sieke & Seifert, 2010). Page 186 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 3) Decide on the location of the manufacturing facility, given the parameters set by the found ing group (four-year lease, B+ or better building grade). Given this decision, the found ers will be able to determine the cash outflow for the first two years of opera tion. 4) Calculate the average net cash build (burn) of the company for the first two years of operation. 5) Determine the overall monthly and annual production capacity of WindForce over the next two years.

Page 187 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 DINNE R OR NO DINNER: A STUDENT LEADERSHIP DECISION CAS E DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case concerns leadership, governance and the roles of board members and individual and institutional reputation. Secondary issues examined include stakeholder analysis; conflict manag ement; and decision analysis by the student leaders. The case has a difficulty level of two through five. The case is designed to be taught in 45-75 minutes and is expected to require 30-45 minutes of outside preparation by students. CAS E SYNOPSIS This case portrays the mismatch between the requirements and expectations of a leadership position and the capab ilities of the elected student leader to fulfill the role. The emotional tension that arises when peers don't measure up to expectations or organizational requirements leads to conflict and in this case the confli cts are acute requiring action to protect and enhanc e the reputations of individuals and a university school of manag ement. The case drama tizes the challenges and choices of the organ ization' s executive leadership board to intervene prod uctively to change the situation, including removing the board president, and still achieve a positive outcome for a high profile event annua lly hosted by the organ ization for the entire university commu nity. The stakes are high in this case because the student organi zation, a business fraternity, has unde rtaken an annua lly recurr ing, highly pu blic event that carries reputation risk for the fraternity, the school of manag ement that hosts the group and the alumni affairs function of the university. The case is a real-time drama of students evaluating a sensitive situation, seeking advice from their chapter faculty adviser, whose rol e is to facilitate and mentor the organ ization, devel oping options for action, and through Socratic questioning helped them select and implement a preferred option. The case offers students an oppor tunity to project themselves into situations common to student-led organ izations that carry similarities to organi zational leadership challenges in the professional world. INTRODUCTION Claire Burns and Spencer Heddins walked out of the room angry and frustrated. As seniors, both of them were establish ed leaders on the University campus and in the School of Management and both were long-standing members of the School 's business fraternity. They had just left the executi ve board meeting in which the fraternity president, Joseph Strawn, had criticized everyone collectively and individually for lack of action on a major, upcoming event, Dinner with the Indus try, an annua l signature event of the business fraternity. While both knew there were problems regarding the event, they were taken aback by the President lashing out at the other fraternity leaders. Not only was it not helpful but they thought Strawn w as as much the Page 188 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 problem as anything else. But what shou ld they do about it? It was the fall semester and the president had been elected in the prior semester. He had raised some concerns then about his interpersonal style and last-minut e decision making pattern. BACKGROUND The co-education al, nationally affiliated business fraternity, chartered at the School of Management for ten years, had grown to an active membership of approximately 60 unde rgraduate students. As top students of the School, they represented all majors and concent rations in the business field. They engaged a wide range of professional events that they scheduled for the members' professional readiness and leader ship experience. The focus on leader ship aligned very well with the School of Management's overarching theme, \"Learn, Lead and Serve.\" The fraternity frequently acted as the arms and legs of several of the School of Management's annua l, signature programs such as Leadership and Ethics Day in the spring, an event that the Dean of the School of Management hos ted on behalf of the University. The fraternity members acted as ambassadors, hosts and guides of the business leader s who came to campus to discuss current issues with students in the students' classes for the day. The fraternity executive board of eleven annua lly elected members was the guidance system for the fraternity's activities during the year. The board developed a strategic plan, presented it to the chapter, and managed its execution throughout the school year. Rush, professional events, faculty relations, alumni affairs, the nationa l chapter of excelle nce competition, and a dinner for indus try professionals were among the major annua l events of the organization. The structure of the executive board is depicted in Figure 1, with the principal student leader s identified in the boxes. Figure 1. Business Fraternity Executive Board Structure Page 189 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Strawn's leadership had created conflict in the past largely due to a combative style in which every detail had the potential to be an issue, regardless of its impor tance. In a number of encounters over the previous year, he had taken on members of the executive bo ard over issues that resulted in bad feelings and little resolution of the issue on the table. He was well-spoken and had the image of being \"in-charge\" and assertive. At the same time, he maintained very close control over all of the information and expectations of the members, controlled communi cation left those respons ible for the event in the dark. He had a noticeabl e habit of procrastination and last minut e decision making that irritated many of his peers. In the fall, an impor tant annua l event that the fraternity organized and hosted was Dinner with the Indus try. DINN ER WITH THE INDU STRY Dinner with the Indus try had grown in its five-year life to a level of significant participation: an average of 50 communi ty-based bus inesses and over 200 students from across the campus attended a dinner to meet and talk informally with principals in fields and businesses that the students felt they might be interested in pursuing professionally. The dinner had become a major event on campus that garnered significant allocation of funding support from the campus student activitie s board and had the suppo rt of influential alumni of the University. One alumnus, who was a well-known indus try leader in the communi ty and leader of a newly formed University alumni organization, w rote to the student organizer after the previous year's event, \"Congratulations on a very successf ul event. Thanks for inviting me to participate.\" In addition to his leader ship role in business, his role as president of the University A lumni Leadership Counc il made his note a particular compliment to the student organizers and the School and University leadership. \"We shou ld get the Leadership Counc il involved,\" he concluded. This impre ssed the vice president of advancem ent for the University and helped solidify the reputation of the student organization with the University and School of Management leadership. The response of the leadership counc il president reflected the broad sentiment among the business communi ty leadership. The response of the communi ty's business leader s was the hope of the dinner organizers and the School of Management, whose leadership actively supp orted the students in promoting the event. The Dean comm ented, \"The event is totally student driven from invita tions, to arrangements, to program; it is an end-to-end student project.\" And, the Dean s aw the event as a learning laboratory for leadership. Under the supervision of a management professor, John White, the fraternity's faculty adviser, and with the assistance of the University's Career Services department and other resources that the students secure d, the event carried the \"brand\" of the School of Management and provided an excelle nt real-time experiential learning and leadership environment. \"This is quite real for the students. The leadership in planning, programmin g, the emotions, pressure, tension of performance and execution ar e all on display. This is real and it is a delicate, sensitive leader ship learning experience,\" the Dean of the School of Management stated. The Dinner had grown in prestige and visibility campus-wide and a lot was riding on its execution. Page 190 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 EXECUT IVE MEET ING POSTMORTEM Follow ing the meetin g of the fraternity's executive board, Heddins and Burns walked toward the stairway leading to the foyer of the School of Management. \"Can you believe Joe's attitude! \" Burns said as they headed downs tairs. \"He just doesn't see the conflict and how frozen we all are. No one really knows who is doing what! Now, no one wants to act because nobod y wants to step on anyone else's toes.\" \"You can't forget that Joe has got the broad support of the fraternity, but the executive board is losing patience. There's the willingness to help, but he i s alienating everyone,\" Heddins said. \"The spoke bluntly about Strawn's approach, \"He's got blinder s on and is so bull heade d. He just wants it his way. Nick [Jonas] has all of the capabilities to make the Dinner with the Indus try work, but Joe just gets in the way. And, he is so abrupt with everyone.\" Heddins and Burns both acknowl edged that Nick was not only well regarded in the fraternity but also in the School of Management and the whole campus. \"That's not the only thing either,\" Burns added. \"There's that total train wreck that occur red at Harvesters when they didn't even know we were coming earlier this year. Joe was suppos ed to coordinate that. And, remember the pledge voting process? It was totally screwed up.\" \"And, we've got electio ns coming up and I'll bet that Joe wants to stand for re-election. It won 't go so well for him, if the Dinner doesn't work,\" Burns added. Burns asked Heddins if he had time to talk for a few minut es about the situation with Joe. \"Do you think that there is anyone on the exec board who can s tand up to Joe? He isn't that close to anyone on the board this year like it was last year when there were some close personal ties,\" Burns said. \"We need a way to get Joe to back off and let Nick do his job, so Joe can concent rate on the other important stuff, like recruiting and professional events.\" \"There's also falling morale,\" Heddins added. \"I don't want us to gang up on him, but we have to bring this out in the open. The Dinner is six weeks away and we need to get going on the plans while we're planning for spring rush and the professional events. Maybe we're doing too much? \" \"We've basically got three things going on, don't we?\" Burns said. \"The dinner, the professional events on the calendar and planning for rush.\" \"And overall morale: I think confidence of the executive board and the fraternity is on the line, ultima tely. It's our reputation,\" Heddins added. What if we calle d Professor White and talked with him about the problem. I mean he might have some ideas,\" Burns speculated. \"He may have some ideas,\" Heddins said. \"I agree, let's call him. Maybe he can meet with us now.\" The phone rang in the office and Professor White answered to hear an urgent tone in Heddins voice with a request to talk. As the faculty adviser to the fraternity, he was aware of the tension around the dinner event. White s aid that he was free now and to come up. \"What's the issue,\" White asked before he hung up? Page 191 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 \"Kind of chaos in the leadership group,\" Heddins said. \"And, it is affec ting meetin g the deadline for Dinner with the Indus try and a bunch of other stuff. I'd like for Claire Burns to come also.\" \"That's fine,\" White said. \"See you in a while.\" Page 192 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Page 193 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 SPRINKLES CUPCAKES : A CASE STUDY OF CREATING A SUCCES SFUL INTERNATIONALIZATION STRATEGY Dennis C. Chen , Belmont University Jeff Overby , Belmont University Barry L. Padgett, Belmont Universi ty Neda Long, Belmont University Lauren Hills Mellott, Belmont Un iversity Lauren Vandermark, Belmont University Nickolette Kennedy, Belmont University Leah Boone, Belmont University CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case concerns developing an internationalization strategy for a growing business, S prinkles Cupcakes. The business owners, Candace and Charles Nelson have grown their business from one store in 2005 to 17 stores in the US and 1 in the Middle East under a licensing agreement. Their innovations include using the highest quality ingredien ts (e.g. sweet cream butter, bittersweet Belgian chocolate, pure Madagascar vanilla, fresh bananas, carrot s, real strawberries, and natural citrus zests) baked fresh daily in small batches , and the creation of a 24 -hour cupcake ATM machine. Questions that students should consider include how should Sprinkles continue to grow their business? What type s of internationalization strategy could they consider ? Should they focus on domestic growth first? Which countries could they target for growth? What chan ges if any could/ should they make to their business/product when they expand internationally? What consider ations should they take into account if licensing or entering wholly owned operations when expanding internationally? The case has a difficulty le vel appropriate for a junior or senior level course, although it may be used at a first -year graduate level, depending on the amount and complexity of the background information that is assigned. The case requires one hour (if the goal is class discussion only) to three hours (if the instructor's goals involve presentations by individuals or teams of students). This is relevant topic to students studying international business and how to successfully create and implement an internationalization strategy. Page 194 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 CASE SYNOPSIS Everyone loves a good cupcake. Sprinkles Cupcake owners, Candace an d Charles Nelson, have created over 20 delicious cupcake recipes. They have grown their business from one store in 2005 to 17 stores in the US and 1 in the Middle East under a franchising agreement . Now they need to consider an internationalization strategy to continue to grow their business. This case raises several internationalization strategy questions. How do they develop an internationalization strategy? How d oes an internationalization strategy differ from their corporate strategy? Should they continue to expand internationally or instead focus on growth domestically? If they do decide to continue international expansion, what countries should they target fi rst and why? Finally, how should they expand internationally, by franchising or by wholly owned subsidiaries? The Birth and Growth of the Sprinkles' Cupcake During a visit in 2002 to New York City, Candace Nelson, and her husband Charles Nelson, tri ed the cupcakes at a well -known bakery . As Candace explained, \"I get the cupcake thing - cupcakes are awesome, but the cupcakes aren't that great.\" Candace believed that it was \"time for cupcakes to stop being the backup dancer to cakes,\" and that cupcakes \"could taste so much better.\" Candace and Charles took it upon themselves to create a better cupcake, and over the next two years, the couple developed over 20 cupcake recipes. (Cava, 2007) The decision to start a cupcake bakery was a high -risk venture; especially since the bakery business was in a four -year decline in the U.S . Despite the odds, the Nelsons pursued their dream. In April 2005, the Nelsons opened the first Sprinkles store on Little Santa Monica Boulevard, in Beverly Hills , California . On t heir first day of operation, the cupcakes sold out in just one hour, and in the first week, the Nelsons sold over 2,000 cupcakes. Based on this success, the Nelsons quickly decided to open more stores. (Davidow, 2007) The Nelsons wanted their stores to r eflect a sophisticated image, so they sought out an architect from Vienna to design Sprinkles' \"sleek, minimalistic\" storefronts. The company's modern theme is carried through to its logo and packaging, which w ere created by a former Martha Stewart employe e (see Exhibit A). In fact, the company's cupcakes are most recognizable by their traditional \"modern dot\" topping. Candace Nelson hand -crafted her cupcake recipes by using the highest quality ingredients including sweet cream butter, bittersweet Belgian c hocolate, pure Madagascar vanilla, fresh bananas, carrots, real strawberries and natural citrus zests. All of the cupcakes are baked fresh daily, in small batches, and contain no preservatives, trans fats or artificial flavors. Sprinkles has a \"sophisticat ed\" take on the classic cupcake and even sells specialty offerings like vegan and gluten -free cupcakes and dog-food cupcakes. Sprinkles is credited with being the world's first exclusive cupcake bakery by The Food Network and as \"the progen itor of the haute cupcake craze \" by the Los Angeles Times . Sprinkles' business concept is often wh ere many cupcake entrepreneurs take their inspiration. Page 195 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Since 2005 , the Nelsons have expanded their cupcake business into twelve U.S. locations . In 2011, the company entered into a franchise agreement with M.H. Alshaya Co. - the same company that has helpe d brands like Cheesecake Factory and Starbucks expand internationally - to help them expand into the Middle East. Sprinkles ' first international store opened in Kuwait City in December 2012. In the coming years, the company plans to open stores in 15 more cities, including London and Tokyo. (Craig, 2013) More than One Way to Eat a Cupcake: Current Products As of 2013, there are four options for customers to purchase these high -end cupcakes: the traditional retail storefront in 12 locations, a mobile cupca ke truck, a cupcake vending machine, and cupcake mix sold online and in stores. In the retail cupcake stores, flavors are rotate d throughout different days of the week, along with seasonal offerings . Sprinkles cupcakes are a premium product, w ith single cupcakes priced at $3. 75 and a dozen priced at $42. Stores are located mainly on the West coast: Beverly Hills, Los Angeles (2), Newport Beach, Palo Alto, and La Jolla. Other branches are in Chicago, Dallas, Hous ton, Scottsdale, New York City, and Was hington, D.C . The interior of the store has been fashioned as a \"bar\" setting. The store is set up to \"[evoke] the memory of European bakeries flooded with the smell of baked goods and awash in natural light.\" (www.sprinkles.com/about/design) Patrons ar e encouraged to sit and stay in the store to enjoy their cupcakes. About 1,500 cupcakes are sold in every retail store every day. Sprinkles has a mobile cupcake truck in California, known as the Sprinklesmobile. The company uses social media, such as Tw itter, to let customers know where the truck is located for the day. It is set up in high traffic areas and at public events and festivals around Los Angeles. The truck only stays in each location for four or five hours at a time. The Sprinklesmobile ca n be rented for private events. L.A. is currently the only city with the cupcake food truck. In keeping with the trend of bringing the product to the customer, t he newest inception is the \"cupcake ATM.\" It is basically a vending machine for \"cupcakes on the go.\" The first one was located outside of the original retail store in Beverly Hills. A second cupcake ATM opened up in downtown Chicago in 2012 . Each vending machine is restocked nightly with a variety of flavors to keep the offerings fresh and is open 24 hours. This new idea sells around 800 to 1,000 cupcakes a day (per locale) and has received very positive fanfare from customers. Finally, consumers can enjoy Sprinkles at any time by purchasing the cupcake mix , sold on shelves and online. T he mix is presently distributed exclusively through Williams - Sonoma. It is packaged in sixteen ounce containers priced at $14.95. A set of two is sold at $19.95. Each container will make 12 cupcakes. The mixes are made up of the same high quality ingre dients used to bake the cupcakes in retail cupcake stores and are offered in Page 196 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 limited flavors of dark chocolate, red velvet, vanilla, and lemon. These different means of product distribution allows Sprinkles to conveniently reach a wide range of customers. International Growth: Dealing with Obstacles After finding great success with their first store in the heart of Hollywood, Sprinkles Cupcakes was approached by leading franchise operator M.H. Alshaya . M.H. Alshaya had helped franchise household names such as Starbucks, American Eagle Outfitters, Victoria's Secret, Cheesecake Factory, and Pinkberry. With the help of their new partner, Sprinkles began to look overseas for potential growth opportunities. Charles Nelson saw the potential in the Middle East as a growth economy. He also noted an emergent affinity in the Middle East for goods from the Americas, particularly among the younger generation. As a result, Sprinkles and M.H. Alshaya decided to open their first international cupcake store in Kuw ait. When the store opened its doors in December of 2012, it would only be the first in a plan to open an additional 34 stores in the Middle East. Although areas of the Middle East may seem risky for new business ventures, Sprinkles took into account a solid market analysis and cultural norms before moving forward with the expansion into the Middle East. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , the Middle East economy was expected to grow at 3.6% during 2013 , a good deal higher than the 2.6% fo recasted growth for the United States . Sprinkles international market expansion has not been without obstacles and modifications to its products and services . Many of the early issues stemmed from cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East. For instance, alcohol is forbidden by Islam and is illegal in several Middle East ern countries . Therefore a substitute for vanilla extract (which contains alcohol) had to be found. Sprinkles also faced difficulties when trying to import ingr edients such as butter for its Kuwait operation . Countries in the Middle East can often take up to three weeks to approve such imports because of various administrative barriers and red tape or simply wanting to ensure the integrity of the supply chain . Sprinkles also altered their cupcake offerings to include custom items that symbolize d local holidays and monuments. With an additional investment from KarpReilly LLC , a private investment firm, in January 2013, Sprinkles will forge towards additional pro duct offerings and growth. This in addition to the product offerings of the Sprinkles \"automated\" cupcake ATM, Sprinkles Ice Cream and the mobile Sprinkles food truck. Sprinkles Cupcakes has immense opportunities ahead of them but they will need to balan ce globalization with maintaining their small cupcake store roots. The Future: Goals for Growth Sprinkles Cupcakes has several goals on the horizon as they look for different ways to expand their business. With the success of their franchise agreement with M.H. Alshaya Co., Sprinkles Cupcakes has plans to have thirty -four new locations spread across Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Page 197 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 Emirates (Urban). However, one major question is whether t hey should capitalize on their Middle East growth and seek more franchise agreements in the area or in other parts of the world. Another potential avenue is to expand on the success of the Sprinkles Cupcakes baking mix and pursue a larger distribution ne twork in conjunction with or beyond William Sonoma. Williams Sonoma, also partnering with M.H. Alshaya Co., began their international expansion in 2010 with locations in Dubai and Kuwait and currently ships to over 75 countries. There are obvious synergi es that these companies could exploit . Sprinkles could also pursue distribution agreements with other specialty food stores or larger food chains such as Whole Foods. Sprinkles c ould also pursue other opportunities to deploy their Sprinklesmobile and /or their vending machine domestically or internationally. Remaining innovative is critical to continued growth in a more and more saturated cupcake market. Lastly, Sprinkles could begin to diversify their product offering internationally . For example, i nstead of just selling cupcakes, they have begun to sell ice cream domestically . This broadens their customer base and is an easy item to sell within their current store format as well as to grocery stores. Their first ice cream store opened in Beverly Hil ls, California , next door to their existing cupcake store. Sprinkles Cupcakes plans to open more ice cream stores in Newport Beach , California and Dallas, Texas. Not only is this another way to grow their sales, but the additional products will also help to increase brand recognition and drive more sales for their existing cupcake business. Success with the ice cream product does not necessarily translate to a successful product internationally, so Sprinkles will need to determine what will work in their international target markets . The Nelsons have a lot to consider. Should they pursue an internationalization strategy, and if so, how do they develop such a strategy? How would an internationalization strategy differ from their corporate strategy? Sho uld they continue to expand internationally or instead focus on growth domestically? If they do decide to continue international expansion, what countries should they target first and why? Finally, how should they expand internationally, by licensing and franchising or by wholly owned subsidiaries?

Page 205 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 HYUNDAI CARD COMPANY: STRATEGIC CHALLENGES IN CHANGING ENVIRONMENT Boram Han, Ewha Ewha Womans University* CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case concerns differentiation strategy of Hyundai Card as a late entrance. Secondary issues examine include strategic challenges in changing environment. The case has a difficulty level of two, appropriate for sophomore l evel. The case is designed to be taught in 2 hours and it expected require 2 hours of outside preparation by students. CASE SYNOPSIS This case study examined Korean credit card industry, focusing on the case of Hyundai Card Company. Even though Hyundai C ard entered lately into the credit card industry, it rapidly grew . Furthermore, under th e hostile condition of overall credit card market , CEO Tae -young Chung took in charge of Hyundai Card and made its' successful restructuring. Hyundai Card differentiat ed its services from other competitors by providing different card services based on customer's life style. Based on segmentation Hyundai Card provided the 'alphabet series cards'. For example, 'M' card stands for 'Motor' which provides the benefit related to automobiles. Chung directed Hyundai Card to be a design -oriented company. This innovative design brought a great attention from the public. Moreover, as Hyundai Card focused on differentiation, Hyundai Card implemented aggressive marketing by organizin g cultural events. Also, in 2005, Hyundai Card formed a joint venture with GE Capital. By forming this strategic partnership with GE Capital, Hyundai Card raised its capital and obtained GE' s advanced risk management and credit management know -how. To emphasize the efficiency of its operation, Chung implement ed new human resource practices. To keep Hyundai Card' s innovativeness, he developed organizational culture that emphasizes talents, diversity, open communication, and effective decision -making process. However, in 2012, the Korean government announced the Credit Card Market Structure Improvement Plan, which limits the growth of credit card industry. Moreover, to deter customer's excessive consumption, Korean government encourages the usage of debit card instead of credit cards. In addition, intense competition and imitation of competitors deteriorate Hyundai Card' s growth. As the overall market size has been shrunken, t he industry members' competition is getting intense. While Hyundai Card' s cultural event and market segmentation succeed in Page 206 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 grasping customer's attention, competitors imitate its' strengths. By facing these challenges, Hyundai Card should proactively respo nd to them and find ways for its future growth. INTRODUCTION In 1995, Diners Club Korea Co., Ltd, the predecessor of the Hyundai Card Company , was started its business. In 2001, the Diners C lub Korea was sold to Hyundai Capita l, a business group member of Hyundai Motors Company , which is one of the largest Korean Chaebol s. It changed its name to Hyundai Card in 2001. In 2011, Hyundai Motor Group and its affili ates owned 53.98% of the Hyundai Card 's outstanding share s while GE Capital owned 43% of its shares. In the 2000s, Hyundai Card achieved significant success by introducing innovative card services such as Hyundai Card M, the Black, the Purple , and the Red. Hyundai Card consecutively received the prestigious \"Korea's Most Respected Company\" honor from the Korea Association of Management Consultants and ranked number one in the credit card category in the National Customer Satisfaction Index (Doosanpedia, 2014). When Hyundai Card entered the credit card market in 2002, Hyundai Card recorded huge deficit s of KRW 145 billion (USD 140 million ). In 2002, t he credit card crisis in Korea occurred and LG Card, which was the largest credit card company in Korea, wen t bankruptcy . Under these difficult external environments, Tae -young Chung took in charge of Hyundai Card. He brought new strategic actions to transform Hyundai Card. Hyundai Card' s strategic t urnaround is based on reshaping its brand image and targeting high income earners (Newsis, 2004). Before joining to Hyundai C ard, C hung was the execu tive director of Hyundai Motor Company . He was sent to Hyundai Card for its restructuring . He was a passionate and innovative leader to challenge all existing paradigms of the card industry and he built the organizational culture of Hyundai C ard that emphasize s innovation and creativity . Hyundai Card offers a wide range of credit services including Premium, Plati num, Alphabet, My Business Card, and Diners/c heck debit cards (Hyundai C ard Corporation , 2014 ). Table 1 gives the feature of the Hyundai Card products and brief descriptions. Before Hyundai Card 's customized services, existing credit card services used to provide services for customers without considering what benefit s customer really want . They consider o ther service benefit s from credit card usage as its supplementary function. As a result, customers never use many of the benefits. In contrast, Hyundai Card put the benefit s from its card usage as the core services of credit card. They considered which ben efits might be the most useful to customers and designed card services based on the needs of the customers . For instance, its flagship credit card is Hyundai Card M , which provides $ 2,000 discount for cardholders who purchase Hyundai or KIA cars (Financia l News, 2013) . In 2005, Hyundai Card also launched 'The Black Card' that was the first premium credit card service in Korea that t arget s people in the top 0.05% of personal income. As a result, Hyundai Card became the second -largest credit -card service company in Korea (Woo, 2013). Hyundai Card expand ed its market shar e from 1% to more than 16% in ten years, and increas ed its brand recognition from 69% in 2007 to 88.1% in 2011. Page 207 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 TABLE 1. HYUNDAI CARD PRODUCTS Card name Card feature Key Services Hyund Card M M stands for Multiple. Providing multiple functions and benefits in every situation where consumers are in need of using credit card. Hyundai Card M2 M 2 is a premium version for Hyundai Card M. It pr ovides upgraded benefits of Hyundai Card M. Black Card The most premium card of Hyundai Card. It targets CEO and opinion leaders in the society. A Card A stands for Asiana airline. It provides benefits related to Asiana airline. O Card O stands for Oil. It provides benefits related to oil and cars. However, recently its return on assets has been decreased from 3% in 2010 to 1.7% in 2012 compared to the industry average of 2.6 %. Furthermore, recent regulatory changes have put challenges for Hyundai Card. At the New Year celebration in 2013 Tae-young Chung, CEO of Hyundai Card expressed his concerns for the entire card Industry. Chung also emphasized Hyundai Card 's innovative DNA and he asked all employees that Hyundai Card shou ld stay away from complacency and should react to the c hallenges instantly : 2013' s given business condition would be the worst case for the card industry. This year could not be easy for Hyundai Card. Because of increasing rate of interest, increasing purchasing cost and family debt, it is hard for us to increase revenues . In this harsh situation, government Page 208 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 reinforced regulation on card companies and competitors straightened up their line of battle. Just simply pursuing existing organizational effectivene ss could hardly be the best strategy . If we get settled with the past victory, inevitably it could precipitate a crisis. We need another breakthrough to make us overcome a rough time. CARD INDUSTRY EVOLUT ION IN KOREA Credit cards allow customers to buy products without cash. When people purchase any products or services with the use of credit card, credit c ard compa nies make payment to card affiliated stores for their members. Credit card firms enroll card members and affiliated stores and establish its credit card network. T hey collect annual fees from the members and transaction fees from the affiliated stores based on the credit transaction amount s. TABLE 2 . THE GROWTH OF CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY (1998 - 2012) Transaction volume (Trill ion, KRW) Number of credit card issued (10 thousand, KRW) Number of affiliated store 2012 553 116,3 8 12,923 <Source: Financial services commission report > The credit card industry in Korea began as a form of membership cards issued by major department stores in 1969. T he credit card industry grew rapidly since 1997 when Korea underwent the Asian financial crisis. Korean government that wa nted to stimulate its economy by increasing people's expenditure supported the growth of credit card industry . In 2010, the number of issued credit card s was 2.8 times of the number of credit card issued in 1998. The credit transaction volumes were also increased by approximately 13.4 times compared to ones in 1996. To increase market shares , Korean credit card companies relentlessly issued credit cards Page 209 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 without thorough inspection of customer 's income and credit history . It resulted in credit card crisis in 2003. In 2003, the number of people with bad credit reached to 2.39 million. Due to credit card crisis, LG Card, one of the major credit card companies in Korea went bankruptcy. (Maeil Economy, 2004) Although Credit Card Crisis slowed down the credit ca rd industry growth, credit cards became the most common payment way in Korea. The average number of credit cards per economically active person was 0.6 in 1990 and increased to 4.7 in 2010. The proportion of credit card usage for payment was 10% in 1990, a nd it jumped to 40.6% in 2003, dropped to 38.4% in 2004 due to the credit card crisis, and increased to 57.0% in 2010. Table 2 and Figure 5 show the Korean credit card industry's growth in terms of transaction volume s, number of issued credit card s, and number of affiliated stores in Korea. Figure 5. Average net profit of Korean credit card companies (KRW trillion) Sourc e: the Korea Development Institution However, the market growth is currently stagnant due to the prolonged economic recession and the high credit card penetration rate in Korea. Korea's credit card penetration rate is up to 71.4% in 2012, which is exceptionally high compared to other developed countries such as the United States' 35.6% and the Britain's 49.5%. The high penetrati on rate limits the future growth of the credit card industry in Korea (The Credit Finance Association, 2013). MAJOR COMPETITORS Table 4 categorizes Korean Credit Card Companies into two types: bank -controlled credit card issuers and non -bank -controlled c redit card issuers. The bank -controlled credit cards are issued by commercial banks. Due to banks ' wide assessment to the public through its branches and its capacity to raise large capital, bank credit card companies have increased the number of their members and affiliated stores. Bank - controlled credi t card firms heavily rely on their local branches as distribution channels for their credit card services. The non -bank controlled credit card firms can be classified into two categories: corporate and distribution credit card firms. Corporate credit card companies include Hyundai Car d, Samsung Card, and Lotte Card that is a part of large Korean conglomerate firms (Chaebols). These card firms collaborate with other 0123 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012Net profit minus one-time factors Net profitPage 210 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 companies , which belong to the same bu siness group to provide specialized services for customers . Distribution card companies issue their credit card as the means to promote their products such as department store card s and clothing store card s. Table 4.

The Figure 6 shows the market shares of major seven credit card companies in 2013. Korean credit card industry is at the maturity stage and competition among credit card firms intensifies . Credit card companies in Korea try to attract new members by competitively providing excessive benefits for them such as providing airline mileage points, discount services, interest -free installment service, and annual fee exemption. Figure 5 shows the decrease of net profit of the credit card companies over time. Figure 6 . Market shares of credit card companies in the first quarter of 2013 <Source: The Credit Finance Association > KB Card Company, Shinhan Card Company, and Samsung Card Company are the major competitors of Hyundai Card. Each companies shows distinctive characteristic of non -bank credit card firms and bank -controlled firms. Moreover, these three companies take more than 50% of credit card market share in WooriPage 211 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 KB Card Company In 1980, Kookmin Bank started its credit card business. In 1987, KB Credit Card was established. In 2013, KB Card 's market share reached 14.6%, as the second largest credit card firm. In 2013, the total amount of its credit card usage is KRW 68 trillion (USD 66.3bi llion). 34% of KB card users used KB card for more than 10 years. It shows KB C ard has high customer loyalty. KB card products can be classified in terms of leisure card, flight card, entertainment card, and platinum card. In 2013, KB Card Company launched 'Hunminjeongeum Card series ' based on four types of life style. KB Card official says that \"By launching Hyunminjeongeum card series, KB card will shape and construct product lines that covers various life styles of our credit card customers, debit card u sers, and VIP customers. We are expecting to meet the various customer 's need by securing various lines of credit card.\" (Consumernews Daily 2013 ) Shinhan Card Company In 1978, Korean Express started credit card services and it changed its name to LG cred it Card in 1988. In 2007, LG Credit Card Company is ac quired by Shinhan Finance Group and changed its trade name as Shinhan Card (Doopedia, 2014). Shinhan Card Company has KRW 17 trillion (USD 16.6 billion ) in asset and about 22 million members . As the largest credit card company in Korea, Shinhan Card took 18th position in terms of credit transaction amount in the global credit market. Shinhan Card was selected as the No.1 company in Korean service quality index. Moreover, for the third consecu tive years, Shinhan Card won the grand prize in customer satisfaction and brand value. Shinhan C ard also received the highest credit rating among Korean credit card companies. Shinhan Card 's vision is to become the world class financial group and its core value includes customer -oriented, mutual respect, leading change, aiming at best, and master mind spirit. As it has more than 22 million card members, Shinhan C ard started to analyze the consumer 's consumption pattern s. Shinhan Card introduces the 'Comb o service ' that provides discount benefits on items which clients frequently purchase based on the analysis of card members ' past consumption records. Samsung Card Company Samsung Group acquired Sejong Credit Card in 1988 and started credit card services under the name of Samsung Card. Samsung Card was merged with Samsung Capital in 2005. Samsun g Electronics and Samsung Life Insurance are Samsung Card 's major shareholders . Samsung Card takes the third position in the Korean credit card industry due to its high level of customer awareness and its marketing power. In 2013 , Samsung Card's market share was 12.2% . Samsung Card launched 'S Class Card' that took advantage of support from other Samsung firms . For instance, it gives additional discounts when the cu stomer purchases Samsung Electronics products. Samsung Card assigns specific numbers to each card . Samsung Card released total 7 number cards until 2013. Since its release, Samsung Card number series attracted more than two million new card users. Page 212 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 The fir m is striving to achieve its vision , \"The best service company for the customer \". The strength of Samsung Card is their unique product s and service s. Samsung Card provides more extensive benefits for its customer than other credit card companies. For instance, Samsung Card provides wedding service and accommodation benefits in Jeju Island , Korea. These differentiated services enable Samsung Card to win a prize in customer satisfaction for consecutive five years. SUCCESSFUL F ACTORS OF HYUNDAI CA RD Market Segmentation Hyundai Card has been an innovator in the credit card industry by continuously introducing differentiated and customized services to customers . Hyundai C ard first adopted brand portfolio s in the Korean card industry. Before the introductio n of 'Hyundai Card M ', there is no idea of classified product s in the Korean credit card industry. Credit card services used to be categorized into regular or premium service based on the credit limit. Hyundai card provides different card services and benefits based on the life styles and consumption patterns of cardholders. M Card released in 2003 and M stood for Motors . Hyundai M C ard was specialized for all car expenditures such as purchasing and maintaining cars . Hyundai Card changed its name to Hyundai Card M later. Following to its change, M does no longer mean m otors and it extends its meaning to multiple life areas that p roviding multiple benefits for its customers. M card achieved a great success and it became one of the most desirable cred it cards in Korea . Hyundai Card issued more than one million M cards and its customer usage rate was 71% while average card usage rate is about 30 % to 40% (Korean Economics, 2002). After M card 's success , Hyundai Card release d alphabet card series. Hyunda i Card divide d customer into 26 categories in terms of their life style s and different alphabets stands for different life styles . For instance , W (weekend) card is specialized for the leisure and travel. U (university) card target s university students . A (Asiana airlines ) card s and K (Korean airline s) card s focus on the customer s who want to obtain flight mileage from their credit card consumptions . Because of differentiated card segmentation Hyundai Card obtains a unique brand identity. Figure 1 describes how brand identity influences the perception of credit card service quality among consumers . If credit card s have strong brand identity, customer would give a high credit to the credit card service.

CEO Chung Tae-young direct ed Hyundai Card to be a design -oriented company . For instance, i n 2003, M card launched its transparent card design (see Figure 2). This simple and novel card design brought a great attention from customers. In 2005, Hyundai Card hired Karim Rashid, a world-famous industrial designer. Hyundai Card produced new design for its Page 214 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 premium card s with Karim Rashid . For instance, to highlight its premium image, Black Cards use handmade plates and sophisticated technique called 'metal implant . It is designed to make cardholders feel a sense of pride (The Korean Herald , 2007) . Figure 3 shows that Hyundai C ard keeps consistency in its card design .

Since 2004 GE had invested a billion dollar to Hyundai Card and this business became one of the most profitable business in GE 's business field. (Business Week, 2009) Leadership of Taeyoung Chung Taeyoung Chung was promoted as Hyundai Card 's CEO in 2003. Since then, Hyundai Card went through dramatic changes and became an icon of innovation . Chung is well known for his passionate and cha rismatic leadership. Under the supervision and leadership of Chung , Hyundai Card has developed organizational culture that emphasizes talents , diversity, open communication , and effective Page 216 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 decision making process. For instance, in 2007, 'Career Market ' and 'Upward Appraisal System ', designed by Chung , represents Hyundai Card 's novelty and i ts passion for inno vation . 'Career Market ' enables employees of Hyundai Cards to flexibly change their jobs across team s or departments . This system is operated in its intranet and consists of two menus: open career zone s and job posting zone s. In open car eer zone s, employees can apply to vacant job s in other divisions or teams. In the job posting zone s, managers post open positions in their teams and department s. Career Market provides opportunity for their employees to experience diverse tasks and design their own career development plan . In 'Upward Appraisal System ', employees evaluate the performance of their managers and leaders . It motivates managers and team leaders to improve continuously their skills, competency, and leadership for their subordinate s. Hyundai Card has fast communication system to make most decisions within 10.5 hours. In 2003, Hyundai Card adopted electronic approval system s, called 'Cube '. It enables Chung and senior managers to monitor all decision making processes in Hyundai Card . Particularly, if managers delay to provide feedback for their subordinates , audit ing division sends the warning e- mail for their procrastination to the manager . In addition, Hyundai Card adopted 'chatting ' feature in its electronic authorization system. Top management teams can participate in any decision making processes at any time by entering the group messaging room . Also, the electronic approval system can be installed in smart phones of its employees . Chung always paid attention to employees' ideas. He tries to have open communication with all the members of the company. All managers ' office walls and doors in Hyundai Card are built of transparent glass es to stimulate open communication between employee s and managers. In 2012, Chun started 'town hall' meeting. Through 'town hall ' meeting, employees and CEO face each other and have open conversation . Chung also actively use s ocial network s ervice (SNS) to communicate with customer s and employee s. He shares actively his management philosophy and thoughts on his SNSs. For instance, in SNS, he had active arguments with Lee Chan -Jin, CEO of Dreamwiz about credit payment system in Korea. He is one of the famous SNS celebrities in Korea who owns 95 thousand followers in Tweeter (SNS). KOREA N CAR D INDUSTRY CHANGES Changes in Regulation s As Korea's household debt came close to KRW 1,100 trillion (USD 1.07 trillion) at the end of 2012 (Seoul Economics, 2014) , the Korean financial authority tried to reduce it by strengthening the requirement s to issue new credit card s. Korea 's household debt reactes164% of their disposable income, which is the world's highest one (Seoul Economics, 2014) . Korean government believed that excessive credit card usage particularly results in this high household debut. In 2012, the Korean government announced the Credit Card Market Structure Improvement Plan that contains following changes: card holders must be over twenty years old; card applicants must have a sixth degree o r better credit rating; they must have dis posable income at the time of card application. In addition, the new regulation includes the increased tax Page 217 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 deduction on debit card payments up to 30% from 25% and it reduced tax deduction benefits of credit card to 25% from 30%. This new regulation lowered the merchan t fee for credit card transactions . In July, 2012, the credit card companies lowered the merchant fee to small merchants down to 1.5% from 1.8% of transaction and raised the fee for large merchan ts to 2% of transaction from 1.5%. Due to the int roduction of new merchant fee system , it gives a negative impact to credit card companies because credit card 's main income comes from merchant fee from affiliated stores. The number of small merchants outnumbers large merchants and it leads revenue reduct ion from merchant fee. The gross margin of credit card companies decline d by approximately KRW 400 billion (USD 390 million) in 2012 . Also, ROA (return on assets) of Korean card industry decreased to 2.2% in 2013 from 5.6% in 2010 (Yunhap , 2010 ). In terms of new g overnment 's regulation s, credit card companies should publicly announce its interest rate and make customer s easily compare interest rate to other firms. New government policies encourag e customer 's usage of debit card instead of credit cards (Fitch, 2013). As a result, the amount of usage of debit card first surpassed amount of usage of credit card in 2013. Mainly, debit card issuers are bank -controlled company. This is because debit cards are linked with bank accounts. Due to debit card's linkage with bank account, non -bank controlled companies have hard time in enrolling debit cards users, so they are threatened by this substitutable product. CHALLENGES FOR HYUND AI CARD Intense competition and imitation s Table 5 shows that the net profit of Hyundai Card Company has decreased since 2010. Hyundai Card 's operating profit in 2012 was reduced by 28% and its operating profit s in the first quarter of 2013 was reduced by 21.5%. Table 5. NET PROFIT OF HYUNDAI CARD (2010 -2013) 2010 2011 2012 2012 (1Q) 2013 (1Q) Y-o-Y Operating 749 472 -37.0% <Source: Hyundai Capital, Hyundai Card & Hyundai Commercial Annual Report> These decreasing profits of Hyundai Card can be explained by internal and external challenges . First, due to the introduction of new policies to the credit card industry, credit card users and usage decreased. To overcome this harsh external environmental factor s, Korean credit Page 218 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 card companies pursue aggressive marketing activities to bring credit card members of their competitors . In addition, most other credit card companies now imitate Hyundai Card 's product segmentation and aggressive marketing . Responding to this threat, to keep their market share and position, Hyundai Card makes more investment on its marketing activities. The largest portion of Hyundai Card's cost structure is the loan loss reserve which is inevitable. Compared to other firm s, Hyundai Card spends substantial resources on marketing and promoting their brand. Hyundai Card's Super Concert, Super Match, and Super Talk have been hardly profitable as the most revenue from selling tickets goes to the artists, athletes, or guest spea kers, neither were the other promotions such as Tim Burton exhibition (2013) and the concert in Liver Pool, England (2013). Deteriorating Customer Satisfaction Rates Having high levels of customer satisfaction is critical in order to maintain loyal custom ers. The higher level of customer satisfaction might lead to more frequent usage of product s or service s. Additionally , it costs substantially less to maintain current customer s than to attract new customers . Recently, Hyundai Card has problems in maintain ing high levels of customer satisfaction. Compared to its rivals unsatisfied customers increased in Hyundai Card over the years. Table 6 shows the credit card company 's number of complaints from customers. The numbers of complaints for Hyundai Card has been increasing at rapid rate s. Many other competitors in the industry put their most effort on managing custome r's satisfaction. Currently, many customers are able to compare the companies ' customer services. Compared to other companies, Hyundai Card mostly focuses on cultural events and marketing such as concert and exhibitions rather than dealing with the needs or requests of their customers . However, these events only bring benefits some of their customers. C omplaints about consultant took about 50% of the total complaints. Also, complaints about Hyundai Card's business, institution and policy is numerous. (Yunhap News, 2012) This can pose threat s to Hyundai Card as competition intensifies , thereby making it easy for consumers to substitute their current c ards. If customers are not satisfied with the Hyundai Card 's service and product then they could easily drop their card s and pick up another one from different firms . Hyundai Card needs to be able to raise the level of satisfaction of their customers in order to build up more loyalty. Moreover, even though, Hyundai Card enjoyed its success with 'Alphabet series', current Hyundai Card had very wide product lines. These Alphabets all stands for its focusing benefits, but some cards are not widely used by cust omers. Maintaining these product lines are cost burden to Hyundai Card. Besides, excessively numerous products gave confusion to customers. TABLE 6 .

First, when Hyundai Card entered the market, with the low customer awareness and market power of the competitors, Hyundai Card suffered from a heavy deficit. On a way to won this bitter fight, Hyundai Card implement aggressive marketing and provide a unique produc t through thorough segmentation of customers that Hyundai Card analyzes customer's life style and their credit card usage pattern. Hyundai Card, brand itself, is well recognized and highly appraised by customers. By introducing 'M Card' which provide handf ul of benefit with comprehensive understanding of what customer really wants, Hyundai Card hit the market . Hyundai Card established differentiated strategies and through this strategy, Hyundai Card could obtain competitive competency. However the Hyundai C ard's future growth does not seem so optimistic. After, credit card crisis in 2003, Government tried restrain customer 's indiscreet credit card usage leading delinquency. Due to government policy, entire credit card industry shrunk. Also, this policy gives negative impact on net profit of credit card companies. F urthermore, as Competitors imitate Hyundai Card's unique strategy, Hyundai Card loses its unique identity. Hyundai Card has witnessed fierce competition in this limited market. During this critical period, Hyundai Card must respond to this unfavorably changing environment and its strategy must deal with competitors' imitation and changing regulations of Korean government. Hyundai Card should choose its next step with more caution and by inspecting it s profit system and current activity, Hyundai Card should find what is really significant for future Hyundai Card.

Specifically, Oracle faces difficulties in managing and integrating acquired companies with respect to technology integration, resulting in problems in product compatibility and security instability. This case provides an overview of Oracle within the software industry. The case can be covered in one class period. Student preparation time of two hour s will suffice . The case can be used for the topic of international business and strategy. The case has a difficulty level appropriate to students leveling to juniors in bachelor's degree for business . CASE SYNOPSIS In the software industry, merger and acquisitions have been one attractive approach in accelerat ing technological innovation, since internal development for technology would otherwise require substantial capital investment and time. Under the hypercompetitive software market, establishing a complete and full software stack has become critical for software companies. In \"stack war\" among major software companie s, Oracle has successfully exploited the oppor tunities and equipped itself with the most expanded stack through acquisition s. This has contributed to strengthening Oracle's core competencies in the IT industry as well as gaining outstanding financial performance for decades . Although Oracle succeeded in vertically expanding its product stack from application to database, systems, and storage : the so called \"Oracle's Red Stack\" , by implementing vigorous acquisition in multiple product stacks , Oracle faced several difficulties in integrating all the comp onents into one compatible system. Arising problems such as product compatibility and security instability cast doubt on whether Oracle is sufficiently capitalizing on the benefits from acquiring IT vendors with specific functions that Oracle had required. How can Oracle resolve the associated complexity involved in post acquisition integration and maximize its synergy from aggressive acquisitions? INTRODUCTION In January 2010, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems, which was previously a major competitor of Oracle, with the transaction valued at approximately $7.4 billion. Larry Ellison, Oracle Corporation's CEO, commented, \"The acquisition of Sun transforms the IT industry, Page 224 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 combining best-in-class enterprise software and mission -critical computing systems. Oracle will be the only company that can engineer integrated system -applications to disk-where all pieces fit and work together so customers do not have to do it themselves. Our customers benefit as their systems integration costs go down while system performance, reliability and security go up (Dignan, 2009).\" With the acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Oracle gained two major Sun Microsystems software assets: Java and Solaris, which is essential software that Oracle middleware and database are based on. Right after the acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Mark Smith, the analyst of Ventana research, said that the acquisition of Sun Microsystems led the elevation of Oracle into an exclusive group of technology providers, such as IBM and HP that have software , server, and storage technology (Ackerman & Padilla, 2009) . Oracle not only gained control over Java and Solaris but also vertically integrated its system stack . Oracle has completed over 100 acquisitions between 1994 and 2013. For instance, Oracle acqui red Siebel for CRM (Customer Relationship Management ), J.D Edwards for ERP (Enterp rise Resource Planning ), Retek for retail management applications, BEA systems for middleware, and recently Sun Microsystems for Java and server hardware. Oracle's aggressive acquisition s have contributed to strengthening Oracle's position as the dominant leader in information technology industry by enabling technology integration among servers, storage, software, and networking connections. Oracl e has been able to reach nearly 50 percent of profit margins, retain customers , and position itself to battle SAP and IBM as Oracle established vertical integration for its software products (Wailgum, 2008) . Although Oracle has established fully integrated system stacks by offering applications , databases, systems, and storage, it encountered several difficulties in achieving technology integration : how Oracle integrates its acquired products with other existing its software products. Given Oracle 's consecutive acquisitions in multiple product stacks and the associated complexity involved in enhancing product compatibility, it is important for Oracle to facilitat e technology integration and maximiz e its synergy from technology acquisitions. STACK WAR IN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY Since the advent of software in the early 1960's, the software industry has rapidly expanded with a number of inventions such as SaaS (Software as a Service) and cloud computing. According to Gartner (2014) , the worldwide revenue of software industry reached $388.5 billion in 2012 and $407.3 billion in 2013, a 4.8 percent increase from the previous year. Moreover, Table 1 shows that 39 out of 100 rapidly growing companies are in the software industry. This indicates that the software industry has grown fast in the past and is also expected to grow in the future . Many new companies continuously enter the software industry because it does not require large capital . In general, these new companies are specialized in one or two software products such as IT solution consulting, middleware, database, storage, and networking. Customers usually select appropriate software product s separately from different compan ies that are suitable for their business needs. However, if they use IT solutions from different providers, they have to spend substantial resources on figuring out which software would operate well with high compatibility on the existing platform and thus able to create synergy (Oracle, 2010). Once the organization has finish ed figuring out which software to add to their IT solutions stack, it must spend additional time and effort integrating all the components into one compatible system. This Page 225 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 process is not only costly but also ineffi cient, burdening the consumers by hampering work efficien cy and demanding unnecessary maintenance costs to the software providers. Source: Top 100 companies of Technology 500 2013 Deloitte Figure 1. Top 100 companies from Technology Fast 500TM In response to these difficulties of fragmented IT solution stacks , software companies compete to differentiate their products by providing integrated and comprehensive software solutions. After IBM's initiation of the software stack strategy, its competitors also joined to implement the same tactics. This competition has been named as a \"stack war\" (Vellante, 2010). For example, Oracle owns \"Oracle's Red Stack\" which is one of the most comprehensive software stacks in the industry. SAP AG, the main competitor of Oracle, has counteracted to Oracle's strategy by constructing a comparable software stack of its own (Wailgum, 2011). IBM and Microsoft also have formidable stacks of software solution . Unlike other competitors, Oracle has full product stacks from cloud applications, end-user applications, middleware & tools , databases, system management, operating system, to virtualization . IBM, however, does not have cloud applica tions and end-user applications in its stacks. SAP AG merely has cloud applications, middlewa re & tools, and data bases. Building necessary software through internal developments takes substanti al resources, time, and risks. However, by acquiring other software firms, major software companies can rapidly obtain necessary software stacks . As the IT industry entered a phase of maturity, an intensifying consolidation of the software industry has been observed (L\u00e9ger et al, 2009). In fact, the number of merger and acquisition s in the software industry is the highest among different industries in 49 countries (Buxman, 2013). For examples, IBM has made more than 130 mergers and acquisitions since 1999. Moreover, Microsoft had more than 160 mergers and acquisitions since 1987, with its acquisition of Skype Technolo gies for $8.5 billion clean technology comm/networkingPage 226 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 COMPANY BACKGROUND Oracle started its business on June 16, 1977, in Santa Clara, California, as Software Development Laboratories (SDL) by three founders ; Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates , for the purpose of developing database management systems software. Hinted from their project for the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) , Ellison and Miner applied the concept of relational databases using Structured Query Language and worked on a similar program for digital minicomputers and other types of machines. Eventually, in 1978, they developed the world's first relational database , using SQL (Structured Query Language ) that allows organizations to use different computers from different manufacturers but with standardized softwar e. The following year, Oracle was able to commercially offer a relational database management system, two years ahead of IBM. In 1983, the first commercially portable RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) , which allow ed companies to run their DBMS (Database Management System) on a range of hardware and operating systems - including mainframes, minicomputers, workstations, and person al computers - helped Oracle double its revenues to over $5 million. Oracle went public by selling one million common shares in 1986. The principal factor for Oracle's success was SQL, which was emerging as the industry's standard software language for RDBMS. With this, Oracle debuted SQL *Star software in the same year, which allow ed comput er users to access data stored on a network of computers as if all network's information were stored on one computer under the distributed system. In 1987, Oracle ranked as the world's largest database management software company by reaching $100 million in sales and gaining more than 4,500 end users in 55 countries. Oracle developed multiple programs such as the Oracle E-Business Suite 11i and Technology Network (OTN) Xchange, which are the most comprehensive suite of global business applications, making Oracle's database system the first to pass nine industry standard security evaluations in 2001. It also expanded its product stack aggressively through over 100 acquisitions . In 2005, Oracle acquired its rival, Peoplesoft to become the largest ERP vendor in the world (Landgrave, 2003). This acquisition was a lengthy process that took 18 months and Oracle paid $26.50 a share (Bank, 2004) .

In an attempt to catch up with their cloud -based competitors , Oracle acquired TOA Technologies with an estimated amount of $96.2 million. This was Oracle 's third acquisition in the applications product category in 2014 (Banker, 2014) . After several endeavors in boosting its cloud services, Oracle achieved a 25% increase in revenue, equaling to $322 million in their fourth quarter in 2014 (Banker, 2014) . Oracle developed cloud-based SaaS and provides Cloud SaaS for human resources, enterprise resource planning, enterprise performance management , customer experience, transportation management , and logistics. Table 1 describes a series of technology acquisitions that Oracle completed by 2014. Oracle 's Vision and Major Products Oracle's vision is based on the following four key principles . The first principle is to simplify. Oracle aims to achieve speedy information delivery with integrated systems under a single database. They currently have a full product stack for information technology solutions. This full product stack offers a simplified solution for customer s as it offers a collection of services from hardware , database, and clouding, etc., reducing the complexity in system s integration. The second principle is to standardize. When developing products, Oracle focuses on reduc ing cost and maintenance cycles with open and easily available components. Especially for manufacturing companies with complex assets such as aircrafts, Oracle developed a solution that ultimately reduces costs and maintenance cycles that was possible through standardization . Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (Complex MRO) delivers such services to organizations that demand to successfully standardize and manage their entire maintenance operations (Oracle, n.d.). The third principle is to automate . Automating refers to improving operational efficienc y with technology and best practices. For instance, in response to cost increase and the escalated demand for patient engagement and enhanced resource utilization in the healthcare industry , Oracle delivers healthcare solutions such as Oracle Health Manage ment Platform Solution and Oracle Health Resources Management Solution. This allows healthcare providers to accelerate the adoption of efficient health delivery systems. Oracle 's wide range of industry specific software and hardware solutions are optimized in a way that improves operational efficiency and delivers performance levels incomparable to other competitors in the industry (Oracle, n.d.) . The fourth principle is to innovate: driving the business forward in new ways with Oracle business solutions . Oracle Innovation Management is a business solution that helps organization s increase their return on innovation with a systematic approach to capture, select and invest in the appropriate and profitable product ideas and also to manage the overall product portfolio. With Page 228 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 this, organizations can make faster and more informed business decisions by easily being able to evaluate product concepts for cost, risk, and against customer requirements and design goals (Hartquist & Jones, 2014). Table 2 describes majo r software products provided by Oracle.

Born in New York and raised in Chicago , Larry Ellison represents the archetypical American success story. Dropping out of two colleges , University of Illinois and University of Chicago, Ellison moved from job to job working for Fireman's Fund, Wells Fargo Bank, and as a programmer at Amdahl Corporation. In Amdahl Corporation, he participated in building the first IBM -compatible mainframe system. With his two colleagues that he met at Amdahl, Robert Miner and Ed Oates, they won a contract to build a relational database management system for the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) under the code name: Oracle. With further development, the three were able to achieve this relational database system for commercial applications, which later became the basis for their multibillion -dollar business . Page 229 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 In an interview with CNBC, Larry Ellison quoted \"I'm addicted to winning. The more you win, the more you want to win (Mathisen, 2014) .\" In 1998, Ellison stated \"If the Internet turns out not to be the future of computing, we're toast. But if it is, we're golden (Clarke, 2014) .\" This quote explicitly shows Ellison's boldness in doing business, and also his outstanding insights on the future of business. Oracle's products are used by the 100 largest public companies in the world and by 400,000 other customers in 145 countries. After succeeding in and gaining a certain position in the software industry, Ellison no longer considers IBM nor SAP AG to be its direct competitors. Rather, he states that Cloud giants such as Amazon and Salesforce.c om, are his biggest competitors. In the 2000s, Ellison was the highest -paid executive with total compensation of $1.84 billion, during which Oracle's market capitalization nearly tripled to $98 billion. According to Igor Still, who worked directly with Larry Ellison for 11 years, Larry Ellison has the ability to select and recruit exceptionally talented and capable management executives, believing that employees are the most valuable assets of a software company (Still, 2013) . When recruiting employees, Ellison strives to hire intelligent and motivate d people who seek to continuously improve their personal goals as well as Oracle's systems, processes, and results. He valued \"unruly geniuses\" with incredible brightness and ambition more to people with maturity and experience. Product Stack Oracle takes on a holistic approach and offers a complete set of enterprise database and applications software to its customers . A full product stack, which is so called \"Oracle's Red Stack\" refers to providing solutions from applications to storage, including middleware, database, operating systems, virtual machines, and servers. Oracle optimized its hardware and software stack to create and run a comprehensive enterprise solution. Oracle can engineer, tune, and collaborate at any level of product stack s to solve business problems of its clients , ensuring that software takes full advantages of the unique feature s in Oracle 's system , while synchronizing hardware and software. It allows comprehensive management across its servers, storage, networking, and software components into an integrated system . Managing a comprehensive product stack enables faster innovation across the entire stack through collaboration and sharing of core intellectual property across product lines. Furthermore , Oracle performs full stack testing by applying fault injection, stress, performance, and scalability testing. This allows customers to gain better performance, security, and reliability for their business -applications. The excellence in performance and convenience of its products and services enhance the reputation of Oracle . By providing full-featured software solutions, Oracle also increases customer s' dependence on Oracle 's products by making it difficult and expensive for customers to switch into products of competitors . Goldmacher, a financial analyst in Wall Street quoted , \"For a long time, Oracle has held firm on pricing for maintenance, which is their highest margin business, and they've really stuck it to their clients (Randewich, 2013 ).\" Robust Quality Assurance Software firms have unique value -chain activities . The primary activities of software development companies are: requirements, analysis & design, construction, quality assurance, Page 230 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 and maintenance. The supporting activities include communication, architecture, project management, infrastructure & operations , and human resources. Quality assurance is a strong business activity for Oracle as it offers a variety of products. Systems failure not only affects Oracle but also its clients . When quality assurance professionals do not address the problems on time, it shortens the application lifecycle of the product . Oracle offers support for its solutions by managing and maintaining systems installed in clients . Support is considered an essential element of customer success and a critical factor of high system availability, operational efficiency, and continuous business innovation (Oracle, 2014). Oracle has unique approach, which promotes consistency and high quality support for servers and storage, software, and engineered systems and solutions. Owing to their investment in enhancing customer support, Oracle maintains its business strength and competitiveness over time (Oracle, n.d.). Competitor Analysis Microsoft Microsoft Corporation, ranked No.1 in the software industry, is an American multinational corporation founded by Bill Gate s and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975. Microsoft recorded around $87 billion in revenue and $28 billion of operating income in 2014 (Microsoft 2014) . At the beginning, Microsoft developed and sold BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code ) interpreter , which have been widely used as programming languages (Allan Roy, 2001) . In the mid-1980s, Microsoft introduced MS-DOS to the personal computer operating system s market and developed Microsoft Windows , which has dominated the operat ing system market (Blaxill, M. & Eckardt, R., 2009) . Microsoft provides a variety of products such as computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and IT services. Its flagship produces include Windows, MS-Office, and Xbox game console s. Between 1990s and 2000s, Microsoft acquir ed 165 IT companies . For example , Microsoft developed MS Powerpoint through acquiring Forethought in 1987 (NewYork Times, 1987) . In addition, Microsoft acquir ed Hotmail in 1997 and bought Navision into Microsoft Dynamics Division in 2002, so as to improve its ERP business (Pelline, J., 1998) . In 2009, Microsoft purchased Interactive Supercomputing to strengthen its cloud computing market (Wauter, 2009) . In 2013, Microsoft acquired Nokia in order to enter the Smartphone industry (Paczkowski, 2011) . IBM IBM began by Charles Ranlett Flint merging several companies into CTR Company, which is the predecessor of IBM (Madrigal, 2011). It is an American multinational technology and consulting corporation that produces computer hardware and software and provides IT consulting services. In 2013 , IBM reached around $99.8 billion in revenue and $18 billion in operating income (Google Finance, 2013) . IBM started their business with hardware products, and later entered into software and IT consult ing service s market from 1990s. IBM actively pursued acquisitions to obtain new technology. For instance, IBM acquired Lotus Notes in order to complement client -server Page 231 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 computing segment in 1995 and bought Tivoli to strengthen its enterprise IT infrastructure in 1996 (CNET News, 1995, Lohr, 1996) . These acquisition s helped IBM expand its business into the software industry . In 2002, IBM purchased Pricewaterhouse coopers Consulting to enter into IT consulting service s (The Washington Post, 2002) . IBM acquired SPSS to strengthen its analytic software market in 2009. IBM Global Business Service (GBS) generated 31% of its revenue by providing management consulting , systems integration and application management service s. SAP AG SAP AG, a German multinational software corporation that develop s enterprise software, is ranked No. 4 after Oracle in terms of sales . SAP AG was founded by five engineers who left IBM. SAP AG scored $21 billion in revenue and around $5.65 billion in operating income in 2013. Its main product is SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) , which accounts for the largest market share in the ERP software market (Columbus, 2014) . It consists of several modules: marketing and sales, field service s, product design and development, production and inventory control, human resources, finance, and accounting. SAP ERP collects and combines data from each module to provide the company with enterprise resource planning. SAP AG additionally provides CRM (Customer Relation Management ), PLM (Product Lifecycle Management ), SCM (Supply SRM (Supplier Relationship Management) , and NetWeaver software platform. SAP AG started to expand their business market by acquiring Steeb, a company specializing in IT consulting services , in 1991. In 2001, SAP acquired Toptier to develop enterprise information portal s, and Prescient Consulting to strengthen its consulting services (Paz, 2001) . Also, Sybase was purchased, as SAP needed to improve database, middleware, and mobile software segment s (Howlett, 2010) . In 2012, SAP acquired Ariba, a company that specializes in supplier network, for cloud service s. Table 3 describes the software stacks of Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and SAP AG on each technology stack . SAP AG provide s IT products from cloud application services , end-user applications, middleware & tools, to databases from the stack. Microsoft has the same products except for servers and storage systems. IBM provides IT products over most stacks except cloud services and end-user application. In contrast to other competitors, Oracle exclusively provides the full-feature product stacks.

Nevertheless, as Oracle has gone through over 100 acquisitions, there are difficulties in integrating acquired products and technolog ies with their existing services and products. After Oracle acquired other software companies, it need s to make sure that the acquired software products or services are compatible with other existing software product s to create synergy. In addition, it is necessary for Oracle to pay attention to their quality assurance and maintenance of acquired software . As Oracle pursues more technology acquisitions, accomplishing adequate technology integr ation between Oracle's existing products and acquired software products is critical to boost the stability and efficiency of Oracle's software stacks. Several problems such as product compatibility and security issues emerged in the process of technology integration. For instance, when Oracle acquired Siebel, it faced product compatibility issues while adapting Siebel's CRM products , which are based on the IBM platform , to Oracle's platform. This platform change created problems for Siebel's existing customers because they were using CRM program s that were based on IBM's. In addition, Java, the most popular programming language in use, originally developed by Sun Microsystems, was confronted with security problems in 2013 after it was acquired by Oracle. Hackers exploited vulnerabilities in Java to carry out attacks against other companies including Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Twitter , and home users (Constantin, 2013) . Java security Page 233 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 issue represented Oracle failure to effectively integrate and manage acquired software products of Sun Microsystems after acquisition (Constantin, 2013) . Moreover, Oracle faces challenges to retain employee s of acquired firms after acquisitions . For instance, after acquiring Peoplesoft, Oracle had lost nearly 50% of its employee s from 11,000 to 6,000 because of their voluntary turnover (Wailgum, 2008) . Typically, the employees from the acquired companies tend to voluntarily resign since they are either not satisfied with the acquiring company 's system , value , and culture . For example, in the case of Siebel, 80% of the employees left and went to Oracle's competitors (Randewitch, 2013) . It result s in a loss of technology and knowledge that embedded in employees of acquired firms that are the main motivation for acquisitions. Oracle is not efficient in managing post acquisition integration to absorb and leverage acquired technology by integrating key employee s of acquired firms into Oracle. As a result, Oracle faces difficulty to stimulate communication and cooperation between target firms and Oracle . LOOKING AHEAD In order to handle post acquisition integration issues, Oracle has been undergoing three practices; education, reconstructing on acquired firms , and employee interaction. 1. Education Oracle developed a manual for post-acquisition management based on their previous acquisition experiences. By using this manual, a general post-acquisition integration process is implemented. Oracle focuses on educating the employees of acquired firms in order for them to adopt Oracle 's system s efficiently. They learn about Oracle 's operational structure and internal values . 2. Reconstructing on acquired firms Oracle is known to lay off a majority of the acquired company 's employees. However, most of employees leave Oracle voluntarily. Usually, the reasons for resignation are disparity in values and difficulties in adjusting to the new corporate environment. Oracle provides a program that allows its former employees to find jobs within the same industry. 3. Employee interaction Oracle finds interaction among employees critical in terms of aligning company culture and increasing intimacy among each other. The company provides different activities for these purposes. For example, they arrange different departments on one floor to enhance physical interaction. In addition, they also offer opportunities for employees to exchange divisions. Finally, social clubs for sharing hobbies and interests are recommended to build relationships with each other. CONCLUSION By 2014, Oracle has achieved a number of acquisitions , including Sun Microsystems, Peoplesoft, Siebel, and Taleo . These acquisition s have extensively broadened Oracle 's product offerings and enabled Oracle to offer complete software solutions . However, as Oracle had Page 234 Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 21, Number 3, 2015 acquired multiple companies to acquire new technology, it also created challenges in post- acquisition integration in terms of technology compatibility and employee retention . Oracle could not be a market leade r in the software industry merely by providing the most comprehensive software stack because post acquisition integration issues damage the quality and reliability of Oracle products . Oracle needs to offer more integrated and combined software product stacks by enhancing the product compatibility between Oracle's existing products and acquired products. How does Oracle stimulate post acquisition integration on their software products to be a genuine market leader in the software industry? ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Seungho Choi is a corresponding author.
