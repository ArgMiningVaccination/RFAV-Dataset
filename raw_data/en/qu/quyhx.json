The supermodel is known to take a holistic approach to her health and it appears she may need more intervention amid reports of her split from Brady. The supermodel and Brady, 45, have reportedly hired divorce lawyers 13 years after saying 'I do' in 2009, according to multiple reports. The supermodel took the lead on hiring an attorney and the NFL star followed her lead while 'figuring out what to do,' according to People. The supermodel wore a t-shirt, loose green joggers, a prayer necklace and carried an Amazon box as she left the healer B\u00fcndchen, who was spotted visiting the healer for a second time this month, takes a call while outside the healer's office. She is known to take a holistic approach to her health B\u00fcndchen ducked into her car as she talked on the phone and left the healer's office RINGLESS: The supermodel's hand was bare of a ring as she carried an amazon box outside the healer's office Wednesday 'I don't think there will be any coming back now,' an anonymous source told Page Six. 'They both have lawyers and are looking at what a split will entail, who gets what and what the finances will be.' B\u00fcndchen was also recently spotted in the parking lot of her gym, along with her children Benjamin, 12, and Vivian, 9, on Tuesday with her luxurious diamond ring missing from her left hand as she locked the car door. She styled a white sporty tank and gray bottoms while her golden locks sat below her shoulders. B\u00fcndchen's two children appeared to carry towels as they locked up their car and headed inside. The Victoria's Secret model is rumored to be staying separately from the NFL quarterback as he returned to Tampa to practice for the Buccaneers' game. The duo have been working through a rough patch as Brady's re-entering the NFL allegedly triggered a rift in their relationship. Brady and B\u00fcndchen are rumored to be assessing how they would divide their assets, including their $26 million property portfolio. The pair recently purchased a $17 million home on Indian Creek Island in Miami, dubbed 'Billionaires Bunker.' The two would have joined A-list celebrities in residing on the exclusive waterfront island, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Aside from the Miami property, the pair also have a condo in New York City worth $3.6 million and another $5.7 million property at an exclusive Yellowstone club in Montana. While there were multiple destinations the couple could've ran to amid Hurricane Ian in Florida last week, B\u00fcndchen reportedly stayed with the couple's children in Miami while Brady stayed somewhere else. Aside from the couple's two kids Vivian and Benjamin, the former Patriots star has a 15-year-old son, Jack, from his previous relationship with Bridget Moynahan. Another messy battle for the lawyers to decide is custody of their shared children. Going solo: It's not clear where Tom has been staying, though he is not at home, where his three children are also staying; seen with (L-R) Benjamin, 12; Jack, 15; and Vivian, nine B\u00fcndchen previously said that she put her career on the sidelines to support her husband Brady's net worth after beginning his football career on the New England Patriots in 2001 has skyrocketed to $250 million. Meanwhile, B\u00fcndchen's net worth is similar after spending years as a Victoria Secret model. The supermodel previously admitted during an interview with Elle Magazine on September 13 that she had to put her career on the sidelines. B\u00fcndchen was looking forward to jump starting her career again after Brady's retirement - and appears to be going forward with her goals despite Brady's decision to return to the field. 'I've done my part, which is [to] be there for [Tom],' she told Elle Magazine. 'I moved to Boston, and I focused on creating a cocoon and a loving environment for my children to grow up in and to be there supporting him and his dreams. 'Seeing my children succeed and become the beautiful little humans that they are, seeing him succeed, and being fulfilled in his career \u2014 it makes me happy. At this point in my life, I feel like I've done a good job on that. 'I have a huge list of things that I have to do, that I want to do. At 42, I feel more connected with my purpose,' B\u00fcndchen said. Brady was pictured at his recent October 2 game alongside Buccaneer teammates. His supermodel wife is known to cheer him on during the games but hasn't been present this season B\u00fcndchen previously admitted her worries about Brady walking back on his retirement plans. 'This is a very violent sport, and I have my children and I would like him to be more present,' B\u00fcndchen told Elle Magazine. 'I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again. But ultimately, I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy too.' On his regularly scheduled 'Let's Go!' podcast last month, the seven-time Super Bowl champion did not mention his marital challenges directly, but spoke about the importance of family. Brady mentioned that he has spent Thanksgiving and Christmas away from his family since joining the NFL. 'I haven't had a Christmas in 23 years, and I haven't had a Thanksgiving in 23 years, I haven't celebrated birthdays with people that I care about that are born from August to late January. And I'm not able to be at funerals and I'm not able to be at weddings,' Brady told his co-host, Jim Gray. Brady and B\u00fcndchen are supposedly 'living separately' amid marital issue rumors after the football star decided to return to the field after announcing his retirement in February Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen's eco-mansion is beginning to take shape on the $17 million plot of land which has a waterfront view of Biscayne Bay, near Miami, Florida While rumors swirl that Brady and B\u00fcndchen's rift was spurred by the NFL star's return to the field, Dailymail.com can confirm the couple's rumored split is unrelated to Brady's surprise return. He had initially quit his career, in part, to focus on his family - as he vowed to spend more time with them since Gisele 'deserves what she needs from me as a husband, and my kids deserve what they need from me as a dad.' B\u00fcndchen is her husband's 'number one cheerleader' and said she would not care if he played until he was in his 50s. But the friction between the two has still resulted in them living apart from one another. The comments below have not been moderated.
