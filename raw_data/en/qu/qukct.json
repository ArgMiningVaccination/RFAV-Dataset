Under the paradigm used by the federal gover nment (NRC 1983) human health risk derives from the combination of hum an exposure to contaminants and the toxicity of the contaminants. In the risk assessment proc ess, contaminant data is gathered to estimate present or future exposures to determine if resources are, or could become, harmful to the health an d well-being of a community. Environmental contact rates are used to es timate contamination doses to exposed individuals via inhalation, ingestion of food and water, and dermal absorption during a defined set of activities in particular loca tions (Figure 1). Conversely, the degree of allowable contamination required to k eep human health risks below a specified risk level can also be calculated. Figure 1.

Exposure Pathways Evaluated in the Risk Assessment Process In order to estimate doses and risks, we must understand how people interact with the environment. All cultur es depend on environmental qualit y for their survival, but the health of tribal communities and their in dividual members is so intertwined with their environment as to be inseparable. This leads to quite different perspectives on the risk assessment process and the role of risk in making environmental and health decisions (Figure 3). Neve rtheless, the conventional perspective and the tribal perspective must be brought together in or der to make risk-based decisions that protect tribal health and the environment. In most cases conventional methods can be modified to a greater or lesser extent.

Bridging Perspectives In the conventional assessment of risk, ex posures to contaminant s are the focus of the process. The doses of each contam inant are estimated by assuming daily ingestion rates (in units of grams/day or gpd) of a particular biotic or abiotic resource, such as fish, for a particular ex posure period. Risks for each contaminant, including mercury, are calculated using conventional equations. The Average Daily Doses (ADD) of each contaminant incu rred through each exposure pathway is calculated using the following equation: ADD = (C x IR x EF x ED) / (AT x BW) where: C = concentration of chemical in the sample (mg/kg) IR = ingestion rate of each sample (mg or grams per day) EF = exposure frequency (days per year) ED = exposure duration (years) BW = body weight (kg) AT = averaging time (days) The factors of ingestion rate, frequency, and duration are paramount to estimating risks. Because exposure evaluation methods were developed to reflect exposures received in urban or suburban situations (F igure 4), tribal ex posure pathways may not be recognized at all and/or not underst ood well enough to realize the diversity and intensity of environmental contact, and therefore the frequency and duration of exposure (Figure 5). The firs t question, then, is how to recognize whether tribal members use the affect ed area or resources.

It means developi ng an exposure scenario that re flects the lifestyle treaties (or their equivalent) were designed to protect. Introduction 13 This document presents some generic ri sk assessment methods while recognizing that they do not substitute for inte rgovernmental consultation and meaningful participation in the decision process. Se veral cautionary notes are as follows: Every tribe is different, and generalizat ions cannot be made from one tribe to another or from one exposure scenario to another. Government to government protocol m eans that the agency must to talk to individual tribes. Intertribal groups do not substitute for individual tribal consultation and do not represent or speak for individual tribes. Treaties and trusteeship are federal obl igations that pr ecede more recent environmental regulations. These ob ligations do not fade with time. Environmental standards were not set with tribes in mind, and may not be adequately protective. There is a balance between maintaining confidentiality of tribal information and having access to data for verification. Tribes have the right to protect proprietary information and to give only summary information to the assessor. Human subjects protocols as well as tribal cultural resource or research codes apply equally to cultural data. Neither human healt h nor cultural information should be published without permission of the tribe. Our experience in developing tribal subs istence-based exposure scenarios has led to a set of technical, ethi cal, and procedural rules (Figur e 6, adapted from Harper et al. 2002): Each parameter must be able to be te sted or verified (documented, modeled, measured, or elicited fr om acknowledged experts) to enable each assumption to be systematically validated. This validation can rely on ethnographic data and open peer-reviewed literature, and on verbal representations from subsistence practitioners and triba lly recognized cultural experts. Ethnographic experts are recognized by their standing in the academic community, while cultural experts are recognized by their traditional or indigenous environmental knowledge and their standing in the tribal community. Pursuant to Rule 702, \"a witness is qua lified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" to testify when his or her \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowle dge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" In response to two U.S. Supreme Court cases holding tr ial judges responsible for excluding unreliable expert testimony, Rule 702 recently was qualified by amendment. To be admissible, the rule now require s federal courts to find: \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and me thods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" Another risk assessor should be able to repeat the same steps and construct essentially the same scenario.

John M. Last defines individual human health as a state characterized by anatomic integrit y, ability to perform personal, family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical, biological, and social stress; a feeling of well -being; and freedom from the risk of disease and untimely death (Last 1998). This definition is broader than the risk-based regulator y approach, which tends to equate good health with lack of excessive ex posure. More broadly , definitions of health and functionality from t he public health literature incl ude a variety of medical and functional measures. However, they may not emphasize the fact that the survival and well-being of individuals and indigenous cultures depend on a healthy environment. Indigenous cultures and their environs are intertwined to a degree that is usually not accounted for by Western society and scientists when developing risk metrics. The environment constitutes a cultural homeland where the people (and their genetics) co-evolved with the ecology ov er thousands of years. The concepts of health and culture can be combined into a concept of cultural health (healthy individuals functioning in healthy social and cultural systems). Culture is collective knowle dge and systematic unity that gives members a sense of personal identity and cultural anchorage (Greaves 1996). Various definitions of \"culture\" include social behavior systems, relig ion, art, material goo ds, individual and collective health, a land ethic, ways of relating to the environment, and other Introduction 16 Informed consent is obtained from research subjects or their legally authorized representatives.

The full span of risks and impacts needs to be evaluated within the risk assessment framework in order for cumu lative risks to be adequately characterized. This is in contrast to a more typical process of evaluating risks to hum an health and ecological resources within the risk assessment phase and deferring the evaluation of risks to socio-cultural and socioeconomic res ources until the risk management phase (National Research Council 1994, 1996; President's Commission 1997).

Human Health-Related Goods and Services: This category includes the provision of water, air, food, and nativ e medicines.

There is also a parallel non-dollar indigenous economy that provides the same types of services, including employment (i.e., the functional role of individuals in maintaining the functional community and ensuring its survival), shelter (house sites, construction materials) , education (intergener ational knowledge required to ensure sustainable survival throughout time and maintain personal and community identity), commerce ( barter items and stability of extended trade networks), hospitality, energy (f uel), transportation (land and water travel, waystops, navigational guides), recreation (scenic visitation areas), and economic support for specialized role s such as religious leaders and teachers.

Theref ore, the objective of subs istence exposure scenarios is to describe original lifestyles and resource uses. It is not to present a snapshot of contemporary restricted or suppressed uses, because the intent is to restore the ecology so that the original pattern of re source use is both possible (after resources are restored) and safe (after contamination is removed). Thus, the use of historical, archaeological, and ethnological data is requir ed to identify the exact nature of these past resource uses. The exposure scenario reflects a traditional subsistence lifestyle. \"Subsistence\" refers to the hunting, fishin g, and gathering activities that are fundamental to the way of life of many indigenous peoples. S ubsistence utilizes traditional and modern technologies for harvesting and preserving foods as well as for distributing the produce through communal networks of sharing and bartering. In general our steps for reconstructing subsistence diets have been to: 1. Review ecological and foraging informa tion specific to the tribe, and the local ecosystem(s); 2. Review interviews and other archaeological and ethnographic sources for supporting information of species and abundance, habitat types, human activity levels, and methods of obtaini ng, preparing, and using resources; 3. Develop overall perce ntages of major food cat egories and major staples within the total diet; 4. Estimate calories provided by the diet, and compare estimates of percentages of quantities and percentages of calories, and 5. Refine estimates of major staples and food categories after considering information about medicines, sweeteners, other often-overlooked food/medicine types, a nd other factors. Steps 1 and 2 require engaging different fo rms of anthropology, ethnohistory, and archaeology. In particular, ethnohistorical approaches, when combined with other forms of data, some of which are geograph ic, offer the most insight into past subsistence lifestyles.

Important Subsistence Foods (after Driver and Massey 1957) Introduction 33 One exciting challenge for us has been to combine the va rious forms of data (from faunal analyses and bone isotopes to firs t hand explorer accounts, documentary history, and ethnography) into one cohesive, verifiable whole, and there have been great rewards in our methodology. Our approach is similar to the methods defined by renowned historian Patricia Galloway (2006), who sees that archaeology, ethnohistory, oral tr adition, first hand accounts, and ethnography can come together in a \"convergence of several lines of evidence\" (Galloway 2006). We are influenced by predecessors in ethnohistory, because we believe, like Bruce Trigger, that succeeding \"et hnohistorians have pioneered the use of more recent ethnographic data to reveal biases and inaccuracies in the historical record and to make possible the interpretation of native behavior in the absence of any independent documentation of native viewpoints\" (Trigger 1986). Thus, we have often comb ined more recent (usually late 19 th century and early 20th century) ethnographic accounts of s ubsistence lifestyles with contact period first-hand accounts and late pre-c ontact and contact period archaeological data. This approach is slightly more difficu lt when the first-hand accounts are distant in time from the ethnographic data, as is the case in much of the eastern part of North America. But first-hand accounts can still be valuable sources of information, since the colonial documents are often more sustained and di verse (from many different national sources) in this geographic area. Of course, creating this convergence is not simple, and requires a way of contextualizing each of these forms of k nowledge, including the documents of first- hand accounts and ethnography. As Galloway poi nts out, this convergence is best done when we come to the \"understanding of t he [historical] document as an artifact of a process...and that archaeology itself is going to help judge its truth\" (Galloway 2006). Thus, when using archaeological ev idence with first hand accounts, oral tradition, and ethnography we must be cogniz ant of the context of production\u2014why a document was preserved or a study perfo rmed in the first pl ace, and what the motivations were in recording the facts. This is not to say that the evidence in these documents is not true or accu rate, but that when they ar e brought together they can paint a deeper and more verifiable picture of past cultures. One key question of our scenarios is what period to focus on for the subsistence diet, because Native cultures, like other cu ltures, are dynamic, creative, and respond to changes in climate and environment as we ll as internal preferences. In general, we usually focus on the early treaty peri od, which usually happens near the time of initial contact with Europeans (of cour se this can be anywhere from the 17 th century to the 19th century, depending on t he Native group). The reasons for this are many\u2014 rights to resources are usually guaranteed in these agreements, first-hand accounts are generally available, allowing for multip le lines of evidence, and the resources themselves are usually not degraded at this time in history.

Our uses of archaeological data have been heavily influenced by approaches in ethno-archaeology that use community-bas ed experts to comment on sites and Introduction 34 previously published reports (see Kelly 1986)\u2014this approach has also influenced our research protocol (see section on res earch ethics below). We find this method meshes well with our use of ethnohistory, in that each has its own strengths and weaknesses. As Bruce Trigger points out, \"a rchaeology is not merely a deficient or denatured copy of ethnology, as many ethnol ogists have assumed it to be, but a complementary discipline that is capable of providing informa tion about cultural change that ethnology cannot\" (Trigger 1986). Each geographic and cultural context requires a different mixture of data, and we recommend that researchers understand not only the resource and cult ural history of a particular tribal group, but al so the history of research in that area. In one example we found that the amount of hunting and fish ing gear in archaeological evidence, the seasonal round as identifi ed in ethnography and archaeology, the settlement pattern relative to known resources, human bone is otope ratios, pollen profiles over time, and so on gave a fairly accurate structure of a diet (Sanger 1988). This information was then supplemented with early firs t-hand and ethnological accounts on the amount of food needed to feed a certain number of men fo r a winter season, with the relative abundance of certain wild foods that were brought in for trade. Whatever the mixture of data, we maintain that the highest standards of science are used, and this is most ensured by obtaining mu ltiple lines of evidence. B.2.2 Research Ethics, Indige nous People, and Ground-Truthing Using multiple lines of evidence not onl y creates better knowledge for environmental managers to protect subsist ence lifestyles; it also creates and maintains better relations between scientists (both Native and non-Native) and Native communities. While our studies aim to protec t traditional lifestyles, it is arrogant to ignore our part in a colonial history in which scientific study has harmed indig enous people and their ways of life. In fact, even when researc hers work for tribal communities, local indigenous citizens often worry about the research and question why it is being done, who it is for, and how it has been designed (Smith 1999). As Maori scholar and activist Linda Tuhiwai Smith points out, \"anthropology made the study of Others, colonized peoples, its primary area, but other disciplines were employed in the practices of imperialism in less direct but far more devastating ways\" (Smith 1999). The use of research in the colonization of indigenous peoples is understood in most Native communities, but it can be ov ercome by being more collaborative and inclusive\u2014in these contexts, stakeholder inpu t into scientific production will result in more accurate and more sustainable sci ence. Again, as Smith points out, \"decolonization does not mean and has not meant a total re jection of all theory or research or Western knowledge. Rather, it is about centering our concerns and world views and then coming to know and understand theory and research from our own perspectives and for our own purposes\" (Smith 1999). Ideally, therefore, our findings on subsistence lifestyles have impacts for environmental managers beyond their imme diate reports. We acknowledge that historical reports are often irrelevant to indigenous people because \"history does not usually deal with what they really value ab out their native cultur es: their language, Introduction 34 previously published reports (see Kelly 1986)\u2014this approach has also influenced our research protocol (see section on res earch ethics below).

We acknowledge that historical reports are often irrelevant to indigenous people because \"history does not usually deal with what they really value ab out their native cultur es: their language, Introduction 35 religions, oral traditions, ar ts, and kin networks\" (Ortiz 1988). Moreover, we realize that our reports will not be seen as discreet academic products with specific means and ends by tribal community member s. As Angela Wilson points out, Our role as historians should be to examine as many perspectives as possible. But, the greatest lessons of these stories are to the young people, the children, and the grandchi ldren of the elders and stor ytellers, who will gain an understanding of where they come from, who they are, and what is expected of them as a Dine, as an A pache, as a Laguna, as a Choctaw, and as a Dakota (Wilson 1998). Therefore, as researchers, we do not pretend our research exists in a vacuum of academic or scientific protocol. Our work has potential political impacts, and we believe, following anthropologist Peter Whit ely (1997), that we consider and address the effects of disseminating our studies and a ttend to and conform to the interests of the local communities in constructing our research projects. By doing this, we can make sustainable research connections wit h Native communities as well as meet their specific needs in both the short and long term (Ranco 2006). Most of our work has not involved sustai ned, direct interviews regarding cultural knowledge about resources (due to time and resource issues, we have focused on scientific evidence already in the public dom ain), but this has not prevented us from engaging community members, from gaining their input on the scientific evidence that founds the exposure scenario. Our se lf-conscious approach to collaboration (in consideration of science's role in coloni zation) has meant that we create many opportunities for feedback in t he scientific process. One ex ample of such a feedback loop can be seen below (Figure 25). Figure 25.

Our se lf-conscious approach to collaboration (in consideration of science's role in coloni zation) has meant that we create many opportunities for feedback in t he scientific process. One ex ample of such a feedback loop can be seen below (Figure 25). Figure 25. Ecological and Anthropological Review Process (Fred Corey, Aroostook Band of Micmacs) Introduction 36 Figure 25 shows our concern for tribal input and review, especially in the data gathering part of the exposure scenario pr ocess. We are committed to the notion that all cultural and historic al evidence be at least commented on by tribal cultural and natural resource personnel and elders. We also believe that tribal governmental approval endorsing the study happen early on in the process, so that tribal personnel will have a mandate to engage the re search as it occurs, not after-the-fact. Again, this process allows for better science, as community-based experts have the opportunity to critique scientific evidence already in the public domain\u2014this is captured by the feedback loop between \"D ata Gathered by Anthropologists\" and \"Tribal Review\" in Figure 25. For quality control purposes, we also have opportunities, depending on the community and funding, for project advisors and internal review before we submit the expo sure scenario to a formal, external peer review. This process ensures both internal tr ibal validation as we ll as validation from the scientific community. B.3 ECOREGION METHODS One of the objectives of this project was to develop traditional tribal subsistence exposure scenarios based on particular eco- cultural zones or ecoregions. Thus, one of our initial tasks was to explore existing literature and various Websites to examine the perspective and approach accepted by federal agencies and other research organizations to describe ecoregions or ecol ogical zones for the co ntinental U.S. We sought a common developed framework th at had been validated by the scientific community upon which to apply our work. We were also interested in a framework that was Internet accessible and compat ible with GIS applications, which would allow us to layer cultural and other types of maps. B.3.1 Development of a Common Framework of Ecoregions We discovered early on there is much discussion among federal agencies and researchers on the subject of develop ing a common framew ork of ecoregions (Omernik 2004). Historically, earth science and resource management agencies that manage land and resources within a co mmon geographic area have worked independently. Activities of each agency ce nter on an individual agency's mission and areas of expertise, and these differenc es have been reflected in the spatial frameworks that agencies use in the planning, design, implementation, and evaluation of their work. The recent impetus to develop a co mmon scheme for identifying and mapping ecoregions came about in 1994 when the U.S. Government Accounting Office (U.S. GAO) produced a report that stipulated a need for a common geographic framework that would allow management to be conducted by ecological rather than political or administrative regions (U.S. GAO 1994). The second recent effort to develop a common ecological framework occurred in 1996, when nine federal agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding, \"Developing a Spatial Fram ework of Ecological Unit s of the United States\" Introduction 36 Figure 25 shows our concern for tribal input and review, especially in the data gathering part of the exposure scenario pr ocess.

The second recent effort to develop a common ecological framework occurred in 1996, when nine federal agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding, \"Developing a Spatial Fram ework of Ecological Unit s of the United States\" Introduction 37 (McMahon et al. 2001). The group formed to address the problem was called National Interagency Technical Team (NI TT), and it agreed to develop a spatial framework to provide the basis fo r interagency ecosystem management. The following agencies part icipated on the NITT: Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) US Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) Agricultural Research Service Bureau of Land Management (BLM) US Geological Survey (USGS) National Park Service Fish and Wildlife Service National Biological Service (currently known as Biological Resources Division of USGS) US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) The NITT did not include tribal representat ives or non-profit organizations. The task faced by the NITT was difficult because of lack of agreement over the definition of ecoregions and how they should be mapped. Definitions were shaped not only by agencies or programs from wh ich these members came, but also by educational backgrounds and experiences. For example, geographers, biologists, soil scientists, regional planners, foresters, co nservationists, etc. bring t heir bias to the meaning of the term \"ecology\" and how ecoregions should be defined. G eologists start with geology and use other characteristics as th ey relate to geology; plant ecologists probably base their regions more heavily on patterns of potential and existing vegetation, climatologi sts on climate, etc. The greatest impediment to agreeing on how to define ecoregions occurs because: (1) of the inherent complexity of ecosystem s, in that they are dynamic; features change and constantly shift, and they are not closed system s; (2) although the framework is hierarchical, boundaries are not precise and r egions at different levels of detail do not nest perfectly, and (3) hum ans affect the stability of ecosystems and the identity of ecological regions by fr agmenting the spatial structure of the landscape, changing the physical and chemical s conditions within which ecological systems operate (McMahon et al. 2001). In fact, ecoregion boundaries are areas, rather than lines, where t he predominant characteristi cs of one region meet the predominant characteristics of another. The goal of the NITT was to develop a map of common ecological regions for the conterminous U.S. (areas that share a common boundary) (McMahon et al. 2001). They established a working definition of an ecoregion to read: areas of similarity regarding patterns in the mosaic of biotic , abiotic, aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystem components, with humans being considered par t of the biota (McMahon et al. 2001, Omernik 2004). The intent of developi ng the common definitio n and framework is that this effort will foster an ecological understanding of the landscape rather than an understanding based on a single resource, scientific discipline, or agency Introduction 37 (McMahon et al. 2001).

The intent of developi ng the common definitio n and framework is that this effort will foster an ecological understanding of the landscape rather than an understanding based on a single resource, scientific discipline, or agency Introduction 38 perspective. The new framework was not intended to replace individual agency frameworks that will continue to be used when they serve a specific purpose. However, the new framework was deemed to be useful for agency activities that are ecologically oriented and involve intere sts of several participating agencies. It was decided that the spatial framework was to be hierarchical, with ecological regions defined at two map scales: 1. small-map scale, with less resoluti on and greater extent (overall area), dividing the U.S. into 80-90 regions for state-level a nd broad regional and national assessment 2. large-map scale, with higher resoluti on and less extent, subdividing the U.S. into coarser regions Map compilation relies on appropriately scale d information about factors that affect ecological potential, such as soils, vegetation, geology, physiography, hydrology, climate, land use, and wildlife. Finally, r egions defined at the la rger map scale will nest into smaller map scale framework (1:7,500,000-scale) Currently, much progress has been made in developing this common framework, first exploring areas of agreement and di sagreement in three federal natural- resource spatial frameworks: 1. Major Land Resource Areas of the USDA, 2. National Hierarchy of Ecological Units of the USDA Forest Service, and 3. Level III Ecoregions of the USEPA. The common framework effort is ongoing wo rk and not yet completed. Ecoregions resulting from this effort may fit within, and potentially may be used to revise, the framework of ecological regions of Nort h America developed by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC). The CEC is an international, interagency supported by the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Commission developed and published maps of two broad levels of ecological regions for N. America (rather than just the U.S. ) in 1997, which are described in Ecological Regions of North America: Toward a Common Perspective (CEC 1997). The most holistic framework to date, however, is t hat of the CEC, which may also be the dominant framework eventually adopted by the NITT. The CEC effort, formed with a trilateral working group from the U.S., Me xico, and Canada, was the first attempt at holistically classifying and m apping ecological regions acro ss all three countries of the North American continent. The worki ng group hoped to foster cooperative work to protect the environment, to insure the su stainability of resources, and to study the effect of human activities on ecosystems. For these reasons we have chosen Ecological Regions of No rth America: Toward a Common Perspective (CEC 1997) as the framework for identifying and describing the components of the major ecological regions in developing the exposure Introduction 38 perspective.

For these reasons we have chosen Ecological Regions of No rth America: Toward a Common Perspective (CEC 1997) as the framework for identifying and describing the components of the major ecological regions in developing the exposure Introduction 39 scenarios. A large contribution to this framework came from Jim Omernik (U.S. EPA), author of the ecoregions used in National Nutrient Strategy Approach (Omernik 1995). However, the CEC ec oregions are those listed on the USEPA Website for reference and downloading. See http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions/na_eco.htm . B.3.2 Our Choice of Framework: CEC Hierarchical Spat ial Framework of Ecoregions Ecological Regions of North Amer ica: Toward a Common Perspective has been chosen as the classification system for i dentifying the major ecological regions. The approaches used to develop the classification include: (1) opinions from ecologists and other scientists on relevant features fo r each region and (2) a data matrix that could be used to build each ecological leve l (CEC 1997). This ecological framework was developed by federal, stat e, provincial, and territorial agencies, and represented a shift towards a more comprehensive , continental scale approach\u2014one that includes not only assessments of trade, but also strives to foster cooperative work to protect the environment, to insure the sust ainability of resources, and to study the effect of human activities on ecosystems (CEC 1997). Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. T hey are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, asse ssment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. By re cognizing the spatial differences in the capacities and potentials of ecosystems, ecoregions stratify the environment by its probable response to disturbance (Br yce et al. 1999). These general purpose regions are critical for structuri ng and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are respons ible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The most immediate ne eds by the states are for developing regional biological criteria and wate r resource standards, and for setting management goals for nonpoint-source pollution. Explanation of the methods used to delineate the ecoregions are given in Omernik (1995) and Gallant et al. (1989). This series of maps has been produced as part of a regional interagency collaborative project aimed at obtaining consensus bet ween the EPA, the NRCS, and the USFS regardi ng alignments of ec ological regions. Diagnostic criteria for t he mapped areas are based on enduring ecosystem components (CEC 1997). The term \"enduring\" means the components are relatively stable and do not change appreciably over ecological time. This includes components such as soil, landform, or majo r vegetation types. Climate is considered but is unique because it must be assess ed by looking at long term records. The approach used to compile ecoregion maps is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified th rough the analysis of the patterns and the composition of biotic and abi otic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and int egrity (Wiken 1986, Omernik 1987, 1995).

These Introduction 40 phenomena include geology, physiography, veget ation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. A hierarchical scheme has been adopt ed for different levels of ecological regions, and is being used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 2004). The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another regardless of t he hierarchical level. Because of possible confusion with other m eanings of terms for different le vels of ecological regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme has been adopted for this effort. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions, whereas at Level II the continent is subdivided into 52 classes (CEC 1997). Level III represents further detail. Level IV ecoregions are under constr uction, with significant number of states having been completed at this level; see Figure 26. Figure 26. Example of the Hierarchical Form of EPA Ecoregions In describing the characteristics of ecoregi ons in the Guidance Manual, references from other frameworks have been made. These include: Terrestrial Ecoregions of North America (Ricketts et al. 1999) , Freshwater Ecoregions of North America: A Conservation Assessment (Abell et al. 2000) , and the USDA Description of the Ecoregions of t he United States (Bailey 1995) . Although the literature cites similarities between Ecological Regions of North America: Level I and Level II and the mentioned resources, additional info rmation is needed to determine whether additional frameworks can be used for descr ibing the major ecological regions. B.3.3 Description of Ecoregion Levels Level I: North America has been divided into 15 broad, Level I ecological regions (Figure 21). Determination of the areas composing the regions has been made through satellite imagery and appropriate nat ural resource source maps at broad scales (1:40-1:50 million-scale presentati on). These ecoregions highlight major ecological areas and provide the broad backd rop to the ecological mosaic of the continent, putting it in context at global or intercontinental scales. Viewing the ecological hierarchy at this scale pr ovides a context for seeing global or intercontinental patterns. Level I ecological regions are: Arctic Cordillera, Tundra, Taiga, Hudson Plains, Northern Forests, Northwestern Forested Mountains, Marine Introduction 40 phenomena include geology, physiography, veget ation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology.

Level I ecological regions are: Arctic Cordillera, Tundra, Taiga, Hudson Plains, Northern Forests, Northwestern Forested Mountains, Marine Introduction 41 West Coast Forests, Eastern Temperate Forests, Great Plai ns, North American Deserts, Mediterranean California, S outhern Semi-Arid Highlands, Temperate Sierras, Tropical Dry Forests, and Tropical Wet Forests. Brief narrative descriptions of each level I region can be found in Section III of the CEC's (1997) publication, Ecological Regions of Nort h America: Toward a Common Perspective . These descriptions\u2014each of which is divided into sections describing the physical setting, biological setting, and human activities therein\u2014provide an overview of the principal attributes of each region. The intent is to provide a sense of the ecological diversity, the human intera ctions taking place, and how each region differs from adjacent ones. Level II: The 52 Level II ecological regions (s hown in Figure 27) that have been delineated are intended to pr ovide a more detailed description and national/regional perspective of the large ec ological areas nested within the Level I regions. For example, the Tropical Wet Forests of Level I is the region covering coastal portions of the United States and Mexico, and is composed of six Level II regions. Level II ecological regions are useful for national and subcontinental overviews of ecological patterns. Three Level I regions (Hudson Plains, Marine West Coast Forest, and Mediterranean California) have no subdivisions at Level II. The Temperate Sierras, Tropical Dry Forests, and Tropical Wet Fo rests Level I regions, on the other hand, each have six Level II subdivisions. This level is useful for national and subcontinental overviews of physiography, wildlife, and land use.

Introduction 43 ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/or/or_eco_pg.pdf Figure 29. Level III and IV Ecoregions of Oregon B.4 DIET Kelly (1995) described the concept of systema tic evaluation of eco-cultural lifestyles for efficiency and resource use patterns, also known as foraging theory. This concept includes labels for people such as hunter-gatherers and foragers, which unfortunately leads to mental images of people barely surviving by randomly foraging around the landscape for something to eat. In reality, t hese labels describe people living within an informed educat ional system based on traditional environmental knowledge, systematic observati on, rich languages, exquisite crafts, and adaptability. In the 1960s to 1980s the \"Man the Hunter\" concept of subsist ence lifestyles (with males providing most of the provender) pr evailed due to a previous archaeological emphasis on hunting and warfare artifact s (Lee and Devore 1968). This gave way in the 1990s to a more balanced foraging mo del that recognized the importance of plants as much as meat (and equality of genders in contributing to survival) and a relatively peaceful and secure \"original affluent society\" (Sahlins 1972). The latter concept is supported by data (Kelly 1995, Winterhalder 1981, Steegman 1983) on the amount of time required to obtain surv ival necessities and to raise children, and the typically abundant amount of time av ailable for socializing, education, ceremonies, material items, leisure, orat ories, and so on. Wint erhalder (1981) further elaborated this view by evaluating in formation about ecotypes, biodiversity, Introduction 43 ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/or/or_eco_pg.pdf Figure 29.

Wint erhalder (1981) further elaborated this view by evaluating in formation about ecotypes, biodiversity, Introduction 44 abundance, patchiness, species abundance, and tr avel times to various resources in the boreal zone to confirm that indige nous traditional environmental knowledge is intimately informed through general knowled ge and constant observation for efficient recovery of resources. In foraging theory, efficiency or return ra te for specific resources obtained from specific habitats is estimated by evaluat ing the amount of calories expended in getting food (search costs) by means of hunting, gathering, or fishing relative to time spent or calories obtained. Foraging info rmation is typically presented as return rates, or net calories obtained per hour of effort. Depending on the evaluation methods used in a study, this return ra te data may include (1 ) time and calories spent in preparing to hunt, fish, or gather (e .g., making nets), (2) time and/or calories spent in the actual activity, and (3) time s pent in the processing of the resource after obtaining it. Several submodels have been proposed: Diet Breadth: In this model, resources are ranked by their value to the forager. Foraging is divided into two phases : search costs (time or energy) to encounter each unit of potential resource species and the pursuit costs for each unit. An optimal diet is one that adds resources to those pursued in decreasing rank order until s earch costs for a resource start to exceed energy return. Patch Selectivity: Since most resources are unev enly distributed, the forager must randomly move over the environm ent and allocate time and effort to travel to various patches of various qua lity, according to which resources are needed, until the travel time exceeds the value of the resource gained. Movement among Habitats: The marginal value model assumes that the forager pre-selects the patches to be visi ted, first using the resources that are closest and best, and gradually moving to lower quality patches farther away until the travel time is so great that t he residence is moved and/or hi switches to different resources. The drawback of oversimplifying foraging solely to caloric efficiency is that micronutrients (vitamins, miner als, specific amino acids, and fatty acids), medicinal or pharmacologically active compounds, other nutritional requirements, and non- nutritional attributes, such as aroma or dye or material uses may not be considered (Lindstrom 1992). Similarly, many plants and animals have multiple uses or are co- located with other resources; therefore, caloric calculati ons must not ignore the way that people actually make decisions about w here to go or what to gather, or the reasons they seek to obtai n particular resources. Sanger (1988) points out that develo ping a foraging picture based solely on archaeological evidence is inadequate bec ause the ratio between marine and terrestrial remains in sites and the ratio between plants and fish and bone among middens is not equal.

Together, the amount of hunting and fishing gear in evidence, the seasonal round, the settlement pattern relative to k nown resources, human bone isotope ratios, pollen profiles over time, and so on give a fa irly accurate picture of the overall diet (Sanger 1988). The dietary input for the risk assessment is typically somewhat less complex than a food pyramid (due to intrinsic limitations of the risk methods). Nevertheless, the risk assessment must consider the totality of species and calories. Therefore, the food pyramids consider the number of species and the foraging studies with their dietary estimates, and identify potential toxins. As noted in Section B.2.1, the steps developed to recons truct an ecologically based diet are: 1. Review ecological and foraging informa tion specific to the tribe, and the local ecosystem(s); 2. Review interviews and other ar chaeological and ethnographic sources for supporting information of species and abundance, habitat types, human activity levels, and methods of obtaini ng, preparing, and using resources; 3.

Default exposure factors have been developed for conventiona l suburban, urban, occupational, and recreational scenarios based on national statistics and assumptions about the activity patterns that compose those sit uations. The approach for developing a tribal scenario is similar, except that large st atistical databases are not available. The basic assumption is that traditional Native American lifeways continue to be active outdoor lifestyles that are moderately physically demandi ng, even with some modern conveniences. Information about especially active individuals is considered; for example, young Indian bachelors (\"pure men\" or \"runners\") would run down game and serve as messengers (Speck 1979). Not everyone is considered to be this athletic, but this kind of information is us ed to confirm a moderately active lifestyle. The conceptual steps in this process are: 1. Understand the lifestyle and the activiti es that comprise the lifestyle, and are required to obtain necessities an d engage in the community culture; 2. Describe the day, the year, and the lif etime of Maine Indian men and women to identify any significant differences in activity levels between genders or ages; 3. Cross-walk activities with exposur e pathways on the basis of frequency and duration of major activities, activi ty levels, and degree of environmental contact, and 4. Estimate cumulative exposure factors. B.5.1 Major Activities Indigenous subsistence foragers (both gende rs) perform a combination of aerobic (high pulse and ventilation ra tes), strength, endurance, and stretching-flexibility activities daily, as well as performing more sedentary work and resting. Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 26 show the thought proce ss for considering the wide range and numerous activities associated with the majo r activity categories (hunting, fishing, gathering, and sweat lodge purificat ion). In actuality, many activities are sequential\u2014 for example, a resource might be gathered in one location, used in a second location to make an implement or basket, and taken to a third location for use in hunting or fishing. 5 The activities shown in Figure 32 and Table 2 are so interconnected that it is virtually impossible to separate a lifestyle into distinct categories, but they are presented as separate for illustration. 5 This is similar to the Cultural Ecosystem Storie s concept developed Terry Williams (Tulalip Tribes) with the associated software, ICONS (see, for example, http://www.epa.gov/owow/watershed/wacademy/ wam/comresource.html ).

Activities associated wi th smoking and constructing drying racks may be involved. Remains are returned to aquatic ecosystems. Gathering Women gathered plants, bark, and firewood up to a day or two distant from the camp or village using a digging stick, knife, and basket or other means for carrying resources back to camp. A variet y of activities is involved, such as hiking, bending, stooping, wading (marsh and water plants), digging, bundling, carrying, and climbing over a wide variety of terrains. Ritual purification (sweat lodge) Sweat lodge building and repairing is intermittent, but collecting firewood is a constant activity. Willoughby (1906) and McBride and Prins (1983, citing Denys) suggest that the sweat lodge was used weekly or monthly, either in a cave or in a small structure covered with mats or skins.

Many item s are gathered during one season for year-round use. While specific activities change from season to season, they are replaced by other activi ties with a similar environmental contact rate. For instance, a particular plant may be gathered during one month, while another month may be spent hunting, and a winter month may include cleaning and using the items obtained previously. We generally assume that all activities are roughly equal, that there is no decrease in environmental contact rates during winte r months. The main winter foods were fresh, dried, and frozen meats and fish, dried berries, seeds, dried root and seed cakes, and teas and medicines. Gathering firewood was required year-round. There was also winter fishing and hunting, as well as an emphasis on making tools, baskets, and other material items. Food and material preparation were constantly required regardless of the season. B.5.2 Exposure Factors for Direct Exposure Pathways For the purposes of developing these expos ure factors, the description of tribal activities focused on: Frequency of activity: Daily, weekly, monthly Duration of activity: Hours at a time Number of years Intensity of environmental contact and intensity of activity Drinking Water: The Spokane and Umatilla scenarios (Harper et al. 2000, Harris and Harper 1997) recommended 3L/d for the hot arid climate of the Columbia Basin. However, other climates are cooler and moister. Two liters might be appropriate elsewhere. Soil and Sediment Ingestion: Soil ingestion includes consi deration of direct ingesti on of dirt, mud, or dust, swallowing inhaled dust, mouthi ng of objects, ingestion of dirt or dust on food, and hand-to-mouth contact. We recommend an indigenous soil ingestion rate of 400mg/day based on a review of EPA guidance, soil ingestion studies in suburban and indigenous settings, and dermal adherence studies (see Appendix for more detail). It is also based on knowledge about tribal subsistence lifestyles with their higher environmental contact rates and loca l climatic and geologic conditions.

There are also likely to be many intermediate-contact days, depending on the o ccupation (e.g., wildlife field work, construction or road work, cultur al resource field work). The soil ingestion rate of 400mg/d fo r all ages is the published upper bound for suburban children (EPA 1997), and is within t he range of outdoor activity rates for adults but lower than the typical 4 80mg/d applied to intermittent outdoor occupations. Tribal subsistence lifestyles were not considered by the EPA guidance, but are generally considered to be similar in soil contact rates to construction, utility worker or military soil contact levels. T he U.S. military assume s 480mg per exposure event6 or per field day. The UN Balkans Task Fo rce assumes that 1 gram of soil can be ingested per military field day.7 Anecdotally, U.S. forces deployed in Iraq report frequent grittiness in the mouth and food. Haywood and Smith (1990) also considered sensory reports of grittiness in their estimate of 1-10g/d in aboriginal Australians. Simon (1998) reviewed soil ingestion st udies from a perspective of risk and dose assessment. Because of their high dependenc e on the land, indigenous peoples are at highest risk for inadvertent ingestion, along with professions that may bring workers into close and continual contact with the soil. Simon recommends using a soil ingestion rate for indi genous people in hunt er/food gathering/nomadic societies of 1g/d in wet climates and 2g/d in dry climates. He recommends using 3g/d for all indigenous children. This is higher than the prior EPA default value of 200mg/day (USEPA 1989). This rate reflects both i ndoor dust and continuous outdoor activities analogous to gardening or camping (van W ijnen 1990), but it is less than a single- incident sports or construction ingestion ra te (Boyd 1999). After considering all of the exposure pathways and activities, this report recommends the use of 400mg/d per day. Inhalation Rate: The inhalation rate in indigenous scenarios reflects the active, outdoor lifestyle of traditional tribal members. Traditional tribal communities have no sedentary members except the frail elderly, whereas one-quarter of moder n American adults of all ages report no leisure time physical activity at all.8 The activity levels associated with the traditional lifesty le and diet based on published anthropological studies, ethnographic literature on fo raging theory, hunting- gathering lifestyles, and interviews with tribal members were ev aluated (see Appendix). Using EPA guidance on hourly inhalation rates for different activi ty levels, a reasonable inhalation rate for an average tribal member's active lifestyle is a median rate of 26.2m3/d.

Introduction 54 based on 8 hours sleeping at 0.4m3/hr, 2 hours sedentary at 0.5m3/hr, 6 hours light activity at 1m3/hr, 6 hours moderate activity at 1.6m3/hr, and 2 hours heavy activity at 3.2m3/hr. Unlike most other exposure factors, which are upper bounds, the inhalation rate is a median rate. This is rounded down to 25m3/day based on the relation of oxygen utilizat ion to caloric intake. Dermal Exposures: The dermal pathway has not been fully researched for this scenario, but EPA methods9 for dermal exposure can be used. Two relevant papers are summarized here. Kissel et al. (1996) included reed gat herers in tide flats in a study of dermal adherence. The category of \"kids in mud\" at a lakeshore had by far the highest skin loadings, with an average of 35mg/cm2 for 6 children and an average of 58mg/cm2 for another 6 children. Reed gatherers were next highest at 0.66mg/cm2 with an upper bound of >1mg/cm2. This was followed by farmers and rugby players (approximately 0.4mg/cm2) and irrigation installers (0.2mg/cm2). Holmes et al. (1999) studied 99 individuals in a va riety of occupations. Farmers, reed gatherers, and kids in mud had the highest overall skin loadings. The next highest skin loadings on the hands were for equipm ent operators, gardeners, construction, and utility workers (0.3mg/cm2), followed by archaeologi sts, and several other occupations (0.15-0.1 mg/cm2). In the future, a mo re refined approach that considers numbers of days or hours in va rious habitats and activities and matches that information with soil ingestion rate could be used. For example, the soil ingestion rate and dermal adherence rate should both consider the number of mud- event days and the proportion of wetlands present in the region of the location where the scenario is being applied. 9 http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/risk/ragse/ Introduction 54 based on 8 hours sleeping at 0.4m3/hr, 2 hours sedentary at 0.5m3/hr, 6 hours light activity at 1m3/hr, 6 hours moderate activity at 1.6m3/hr, and 2 hours heavy activity at 3.2m3/hr.

An exposure scenario is a narrative and numerical representation of the interactions between human rec eptors and their immediate environment. Exposure scenarios include m edia-specific and pathway-s pecific exposure factors that reflect the degree of environmental contact for eac h medium and each exposure pathway, expressed as the frequency, dur ation, and intensity of contact. If environmental contamination is present, th e exposure factors are used to estimate human exposure, expressed as the dose of each contaminant to the person for whom the exposure scenario is develo ped. The dose of each contaminant is combined with its toxicity to develop and es timate of health risk to the person. Exposure factors can also be used to develop environmental standards to ensure that natural resource s are safe to use. Even though many tribal lands have been lost and resources degraded, there are generally more traditional or subsistence pr actices followed by tribal members than the general non-native population realizes. Additi onally, the objective of many tribes is to regain land, restore resources, and encourage more members to practice healthier (i.e., more traditional) lifestyles. Therefore, t he objective of subsistence exposure scenarios is to describe the orig inal lifestyles and resource uses, not to present a current snapshot of restricted or suppressed uses, because the intent is to restore the ecology so that the original pattern of resource uses is both possible (after resources are restored) and safe (after contamination is removed). This is a different situation than fo r the general American populati on, where the intent of remediation is to allow people to continue their current (and portable) lifestyle in a newly cleaned location. For the general United States population, an exposure scenario is typically designed to describe an upper bound ( generally around the 75th percentile) of the population being assessed. Some individua l exposure factors are the 90th or 95th percentile; others are mean values. In the case of tribal exposure scenarios, there are no tribal- specific databases of subsistence activities, resources, or diets as there are for the general United States population. Cross-sectional su rveys of current tribal populations will not generate that data because much resource use has been suppressed due to loss of land and acce ss, awareness of contamination, prosecution by the dominant society, and other reasons. This means that large and accurate statistical distributions for subs istence exposure factors are not available and cannot be developed unless only a fully subsis tent subset of the tribe is studied, and this is not possible because the traditi onal subsistent members resist being studied and measured. Therefor e, ranges of exposures, or specified percentiles of exposure are not possible to calculate. T he Elem Scenario is reconstructed as a reasonable representation of the traditional subsistence lifestyle, equivalent to a central tendency of this lifestyle ra ther than a statis tical upper bound.

T he Elem Scenario is reconstructed as a reasonable representation of the traditional subsistence lifestyle, equivalent to a central tendency of this lifestyle ra ther than a statis tical upper bound. Elem (Pomo) Scenario 65 For the general suburban population the expo sure scenario is well defined in EPA guidance (Exposure Factors Handbooks). The Elem tribal scenario is based on the lifestyle and baseline conditions of the regional natural resources. This scenario identifies general exposure pa thways specific to Elem lifestyles and key resources that the Elem people use. It starts wit h a general description of baseline natural resources that are (or should be) present in the study area. A general understanding of what people do (or would do in the absence of contamination) and what resour ces are available for their use provides the basis for developing preliminary exposur e factors. Then the scenario describes the activities that traditional people undertake to surviv e and thrive in that local ecosystem, including hunting, gathering foods and medicines, fishing, making material items, farming or gardening, raising li vestock, irrigating, and vari ous cultural and domestic activities. As mentioned, the exposure scenario refl ects a traditional subsistence lifestyle. Subsistence refers to the hunting, fish ing, and gathering activities that are fundamental to the way of life of many indigenous peo ples. Today's subsistence economies utilize traditional and modern tec hnologies for harvesting and preserving foods and for distributing the produce th rough communal networks of sharing and bartering. The following is a useful explanation of \"subsistence, \" taken from the National Park Service: While non-natives tend to define subsis tence in terms of poverty or the minimum amount of food necessary to support life, native people equate subsistence with their culture. Among m any tribes, maintaining a subsistence lifestyle has become the symbol of thei r survival in the face of mounting political and economic pressures. It defines who they are as a people. To Native Americans who continue to depend on natural resources, subsistence is more than eking out a living. While it is important to the economic well- being of their communities, the subsist ence lifestyle is also the basis of cultural existence and survival. It is a communal activity. It unifies communities as cohesive functioning units through collective production and distribution of the harves t. Some groups have formalized patterns of sharing, while others do so in more informal wa ys. Entire families participate, including elders, who assist with less physically demanding tasks. Parents teach the young to hunt, fish, and farm. Food and goods are also distributed through native cultural institutions. Most require young hunters to distribute their first catch throughout the community. Subsist ence embodies cultural values that recognize both the social obligation to share as well as the special spiritual relationship to the land and resources. This relationship is portrayed in native art and in many ceremonies held throughout the year. 3 In economic terms, a subsistence economy is one in which a dollar currency is limited because many goods and services ar e produced and consumed by the same 3 National Park Service: http://www.cr.nps.gov/aad/cg/fa_1999/Subsist.htm Elem (Pomo) Scenario 65 For the general suburban population the expo sure scenario is well defined in EPA guidance (Exposure Factors Handbooks).

Today, currency (symbol s of specified quantities of useful resources) is limited, but important, so many indigenous families include members whose role is to acquire various types of wealth. The subsistence economy does include currencies of goods, services, knowle dge, obligation, and respect, as well as 'money' or symbols of work t hat are used to 'buy' goods or services whose use is displaced in time and space from their production. Examples of money include wampum and, today, dollars. Wealth can be measured in other ways, including the security that comes from an abundance of re spect that ensures that resources will be provided to the family even in lean time s, as well as from community well-being and sensory loading from the beautiful and aromatic natural surroundings. For example, subsistence in an Arctic community includes the following: The modern-day subsistence family depends on the tools of the trade, most of which are expensive. Snowmobile s, gasoline, guns, fishing nets, and sleeping bags are necessities. Subsist ence households also enjoy many of the modern conveniences of life, and are saddled with the economic demands which come with their acquisi tion. Today's subsistence family generates much-needed cash as wage- labourers, part-time workers and trappers, professional business people, traditional craftmakers, and seasonal workers. A highly-integrated inte rdependence between formal (cash-based) and informal (barter and subsistence- based) economic sectors has evolved.4 Once the activities composing a particular subsistence lifestyle are known, they are translated into a form that is used for ri sk assessment. This translation captures the degree of environmental contact that occurs through activities and diet, expressed as numerical exposure factors . Exposure factors for direct exposure pathways include exposure to abiotic media (air, wate r, soil, and sediment), which can result in inhalation, soil ingestion, water ingestion, and dermal exposure. Indirect pathways refer to contaminants that are incorpor ated into biota and subsequently expose people who ingest or use them. There are many unique exposure pathways that are not accounted for in scenarios for the gener al public, but may be significant to people with certain traditional specialties su ch as basket making, flint knapping, or using natural medicines, smoke, smudges, paints, and dyes. These activities may result in increased dust inhalation, soil i ngestion, soil loading onto the skin for dermal exposure, or exposure via wounds, to give a few examples. While the portals of entry into the body are the same for everyo ne (primarily via the lungs, skin, mouth), the amount of contaminants may be increased and the relati ve importance of some activities (e.g., baske t making, wetlands gatheri ng), pathways (e.g., steam immersion or medicinal infusions), or por tals of entry (e.g., dermal wounding) may be different than for th e general population. Foraging theory data from the anthropological literature is particularly useful for developing exposure scenarios because the major dietary and resource staples may be described, as well as how much time and effort is needed to obtain them. 4 http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/Na tResources/subsistglobal.html Elem (Pomo) Scenario 66 families or bands.

This process is laid out in the following se ctions according to the general sequence: 1. Environmental setting\u2014what resources are available; 2. Lifestyle description\u2014activities and their frequency, duration and intensity, and resource use; 3. Diet; 4. Exposure pathways, and 5. Exposure factors \u2014iterative cross-walk bet ween pathways and direct exposure factors: cumulative soil, water, air, and dietary exposures. Because the method for developing expo sure factors is derived from an understanding of lifestyle rather than from large statistical databases (national drinking water rates, or USDA databases of national average food intakes) and is unfamiliar to many readers, it is descri bed briefly here (more detail is presented below). Because large databases are not available and cannot be constructed, we take a top-down approach. For example, we do not attempt to develop a complete diet based on surveys of the uses of the typi cal 200+ natural resources available and used with an ecoregion. Rather, we develop a calorically complete estimate of a 2000kcal/day diet that identifies the majo r staples and their rough percentages in the original diet. Similarly, we do not devel op an average day by tracking hundreds of individual activities from many people. The basic process is to: 1. Start with an understanding of the major categories of subsistence activities (such as hunting, fishing, gatheri ng, basket making, and sweat lodge purification), 2. Describe enough of the sub-activities that the complexity and interconnection of resources and activities can be understood, 3. Identify the major activities t hat contribute to exposure, and then 4. Iteratively cross-walk between activiti es and conventional exposure factors to develop cumulative exposure factors. To illustrate, each of the major activity cat egories includes activities that result in exposure to soil, and therefore soil ingesti on. By estimating the relative amount of time spent in activities that result in high, medium, or low soil exposure for each activity category, an overall soil-ingestion ra te can be estimated. However, we do not attempt to be overly quantitat ive in enumerating the myriad activities and resources in each category \u2014this requires more precision than is warranted and is likely to require proprietary information that cannot be released. Elem (Pomo) Scenario 67 Together, this information is then used for the food-chain portion of the scenario and to calculate the direct exposure factors. This process is laid out in the following se ctions according to the general sequence: 1. Environmental setting\u2014what resources are available; 2. Lifestyle description\u2014activities and their frequency, duration and intensity, and resource use; 3. Diet; 4. Exposure pathways, and 5. Exposure factors \u2014iterative cross-walk bet ween pathways and direct exposure factors: cumulative soil, water, air, and dietary exposures. Because the method for developing expo sure factors is derived from an understanding of lifestyle rather than from large statistical databases (national drinking water rates, or USDA databases of national average food intakes) and is unfamiliar to many readers, it is descri bed briefly here (more detail is presented below). Because large databases are not available and cannot be constructed, we take a top-down approach. For example, we do not attempt to develop a complete diet based on surveys of the uses of the typi cal 200+ natural resources available and used with an ecoregion. Rather, we develop a calorically complete estimate of a 2000kcal/day diet that identifies the majo r staples and their rough percentages in the original diet. Similarly, we do not devel op an average day by tracking hundreds of individual activities from many people. The basic process is to: 1. Start with an understanding of the major categories of subsistence activities (such as hunting, fishing, gatheri ng, basket making, and sweat lodge purification), 2. Describe enough of the sub-activities that the complexity and interconnection of resources and activities can be understood, 3. Identify the major activities t hat contribute to exposure, and then 4.

Elem (Pomo) Scenario 68 Finally, a review of existing literature (biomedical, anthropological, and so on) enables us to double-check whether multiple lines of evidence leads us to a similar conclusion for each exposure factor.

Baseline environmental conditions ar e approximated. This is not a fixed year, but rather a condition of natural resour ces. In the case of Elem, baseline conditions refer to the early-contac t time period when there were still ample resources and minimal land loss. This time period extends to as recently as 100-200 years ago, before the er a of the large California irri gation projects and development of the California interior and the Clear Lake region. The overall territory of the Pomo peopl es is north of San Francisco Bay approximately 130 miles north to sout h and 100 miles east to west. Pomo environments include the coastal and redwo od belts, river valleys, and the Clear Lake area where Elem is located. It reaches from the coast to the Sacramento River in the interior California central valley (Baumhoff 1978, Barrett 1908). Habitation around Clear Lake began at least 10,000 to 12,000 years ago (Willig et al. 1988, McLendon and Lowry 1978). Each cluster of village communities (or 'tribelet') was slightly different from the next, resulting in a wi de range of cultures and seven languages. The Elem people were located in Elem , the largest of the southeastern Pomo villages, on Rattlesnake Island (or Sul phur Bank Island) in Clear Lake, and in two other smaller villages on Clear Lake (McLendon and Lowry 1978, Brown and Andrews 1969, Willig et al. 1988).

Ecological diversity is strongly related to it s varied climate, terrain, geology, and soil, and largely tracks the watersheds and physiog raphic regions shown in Section 2.1. In North America, several broad clim atic zones are recognized, roughly corresponding to temperature and moisture gradients. North American vegetation types roughly track these zones. Of these zones, the marine west coast, Mediterranean California, and northwestern fo rested mountains are relevant to the Elem Scenario. Because the zones are def ined by dominant vegetation types, the composition of plant and animal species is fairly predictable for the dominant species.

From the moss and fungi on t he forest floor to the rare marbled murrelets that nest only in the ancient trees , the ecosystem supports communities of plants and animals much more diverse than those of younger forests. On uplands where fire disturbance was once more comm on, redwoods mix with other big trees, such as Douglas fir, grand fir, western r ed hemlock, Sitka spruce, western red cedar, tanoak, bigleaf maple, California bay, and Po rt Orford cedar. These forests contain a rich understory of herbaceous plants, shrubs, treelets, ferns, and fungi, as well as a great diversity of animal life. Elem (Pomo) Scenario 81 2.3.3 Mediterranean California Ecoregi ons: Chaparral Woodlands Ce ntral California Valley Level II Ecoregion 11.1, Mediterranean Califor nia, extends 1,300k m from Oregon in the north to Baja California Norte in the s outh. It abuts the Paci fic Ocean on the west and the Sierra Nevada and deserts to the east. For more information on the Mediterranean California Ecoregion please refer to Ecological Regions of North America: Toward a Common Perspective , online at http://www.cec.org/files/PDF/ BIODIVERSITY/eco-eng_EN.pdf . The most specific ecological descriptions of the Elem Pomo territory are the Southern and Central Chaparral and Oak Woodlands Ecoregion 1 and the Central California Valley Ecoregion 2. Southern and Central Chapparal and Oak Woodlands: The distinguishing characteristic of this ecological regi on is its Mediterranean climate of hot dry summers and cool moist winters, and the associated vegetative cover: mainly chaparral and oak woodlands, with grasslands occurring in some lower elevations and patches of pine found at high er elevations. Most of t he region consists of open low mountains or foothills, with occasional ar eas of irregular plains in the south and near the border of the adjacent Central California Valley ecological region that this region encircles. Many species of oaks are native to this area: blue, scrub, coast live, canyon live, golden-cup, valley, interior live, and maul . In several areas, a base of serpentine rock supports plants which thrive in its pres ence, including several species of pines and cypresses (such as Sargent and McNab cypress), leather oak, interior silktassel, milkwort streptanthus, and Muir's hairstreak. Mammals are diverse here, ma king up 10 percent of the 60 endemic species\u2014the largest number of endemic mammals in any ecoregion in the United States or Canada. Sonoma chipmunks, Suisun shrews , salt marsh harvest mice, and many species of kangaroo rats call the area home. A variety of plethodontid, or lungless, salamanders also live here, includi ng five endemics. Scrub jays, acorn woodpeckers, and wrentits are three of t he area's 100 species of birds. Unusual invertebrates found here include army ants, ancient bristletails, and land snails. This ecoregion supports over 2000 species of plants in addition to trees. This is probably due to the fact t hat the area is a mosaic of grasslands, chaparral shrublands, open oak savannas, oak woodlands, serpentine communities, closed- cone pine forests, pockets of montane conifer forests, wetlands, salt marshes, and riparian forests. The area also ranges in elevat ion from 300 feet (90m) to 3,000 feet (900m). Oak woodland and chaparral are t he most common plant communities. Valleys contain foothill pines, California buckeye, manzanita, redbud, and chamise.

Central California Valley: The long, hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters of this flat-plained ecological region disti nguish it from neighbori ng regions that are either hilly or mountainous, forested or shrub covered. California's Central Valley Elem (Pomo) Scenario 82 was once a large temperate grassland with bunch grasses, the California Central Valley grasslands ecoregion, on which herds of pronghorn and elk grazed; some writers referred to it as \"America's Serengeti.\" The ar ea supported incredibly diverse habitats, including desert areas, prairies , savannas, woodlands, marshes, vernal pools (seasonal wetlands), and an immense river delta. The grasslands once provided plentiful food for pronghorn, elk, mule deer, California ground squirrels, and kangaroo rats. Their predators included coyotes, mountain lions, ringtails, bobcats, and San Joaquin Valley kit foxes, now a federally endangered species found only in southern foot hills. River areas were lined by a wide swath of trees such as willows, western sycamores, box elders, Fremont cottonwoods, and valley oaks. These riparian forests prov ided stopover points and breeding areas for huge flocks of migrating bi rds from as far as the tropics, and a home for the elderberry longhorn beetle, now a federally endangered species. In winter, the delta marshes provided food and shelter for thousands of waterfowl. Some vernal pools still support the rare Delta green ground beetle.

Elem (Pomo) Scenario 83 3 OVERVIEW OF GENERAL ELEM ECOLOGICAL LIFESTYLE This section describes the ecologically-bas ed lifeways and traditional resource uses that compose the traditional Elem subsistenc e lifestyle. The Elem culture exploits a wide range of resources and ecological nich es. The Elem territory includes several vegetation zones, which allows the people to take advantage of seasonal diversity of resources (Heizer and Elasser 1980). Cl ear Lake basin was characterized by unusual resource abundance which allo wed or encouraged a complex social structure and artisanship (White 1998, McLendon 1977, Brown and Andrews 1969). The interior valley which included the lake wa s originally filled with grass over 6 feet tall and large game \"so abundant like flocks of sheep\" (Barrett 1952). People did not have to travel far to obtain all th ey needed (McLendon 1977). Travel between Clear Lake villages was invariably by balsa (tule stems bound toget her into boats). Subsistence activities included traditi onal and modern technolog ies for harvesting and preserving foods, as well as for distributing produce and cash through communal networks of sharing and barteri ng. Stored foods included dried fish, seeds, acorns, buckeyes, pepperwood nuts, wit h seasonal supplem entation of fresh vegetal foods, such as berries, clover, r oots, and bulbs. Everyone participated in subsistence activities, and most had additional specialties, such as knowing all the uses of a particular resource (Gifford 1926). The Clear Lake culture was centered on res ources of acorns, fish, game, and tule. Staples (foods that are abundant, reliable, and/ or storable) in the area were acorns, large game mammals, roots, seeds, and fish (Baumhoff 1963). The stored foods were acorns (56%), fish (28%), and sma ll seeds (14%). Acorns, seeds and nuts were most often made into two forms of food, atole and pinole, 8 used throughout California. A \"typical meal was dried fish and acorn mush,\" and the components were available year-round in fresh and st ored forms. This was supplemented with fresh meat or waterfowl when available, and fresh greens , roots, bulbs, berries, and fruits in season (McLendon and Lowy 1978, McLendon 1977). Cultivation was common among all the Pomo tribes, and fi re management was practiced throughout the California region. 3.1 HISTORICAL SEASONAL PATTERNS OF THE ELEM The Elem year was structured around majo r resources. The annual natural cycle started with fish runs in February and Ma rch. The lake was \"teeming with fish,\" although fishing occurred primarily during s pawning runs, when each fish species in succession moved close to shore or into streams to spawn (McLendon 1977). After the first fish runs, the first greens were ready, followed by young tule shoots, and then angelica shoots and other early greens. In May or June the first tubers were ready for digging. A third tuber, Indian carro t, was ready in June or July.

Often they fished all night when fish fed. Fi sh were grilled, baked, and dried and smoked (Brown and Andrews 1969). Large game in cluded mule and black-tailed deer, Roosevelt and tule elk, and pronghorn antelope (Baumhoff 1963). 3.2.2 Gathering About 230 plant species are documented as used by Pomo bands in edible, medicinal, or material forms (Goodrich 1980, Heizer and Elasser 1980, Holmes 1975). Almost every kind of nut, berry, seed, bulb, and root was utilized, as well as many kinds of leaves and young sprouts consumed as greens, flavorings, teas, or medicines (Barrett 1952, Stewart 1943, Bibby 1992, Loeb 1926, McLendon 1977). Goodrich documents that various Pomo bands used 11 species of plants for bread, 19 for fruits, 11 for greens, and around a dozen for pinole and/or atole. Many plants have pharmacologically active compounds for a wide range of ailments, including diabetes (black huckleberry leaves, Vaccinium ovatum ), and many plants have both nutritional and medicinal qualit ies. Many species have ma terial uses, including 14 materials used in baskets, 3 for fish poison, 4 for glue, and 5 for rope. Acorns were the primary plant food, follo wed by roots and bulbs, seeds and nuts, berries, and greens (in that order), plus teas, medicines, sweets, salt and pepper, and tobacco (McLendon and Lowry 1978). With the exception of the poisonous Zygadenes, all the bulbous plants were used for food. A dozen kinds of bulbs were used ( Calochortus, Brodiaea, Allium, Hookera, others), and the bulbs of various Elem (Pomo) Scenario 84 eaten in pinole during the winter.

A dozen kinds of bulbs were used ( Calochortus, Brodiaea, Allium, Hookera, others), and the bulbs of various Elem (Pomo) Scenario 85 species of lilies were important and more abundant in this region than in almost any other part of the state (Barrett 1908). Seeds included Chenopodium (chia), angelica, anise, poppy, fiddlehead, tule shoots and roots (3 s pecies), and many others. Condiments included salt, pepper (pepper balls gathered fr om the pepper or bay tree, roasted, hulled and ground), and anise roots. The Elem were the primary bead-makers in central California. Bead (money) makers were a partly specialized class of men who obtained the raw materials and made it into various items (McLendon and Lowry 1978). Beads were used for ceremonial donation, money, funerary donations, trade, debts, trespass, payment for work done, and payment of fines (Barrett 1952). Clamshell ( Saxidonus nuttalli ) and magnesite money-beads were regarded as sma ll change and strung on strings, while magnesite cylinders were counted individuall y. Clam shell discoid beads were made by rubbing the outer surface down to the white inner layer, then breaking the shell into fragments. A fragment was chipped into a rough- edged disc, which was drilled with a snowberry shaft fitted with a chert point. Magnesite discs were made essentially the same, with the addition that the magnesite was buried under a fire to impart a pleasing color that ranged from pink to brick red to chocolate brown, or variegated. Discs were strung on wire grass for final shaping by sandstone as a strand. Magnesite cylinders were \u00bc inch to 2 inches in diameter and 1 to 3 inches long. Silica exposure associated with this occupation is unknown. Everyone used obsidian from abundant local sources (Mt. Konocti on the southern shore of Clear Lake) to make arrowheads and other tools. Chert, jasper, flint, steatite, chalcedony, petrified wood, and quartz crystals were also used for various purposes. Chert is harder and used for drills and harder arrowheads. Steatite (soap stone), magnesium mica, and talc were used. Pumice was used as an abrasive, such as for softening deer hides. Cinnabar was used for body paint. Pomo baskets are elaborate, wit h different styles of basket for different uses, some water tight. Materials included willow us ed as the warp (shaped, sorted and dried). Woof was sedge root (dried, split down t he middle, hung up for a year), redbud bark, bulrush root, often dyed black, and digger pine root fibers (Brown and Andrews 1969). Black color in baskets roots of carex (razor grass) were buried in black oak ashes. One medium grass basket required 37 50 grass stalks from previously burned or pruned plants; 5 Apocynum stalks make one foot of co rdage; a 40-foot deer net used fibers from 35,000 plants.

Acorns: Acorns furnished the main article of diet and are the most characteristic California staple. Preference of acorn spec ies depends on specific use. In order of preference, the oaks are tan oak ( Lithocarpus densiflora oak ( Q. dumosa ) (Baumhoff 1978). Certain oak trees or patches of trees belonged to individuals (Barrett 1952). A family could easily collect several ton of acor ns. During an actual collection period, 100 pounds of acorns could be gathered in an ho ur, producing 50 pounds of kernels. The tan oak and black oak seed crop is about 125 pound per tree. The Oregon oak ( Q. garryana ) can produce 200 pounds or more per tree. Other species are also prolific, but some tend to have irregular crops (Baumhoff 1963). Every old photograph of Elem villages shows multiple granaries on stilts (Baumhoff 1963). The smallest granaries were roughly the size of a 50-gallon barrel. A typical granary for a family of 6 m easures 5 by 12 feet, holding 2440kg (Heizer and Elasser 1980). Acorn granaries were lined with wormw ood or bay leaves to repel insects and worms (Fagan 2003). Acorns in the shell could be stored up to 2 years. Because relying on acorns as a staple requires inte nse activity at harvest and large storage capacity, granaries were located at perm anent settlements located near oak forests (Fagan 2003). Processing involved labor-int ensive shelling, winnowing (to remove the skin), and pounding, taking much longer than grass seeds. It takes 3 hours to convert 6 pounds of shelled acorns in to 5.3 pounds of flour. A day's hard pounding provided enough flour for a family for severa l days. After pounding, the tannic acid is leached out, and the leached meal can be boiled as mush or baked as bread (Baumhoff 1963). Other Nuts and Seeds: Grass seeds, though abundant, also require intensive processing\u2014hulling (breaking shells if la rge), milling (coarse grinding), and grinding into flour (Fagan 2003). Pinole was the fi ne flour or meal made from parched, ground seeds from tansy-mustard, chia, or other grasses and flowering annuals; this was eaten dry, pinch by pinch, or made into a mush with water. The meal also can be dampened, made into balls, and eaten raw or cooked (Balls 1962, Barrett 1952). Ground buckeye balls were also leached, but much more thoroughly, often for months. Pine nuts (of digger and sugar pines) were eaten raw or roasted. California Bay nuts were picked in the spring, roast ed, shelled, ground, and stored for winter. Hazelnuts (and shoots for baskets) were gathered from carefully-managed patches. Salt: Various inland seepages occur where sa lt-bearing water (percolating upward through salt beds) evaporates and leaves cryst allized salt on the surface of the soil. Often the crude salt is dissolved and recryst allized, which by chemical analysis is 99.2% NaCl. The crude salt is 28% insoluble material, still used raw, and still palatable (Mauldin 1975). Sea salt wa s obtained during trips to the coast. Clay Used in Bread: It was a common culinary practice to mix ferruginous clay with acorn meal (one pint of clay to 3 quarts flour). The clay is referred to as \"Indian baking powder\" (masil), is somewhat swee t, and helps the cake stick together. This Elem (Pomo) Scenario 86 oregon oak oak ( Q. dumosa ) (Baumhoff 1978).

Sea salt wa s obtained during trips to the coast. Clay Used in Bread: It was a common culinary practice to mix ferruginous clay with acorn meal (one pint of clay to 3 quarts flour). The clay is referred to as \"Indian baking powder\" (masil), is somewhat swee t, and helps the cake stick together. This Elem (Pomo) Scenario 87 clay is 10% FeO 2 by weight. The purpose of the clay was to convert the tannic acid of the acorn meal into an insoluble com pound formed at the baking temperature, by reaction of the tannic acid with iron oxide (Mauldin 19 75, Stewart 1943, Holmes 1975, Selinus et al. 2005). 3.2.3 Resource Management Early settlers who arrived in central Califor nia saw a verdant carpet of grass with scattered live oaks and manzanita bushes that reminded them of a well tended garden. This is because California was not wilderness but many carefully managed habitats and plant communities that supported large populations through exceptionally effective ex tractive and storage technol ogy (Blackburn and Anderson 1993). Throughout the state, many areas we re cared for by families and knowledge was passed on to each generation. Individual families took care of individual oak trees. Mosaic vegetation and biodiversity were deliberately encouraged. Cultivating favored plants in different patches was common among all of the Pomo tribes, as well as weeding, pruning, irrigation, so wing, selective harvesting, and tilling. Methods for gathering mimic natural disturbanc e; for example, the root harvest tool (digging stick) does not harm the resource , but loosens the soil. Pomo women also weeded sedge beds to loosen the soil and remove impediments to rhizomes radiating from each plant, promoti ng the untangled, long underground stems desirable for basketry material (Anders on 1973, Anderson et al. 1997). Coppicing (encouraging annual shoots of basket ma terials) was also practiced. Natural fire caused by summer lightning strikes not associated with rain is an important component of t he Mediterranean climate. Un til suppression policies around 1900, late summer and early fall fire s were an expected natural event, with a natural fire interval of 10-50 years in eac h location (in addition to more frequent fire regimes employed by the nativ e peoples). Thus, intense destr uctive fires were rare. California plants not only evolved with fire, but some require fire . Without fire, brush can become dominant. With fire, grasse s and young shoots provide deer browse. Without fire, chaparral becomes dense and reduced in browseability, and forbs are inhibited. Certain species were known to better with annual burning, others did better with burning every several years, and so on (Anderson et al. 19 97, Lewis 1993). Native people understood the relation of pl ant and fire cycles and employed fire to maintain browse, reduce catastrophic fire hazard, and encourage germination of native plants and growth of native forbs. U ndergrowth was controlled so forests were more open, meadows were kept clear, and mars hes were deliberately fired to clear out dead plants, control disease and in sects, and increase breeding areas and diversity.

Elem (Pomo) Scenario 88 4 HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND EXPOSURE SCENARIO The approach used in describing an overall diet is to use the information about major resources present in the study area, fo raging theory information, and information from the existing liter ature and interviews. An overall total caloric diet with rough proportions of different food groups in a typi cal traditional diet is shown in Section 4.3 (Figure 10). This diet is reconstruct ed from information about what the traditional diet actually was, rather than what it might be today if USDA recommendations about daily intakes were followed substi tuting wild for domesticated foods. The steps for reconstructing the Elem diet are: 1. Review foraging theory information pres ented above specific to the Tribe, the local ecosystem, and, if available, for the specific location under consideration; 2. Review ecological information for a rough estimate of resource abundance of natural resources under baseline conditions; 3. Review interviews and other eth nographic sources for supporting information of species and abundance, habitat types, human activity levels, and methods of obtaining, preparing, and using resources; 4. Develop overall perce ntages of major food cat egories and major staples within the total diet; 5. Estimate calories provided by the diet, and compare estimates of percentages of quantities and percentages of calories; 6. Refine estimates of major staples and food categories after considering information about medicines, sweetener s, and other often-overlooked food/medicine types; macronutri ents, and other factors. 4.1 METHODS FOR DESCRIBING THE DIET Kelly (1995) describes the concepts of eco-cu ltural lifestyles, also known as foraging theory. In the 1960s to 1980s the \"Man the Hunter\" concept (with males providing most of the provender) prevailed due to a previous archaeological emphasis on hunting and warfare artifa cts (Lee and Devore 1968). This gave way in the 1980s and 1990s to a more balanced foraging model that emphasized plants as much as meat (and equality of genders in contributing to surviv al), and a relatively peaceful and secure \"original affluent society\" (Sahlins 1972). The latter concept is supported by data (Kelly 1995, Winterhalder 1981) on the amount of time required to obtain survival necessities and to raise children, and the typically abu ndant amount of time available for socializing, education, ceremoni es, material items, leisure, recreation, oratories, and so on. However, hunter- gatherers are not ove r-nourished, and face seasonal or cyclical shortages even though outri ght starvation is rare. The lifestyle is also \"physically demanding\" (Kelly 1995) , giving rise to discussions about the number of calories availabl e or required and the activity levels used to develop Elem (Pomo) Scenario 88 4 HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND EXPOSURE SCENARIO The approach used in describing an overall diet is to use the information about major resources present in the study area, fo raging theory information, and information from the existing liter ature and interviews.

Efficiency or return ra te for specific resources in specific habitats is estimated using foraging theory by evaluatin g the amount of calories expended in getting food (search costs) by means of hunting, gathering, or fishing relative to time spent or calories obtained. Foraging information is typi cally presented as return rates, or net calories obtained per hour of effort. A dditional factors such as biodiversity, abundance, and patchiness or continuity of resources result in time allocation decisions that are intentional ly or unintentionally made by foraging societies, such as optimal diet breadth, optimal foraging ar ea, and optimal foraging group size for a particular ecosystem (Winterhalder 1981) . Depending on the evaluation methods used in a study, this return rate data ma y include (1) time and calories spent in preparing to hunt, fish, or gather (e.g., making nets) , (2) time and/or ca lories spent in the actual activity, and (3) time spent in the processing of the resource after obtaining it. The drawback of oversimplifying foraging solely to caloric efficiency is that micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, specific amino acids, and fatty acids), medicinal or pharmacologically active compounds, other nutritional requirements, and non-nutritional attributes, such as aroma or dye or material uses, are often not considered (Lindstrom 1992). Similarly, m any plants and animals have multiple uses or are co-located with other res ources; therefore, caloric calculations must not ignore the way that people actually make decisions about where to go or what to gather, or the reasons they seek to obtain particular resources. 4.2 FORAGING STUDIES FO R CENTRAL CALIFORNIA Broughton (1988) evaluated the fauna of the Sacramento Valley, and developed a diet breadth model. White (2002) review ed this approach and identified problems with this and other foraging models. For ex ample, seasonal competition affects choices if two resources are ready at the same time. Also, the lonely forager assumption is not generally applicable si nce resources are gathered by groups with different people procuring different resour ces. The Broughton model was modified by White to be suitable to the Clear Lak e area (by omitting salmon and pronghorn), although it still includes only animal resource s.

Elem (Pomo) Scenario 90 White critiques these figures in several ways: He concludes that they do not hold for t he Clear Lake Basin. In particular, fish were greatly underestimated because they were not evaluated as they would be taken during spawning runs. Fish (hitch , blackfish, pike) were actually one of the highest ranked resources, at least during the various spawning seasons. Turtles were not included, whereas t hey actually comprise a substantial fraction of small game bones in site s in appropriate locales, and more common in some assemblages than lagomorphs. Over time, the ratios of fish to large game can c hange considerably for many reasons, including uses of non-edible parts such as bones for tools, etc. Mollusks were not included, whereas they were used widely (western ridge mussel, Lake mussels were gat hered by feeling them with bare feet. Baumhoff (1963) estimated acorn and gam e production from vegetation maps, which showed 22 vegetation types (in 1945 ). He reconstructed a pre-contact resource map from vegetation information, original soil maps, and historic range land studies. He identified vegetation ty pes and rated them for acorn and game production, and identified stream miles and rated them for fish production. He then determined the size of each vegetation type and stream mile s available to individual tribes, and weighted them acco rding to productivity of ga me, acorns, and fish. For example, 60 square miles of chaparral, which ranks as a secondary acorn source, gives an index of 30 for acorns (60 mi 2 x \u00bd). However, it ranks very high in game production, which is weighted double, givi ng a game index of 120. Therefore, the total index for 60 acres of chaparral for bot h game and acorns is 150. For individual tribes, Baumhoff estimated the acreage of each vegetation type, as well as the number of stream mile s suitable for primary, secondary, or tertiary fish production. Clear Lake is immediately surrounded primarily by oak w oodland and chaparral, with nearby grassland and pine-fir fore st. Oak woodlands rank at the highest level for the combination of game and acor n production, while grassl and ranks at the highest level for game but lower for acorn density. Baumhoff ranks production of Clear Lake fisheries as equivalent to a secondary sa lmon stream in terms of total poundage. The southeastern Pomo had 200 square mile s of upland available, primarily oak woodland. He concludes that t he ranking of resource availability for the southeastern Pomo was as follows: game ranked slight ly ahead of acorns, which ranked ahead of fish in terms of overall productivity. Baum hoff estimated that tribes living on primary salmon rivers relied on acorn, game, and fi sh in an estimated ratio of 3:2:3. 4.3 THE ELEM DIET This section uses the information from t he previous sections to derive and rank estimates of major categories of food types .

It considers the number of species, the Elem (Pomo) Scenario 91 foraging studies with their dietary esti mates, and recent interview data. This information is combined to reconstruct a di et that was obtained from the Clear Lake area. It is intended to describe what the diet actually was before contamination altered the natural resources. Figures 11 and 12 illustrate the derived diet by percent of calories and by grams per day. The la tter illustration is more comparable to conventional food pyramids, which are shown by number of servings. Baumhoff (1963) estimated a ratio for intake of acorn, game, and fish for central California tribes on salmon-bearing rivers of 3:2:3. Those tribes generally used acorns and game more than fish; however, the tribes immediately around Clear Lake used all three. We extrapolate from Baumho ff's ratio a Clear Lake ratio for acorns, game, and fish of 3:2:2, which accounts for fish being of secondary rather than primary quantity. The general order of vegetal resources used, in order, are acorns, roots and bulbs, seeds and nuts, berries, greens, and a general category for teas, medicines, sweets, salt and pepper, and tobacco (McLendon and Lowry 1978). The general order of animal resources is fish, large game, fowl, sm all game, shellfish, insects, and turtles. Heizer and Elasser (1980) combined vegetal and animal resource use into an approximate overall diet (F igure 10) based on earlier work, particularly from Baumhoff, but also from earlier authors w ho measured what wa s being stored.

This is done to ensure that a full amount of calories is accounted for, and the diet is roughly balanced within the ranges of other foragi ng diets. Based on the discussion above, an estimate of the complete diet is shown below in Table 4. Each food category is converted to calories, and then to grams per day. It is impo ssible to be more quantitative than a rough estimate of over all percentages given the lack of data on native foods\u2014nutritional data on native foods are almost totally lacking. Therefore, all of the information in Table 4 is from the USDA database (except where noted) for an average member of the same or nearest plant or animal family (the \"Representative Species\" column in Table 4). Wherever specific information is available from the USDA database, such as for game species, it is used (http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ ). Where possible, the data for fresh or cooked foods matches the form of nat ive plants eaten. We recognize that domesticated species of plants have been bred for certain characteristics such as low fiber content, more sweetness, and other characteristics. Tribal members often refer to wild varieties as \"stronger\" than domesticated va rieties, but the actual nutritional or biochemical attri butes that this refers to ar e not known.

Elem (Pomo) Scenario 94 A closer examination of a pr imary food, acorns, illustrates some issues in estimating food group totals. Many investigators hav e evaluated the nutri tional quality of acorns, but early reports in the anthropol ogical literature frequent ly did not report whether their estimates were based on uns helled nuts (a stored form), the flour (stored for shorter periods), or fresh nuts versus parched or dried. Dried acorn whole nuts (without the shell) and ground acorn flour have 500 kcal/100g. Raw acorn nuts (without the shell but fr esh) contain 387 kcal/100g.9 Tables 5, 6, and analyses: Baumho ff the USDA (http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR14/sr14.html ), respectively.

Many investigators hav e evaluated the nutri tional quality of acorns, but early reports in the anthropol ogical literature frequent ly did not report whether their estimates were based on uns helled nuts (a stored form), the flour (stored for shorter periods), or fresh nuts versus parched or dried. Dried acorn whole nuts (without the shell) and ground acorn flour have 500 kcal/100g. Raw acorn nuts (without the shell but fr esh) contain 387 kcal/100g.9 Tables 5, 6, and analyses: Baumho ff the USDA (http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR14/sr14.html ), respectively.

Indirect pathways include exposur e via the oral inges tion of food and medicine (see previous section). This sect ion focuses on direct pathways: direct inhalation, dermal exposure, and ingestion of water, air, dust, sediment, and soil (including soil on the outside of food or added through cooking). Default exposure factors have been devel oped for conventional suburban, urban, occupational, and recreational scenarios ba sed on national statistics. Our approach to developing a tribal scenario is not to in ventory every activity and every resource, but to provide an overall estimate of the general activity levels, anchored with specific information as available. The basic assumption is that traditional lifeways are active outdoor lifestyles that are somewhat physica lly demanding, even with some modern conveniences. Subsist ence foragers (both genders) perform a combination of aerobic (high heart and vent ilation rates), strength, endurance, and stretching-flexibility daily activities, as well as performing more sedentary work and resting. The exposure factors here ar e general to traditional subsistence lifestyles, regardless of their location. The conc eptual steps in this process are: 1. Understand the lifestyle and the activiti es that comprise the lifestyle, and are required to obtain necessities an d engage in the community culture; 2. Describe the day, the year, and the lif etime of men and women to identify any significant differences in activity levels between genders or ages; 3. Cross-walk activities with exposur e pathways on the basis of frequency and duration of major activities, activi ty levels, and degree of environmental contact, and 4.

Hunting occurs in terrain ranging from flat and open to very steep and rugged. It may also include setting traplines, waiting in blinds, digging-out small game, climbing, etc. After the capture or kill, field dressing, packing or hauling, and other strenuous activities may occur, depending on the species. Subsequent activities include cutting, and storing (e.g., smoking or drying). Fishing Fishing includes building weirs, scooping minnows, hauling in lines (we assume that large nets are not used in small drainages), gaffing or gigging, wading (for shellfish), followed by cleaning the fish and carrying them to the place of use. Activities associated wi th smoking and constructing drying racks may be involved. Gathering A variety of activities is involved, such as hiking, bending, stooping, wading (marsh and water plants), digging, bundling, carrying, and climbing over a wide variety of terrains. Ritual purification (sweat lodge) Sweat-lodge building and repairing is intermittent, but collecting firewood is a constant activity. Cold and hot springs were used for therapeutic healing. Materials use and food preparation Many activities of low to high intensit y are involved in preparing materials for use or food storage. Some are quite vigorous such as pounding or grinding seeds and nuts into flour, preparing meat, and tanning hides.

General levels of exertion, relative to inhalation rate, are also assumed to be the same for males and females. The inland Pomo would make several trips to t he coast each year during low tide.

Other authors also report frequent or daily use of the sweat house (Gifford 1926, Barrett 1952, Brown and Andrews 1969, Heizer and Elasser 1980). Cultural Activities: All persons participate in day -long outdoor community cultural activities once a month, such as powwo ws and seasonal cere monial and private cultural activities (averaging about 0.5 hour s/day). These activities tend to be large gatherings with a greater rate of dust re suspension and particulate inhalation. Individuals also tend to be active, resu lting in a greater inhalation and water ingestion rates: \"the exertion of the danc e was so great that perspiration showed freely on their fine looking bodie s\" (Brown and Andrews 1969). Basket Making: Exposure pathways specific to basket makers are well- recognized,12 but it has not been fully resear ched with respect to environmental contact rates. Gathering of some plant s (e.g., willows, cattails, reeds, and rushes) can be very muddy, and river shore or lake shore activities with sediment exposure may be underestimated. Washing, peeling, weaving rushes, and other activities results in additional exposure, such as dust deposited on leaves or soil adhered to roots.

Other Special Activities: It is recognized that there are special circumstances when some people may be highly exposed to indi vidual natural resources or media. For instance, some men hunt or fish fo r the general community, and many people provide roots and fish and game to elders in addition to their own families. Beadmakers may receive additional expos ure through obtaining and working with their materials. Seasonality: The changes in activity patterns over the annual seasonal cycle has been modified in modern times, but the ec ological cycle has not, so people must still gather plants according to when they are ripe, hunt according to game and fowl patterns, and fish when the spawning runs occur. Many item s are gathered during one season for year-round use. While specific activities change from season to season, they are replaced by other activi ties with a similar environmental contact rate. For instance, a particular plant may be gathered during one month, while another month may be spent hunting, and a winter month may include cleaning and using the items obtained previously. Therefor e, since activity levels are roughly equal throughout the seasons, there is no decrease in environmental contact rates during winter months. 5.4 EXPOSURE FACTORS FOR DI RECT EXPOSURE PATHWAYS A description of activities for the purposes of developing exposure factors focuses on: Frequency of activity: Daily, weekly, monthly Duration of activity: Hours at a time Number of years Intensity of environmental contact and intensity of activity: For soil ingestion and dermal exposure, is the activity more than, less than, or equal to gardening, camping, cons truction/excavation, or sports? For inhalation rates and calorie needs, is the activity level more than, less than, or equal to standard EPA activity leve ls for specific activities with known respiration rates and caloric expenditure? The following table (Table 11) includes two adult scenarios: the suburban resident and the subsistence forager. The scenario is typically used in risk assessments, and the second reflects the set of activities that compose the Elem lifestyle. Each scenario is intended to be physiologically coherent , which means that the dietary intake, activity levels, and inhalation rates are physiologically linked. For instance, the more sedentary suburban scenario is bas ed on national data on typical lifestyles (light occupational activities sitting or standing, with some moderate activity at home). The subsistence forager is mo re active, with a proportionally higher Elem (Pomo) Scenario 100 ensure that the exposure fa ctors for each route of ex posure account for this particular activity.

The scenario is typically used in risk assessments, and the second reflects the set of activities that compose the Elem lifestyle. Each scenario is intended to be physiologically coherent , which means that the dietary intake, activity levels, and inhalation rates are physiologically linked. For instance, the more sedentary suburban scenario is bas ed on national data on typical lifestyles (light occupational activities sitting or standing, with some moderate activity at home). The subsistence forager is mo re active, with a proportionally higher Elem (Pomo) Scenario 101 inhalation rate, as well as a higher soil ingestion rate, due to a higher degree of soil contact. The following table shows adult values, as does the dietary discussion above. Children's exposure factors are scaled from the subsistence forager rates, as is conventionally done in risk assessment (f rom the Children's Exposure Factors Handbook), with the exception of the soil ingestion rate, which is left at 400mg/d throughout the lifetime. Body weight is a consistent 70kg because that is the standard EPA assumption used in risk assessments. Table 11. Major exposure factors for direct pathways. Exposure Factors (Adult) Direct Pathway Default Suburban Lifestyle Subsistence Forager Lifestyle Inhalation 20m3 25m3/day: This rate is based on a lifestyle that is an outdoor active lifestyle, based on EPA activity databases, foraging theory and ethnographic description of the activities undertaken to obtain subsistence resources as well as allotment-based food (livestock and garden). It is higher than the conventional 20m 3/day because the respiration rates associated with typical activities are higher than those of suburban activities. Drinking water ingestion 2L/d 3L/d plus 1L for each use of the sweat lodge during ritual purification, or 4L/day total. Soil ingestion 100mg/d (conventional suburban); 50mg/d (manicured suburban; less outdoor time). 400 mg/d: This rate is based on indoor and outdoor activities, a greater rate of gathering, processing, and other uses of natural resources, as well as on residual soil on grown and gathered plants. Episodic events (1 gram each) are considered, such as wetland gathering, cultural activities with higher soil contact, and so on. But this might be underestimated. It does not specifically include geophagia or pica. Dermal exposure Must be included in the risk assessment. Greater environmental contacts must be factored in; however, suburban defaults may be used until data for traditional lifeways are developed, although a greater fr action of the skin surface and a higher dermal loading rate should be considered. Other parameters Exposure frequency Up to 365 days per year, but varies. Hours per day varies; typically 24 hrs/d. 365 days per year. Hours per day varies; typically 24 hrs/d. Exposure duration 30 years 70-75 years Drinking Water: Harper et al. (2002) estimated an average water ingestion rate of 3L/day for adults, based on total fluid intake in an arid climate. In addition, each use of the sweat lodge requires an additional 1L fo r rehydration (24L per year). It should be noted that water intake in an arid envir onment may be more than 3L per day.

Children's exposure factors are scaled from the subsistence forager rates, as is conventionally done in risk assessment (f rom the Children's Exposure Factors Handbook), with the exception of the soil ingestion rate, which is left at 400mg/d throughout the lifetime. Body weight is a consistent 70kg because that is the standard EPA assumption used in risk assessments. Table 11. Major exposure factors for direct pathways. Exposure Factors (Adult) Direct Pathway Default Suburban Lifestyle Subsistence Forager Lifestyle Inhalation 20m3 25m3/day: This rate is based on a lifestyle that is an outdoor active lifestyle, based on EPA activity databases, foraging theory and ethnographic description of the activities undertaken to obtain subsistence resources as well as allotment-based food (livestock and garden). It is higher than the conventional 20m 3/day because the respiration rates associated with typical activities are higher than those of suburban activities. Drinking water ingestion 2L/d 3L/d plus 1L for each use of the sweat lodge during ritual purification, or 4L/day total. Soil ingestion 100mg/d (conventional suburban); 50mg/d (manicured suburban; less outdoor time). 400 mg/d: This rate is based on indoor and outdoor activities, a greater rate of gathering, processing, and other uses of natural resources, as well as on residual soil on grown and gathered plants. Episodic events (1 gram each) are considered, such as wetland gathering, cultural activities with higher soil contact, and so on. But this might be underestimated. It does not specifically include geophagia or pica. Dermal exposure Must be included in the risk assessment. Greater environmental contacts must be factored in; however, suburban defaults may be used until data for traditional lifeways are developed, although a greater fr action of the skin surface and a higher dermal loading rate should be considered. Other parameters Exposure frequency Up to 365 days per year, but varies. Hours per day varies; typically 24 hrs/d. 365 days per year. Hours per day varies; typically 24 hrs/d. Exposure duration 30 years 70-75 years Drinking Water: Harper et al. (2002) estimated an average water ingestion rate of 3L/day for adults, based on total fluid intake in an arid climate. In addition, each use of the sweat lodge requires an additional 1L fo r rehydration (24L per year). It should be noted that water intake in an arid envir onment may be more than 3L per day. For Elem (Pomo) Scenario 102 example, the Army assumes that the maxi mum individual daily amount of drinking water required by military personnel to remain combat-effect ive ranges from 5- 15L/day, depending on the climate, season, and intensity of work.13 The Army Quartermaster assumes that military personnel in hot clim ates require 3 gallons per day as drinking water.14 Soil and Sediment Ingestion: Soil ingestion includes consideration of direct ingestion of dirt, mud, or dust, swa llowing inhaled dust, mout hing of objects, ingestion of dirt or dust on food, and hand-to -mouth contact. The tribal soil ingestion rate of 400mg/day is based on a review of EPA guidance, soil ingestion studies in suburban and indigenous settings, pi ca and geophagia, and dermal adherence studies (a small portion of which is summa rized here). The Elem soil ingestion rate also considers many 1-gram days and events , such as root gathering days, tule and wapato gathering days, powwows, rodeos, horse training and riding days, sweat- lodge building or repair days, grave digging, and similar ac tivities. However, this might result in an underestimation of soil in gestion. It reflects a variety of soil pathways such as pit cooking, gatheri ng and gardening, residual soil or dust on foods and medicine, localized so il-generating activities, holding natural materials in the mouth while processi ng or using, driving on unpaved roads, and similar considerations. For the Elem, the undergr ound oven was very important. \"A large percentage of their food, roots, berries, seeds, and even a large portion of meats [were] eaten in an uncook ed state\" (Barrett 1952). The soil ingestion rate of 400mg/d fo r all ages is the published upper bound for suburban children (EPA 1997), and is within t he range of outdoor activity rates for adults but lower than the typical 480mg/d app lied to outdoor work to allow for some low-contact days. Subsistence lifestyles were not considered by the EPA guidance, but are generally considered to be similar in soil contact rates to construction, utility work or military exercise. The US m ilitary assumes 480mg per exposure event15 or per field day. The UN Balkans Task Forc e assumes that 1 gram of soil can be ingested per military field day.16 Anecdotally, US forces deployed in Iraq report frequent grittiness in the mouth and food. Haywood and Smith (1990) also considered sensory reports of grittiness in their estimate of 1-10g/d in aboriginal Australians. Simon (1998) reviewed soil ingestion st udies from a perspective of risk and dose assessment. Because of their high dependenc e on the land, indigenous peoples are at highest risk for inadvertent ingestion, along with professions that may bring 13 http://www.nap.edu/execsumm/NI000954.html Guidelines for Chemical Warfare Agents in Military Field Drinking Water (1995). 14 http://www.pasols.org/energy/water2.pdf 15 http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/pesto/pest_s22.htm , citing US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, Exposure Factors Handbook, Volume I , EPA/600/P-95/002a, August 1997 as the basis for the 480mg/d. 16 UNEP/UNCHS Balkans Task Force (BTF) (1999).

Simon recommends using a soil ingestion rate for indi genous people in hunt ers/food gathering/ nomadic societies of 1g/d in wet climates and 2g/d in dry climates. He recommends using 3g/d for all indigenous children. For the Clear Lake climate and lifestyle, t he soil ingestion rate for young children (0- 6 years) is assumed to be 400mg/day for 365 days/year. This is higher than the prior EPA default value of 200mg/day (USEPA 1989) . This rate reflects both indoor dust and continuous outdoor activities analogo us to gardening or camping (Van Wijnen 1990), but it is less than a single-incident sp orts or construction ingestion rate (Boyd 1999). Inhalation Rate: The inhalation rate in the Elem sc enario reflects the active, outdoor lifestyle of traditional tribal members. T heir fitness was comparable to that of long distance runners. In the la te 1800s, 20 mile round trips were \"regarded as so commonplace a performance as to be wort h but two dollars\" (Heizer and Elasser 1980). Traditional tribal communities have no sedentary members except the frail elderly, whereas one-quarter of modern American adults of a ll ages report no leisure time physical activity at all. 17 An inhalation rate of 25m3/d is more accurate for the Tribe's active, outdoor lifestyle than the EPA default rate of 20m3/d (USEPA 1997). Using EPA guidance, a median rate of 26.2m3/d is obtained from 8 hours sleeping, 2 hours sedentary, 6 hours light activity, 6 hours moderate activity, and 2 hours heavy activity. This represents minimal heavy activi ty (construction, climbing hills, etc.). Most other exposure fact ors are upper bounds, so the use of a median rate for inhalation is inconsistent with the r easonable maximum exposure (RME) approach typically used in Superfund risk assessments, and could result in under-protection of children, the elderly, athletes, asthmati cs, and the half of t he population with above- average inhalation rates. Dermal Exposures: The dermal pathway has not been fully researched for this scenario, but EPA methods 18 for dermal exposure can be used. However, a greater surface area and a greater skin loading of so il (soil adhered to skin) should be used. Two relevant papers are summarized here. Kissel et al. (1996) included reed gatherers in tide flats in a study of dermal adherence. The category of \"kids in mud\" at a lakeshore had by far the highest skin loadings, with an average of 35mg/cm2 for 6 children and an average of 58mg/cm2 for another 6 children. Reed gatherers were next highest at 0.66mg/cm2 with an upper bound of >1mg/cm2. This was followed by farmers and rugby players (approximately 0.4mg/cm2) and irrigation installers (0.2mg/cm2). Holmes et al. (1999) studied 99 individuals in a variety of occupations. Farmers, reed gatherers and kids in mud had the highest overall skin loadings. The next highest skin loadings on the hands we re for equipment operators, gardeners, construction, and utility workers (0.3mg/cm2), followed by archaeologists, and several other occupations (0.15-0.1 (Pomo) Scenario 103 workers into close and continual contact with the soil.

Elem (Pomo) Scenario 105 6 CONCLUSION This report has presented t he Elem scenario and supporting information for use in human health risk assessments. This report is intended to describe enough about the traditional subsistence lifestyle that a risk assessor who is familiar with developing exposure scenarios can under stand the derivation of the exposure factors even if she does not have an in-dep th familiarity with the Elem lifestyle. Where information is not presented, it is assumed that convent ional parameters are suitable (e.g., skin surface area). The report describes the Elem environment in the Klamat h Mountains, Coast Range, Southern and Central Chaparral and Oak Woodl ands, and Central California Valley ecoregions, and the available resources. An ecological lifestyle is presented, one centered on traditional resources of acorns, fish, game, and tule. An overall diet is developed by reviewing previous for aging studies, and considering available resources, with major food-type categorie s estimated as percentages and presented by percent of calories and by grams per day . The most prevalent food source is the acorn. Exposure factors are developed based on traditional subsistence lifestyles, with attention to the activity patterns and s pecific activities of the Elem. Rates of inhalation, water ingestion, and soil ingesti on are higher than those of the general population, due in part to the Elem people' s increased outdoor activity. Increased soil ingestion is partly attributable to the gathering and processing of food and material resources, at times in wetlands.

This scenario applies to the pinyon-juniper ecosystem between the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Great Basin. An exposure scenario is a narrati ve and numerical representation of the interactions between human and/or ecol ogical receptors and their immediate environment. Exposure scenarios include me dia-specific and pathway-specific exposure factors required to estimate a dose to the target receptor as they pursue a defined set of activities in particular locations. Even though many tribal lands have been lost and resources degraded, there are generally more traditional or subsistence pr actices followed by tribal members than the general non-native population realizes. Howeve r, the objective of many tribes is to regain land, restore resources, and encourage more members to practice healthier (i.e., more traditional) lifestyles. Therefore, t he objective of subsistence exposure scenarios is to describe the orig inal lifestyles and resource uses, not to present a current snapshot of restricted or suppressed uses, because the intent is to restore the ecology so that the original pattern of resource uses is both possible (after resources are restored) and safe (after contamination is removed). This is a different situation than fo r the general American populatio n, where the intent of remediation is to allow people to continue their current (and portable) lifestyle in a newly cleaned location. The int ent of the Washoe Scenario is to reconstruct what the lifestyle and diet would have been in t he affected area prior to contamination. For the general United States population, an exposure scenario is typically designed to be an upper bound (generally around the 75 th percentile) of the population being assessed. Some individual exposure factors are the 90th or 95th percentile; others are mean values. In the case of tribal exposure scenarios, there are no specific databases of subsistence activities, resource s, or diets as ther e are for the general United States population.

Therefore, ranges of exposures or specified percentiles of exposure are not possible to calculate. The Washoe scenario is intended to be a reasonable representation of a traditi onal subsistence lifestyle, equi valent to a central tendency rather than to an upper bound.

The Washoe scenario is intended to be a reasonable representation of a traditi onal subsistence lifestyle, equi valent to a central tendency rather than to an upper bound. For the general suburban population the expo sure scenario is well defined in EPA guidance (Exposure Factors Handbooks). The Washoe tribal scenario is based on the lifestyle and baseline conditions of the regional natural resources. This scenario identifies general exposure pa thways specific to Washoe lifestyles and key resources that the Washoe people use. It starts with a general description of baseline natural resources that are (or s hould be) present in the region. A general Washoe Tribe Scenario 121 understanding of what people do (or would do in the absence of contamination) and what resources are available for their use provides the basis for developing preliminary exposure factors. Then the scenario describes the activities that traditional people undertake to survive and th rive in the local ecosystem, including hunting, gathering foods and medi cines, fishing, making ma terial items, farming or gardening, raising livestock, i rrigating, and various cultural and domestic activities. As mentioned, the exposure scenario refl ects a traditional subsistence lifestyle. \"Subsistence\" refers to the hunting, fi shing, and gathering activities that are fundamental to the way of life of many indigenous peo ples. Today's subsistence economies utilize traditional and modern technol ogies for harvesting and preserving foods and for distributing the produce th rough communal networks of sharing and bartering. The following is a useful expl anation of \"subsistenc e,\" taken from the National Park Service: While non-natives tend to define subsis tence in terms of poverty or the minimum amount of food necessary to support life, native people equate subsistence with their culture. Among m any tribes, maintaining a subsistence lifestyle has become the symbol of thei r survival in the face of mounting political and economic pressures. It defines who they are as a people. To Native Americans who continue to depend on natural resources, subsistence is more than eking out a living. While it is important to the economic well- being of their communities, the subsist ence lifestyle is also the basis of cultural existence and survival. It is a communal activity. It unifies communities as cohesive functioning units through collective production and distribution of the harves t. Some groups have formalized patterns of sharing, while others do so in more informal wa ys. Entire families participate, including elders, who assist with less physically demanding tasks. Parents teach the young to hunt, fish, and farm. Food and goods are also distributed through native cultural institutions. Most require young hunters to distribute their first catch throughout the community. Subsist ence embodies cultural values that recognize both the social obligation to share as well as the special spiritual relationship to the land and resources. Th is relationship is portrayed in native art and in many ceremonies held throughout the year. 1 In economic terms, a subsistence econom y is one in which currency is limited because many goods and services are produced and consumed by the same families or bands. Today, currency (symbol s of specified quantities of useful resources) is limited, but important. For example, subsistence in an Arctic community includes the following: The modern-day subsistence family depends on the tools of the trade, most of which are expensive. Snowmobile s, gasoline, guns, fishing nets, and sleeping bags are necessities. Subsist ence households also enjoy many of the modern conveniences of life, and are saddled with the economic 1 National Park Service: http://www.cr.nps.gov/aad/cg/fa_1999/Subsist.htm Washoe Tribe Scenario 121 understanding of what people do (or would do in the absence of contamination) and what resources are available for their use provides the basis for developing preliminary exposure factors.

Today's subsistence family generates much-needed cash as wage- labourers, part-time workers and trappers, professional business people, traditional craftmakers, and seasonal workers. A highly-integrated inte rdependence between formal (cash-based) and informal (barter and subsistence- based) economic sectors has evolved.2 Once the activities composing a particular subsistence lifestyle are known, they are translated into a form that is used for ri sk assessment. This translation captures the degree of environmental contact that occurs through activities and diet, expressed as numerical exposure factors . Exposure factors for direct exposure pathways include exposure to abiotic media (air, wate r, soil, and sediment), which can result in inhalation, soil ingestion, water ingestion, and dermal exposure. Indirect pathways refer to contaminants that are incorpor ated into biota and subsequently expose people who ingest or use them. There are many unique exposure pathways that are not accounted for in scenarios for the gener al public, but may be significant to people with certain traditional specialties su ch as basket making, flint knapping, or using natural medicines, smoke, smudges, paints, and dyes. These activities may result in increased dust inhalation, soil i ngestion, soil loading onto the skin for dermal exposure, or exposure via wounds, to give a few examples. While the portals of entry into the body are the same for everyo ne (primarily via the lungs, skin, mouth), the amount of contaminants may be increased and the relative importance of some activities (e.g., baske t making, wetlands gatheri ng), pathways (e.g., steam immersion or medicinal infusions), or por tals of entry (e.g., dermal wounding) may be different than for th e general population. Foraging theory data from the anthropological literature is particularly useful for developing exposure scenarios, because t he major dietary and resource staples may be described, as well as how much time and effort is needed to obtain them. Together, this information is then used for the food-chain portion of the scenario and to calculate the direct exposure factors.

Because large databases are not available and cannot be constructed, we take a top-down approach. For example, we do not attempt to develop a complete diet based on surveys of the uses of the typi cal 200+ natural resources available and used with an ecoregion. Rather, we develop a calorically complete food pyramid that identifies the major staples and their rough percentages in the original diet. Similarly, we do not develop an average day by tracki ng hundreds of individual activities from many people. The basic process is to: 1. Start with an understanding of the major categories of subsistence activities (such as hunting, fishing, gatheri ng, basket making, and sweat lodge purification), 2. Describe enough of the sub-activities that the complexity and interconnection of resources and activities can be understood, 3. Identify the major activities t hat contribute to exposure, and then 4. Iteratively cross-walk between activi ties and conventional exposure factors to develop cumulative exposure factors. To illustrate, each of the major activity cat egories includes activities that result in exposure to soil, and therefore soil ingesti on. By estimating the relative amount of time spent in activities that result in high, medium, or low soil exposure for each activity category, an overall soil-ingestion ra te can be estimated. However, we do not attempt to be overly quantitat ive in enumerating the myriad activities and resources in each category \u2014this requires more precision than is warranted and is likely to require proprietary information that cannot be released. Finally, a review of existing literature (biomedical, anthropological, and so on) enables us to double-check whether multiple lines of evidence leads us to a similar conclusion for each exposure factor.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 124 2 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING This section provides a general introduc tion to habitats and plant communities present in Washoe territory. General res ource use throughout the Washoe territory is described, with reference to the Levia than-Bryant Creek drainage or similar drainages as data are available. The Washoe culture, which evolved around Lake Tahoe, exploits a wide range of resources and ecological niches. The Washoe territory includes the boreal lakes and Sierra crest conifer zone (including Lake Tahoe, Honey Lake, and Topaz Lake), the transition zone with pinyon pines, and the Sonoran or sagebrush zone. Permanent settlements were located primarily near rivers and springs on the high ground of larger valleys. The distributi on of resources was largely the same in all major valleys, with some north-to-south gradations. Many authors have described the general en vironmental setting of the Sierra Nevada, Pinyon-Juniper, and Great Basi n ecosystems (Barbour and Major 1977, Brown 1986, Foster and Hobbs 1992, Holland and Kiel 1995, Lanner 1981, Moore 2000, Muir 1988a, b, Schaffer Smith 2000, Tilford 1997, Tingley and Pizarro 2000, Winnett 1987). There are two distinct ecosystem types in the original Washoe territory \u2014the heavily timbered and well-watered Sierra Nevada and the semi-desert Great Basin. The elevation of the Sierra Nevada causes saturated westerly winds to drop most of their moisture on the western slope. The mo ister western side has more ecological zones than the eastern side, with more grad ual transitions from one to the next. The western slopes mostly contain chaparra ls and ponderosa pine-oak woodlands, while the rain-shadowed eastern slopes, stretchi ng from the peaks to the Great Basin floor, mostly contain pinyon-juniper and sagebrush-steppe plant communities. A general sequence of vegetation types from higher to lower elevation is described by Walker (2003), Hammett et al. (2004) , and references cited therein, and is summarized in the following sections.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 125 The area is shown on a map of the c ontinental US in Figure 1 below. Figure 1. Continental U.S. with Washoe Tribe Location 2.1 BOREAL ZONES 2.1.1 Upper Montane Zone This boreal zone typically contains Jeffrey pine, white fir, and incense cedar (on gravelly dry slopes at higher elevations and moister north slopes at lower elevations) with understories of greenleaf and pinemat m anzanita, tobacco brush and/or snow bush, depending on soil type, moisture, canopy cover, and aspect. Oaks are shrubs at this elevation (huckleberry oak and bush chinquapin). This zone may include white and lodgepole pine if the water table is high, and red fir in flats with deep soils. This broad zone includes several subzones: the alpine and subalpine belts at higher elevations, and the lodgepole-fir belt. 2.1.2 Lower Montane Zone This boreal zone typically contains pines, r ed fir, and western or Sierra juniper with chaparral ), mountain misery, or sagebr ush, depending on soil type, moisture, canopy cover, and aspect. There ar e also some black oaks, western white pine, and sugar pine. Where fires have been suppressed, white fir and incense cedar overtake ponderosa and black oaks; r egular fires promote ponderosa, oaks, and ceanothus (deer forage). In higher m eadows or sand flats formed on pumice flats, a ring of water-tole rant lodgepole pines may surround the moist flat. In drier areas, the understory may be c haracteristic of Basin sagebrush, with rabbitbrush, ( Achillea millefolium ), Washoe Tribe Scenario 125 The area is shown on a map of the c ontinental US in Figure 1 below.

Riparian species change somewhat with elevation, and ma y include dogwood, alder, elderberry, currants, and a variety of bulbs and tubers. Springs and associated marshes and riparian habitats are extremely import ant to the Pine Nut Mountains' wildlife and to the Washoe people. They are widely scattered over the Pine Nut Mountains. While some wet areas are saline and alkaline marshes, most are small pools with warm to cool wa ter sources. Where the water table is highest (mesic soils), mountain meadows are present, with willows, alders, huckleberries, wild rose, aspen, and cottonwood at lower elevations (a sign of water). Meadows have the highe st plant diversity, with up to a hundred species in a single meadow. Mule ears (an aromatic large- leafed sunflower) can form colonies in dry meadows that are tens of acres in size. Berries, swamp onions, fern, wild spinach, wild lettuce, and various bulbs and tubers, such as lilies, wild potatoes, and Indian sweet potatoes, may be present. Tule, cattail, sedges, and other rushes can be present if moist enough. On river botto mlands, wild rye, western wheatgrass, Nevada bluegrass, sedges, rushes, bu ffaloberry, rubber rabbitbrush, Basin big sagebrush, Fremont cottonwood, and willow can be found. 2.2 2.2.1 Pinyon-Juniper Habitat (Pinus monophylla -Juniperus osteosperma ) This habitat covers slopes of the eastern Sierra in areas with gravelly, well-drained soils, which transition into the lower sagebrush belt. This community is closely associated with sagebrush scr ub, often with pinyons on upper slopes and sage just below them on flatter drier areas. The under story is most often sage, bitterbrush, rabbitbrush, green ephedra (Mormon tea), and mountain mahogany, wit h a variety of perennial wildflowers and grasses. 2.2.2 Sagebrush Steppe Intermountain grassland and Basin sagebrush pl ant associations occur at lower and drier of grasses and flowers. In the Basin (by the East Fork of the Carson River around Dresslerville), t he vegetation on the bench lands includes Wyoming sagebrush, rabbitbrush, bi tterbrush, squirreltail, vari ety of grass seeds, mustard, pigweed, 3 Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board, St ate of California (2003). 2002 Year-End Report for Leviathan Mine, Alpine County, California, p.24, species are also being used for re vegetation at the mine site.3 2.1.3 Mountain Meadows, Springs, and Creeks These habitats occur throughout the boreal and transition zones.

The lowest zone in the Great Basin is the shadscale zone, named after its most abundant shrub, and typically includes also green rabbitbrush, sa gebrush, four-winged saline areas may be dominated by big greasewood, along with des ert blite and green molly. 2.3.1 Desert Marshlands The Great Basin has no river outlets, but exhi bits high evaporation rates; therefore, some wet areas can contain alkaline wate rs and soils/sediments. Depending on the alkalinity, these waterlogged areas may cont ain salt-tolerant sedges and rushes. For example, the Stillwater Marsh (near to but not in the affected ar ea) has four lakes that drain from one to another , causing the salinity to increase sequentially. The first lake receives the freshest water (still potabl e) and contains cattails, bulrush, willow, and sago pondweed. The next lake is mo re saline and contains muskgrass, sago pondweed, and wigeongrass. The third basin cont ains alkali saltbrush or nutgrass. The final basin is the most saline (simila r and up to twice as saline as seawater) and contains few plants but many brine shrimp and brine flies.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 128 2.4 WATERSHEDS Many tribal homelands are defined in te rms of watershed boundaries with the water source in the center (unlike the West ern habit of using rivers as peripheral boundaries). This is because native peoples us e entire river valleys with their ranges of elevation from the river bottoms to the boundary ridges or mountains, and utilized the associated seasonal patterns of res ource availability. Figure 2 shows the Washoe area watersheds. Figure 2.

Washoe Area Watersheds Washoe Tribe Scenario 129 2.5 WASHOE ECOREGIONS The basic premise of underst anding ecologically-based lifew ays is that people adapt their activities and diets to their local ecological region in order to survive and prosper. Therefore, the descr iption of environmental se tting must identify natural ecological zones, or ecoregions. Ecoregion s denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantit y of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial fr amework for the re search, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components (Bryce et al. 1999). These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem managem ent strategies across federal and state agencies and nongovernmental organizations responsible for different types of resources in the same geographical areas (Omernik 2000). Ecological diversity is strongly related to it s varied climate, terrain, geology, and soil, and largely tracks watersheds and physiographic regions. In North America, several broad climatic zones are recognized, roughly corresponding to temperature and moisture gradients. North American vegetat ion types roughly track these zones. Of these zones, the Northwestern Forested Mo untains and North American Deserts are relevant to the Washoe Scenario. Bec ause the zones are defined by dominant vegetation types, the compositi on of plant and animal species is fairly predictable for the dominant species. Local differences in geology (soils and deeper substrates), elevation, aspect, and climate (light, temperature, prec ipitation and wind), and water (streams and wetlands) affect indi vidual plant associations. A hierarchical scheme has been adopted for diffe rent levels of ecological regions, and is being used by the US Envir onmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 4 Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America in to 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions. At Level III, the conterminous United States has 84 (USEPA 2005). Methods used by the USEPA to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2000, 2004), Gallant et al. ( 1989), and Bailey (1995).5 The approach used to compile these ecoregion maps is based on the premise that ecoregions can be identified through the analysis of the spatial patterns and the composition of biotic and abiotic characterist ics that affect or re flect differences in ecosystem quality and int egrity (Wiken 1986, Omernik 1987, 1995). These characteristics include physiography, geology, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, fish, hydrology, and vegetation, including \"pot ential natural vegetation,\" defined by Kuchler as vegetation that would ex ist today if human influence ended and the natural vegetation were restored (including the earlier fire regime of mixed natural and indigenous origin, and natural flooding). 4 http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions.htm and http://www.cec.org/files/PDF/ BIODIVERSITY/eco-eng_EN.pdf 5 USFS Bailey 129 basic premise of underst anding ecologically-based lifew ays is that people adapt their activities and diets to their local ecological region in order to survive and prosper.

Washoe Level III Ecoregions Washoe Tribe Scenario 131 3 OVERVIEW OF GENERAL WASH OE ECOLOGICAL LIFESTYLE The Washoe did not have to travel very far to obtain all the resources they needed and to access trade across the Sierras into California (Cook 1941). The Washoe economy focused on plant gathering, fish ing, and hunting (Price 1980, Kelly 1995, Tucker et al. 1992). The predominant staples included fish and pinyon nuts, both of which were zealously defended (Downs 1 966). There is evidence that Washoe families had a form of ownership interest of pinyon plots, which is rare in hunting and gathering societies. Additional staples included rabbits, acorns (obtained from northern Washoe areas or by trade from across the Sierra s into California), large game, small game, fowl, and many bulbs, roots, seeds and berries (Walker 2003, Hammett et al. 2004). An abundance of basket weaving and rabbit-skin robes indicates that a considerable amount of time wa s available for the material aspects of the culture. In the words of one Tri be member, water was a culturally esteemed resource, Water has always had a special signific ance to the Washoe people. All life is derived from water in Washoe beliefs, and water is considered sacred. There are legends and mythologies related to wa ter. The many uses of water range from spiritual, medicinal, and ceremonial uses, to everyday uses such as drinking, bathing, cooking, and cleani ng with water. Water\u2014whether in springs, streams, rivers, or lakes\u2014has such a defining and profound role in the culture of the Washoe people that it could be described as the essence of the Washoe people. 6 The number of people who still know and pr actice traditional ways (or remember them) is high, based on the number of people av ailable for interviews by Walker and Hammett. 3.1 HISTORICAL SEASONAL PA TTERNS OF THE WASHOE This section describes both the historical cycles and the modern adaptations that still follow seasonal resource availability. Alt hough this description often refers to past practices, it is important to understand t hat a resource-oriented lifestyle must still conform to the natural environment. Thus , even if people do not physically move their homes seasonally, they still pursue orig inal seasonal activities in original locations from a permanent home base, with modern conveyances and tools enabling them to reach these areas quicker and process resources faster. Also, pine nut camps, hunting camps, fishing camps, or other resource- based camps are still used by many native peoples. The Washoe year includes annual cycles fo r fishing, gathering, and hunting (Downs 1966, Kelly 2001). Fishing occurs all year long , but begins in earnest as soon as the snow begins to leave the lower foothills.

Whitefish from Lake Tahoe and the rivers 6 Darrel Cruz, Washoe Tribal member and Washoe Tribe Environmental Specialist, March 10, 2005. Washoe Tribe Scenario 132 provided welcome fresh food, along with ga me and early spring plants. By June, people had moved from the lake to winter ca mps in the pinyon belt or lowlands, to harvest spring migrations of trout and suckers from the lakes to t he tributaries. Fish were dried and lasted most but not all of the year, supplemented by smaller fish fresh from streams and ri vers (the Carson River, Truckee River, Bryant Creek, and their tributaries). When t he spring spawning runs were over, families moved to higher lakes, where mountain meadows pr ovided an increasing amount and diversity of food and more fish and animals became av ailable. By late summer, the many ripening lowland grasses spurred a round of seed gathering. In the fall, the pinyon nut harvest occurred, as well as its asso ciated ceremonies, large assemblages, and other events. Tremendous amounts of nut s were gathered, parched, and stored for winter and year-round use. Washoes were active during all seasons, although less so during the winter due to weather conditions (Downs 1966, Kelly 19 95, Hammett et al. 2004, Walker 2003, Price 1980, Tucker et al. 1992). At that ti me, watercress was t he primary fresh green plant available for gathering. The main win ter foods were pine nuts, dried and frozen meats, dried berries, fish, fowl, seeds , dried root and seed cakes, and teas and medicines. Some of the pine nuts were partia lly processed, but gr inding, winnowing, skinning, and other activities were still r equired. The Tribe had to gather firewood year-round. Whitefish were sought in the winter and hunting continued, and there was an emphasis on making tools, baskets, and other material items. Food and material preparation were constantly requi red regardless of w eather. The full range of plant and animal processing was constan t, including hulling, grinding, pounding, scraping, roasting, excavating cooking pits , carrying loads of food and materials and firewood, and building smoking racks, hearth s, caches, and shelters. Similarly, people always scouted, tracked game, monito red where to harvest the next ready resources, or looked for good stands. Downs noted that, \"Plant foods were gathered intensively from early spring until late fa ll\" (1966). A longer list of activities is presented in Hammett et al. (2004). 3.2 GENERAL RESOURCE USE A wide variety of species use by the Wa shoe is documented. Fowler (1986) lists over 200 species used throughout the Great Basin, many of which are in the Washoe areas, and Tilford (1997) notes that around 150 edible and medicinal species, including berries are in the general area, with 75% of those species (or at least 100) expected to be present in the Washoe territory. D'Azevedo (1986) describes \"a large variety of pr edictable resources close at hand.\" Hammett et al. (2004) and Walker (2003) analyzed information on plant and animal use from historical and contemporary et hnographic sources, including interviews with tribal members. The interviews fo cused on the resource s of the Leviathan- Bryant Creek watershed that are or were used by Washoe tribal members. The Walker report identifies many resources used. The Hammett report identifies and quantifies some of the resour ces of the overall diet, and also determines an activity level needed to develop exposure fact ors for traditional activities.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 133 3.2.1 Fishing and Hunting Fishing was a highly import ant vocation. In the higher mountain section of the Washoe country, notably at Lake Tahoe, fish ing was of similar importance as pine nut gathering. The Bryant Creek drainage has been a primary fishing area for the Washoe, and also has contained some of th e best hunting grounds. Fish of various kinds were abundant in the Bryant Creek drainage. Several native species of fish (Lahontan cutthroat trout, whitefish, su ckers, and minnows) and introduced species (brown trout, brook trout, rainbow trout, golden trout, and carp) are now present, although diminished. We depended on that creek [ Leviathan and Bryant] before [mining]; we used to fish in it. There were big fish in it, and we fished it all the time (Walker 2003). Game resources collected by the Washoe in the higher elevations , the Bryant Creek drainage, and the East Fork of the Cars on River include but ar e not limited to deer, antelope, marmot, ground squirrels,7 rabbits, crayfish, clams, waterfowl, quail, sage hens, grouse, and grasshoppers. The annual deer migration from high to lower elevations through the Lev iathan Creek corridor was a predictable event and the people relied upon it as a source of deer mea t. However, as interviewees noted, the deer do not come over Monitor Pass or through the Leviathan Cr eek area any more, indicating disrupted migration patterns (Walker 2003). 3.2.2 Gathering Price (1980) writes that \"t he average [Washoe] woman was comparable to a botanist in her medical knowledge of plants,\" and that \"about 100 species of plants were used in some way as food, medicine, fiber, or construction.\" Hammett et al. (2004) also lists about 100 plant species used. Downs (1966) describes the variety and amounts of plant foods as \"almost infinite,\" but widely dispersed. The semi-arid portion of the general Washoe te rritory provides a variety of grasses with edible seeds, as well as the pinyon pi ne whose nuts, commonly referred to as \"pine nuts,\" constitute such an important ar ticle of food throughout much of the Great Basin area. Leviathan Creek was one of the best source s for gathering plant to eat and willow branches for basket making (Walker 2003). Many Leviathan-Br yant Creek plant resources are cited in the Walker and Ha mmett interviews. In the spring and early summer numerous bulbs and roots were historically available, such as wild onions, 7 Different authors and interviewees use the term s gopher, woodchuck, marmot, prairie dogs, ground squirrel, and small or large ground squirrel without indicating species. We assume that woodchucks and large ground squirrels are actually marmots (Marmota flaviventri) , beldingi) . Washoe Tribe Scenario 133 3.2.1 Fishing and Hunting Fishing was a highly import ant vocation. In the higher mountain section of the Washoe country, notably at Lake Tahoe, fish ing was of similar importance as pine nut gathering.

We assume that woodchucks and large ground squirrels are actually marmots (Marmota flaviventri) , bitterroot, seve ral other types of wild lilies, several types of wild potatoes, cattail, tule, and many medicines. One Walker (2003) interviewee noted of the mine site, \"There is a lot of busdi [wild onions] up there.\" Among the most common western chokecherry, elderberry , buckberry , Saskatoon serviceberry, desert and gol den currants, Sierra plum, and Sierra gooseberry. Varieties of wild strawber ries were also traditionally gathered in the area and highly prized. Another Tribe member spoke of the abundance of edible plants (Walker 2003), \"There were a lot of st rawberries, spinach, and we had a lot of greens, like watercress. Mama knew a lot of the plants, like wild spinach. There were currants and strawberries, lots of them. There were very sweet. Chokecherries, as well.\" The leafy and/or tender parts of many plants gathered from the Bryant Creek drainage and the East Fork of the Cars on River were often eaten raw, although many were cooked or dried. Several species of watercress grow along many streams; some varieties are available th roughout the winter months and were eaten fresh as picked. Several types of mushr ooms were gathered under trees after spring rains, and ephedra tea was used as a stim ulating tea and for medicinal purposes (Walker 2003). The Washoe were especially noted for their basketry: \"Washoe baskets are the finest in the world\" (Sprout and Sprout 1999, Mason 1904, Cahodas 1979). Today, the Washoes continue to make twined or coiled baskets, primarily out of willow. Inner bark is used for the white twinin g and sewing elements, and browned from sun exposure (Barrett 1988). The other primary colored materi als are the bracken root (Pteridium aquilinum) , black when soaked in mud, the brown or red redbud bark (Cercis occidentalis ). The latter was historically obt ained by trade from the western Maidu (Garey-Sage 2003). Softer basket mate rials include cattails and a variety of grasses and sedges. Tules are used for raft s and mats. Most cordage is made from dogbane iris (Lindstrom 1992). 3.2.3 Sampling and Analysis Priorities Some of the major plant resources are show n in Table 1, as well as some of the animal species that could be a priority to sample and include in both the human and ecological risk assessments. Higher trophic levels than those in the table would also be included in both the human and ecolog ical risk assessments, but are not recommended for sampling (they should be m odeled instead). This table is not an exhaustive list of edible s pecies, but includes representative edible and materially important species. Some categories c ontain multiple plan t families, genera, and species.

Some species are merely brushed off befor e eating, some are ground, and some are pit-cooked. Residual soil on the outside of plants is known to be an exposure pathway, but there is very little data on th is point. Laboratory analysis should ideally test both what is internal to plants and what is left on the surface after being treated by tribal members in their usual way; otherwise the contam inant load will be underestimated.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 137 4 HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND EXPOSURE SCENARIO 4.1 METHODS FOR DESCRIBING THE DIET The approach used in describing an overall diet is to use the information about major resources present in the study area, fo raging theory information, and information from existing literature and interviews. An overall total caloric food pyramid with rough proportions of different food groups has been developed to show a typical traditional diet (Figure 4). This food pyra mid is reconstructed from information about what the traditional diet actually was, ra ther than what it mi ght be today if USDA recommendations about daily intakes were followed substituting wild foods for domesticated ones. In particular, the traditi onal Washoe diet was based on fish and game rather than grains. The steps for reconstructing the Washoe diet are: Review foraging theory information specif ic to the Tribe, the local ecosystem, and, if available, for the specif ic location under consideration; Review ecological information for a rough estimate of resource abundance of natural resources under baseline conditions; Review interviews and other ethnogr aphic sources for supporting information of species and abundance, habitat types, human activity levels, and methods of obtaining, preparing, and using resources; Develop overall percent ages of major food categories and major staples within the total diet; Estimate calories provided by the di et, and compare estimates of percentages of quantities and percentages of calories, and Refine estimates of major staples and food categories after considering information about medicines, sweeteners, other often-overlooked food/medicine types like macronut rients, and other factors. The dietary input for the risk assessment is typically somewhat less complex than the food pyramid (due to intrin sic limitations of the risk methods). Nevertheless, the risk assessment must consider the totality of species and calories. As noted in Section 3.2 on general resource use, the am ount and variety of species used by the Washoe is wide and abundant. 4.1.1 Foraging Theory Kelly (1995) describes the concepts of eco-cu ltural lifestyles, also known as foraging theory. In the 1960s to 1980s the \"Man the Hunter\" concept (with males providing most of the provender) prevailed due to a previous archaeological emphasis on hunting and warfare artifact s (Lee and Devore 1968). This gave way in the 1990s to a more balanced foraging model that emphas ized plants as much as meat (and equality of genders in cont ributing to survival) and a relatively peaceful and secure \"original affluent society\" (Sahlins 1972). The latter concept is supported by data (Kelly 1995, Winterhalder 1981) on the amount of time required to obtain survival Washoe Tribe Scenario 137 4 HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND EXPOSURE SCENARIO 4.1 METHODS FOR DESCRIBING THE DIET The approach used in describing an overall diet is to use the information about major resources present in the study area, fo raging theory information, and information from existing literature and interviews.

However, hunter- gatherers are not ove r-nourished, and face seasonal shortages even though outright starvation is rare. The lifestyle is also \"physically demanding\" (Kelly 1995), giving ri se to discussions about the number of calories available or required and the ac tivity levels used to develop exposure factors. Efficiency or return ra te for specific resources in specific habitats is estimated using foraging theory by evaluatin g the amount of calories expended in getting food (search costs) by means of hunt ing, gathering, or fishing rela tive to the time spent or calories obtained. Foraging information is typi cally presented as return rates, or net calories obtained per hour of effort. A dditional factors such as biodiversity, abundance, and patchiness or continuity of resources result in time allocation decisions that are intentionally or unintentionally made by foraging societies, such as optimal diet breadth, optimal foraging ar ea, and optimal foraging group size for a particular ecosystem (Winterhalder 1981) . Depending on the evaluation methods used in a study, this return rate data ma y include (1) time and calories spent in preparing to hunt, fish, or gather (e.g., making nets) , (2) time and/or ca lories spent in the actual activity, and (3) time spent in the processing of the resource after obtaining it. The drawback of oversimplifying foraging solely to caloric efficiency is that micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, specific amino acids, and fatty acids), medicinal or pharmacologically active compounds, other nutritional requirements, and non-nutritional attributes, such as aroma or dye or material uses, are often not considered (Lindstrom 1992). Similarly, m any plants and animals have multiple uses or are co-located with other re sources; therefore, caloric calculations must not ignore the way that people actually make decisions about where to go or what to gather, or the reasons they seek to obtain particular resources. 4.2 STUDIES ON WASHOE DIET 4.2.1 Foraging Studies Three major foraging theory studies hav e been identified for the Washoe: (1) Lindstrom (1992) focused on fishing in the Truckee River, (2) Tucker et al. (1992) evaluated a more generalized area and diet, and (3) Kelly (2001) focused on Great Basin wetlands resources. While these st udies did not specifically focus on the Leviathan-Bryant Creek drainage, they provide relevant information due to similarity of resources and uses. Each author's result s are presented separat ely even if they included the same resources since there were some differences in methods and assumptions. Lindstrom (1992) evaluated Truckee Riv er fishing and Great Basin aquatic and terrestrial resources for ca loric return rate efficien cy associated with traditional methods, i.e., including the time needed to ma ke fish nets and other implements and processing costs for storage compared to fresh consumption. She evaluated the hours spent obtaining and preparing resources ( during their peak availability times).

She evaluated the hours spent obtaining and preparing resources ( during their peak availability times). Washoe Tribe Scenario 139 She also gathered information from interviews with Washoe members skilled at making and using traditional implements, and information from the archaeological record. She concluded that the Tr uckee River-based economy would have emphasized fish, grasshoppers (during peak years and seasons), big game, rabbits, small game, pinyon nuts (from the foothills ), cattail pollen, and various individual seeds and roots, in that approx imate order. Lindstrom writes that \"a high level of energy efficiency suggests fish were used as a principal resource whenever they were available.\" This assumes a certai n efficiency of capture or abundance, especially during schooli ng or spawning, and ratios of specific capture methods. As she notes, her ranking of resources from most to least prefe rred is not entirely consistent with notes from anthropologists, settlers, and visitors, or with tribal traditional environmental knowledge. For inst ance, rabbits and pine nuts (from the pinyon pine) are ranked lower than their ac tual importance, primarily because her analysis focused on a single resource ar ea rather than on t he overall Washoe territory. This also suggests that a number of factors are not included in typical equations used to rank resources, such as possible high seasonal abundance, group hunts, storability, and mult iple uses of resources (e.g., rabbits hunted for both food and skins, willows gathered for baskets as well as medicine, and many other material items made from mount ain and foothill resources). Tucker et al. (1992) describe an \"idealized pr e-contact Washoe diet\" based on a diet breadth model using ethnograph ic and archaeological data, such as frequency and location of bones and implements commonly f ound in excavations. The diet is also based on known resource abundance and calo ric return rates per hour, but it underestimates soft matter such as plant s and fish bones that decompose and leave less of a physical trace. Tucker et al. do not include energy expended in chasing or the efficiency of gathering co-located resource s (other than indirectly through overall abundance of the resource), the energy expended in processing the resources, or other uses that might al ter the preferential sequence. The approximate order in which individual resources would be pref erred using only the caloric, seasonal abundance and archaeological information is: 1. Deer (return rate = 24,000 kcal/hr; a ssumes one kill per 8 hours of effort), 2. Antelope (return rate = 23,000 kcal/hr), 3. Jackrabbit (return ra te = 14,000 kcal/hr), 4.

(1992), small s eeds and greens as combined categories of resources (rather than individua l species) are efficient res ources to gather if they are sufficiently abundant and if gathered concurrent ly with higher ranked resources. This list also completely overlooks the many im portant greens, roots, bulbs, tubers, and rhizomes that were gathered in abundance, as well as basket materials and non- food items. Some of the list ed resources would also rank higher if they store well or if they provide specific nutrients. The Washoes knew to expend extra energy in gathering storable resources as a hedge agai nst famine, and are also well aware of nutritional or medicinal benefits of specif ic plants. For exam ple, spinach and watercress were considered essential foods . A Hammett et al. (2004) interviewee noted, \"[Washoe] people craved this food [watercress]; must have been something in it people need because parents insisted that children eat it.\" Thus, broad categories of plants (greens, frui ts, roots, bulbs, tubers) ar e not represented at all in the above ranking. Even seeds, some of wh ich are recovered archaeologically, are probably underestimated, espec ially native grasses \"from which tons of seed were gathered\" (Cook 1941). Kelly (1995) evaluated Great Basin for aging in his discussion of many foraging societies around the world. Anim als, including waterfowl, are all more efficient to gather than plants as long as they are relatively easy to catch. Return rates for a few resources (based on kcal/hr of effort, but not indicating how strenuous the effort is; on known abundance locally, and showing ra tes for worst to best years based on available data) were estimated as: Deer = 17,000-31,000 kcal/hr (p oor year to best year), Jackrabbit = 14,000, Gopher = 10,000, Cattail = 300, and Pine nuts = 800-1,400. Kelly (1995) estimated that the overall Washoe diet wa s obtained 30% from hunting, 40% from gathering, and 30% from fishi ng. This was based on estimates of abundance, density of resource s, seasonality, and harvesti ng or cooking technology. Unlike the list in Tucker et al. (1992), plant resources are very prominent. For example, cattail roots harve sted in the summer have a poor return rate, because they have expended their energy into the l eaves. But when harvested in the late fall or winter when energy is being stored, they have a much higher return rate and would be a preferred food choice. Lower calo ric return rates are provided by cattail pollen, squirrels, ducks, gambel oak acorns , tansy mustard seeds, pine nuts (low overall calorie return due to the time required to roast the cones, gather seeds, and grind them into meal), bi tterroot roots, wild rye seeds , minnows (caught with nets), saltbush seeds, bulrush seeds, other gra sses, sunflowers, and roots. Among plant resources, cattail pollen was estimated to have the densest caloric content, with Washoe Tribe Scenario 140 13. Indian rice grass seeds (return rate = 300 kcal/hr).

Among plant resources, cattail pollen was estimated to have the densest caloric content, with Washoe Tribe Scenario 141 acorns, pine nuts, and tansy mustard seeds next, followed by all other roots and seeds. However, although cattail pollen is calo rically dense, it takes time and effort to obtain; therefore, its return rate is lo wer than cattail roots, which is a poorer food but easier to obtain in quantity. However, cattail pollen can be eaten right off the stalk, and thus may have no processing cost s (although it was typically ground into flour before use). Kelly (2001) focused on the level of re sources obtained from Gr eat Basin wetlands (Stillwater Marsh near Carson Lake, sout heast of Pyramid Lake), based on foraging theory and a caloric balance that includes walking to a resource, carrying a load back, and harvesting and processi ng costs. Based on all cost s, Kelly estimated that a typical family's foraging area is 6km in radius until resources are reduced beyond a certain abundance (hunting areas might be la rger). A large amount of storable resources, such as dried fish or game or pine nuts, allows a family to maintain a central residence such as a winter home (whi ch was always by springs or streams). Thus, \"fish, large game, seeds, and pinyon appear to have been particularly important.\" Kelly concluded that the rates of return were great est for grasshoppers (collected en masse after they periodica lly washed up on lake shores and formed windrows, then roasted), followed by loca l large game, small game, waterfowl, a variety of seeds and nuts, and winter-gathered cattail and tule roots. Kelly (2001) also estimated return rate s for foraging away from home and included an estimate of kcal expended during the foraging activity. Foraging in a marsh from a residential base near the marsh (camps we re generally \u00bc to \u00bd mile from a marsh due to mosquitoes) was based on an assumpti on of moderate walking at 300 kcal/hr on the way out, plus 30% more carrying a 32 liter load back, all in an 8 hour day and with an average return rate of 1830 kcal/hr (n ot including processi ng). After taking the return rate and subtracting the energy cost of walking there and collecting and returning with a load, the species which hav e the most effective return rates are (more examples appear in Kelly 2001; Table 3-8): Cattail pollen = 4500 kcal/hr (the highest return rate kcal/hr), Chub = up to 4000, Rodents, waterfowl, bulrush seeds = around 1000, and Many other seeds ranging from 100 to 800. It is important to note that t he effective return rate for large game is more difficult to estimate, since the time spent in finding it is so variable. Here is a list of similar more variable return rates are: Pine nuts = 800 to 9600 (depending on di stance and other conditions), Large game = up to 4,500 at 8 hours per kill, Small game = up to 2500, Bitterroot = 1250, and Ricegrass and wild rye seeds = 350.

The numbers indicate how much could be gathered by one or more people in a season for personal use, fam ily use, and/or shar ing or trading. Nuts: Pine nuts\u2014up to 1500 lbs of nuts Note: Price (1980) indicates consumpti on of 300 pounds of pine nuts per person per year, eaten at a rate of 1 pound of pine nuts per person per day, or one-half of the total food consumpt ion. At roughly 600 kcal per 100g after shelling and winnowing (USDA database), and 454g/pound, this means that 2700 kcal per pound of pine nuts could have been availa ble per person per day. If pine nuts comprised half the diet, this would mean that 5,000 kcal/day was consumed, which is double the typical forager dietar y intake (Kelly 1995). On the other hand, pine nuts are a well-known staple. \"At ce rtain seasons [the Washoe] have fish... for the remainder of the year they live upon the pine nuts, which form their greater winter subsistence\" (Li ndstrom 1992, citing Nevins 1956). Cook (1941) interviewed Washoe familie s regarding current pine nut availability. Families could gather up to twenty 100- pound sacks in good years, although they typically sold up to half. Some famili es got far less, presumably depending on their access to pine nut allotments, whet her it was a good year, or other reasons. A 100 pound sack yields 60 pounds of meat after shelling and winnowing (which Price, above, may not have considered). Cook also discussed fresh pine nuts versus the dried nuts (after parching for storage), which could reduce the weight by 15%. This would mean that 100 pounds of fresh nuts yields about 50 pounds of ground meal at approximately 2100 kcal per pound of nut flour, which is one of the forms eaten.

This information is combined to reconstruct a diet that was obtai ned from stream-river drainages such as the Leviathan-Bryant Creek system. It is intended to describe what the diet actually was before contamination altered the natural resources. This diet is presented below as percentages and as a food pyramid (Figure 4).

Therefore, fish are ranked lower in the diet shown below . It does not include acorns from the northern part of the Washoe territory. Based on interviews and existing literature, foraging theory, dietary calories, and related information, the traditional Washoe diet for foothill dr ainage systems such as the Leviathan-Bryant Creek system is estimated as: Pine nuts (20% of total calories); Fish and shellfish (15%); Game (large and small, and fowl) (15%); Roots, bulbs, tubers, rhizomes (15%); Greens (10%); Berries (10%); Seeds (10%), and Honey, rose hips, medicines, teas (5% combined).

Specific in formation from the USDA database, such as for game species, is used when available. Where possible, the data for fresh or cooked foods matches the form of nativ e plants eaten. We recognize that domesticated species of plants have been bred for certain characteristics, such as low fiber content and more sweetness. Tribal members often refer to wild varieties as being \"stronger\" than domesticated variet ies. This is a well-known data gap. Table 2 indicates macronutrient content for representative species, Table 3 estimates calories for the major fo od categories, and Table 4 estimates macronutrients for the major food categories. We are assuming, as other authors have, that 2500 kcal is adequate for foraging activity levels in a 70kg person; however, higher calorie levels may also be appropriate. For this analysis, we are conservatively assuming the lower calorie rate. Table 4 estimates a Washoe daily diet in wh ich 26% of calories come from protein, 170 grams per day (gpd); 36% from lipid, 102gpd, and 38% from carbohydrate (CHO), 244gpd. (Due to the lipid content of the nuts and seeds, this diet is higher in lipid than many foraging diets.) Protei n and carbohydrate provide roughly 4 kcal/g. Fats and oils provide roughly 8-9 kcal/ g. Therefore, t he estimated daily macronutrients ingested 170g protein x 4 kcal/g = lipid x 9 kcal/g = 918 kcal, and 244g CHO x 4 kcal/g = 976 kcal, providing a total of 2574 kcal. For comparison, Hunn (1990) described a typi cal daily Columbia Plateau diet that included 1300gpd roots (providing 1330 kca l), 100gpd berries (62 salmon (850 kcal), and 240gpd (302 kcal). The total intake is 2140gpd (2543 kcal), or roughly 4 to 5 pounds of f ood per day. The Columbia Plateau diet provides 168gpd protein, 334gp d carbohydrate, and 55.4gpd lip id (30% protein, 60% carbohydrate, and 10% lipid).

Indirect pathways include exposur e via the oral inges tion of food and medicine (see previous section). This sect ion focuses on direct pathways: direct inhalation, dermal exposure, and ingestion of water, air, dust, sediment, and soil (including soil on the outside of food or added through cooking). Default exposure factors have been devel oped for conventional suburban, urban, occupational, and recreational scenarios ba sed on national statistics. Our approach to developing a tribal scenario is not to in ventory every activity and every resource, but to provide an overall estimate of the general activity levels, anchored with specific information as available. The basic assumption is that traditional lifeways are active outdoor lifestyles that are m oderately physically demanding, even with some modern conveniences. Subsist ence foragers (both genders) perform a combination of aerobic (high heart and v entilation rates), strength, endurance, and stretching-flexibility daily activities, as well as performing more sedentary work and resting. The exposure factors here ar e general to traditional subsistence lifestyles, regardless of their location. However, they may not be identical to the site-specific RME (reasonably maximally exposed) indi vidual, which will be tailored to the habitats and resources found in the a ffected area once baseline and current ecological and environmental conditions are defined. The conceptual steps in this process are: 1. Understand the lifestyle and the activiti es that comprise the lifestyle, and are required to obtain necessities an d engage in the community culture; 2. Describe the day, the y ear, and the lifetime of men and women to identify any significant differences in activity levels between genders or ages; 3. Cross-walk activities with exposur e pathways on the basis of frequency and duration of major activities, activi ty levels, and degree of environmental contact, and 4. Estimate cumulative exposure factors. 5.2 MAJOR ACTIVITIES Tables 5-7 show the thought process fo r considering the range and number of activities associated with majo r activity categories (hunti ng, fishing, gathering, and sweat-lodge purification).

Washoe Tribe Scenario 151 Table 6. Major activity categories. Activity Type General Description Hunting Hunting includes a variety of preparation ac tivities of low to moderate intensity. Ritual bathing occurs before the hunt. Hunting occurs in terrain ranging from flat and open to very steep and rugged. It may also include setting traplines, waiting in blinds, digging-out small game, c limbing, etc. After the capture or kill, field dressing, packing or hauling, and other strenuous activities may occur, depending on the species. Subsequent activities include cutting, storing (e.g., smoking or drying), and returning the remains to the ecosystem. Fishing Fishing includes building weirs, scooping minnows, hauling in lines (we assume that large nets are not used in small drainages), gaffing or gigging, wading (for shellfish), followed by cleaning the fish and carrying them to the place of use. Activities associated wi th smoking and constructing drying racks may be involved. Remains are returned to aquatic ecosystems. Gathering Women gathered plants \"perhaps within a day's walk from camp\" using a digging stick, knife, and basket for ca rrying resources back to camp (Downs 1966, Hammett et al. 2004). A variety of acti vities is involved, such as hiking, bending, stooping, wading (marsh and water plants), digging, bundling, carrying, and climbing over a wide variety of terrains. Ritual purification (sweat lodge) Sweat-lodge building and repairing is intermittent, but collecting firewood is a constant activity. D'Azevedo (1986) lists 6 citations for Washoe ritual purification. Cold and hot springs were used for therapeutic healing. Today, every Washoe community has a purification lodge (Washoe Tribe, personal communication). Materials use and food preparation Many activities of low to high intensit y are involved in preparing materials for use or food storage. Some are quite vigorous such as pounding or grinding seeds and nuts into flour, preparing meat, and tanning hides. This category includes basket making, which is an exam ple of a very important activity with its own set of prescribed activities, meanings, and cultural ethics. Washoe Tribe Scenario 151 Table 6.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 153 5.3 THE FAMILY, THE DAY, AND THE LIFETIME This section describes a family-based exposure scenario based on a traditional Washoe lifestyle and diet. It is based on habit s of tribal members who live in a house in a sparsely populated riparian corri dor with a home garden, and who have a high rate of subsistence activities, a regular sch edule of other cultural activities and are seasonally occupied as field workers m onitoring natural and cultural resources, taking environmental samples, and doing re clamation or restoration work. The lifestyles are moderately active outdoor lifestyles. 5.3.1 Lifestyle of a Representative Washoe Tribal Family The families are intended to be reasonable maximum composites, and were constructed with the guidance of the Washoe Tribal Cultur al Resources Coordinator. Each family includes (1) an infant/child (age 0-2 years) who breast-feeds for two years and crawls and plays; (2) a child (age 2-6) who plays in the house and outdoors; (3) a youth (age 7-16) who att ends school, plays outdoors near his/her residence, and is learning traditional practi ces; (4) two adult workers (one male, one female, age 17-55; the female breast-feeds the infant) who work outdoors on reclamation and environmental and cultural activities, and engage in subsistence activities, and (5) an elder (age 56-75) who is partly at home and partly outdoors teaching and demonstrating traditional cultur al practices. All members (except the infant from 0-2 years) par take in cultural activities throughout the year. Location and Type of Residence: The residence is located at the furthest upstream available allotment in the Levia than-Bryant Creek dr ainage. The family lives in a house with no landscaping ot her than the natural vegetation, no air conditioning, and wood-burning heat in the winter. The house has its own well for domestic use and a garden irriga ted with groundwater or surf ace water (whichever is more contaminated). The road and driveway are not paved. 5.3.2 Activity Patterns of Each Family Member Infant: The infant breast-feeds for 2 years, a nd crawls on the floor (a source of house dust exposure) from age 6 months to 2 years. Infants ingest more fluid per body weight than children do, and toddlers (6 months to 2 years) are likely to have the highest of the children's exposures due to crawling and mouthing behaviors, and their food and water per capita ingestion rates. Child (ages 2-6 years): Beginning at age 2, the child eats the same food as everyone else, and spends some time a ccompanying the mother as she gardens and gathers. Youth (ages 7-16): The adolescent is learning to hunt, gather, and fish (and spends equal time in each activity in their respec tive locations), plays outdoors, and attends school.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 154 Adult Worker (ages 17-55): Workers are assumed to wo rk for the Tribe collecting environmental samples, engaging in restorat ion/remediation or construction work, and caring for natural and cultural resources and tribal property. This type of activity is dusty in the summer and muddy in the winter. Both males and females are currently employed in this type of activity . Workers could be exposed to surface soil and dust, vegetation, surface water, sedi ments, and seeps. These workers have an average 8-hour workday. While in the field, the worker eats l unch brought from home, possibly supplemented with native foods gathered near the workplace, and does not have a place to wash food (dust ingestion). Adult Hunter/Fisher/Gatherer: Each adult also hunts (ma le), fishes (male), or gardens and gathers plants (femal e). These activities are roughly analogous to each other with respect to the degree of env ironmental contact, and therefore are assumed to result in the same amount of soil or sediment ingestion for males and females. The additional time and contact during game processing, plant washing and preparation are also roughl y equal. The location of hunting small game or fowl is in the same area as the residence, and t he location of big game hunting covers a larger area. The garden is at the place of residence and us es the same water as the household, while the gathering occurs in a larger area. All of the hunters, gatherers and fishers spend some time near water, if it is present in the area, on activities such as washing plants or game, gathering aquat ic plants and mollusks/crustaceans, and so on, with concomitant expos ure to mud or sediment. Elder (ages 56-75): The elder gathers plants and me dicines, prepares them, uses them (e.g., making medicine s or baskets, etc.) and teaches a variety of indoor and outdoor traditional activities. The elder al so provides child care in the home. 5.3.3 Specific Cult ural Activities This section considers activities that ar e engaged in at varying levels by the Tribe and by varying age-groups, and other fa ctors that affect exposure. Ritual Purification (Sweat Lodge) (ages 10-75): A sizeable fraction of Washoe youth and adults participate in purification ceremonies in private or community ceremonial (sweat) lodges. The basic mechanics of lodge construction and use have been described in the open literature. The size of Washoe sweat lodges is roughly 5 feet high and 12 feet wide. The duration is generally about 2 hours per ceremony. The frequency is calculated based on 8 mont hs of participation in one 2-hour ceremony plus 4 months of participation in a four-sweat series, for a total of 24 2- hour sweats per year. This frequency is an average for Washoes who participate in purification ceremonies, but may some what underestimate the frequency for ceremonial leaders. During the ceremony, approximately 4 gallons of water is poured on heated rocks, forming steam ( one gallon per half hour). Either groundwater or surface water may be used. Inhalation and heart rates and inhalation rates may be higher depending on activiti es that occur during the sweat-lodge ceremony (e.g., singing).

Inhalation and heart rates and inhalation rates may be higher depending on activiti es that occur during the sweat-lodge ceremony (e.g., singing). Washoe Tribe Scenario 155 Cultural Activities: All age-groups participate in day-long outdoor community cultural activities once a month, including seasonal ceremonial and private cultural activities (averaging about 0.5 hours/day). These are often gatherings which consist of activities that result in a greater rate of dust resuspension and particulate inhalation, as well as great er personal inhalation and wate r ingestion rates. If this scenario is applied in other locations, addition al activities such as powwows could be considered. Basket Making: Exposure pathways specific to basket makers are well- recognized,11 but data useful for exposure asse ssment are almost totally lacking. Gathering of some plants (e.g., willows , cattails, reeds, and rushes) can be very muddy, and therefore river-s hore or lakeshore sediment exposure may be underestimated. Washing, peeling, weaving rushes, and other activities result in additional exposure to dust deposited on leav es or soil adhered to roots. Some of the materials are held in the mouth for sp litting, and cuts on fi ngers are common. As more information becomes available, it wil l be evaluated so that exposure factors for each route of exposure account for these particular activities. Other Special Activities: It is recognized that there are special circumstances when some people may be highly exposed (and their exposure would be underestimated). For instance, some men hunt or fish fo r the general community, and many people provide roots and fish and game to elders in addition to their own families. Flint knappers may receive additional exposure through obtaining and working with their materials. Elders with special traditiona l environmental knowledge may spend more time in the field teaching. As with the exposure pathways of baske t making, other pathways unique to traditional practices also lack data and are therefore sources of uncertainty. For example, pharmacologically active medicina l plants may have differential uptake of contaminants into the plant as well as a ffecting the metabolism of the person and/or interacting with contaminants. Alkaloid s in ephedra tea and other plants affect metabolism in various ways. Material s released from firewood, smokes, and smudges may contain contaminants or affe ct physiological parameters of the person. We have tried to consider these and other pathways in the cumulative roll- up of exposure factors, but they remain as potentia l exposure pathways or can potentially affect the way that a person reacts to single or multiple contaminants. Seasonality: The changes in activity patterns over the annual seasonal cycle has been modified in modern times, but the ec ological cycle has not, so people must still gather plants according to when they are ripe, hunt according to game and fowl patterns, and fish when the spawning runs occur. Many item s are gathered during one season for year-round use. While specific activities change from season to season, they are replaced by other activi ties with a similar environmental contact rate. For instance, a particular plant may be gathered during one month, while another month may be spent hunting, and a winter month may include cleaning and 11 http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/envjust/documents/basketweaver.pdf Washoe Tribe Scenario 155 Cultural Activities: All age-groups participate in day-long outdoor community cultural activities once a month, including seasonal ceremonial and private cultural activities (averaging about 0.5 hours/day).

We assu me that all activities are roughly equal, so there is no decrease in environmental contact ra tes during wint er months. 5.3.4 Time Allocation throughout the Day This section describes the time allocation t hat is reflected in daily exposure factors. The locations at which these activities occur will be defined in the RME report. Identical Activities: From the age of 2 to 75 year s, 15 hours of every day are similar: 8 hours sleep, 3.5 hours in other i ndoor activities, some time in the sweat lodge (averaged), 2 hours in nearby outside activity, such as small game hunting, 0.5 hour in community cultural activiti es, and 1 hour traveling on unpaved roads. These activities are referred to as common time . Infant: Standard infant exposure par ameters are used. Hous e dust is assumed to have similar concentrations of contaminants as outside soil. The infant is breast-fed for 2 years. The risk assessment may be performed assuming two different scenarios: (1) the mother has received 25 years of prior exposure from a contaminated area; and (2) the mother has not received such exposure. In situations where exposure has been occurring, a new mother may have been exposed as she was growing up and may carry a body burden or heritable mutation that she might pass on to a fetus during gestation, as well as during lactation. If contamination remains on site into the future, then futu re mothers could be exposed as children, and then through pregnancy. In other situations, a female might not re turn to the site until after the baby is born, so the infant 's exposure would not start until birth, and would not have been exposed in utero. Child: The child, through age 6, spends the sa me amount of common time in the same activities, and 4 hours indoors and 5 hours outdoors with t he mother as she gardens and gathers. Youth: Common time plus 6 hours at school 5 days/week (averaging 4.5 hours/day), 2.5 hours indoors, and 3 hours outdoors playi ng or accompanying an adult or elder, learning traditional activities . It is assumed that the sch ool is uncontaminated unless there is data about chemical usage or contam ination, and it is also assumed that his or her near-residence outdoor time results in a higher amount of soil contact than at other ages; therefore, the youth's average co ntact rates are the same as those of the child and the adult. Adult: Common time plus 8 hours working 5 days/week (about 5.5 hours/day), 0.5 hour at home, and 3 hours in one of the subsistence activities. Elder: Common time plus 3 hours at home providing child care, 3 hours outdoors teaching, 1 hour gardening or gathering, and 2 hours at home processing materials and making items.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 157 5.3.5 The Lifetime Traditionally, daily tasks were somewhat di fferent for males and females: males tend to hunt and fish, while females gather and cook. However, even where activity patterns show gender dimorphi sm, the rates of environment al contact were and are probably similar. In addition, both wom en and men are employed as environmental and construction workers, as well. Theref ore, for the purposes of the exposure scenario, the genders have identical exposure factors. Male Lifetime: The male lifetime consists of the standard infancy, childhood, and youth. At age 17 he specializes in either hunting or fishing and begins working as a reclamation/restoratio n/environmental worker. These activities are specified solely to determine their locations, which may have different contaminant concentrations. As an elder he changes his activity pattern s to teaching and demonstrating, as described above. Female Lifetime: The female lifetime consists of the standard infa ncy, childhood, and youth. At age 17 she engages in gatheri ng and gardening and also works the same job as the male. During motherhood, the woman may remain at home, which is located in the same sparsely popul ated area, and she continues to garden and gather, so her exposure does not diminish. He r earlier exposure may result in a dose to the fetus and breast-feeding infant. 5.4 MEDIA, PATHWAYS, AND DIRECT EXPOSURE FACTORS As described previously, exposure factor s are developed by cross-walking the activities described above with specif ic media-based exposure pathways. The identification of medi a pathways begins to sum exposur es; for instance, all the soil exposures from hunting, gathering, hous ehold activities, processing and using materials, food processing, and other activi ties are summed qualitatively. At a later step in the RME, the time spent in va rious locations will be defined so location- specific exposure point concentrations can be determined. Ground Water and/or Surface Water Pathways: The importance of bathing in Washoe ritual life makes access to clean and uncontaminated water particularly important. As mentioned previously, water is central to Washoe identify and life. Ritual bathing and/or steam pur ification occurs before h unting and other cultural activities. Water is also important fo r general cleanliness (which has always been very important to tribal members), soak ing plant materials, and processing foods and materials. For purposes of evaluating ri sk, both ground water and/or surface water are directly ingested as drinking water. Bo th are also used to create steam in the sweat lodge. Other uses of these res ources include typical household use (e.g., cooking, bathing, showering), irrigat ion of crops and/or garden, and livestock watering.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 158 Air and Dust Pathways: As a general rule, the air pathway can result in exposure to any present volatiles, aerosols, and resuspended dust. Dust resuspension from unpaved roads and other unvegetated surfaces should be included as part of the inhalation exposure pathway. If there is a potential for exposure, inhalation of fire smoke or smudge should be included becau se some of these pathways can be frequent and significant. Soil and Sediment Pathways: This pathway includes so il ingestion from hand to mouth activities associated with daily acti vities, gathering (e.g., digging roots) and gardening, food and material processing (e .g., grinding, scraping, pit cooking). Several foods are prepared by pit cooki ng: fish, ground squirrels, wild garlic, wild onions, acorns, pine nuts, and marmots (H ammett et al. 2004, Walker 2003). This pathway also includes direct ingesti on resulting from residual soil on roots and bulbs. The as-gathered and as-eaten conditi ons of plants are important. Many vegetable foods were eaten raw and on the s pot. Hammett et al. (2004) describes such eating of lily bulbs, with the only preparation being brushing the dirt off. Grinding seeds and nuts also adds rock dust to the flour. Gathering of willows, bracken fern, and ot her basket and cordage materials results in soil ingestion. Further exposure is re ceived when one splits shoots into weaving strips by holding one end in the mouth while pulling strips off with each hand. 5.5 EXPOSURE FACTORS FOR DI RECT EXPOSURE PATHWAYS A description of activities for the purposes of developing exposure factors focuses on: Frequency of activity: Daily, weekly, monthly Duration of activity: Hours at a time Number of years Intensity of environmental contact and intensity of activity: For soil ingestion and dermal exposure, is the activity more than, less than, or equal to gardening, camping, cons truction/excavation, or sports? For inhalation rates and calorie needs, is the activity level more than, less than, or equal to standard EPA activity leve ls for specific activities with known respiration rates and caloric expenditure? The following table (Table 8) includes th ree adult scenarios: the suburban resident, the rural residential farmer-gardener, and the subsistence forager. The first two scenarios are typically used in risk assessm ents, and the third re flects the set of activities that compose the Washoe lifestyle. Each scenario is intended to be physiologically coherent , which means that the dietary intake, activity levels, and inhalation rates are physiologically link ed. For instance, t he more sedentary suburban scenario is based on national data on typical lifestyles (light occupational Washoe Tribe Scenario 158 Air and Dust Pathways: As a general rule, the air pathway can result in exposure to any present volatiles, aerosols, and resuspended dust.

For instance, t he more sedentary suburban scenario is based on national data on typical lifestyles (light occupational Washoe Tribe Scenario 159 activities sitting or standing, with some m oderate activity at home), while the rural residential farmer has a higher activity leve l, higher inhalation rate, and higher soil ingestion rate due to his fa rming activity pattern. The subsistence forager is still more active, with a proportionally higher inhalation rate, as well as a higher soil ingestion rate, due to a higher degree of soil contact. The table shows adult values, as does the dietary discussion above. Children's exposure factors are scaled from the subsis tence forager rates, as is conventionally done in risk assessment (from the Childre n's Exposure Factors Handbook), with the exception of the soil ingestion rate, which is left at 400mg/d throughout the lifetime. Body weight is a consistent 70kg because that is the standard EPA assumption used in risk assessments.

Exposure Factors (Adults) Direct Pathway Default Suburban Lifestyle Rural Residential Farmer Lifestyle Subsistence Forager Lifestyle Inhalation 20m3 25m3: While EPA does not have official exposure factors for this lifestyle, it is reasonable to assume that a person who farms, gardens, irrigates, and cares for livestock has an intermediate inhalation rate. 30m 3/day: This rate is based on a lifestyle that is an outdoor active lifestyle, based on EPA activity databases, foraging theory, and ethnographic description of the activities undertaken to obtain subsistence resources as well as allotment-based food (livestock and garden). It is higher than the conventional 20m3/day because the activities with associated respiration rates are higher than suburban activities. Drinking water ingestion 2L/d 3L/day: This rate is based on water requirements in an outdoor moderately arid environment. 3L/d plus 1L for each use of the sweat lodge during ritual purification: at 24 uses per year, this is 3.065L/d, which we are rounding down to 3L. Soil ingestion 100mg/d (conventional suburban); 50mg/d (manicured suburban; less outdoor time) 300mg/d 400mg/d: This rate is based on indoor and outdoor activities, a greater rate of gathering, processing, and other uses of natural resources, as well as on residual soil on grown and gathered plants. Episodic events (1 gram each) are considered, such as wetland gathering, cultural activities with higher soil contact, and so on. It does not specifically include geophagia or pica.

(2002) estimated an average water ingestion rate of 3L/day for adults, based on total fluid intake in an arid climate. In addition, each use of the sweat lodge requires an additional 1L fo r rehydration (24L per year). It should be noted that water intake in an arid env ironment may be more than 3L per day. For example, the Army assumes that the maxi mum individual daily amount of drinking water required by military personnel to remain combat-effect ive ranges from 5- 15L/day, depending on the climate, season, and intensity of work.12 The Army Quartermaster assumes that military personnel in hot clim ates require 3 gallons per day as drinking water.13 Soil and Sediment Ingestion: Soil ingestion includes consideration of direct ingestion of dirt, mud, or dust, swa llowing inhaled dust, mouthing of objects, ingestion of dirt or dust on food, a nd hand-to-mouth contact. The Washoe soil ingestion rate of 400mg/day is based on a review of EPA guidance, soil ingestion studies in suburban and indigenous settings , and dermal adherence studies (a small portion of which is summarized here). It is also based on knowledge about subsistence lifestyles with their higher envir onmental contact rate s and local climatic and geologic conditions. It reflects a variet y of soil pathways such as pit cooking, gathering and gardening, residua l soil or dust on foods and medicine, localized soil- generating activities, holding natural materi als in the mouth while processing or using, driving on unpaved roads , and similar considerations. It also considers many 1-gram days and events , such as root gathering days, tule and reed gathering days, horse training and riding days, sweat-lodge building or repair days, grave digging, and similar activities. There are also likel y to be many high or intermediate-contact days, depending on the occupation (e.g., wildlife field work, construction or road work, cultural resource field work). A baseline number of these events is incorporated, but this would need to be reco nsidered in the RME if a large number of such events becomes evident. The soil ingestion rate of 400mg/d for all ages is the published upper bound for suburban children (EPA 1997), and is within t he range of outdoor activity rates for adults but lower than the typical 480mg/d app lied to outdoor work, to allow for some low-contact days. Subsistence lifestyles were not considered by the EPA guidance, but are generally considered to be similar in soil contact rates to construction, utility work, or military exercise. The US m ilitary assumes 480mg per exposure event 14 or per field day.

Simon (1998) reviewed soil ingestion st udies from a perspective of risk and dose assessment. Because of their high dependenc e on the land, indigenous peoples are at highest risk for inadvertent ingestion, along with professions that may bring workers into close and continual contact with the soil. Simon recommends using a soil ingestion rate for indi genous people in hunt er/food gathering/nomadic societies of 1g/d in wet climates and 2g/d in dry climates. He recommends using 3g/d for all indigenous children. For the Washoe climate and lifestyle, the so il ingestion rate for young children (0-6 years) is assumed to be 400mg/day for 365 days/year. This is hi gher than the prior EPA default value of 200mg/day (USEPA 1989) . This rate reflects both indoor dust and continuous outdoor activities analogous to gardening or camping (van Wijnen 1990), but it is less than a single-incident sp orts or construction ingestion rate (Boyd 1999). Inhalation Rate: The inhalation rate in the Was hoe scenario reflects the active, outdoor lifestyle of traditional tribal mem bers. Traditional tribal communities have no sedentary members except the frail el derly, whereas one- quarter of modern American adults of all ages report no leisure time physical activity at all. 16 We have documented the activity levels associated with the traditional lif estyle and diet with published anthropological studies, ethnogr aphic literature on foraging theory, hunting-gathering lifestyles, and intervie ws with tribal members. Using EPA guidance on hourly inhalation rates for di fferent activity levels, a reasonable inhalation rate for an average tribal member's active lifestyle is a median rate of 26.2m3/d. This rate is based on 8 hours sleeping at 0.4m3/hr, 2 hours sedentary at 0.5m3/hr, 6 hours light activity at 1m3/hr, 6 hours moderate activity at 1.6m3/hr, and 2 hours heavy activity at 3.2m3/hr. Most other exposure factors are upper bounds, so the use of a median rate for inhalation is inconsistent with the usual RME approach used in Superfund risk assessments, and could result in under-protection of children, the elderly, athletes, asthmatics, and the half of the population with above-average inhalation rates. Due to a tribal desir e to protect more than just the average traditional person, the inhalation rate is rounded up, from 26.2m3/d to 30m3/day. Dermal Exposures: The dermal pathway has not been fully researched for this scenario, but EPA methods17 for dermal exposure can be used. However, a greater surface area and a greater skin loading of so il (soil adhered to skin) should be used. Two relevant papers are summarized here. Kissel et al. (1996) included reed gatherers in tide flats in a study of dermal adherence. The category of \"kids in mud\" at a lakeshore had by far the highest skin loadings, with an average of 35mg/cm2 for 6 children and an average of 58mg/cm2 for another 6 children. Reed gatherers were next highest at 0.66mg/cm2 with an upper bound of >1mg/cm2.

Washoe Tribe Scenario 164 6 CONCLUSION This report has presented the Washoe scenario and supporting information for use in human health risk assessments. This r eport is intended to describe enough about the traditional subsistence lifestyle that a risk assessor who is familiar with developing exposure scenarios can under stand the derivation of the exposure factors even if she does not have an in-dep th familiarity with the Washoe lifestyle. Where information is not presented, it is assumed that convent ional parameters are suitable (e.g., skin surface area). The report describes the Tr ibe's environment in the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin ecosystems, and the available resources. An ecological lifestyle is presented, one that traditionally followed seasonal areas fo r fishing and food and material gathering, and placed cultural significance on water for use in ritual and day-to-day activity. An overall diet is developed by reviewing previous foraging studies and ethnographic data, and considering available resour ces, with major food-type categories estimated as percentages and presented in a food pyramid. The most prevalent food source is the pine nut, which corresponds to a diet higher in lipids than the typical forager diet. Exposure factors are dev eloped based on traditional subsistence lifestyles, with attention to the lifestyle, activi ty patterns, specific activities, daily time allocation, and lifetime of the Washoe. Rates of inhalation, water ingestion, and particularly soil ingestion are hi gher than those of the gener al population, due in part to the Tribe's increased outdoor activity in an arid climate. Increased soil ingestion is partly attributable to the gathering and proce ssing of food and material resources, at times in wetlands.

The int ent of the CTUIR Sc enario is to reconstruct what the lifestyle and diet would have been in t he affected area prior to contamination. For the general United States population, an exposure scenario is typically designed to be an upper bound (generally around the 75th percentile) of the population being assessed. Some individual exposure factors are the 90th or 95th percentile; others are mean values. In the case of tribal exposure scenarios, there are no specific databases of subsistence activities, resource s, or diets as ther e are for the general United States population. Cro ss-sectional surveys of curr ent tribal populations will not generate that data because much res ource use has been suppressed due to loss of land and access, awareness of cont amination, persecution by the dominant society, and other reasons. This means that large and accurate statistical distributions for subsistence exposure factors are not ava ilable and cannot be developed. Therefore, ranges of exposures or specified percentiles of exposure are not possible to calculate. The CTUIR sc enario is intended to be a reasonable representation of a traditi onal subsistence lifestyle, equi valent to a central tendency rather than to an upper bound. For the general suburban population the expo sure scenario is well defined in EPA guidance (Exposure Factors Handbooks). The CTUIR scenario is based on the lifestyle and baseline conditions of the regional natural resources. This scenario identifies general exposure pa thways specific to CTUIR lifestyles and key resources that the CT UIR people use. A general u nderstanding of what people do (or would do in the absence of contami nation) and what resources are available for their use provides the basis for devel oping preliminary exposure factors. Then CTUIR Scenario 174 the scenario describes the activities that traditional people undertake to survive and thrive in the local ecosystem, includi ng hunting, gathering foods and medicines, fishing, making material item s, farming or gardening, raisi ng livestock, irrigating, and various cultural and domestic activities. As mentioned, the exposure scenario refl ects a traditional subsistence lifestyle. \"Subsistence\" refers to the hunting, fi shing, and gathering activities that are fundamental to the way of life of many indigenous peo ples. Today's subsistence economies utilize traditional and modern tec hnologies for harvesting and preserving foods and for distributing the produce th rough communal networks of sharing and bartering. The following is a useful expl anation of \"subsistenc e,\" taken from the National Park Service: While non-natives tend to define subsis tence in terms of poverty or the minimum amount of food necessary to support life, native people equate subsistence with their culture. Among m any tribes, maintaining a subsistence lifestyle has become the symbol of thei r survival in the face of mounting political and economic pressures. It defines who they are as a people. To Native Americans who continue to depend on natural resources, subsistence is more than eking out a living. While it is important to the economic well- being of their communities, the subsist ence lifestyle is also the basis of cultural existence and survival. It is a communal activity. It unifies communities as cohesive functioning units through collective production and distribution of the harves t. Some groups have formalized patterns of sharing, while others do so in more informal wa ys. Entire families participate, including elders, who assist with less physically demanding tasks. Parents teach the young to hunt, fish, and farm. Food and goods are also distributed through native cultural institutions. Most require young hunters to distribute their first catch throughout the community. Subsist ence embodies cultural values that recognize both the social obligation to share as well as the special spiritual relationship to the land and resources. This relationship is portrayed in native art and in many ceremonies held throughout the year. 1 In economic terms, a subsistence econom y is one in which currency is limited because many goods and services are produced and consumed by the same families or bands. Today, currency (symbol s of specified quantities of useful resources) is limited, but important. For example, subsistence in an Arctic community includes the following: The modern-day subsistence family depends on the tools of the trade, most of which are expensive. Snowmobile s, gasoline, guns, fishing nets, and sleeping bags are necessities. Subsist ence households also enjoy many of the modern conveniences of life, and are saddled with the economic demands which come with their acquisi tion. Today's subsistence family generates much-needed cash as wage- part-time workers and 1 National Park Service: http://www.cr.nps.gov/aad/cg/fa_1999/Subsist.htm CTUIR Scenario 174 the scenario describes the activities that traditional people undertake to survive and thrive in the local ecosystem, includi ng hunting, gathering foods and medicines, fishing, making material item s, farming or gardening, raisi ng livestock, irrigating, and various cultural and domestic activities.

A highly-integrated inte rdependence between formal (cash-based) and informal (barter and subsistence- based) economic sectors has evolved.2 Once the activities composing a particular subsistence lifestyle are known, they are translated into a form that is used for ri sk assessment. This translation captures the degree of environmental contact that occurs through activities and diet, expressed as numerical exposure factors . Exposure factors for direct exposure pathways include exposure to abiotic media (air, wate r, soil, and sediment), which can result in inhalation, soil ingestion, water ingestion, and dermal exposure. Indirect pathways refer to contaminants that are incorpor ated into biota and subsequently expose people who ingest or use them. There are many unique exposure pathways that are not accounted for in scenarios for the gener al public, but may be significant to people with certain traditional specialties su ch as basket making, flint knapping, or using natural medicines, smoke, smudges, paints, and dyes. These activities may result in increased dust inhalation, soil i ngestion, soil loading onto the skin for dermal exposure, or exposure via wounds, to give a few examples. While the portals of entry into the body are the same for everyo ne (primarily via the lungs, skin, mouth), the amount of contaminants may be increased and the relati ve importance of some activities (e.g., baske t making, wetlands gatheri ng), pathways (e.g., steam immersion or medicinal infusions), or por tals of entry (e.g., dermal wounding) may be different than for th e general population. Foraging theory data from the anthropological literature is particularly useful for developing exposure scenarios, because t he major dietary and resource staples may be described, as well as how much time and effort is needed to obtain them. Together, this information is then used for the food-chain portion of the Scenario and to calculate the direct exposure factors. This process is laid out in the following se ctions according to the general sequence: 1. Environmental setting\u2014what resources are available; 2. Lifestyle description\u2014activities and their frequency, duration and intensity, and resource use; 3. Diet; 4. Exposure pathways, and 5. Exposure factors \u2014iterative cross-walk bet ween pathways and direct exposure factors: cumulative soil, water, air, and dietary exposures. Because the method for developing expo sure factors is derived from an understanding of lifestyle rather than from large statistical databases (national drinking water rates, or USDA databases of national average food intakes) and is unfamiliar to many readers, it is descr ibed briefly here (more detail is presented below). 2 http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/Na tResources/subsistglobal.html CTUIR Scenario 175 trappers, professional business people, traditional craftmakers, and seasonal workers.

For example, we do not attempt to develop a complete diet based on surveys of the uses of the typi cal 200+ natural resources available and used with an ecoregion. Rather, we develop a calorically complete food pyramid that identifies the major staples and their rough percentages in the original diet. Similarly, we do not develop an average day by tracki ng hundreds of individual activities from many people. The basic process is to: 1. Start with an understanding of the major categories of subsistence activities (such as hunting, fishing, gatheri ng, basket making, and sweat lodge purification), 2. Describe enough of the sub-activities that the complexity and interconnection of resources and activities can be understood, 3. Identify the major activities t hat contribute to exposure, and then 4. Iteratively cross-walk between activiti es and conventional exposure factors to develop cumulative exposure factors. To illustrate, each of the major activity cat egories includes activities that result in exposure to soil, and therefore soil ingesti on. By estimating the relative amount of time spent in activities that result in high, medium, or low soil exposure for each activity category, an overall soil-ingestion ra te can be estimated. However, we do not attempt to be overly quantitat ive in enumerating the myriad activities and resources in each category \u2014this requires more precision than is warranted and is likely to require proprietary information that cannot be released. Finally, a review of existing literature (biomedical, anthropological, and so on) enables us to double-check whether multiple lines of evidence leads us to a similar conclusion for each exposure factor. 1.1 BASIS Information on the CTUIR eco-cultural lif estyle has been presented previously, and is summarized as follows. The CTUIR culture, which has co-evolved with nature through thousands of ecological education, has provid ed its people with their traditional environmental knowledge. Throughout t he year, when the CTUIR traditional American Indian participates in activi ties such as hunting and gathering for foods, medicines, ceremonies, and subsistence, the associated activities are as important as the end product. A ll of the foods and implements gathered and manufactured by the traditional Amer ican Indian are interconnected in at least one, but more often in many wa ys. The people of the CTUIR community follow cultural teachings brought down th rough history from the elders. Our individual and collective we ll-being is derived from membership in a healthy community that has access to ancestr al lands and traditional resources and from having the ability to satisfy the per sonal responsibility to participate in traditional community activities and to hel p maintain the spiritual quality of our CTUIR Scenario 176 Because large databases are not available and cannot be constructed, we take a top-down approach.

This is an ancient oral tradi tion of cultural norms. The material or fabric of this tradition is unique, and is woven into a single tapestry that extends from far in the past to long into the future. In order to encompass the wide range of factors [directly] tied to the tradit ional American Indians of the CTUIR, a risk assessment has to be designed and scaled appropriately (Harris 1998). EPA is required to identify populations who are more highly exposed; for example, subsistence populations and those who practi ce subsistence consumption of natural resources (Executive Order 128983). EPA is also required to protect sensitive populations.4 Some of the factors known to increase sensitivity include developmental stage, age (very young and ve ry old), gender, genetics, and health status,5 and this is part of EPA's hum an health research strategy.6 The Superfund law requires cl eanup of the site to leve ls which are protective of human health and the environment, wh ich will serve to minimize any disproportionately high and adverse env ironmental burdens impacting the EJ community.7 CERCLA ARARs include treaties such as t he Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 703 et seq. Theref ore, CTUIR believes that ot her treaties, including the Treaty of 1855, are ARARs as well.

This is an ancient oral tradi tion of cultural norms. The material or fabric of this tradition is unique, and is woven into a single tapestry that extends from far in the past to long into the future. In order to encompass the wide range of factors [directly] tied to the tradit ional American Indians of the CTUIR, a risk assessment has to be designed and scaled appropriately (Harris 1998). EPA is required to identify populations who are more highly exposed; for example, subsistence populations and those who practi ce subsistence consumption of natural resources (Executive Order 128983). EPA is also required to protect sensitive populations.4 Some of the factors known to increase sensitivity include developmental stage, age (very young and ve ry old), gender, genetics, and health status,5 and this is part of EPA's hum an health research strategy.6 The Superfund law requires cl eanup of the site to leve ls which are protective of human health and the environment, wh ich will serve to minimize any disproportionately high and adverse env ironmental burdens impacting the EJ community.7 CERCLA ARARs include treaties such as t he Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 703 et seq. Theref ore, CTUIR believes that ot her treaties, including the Treaty of 1855, are ARARs as well.

An overall total caloric food pyramid with rough proportions of different food groups has been developed to show a typical traditional diet (Figure 2). This food pyra mid is reconstructed from information about what the traditional diet actually was, ra ther than what it mi ght be today if USDA recommendations about daily intakes were followed substituting wild foods for domesticated ones. In particular, the tr aditional CTUIR river-based diet was based on fish. The dietary input for the risk assessment is typically somewhat less complex than the food pyramid (due to intrin sic limitations of the risk methods). Nevertheless, the risk assessment must consider the totality of species and calories. 2.2 CTUIR RIVER-BASED DIET Approximately 135 species of plants are us ed as foods, flavorings, or beverages; approximately 125 species are used in traditional technologies; nearly 120 species of medicinal plants are used by the sout hern Columbia Plateau tribes and up to 200 by northern tribes (Hunn 1990). This wide va riety of plants is typical of foraging societies. For risk assessment, however, this is collapsed into a few food categories. This is because the simple risk equations cannot handle more detailed information, and data on species-specific soil-to-plant uptake is lacking. Further compounding this problem is the tendency of game to be treated like livestock, and native plants like domesticated plants. Many pathways su ch as medicines and teas are typically ignored altogether. For this reason, t he upper bounds for food categories are evaluated in the same way that direct exposure factors are rounded up to account for the myriad of small and ot herwise ignored pathways. There are two distinct diets within the Um atilla Tribes: the game-focused diet and the fish-focused diet. Because this scenario is applied to Hanford and the Columbia River, only the fish-based diet is presented here. The estimated diet is shown below as a food pyramid (Figure 2). The percentages of each food category in the diet are: Fish (40% of total calories); Roots (including tubers, corms, and bulbs) (32%); Greens (including medicinal leaves, t ea, stems, pith, and cambium) (12%); Game (including fowl) (6%); and fruits (5%), and Sweeteners, mushrooms, lichens (5%).

CTUIR Scenario 182 3 EXPOSURE FACTORS AND PATHWAYS 3.1 APPROACH Exposure factors reflect the activity levels and resource use of the lifestyle scenario under evaluation.10 Exposure factors for both di rect and indirect pathways are developed. Indirect pathways include expos ure via the oral i ngestion of food and medicine (see previous section). This sect ion focuses on direct pathways: direct inhalation, dermal exposure, and ingestion of water, air, dust, sediment, and soil (including soil on the outside of food or added through cooking). Default exposure factors have been devel oped for conventional suburban, urban, occupational, and recreational scenarios ba sed on national statistics. Our approach to developing a tribal scenario is not to in ventory every activity and every resource, but to provide an overall estimate of the general activity levels, anchored with specific information as available. The basic assumption is that traditional lifeways are active outdoor lifestyles that are somewhat physica lly demanding, even with some modern conveniences. Subsist ence foragers (both genders) perform a combination of aerobic (high heart and vent ilation rates), strength, endurance, and stretching-flexibility daily activities, as well as performing more sedentary work and resting. The exposure factors here ar e general to traditional subsistence lifestyles, regardless of their location. The conc eptual steps in this process are: 5. Understand the lifestyle and the activi ties that compose the lifestyle, and are required to obtain necessities an d engage in the community culture; 6. Describe the day, the y ear, and the lifetime of men and women to identify any significant differences in activity levels between genders or ages; 7. Cross-walk activities with exposur e pathways on the basis of frequency and duration of major activities, activi ty levels, and degree of environmental contact, and 8. Estimate cumulative di rect exposure factors. This scenario reflects an active, outdoor lif estyle with a subsistence economic base. Subsistence food sources include gathering, gardening, hunting, pasturing livestock, and fishing. The forager relies all or in part on native foods and medicines, while the residential farmer relies on domesticated but self-produced foods. Thus, the CTUIR scenario is at the foraging end of the subsistence spectrum, while the residential farmer is at the domesticated end of the subsistence spectrum. Both are active, outdoor lifestyles, and are consistent wit h the reasonable maximum exposure (RME) approach to baseline risk assessment. This is a full-time multipathway scenario, to be applied within each area being assessed, consistent with EPA guidance on performing baseline risk assessments. 10 http://cfpub2.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/re cordisplay.cfm?deid=85843 CTUIR Scenario 182 3 EXPOSURE FACTORS AND PATHWAYS 3.1 APPROACH Exposure factors reflect the activity levels and resource use of the lifestyle scenario under evaluation.10 Exposure factors for both di rect and indirect pathways are developed.

It reflects the activities that the person w ould engage in if the site were not contaminated. Therefore, a baseline risk assessment is applied irrespective of possible institutional controls or other rest rictions that may be needed as part of the remedy in order to protect human health. Unrestricted access is the typical baseli ne risk assessment \"no action\" scenario. This includes CTUIR residence, because permanent year-round fishing villages with resident CTUIR members were present al ong the Hanford Reach when Hanford was established. This scenario is not a visiting scenario like a recreational scenario. It is a full-time scenario. This means that the forager may obtain a site-specific percentage of his and her food from an irrigated garden to supplement the native plants in his or her diet. T he ratio of gathered to grown pl ants will vary with the size and resources of the assessment area, as will the ratio of game to livestock, upland to riparian resources, and so on. The for ager also uses a well and/or seep and/or river for drinking water, sweat lodge water, and irrigation, also consistent with the general CERCLA principles of evaluating reasonable maximum exposures. Exposure factors for the traditional CTUIR lifestyle are presented below. One of the key misunderstandings is how a subsis tence lifestyle can be applied to a constrained area. The risk assessment methodology uses an interface between lifestyle and contamination termed an expos ure point concentrat ion. The guidance for risk assessment is to assume that the RM E individual is constrained to the area being assessed (for subsistence or resident ial scenarios), or receives exposures only during visits to the area being asse ssed (for recreational or occupational scenarios). The subsistence scenario is not to be divided into partial scenarios, such as upland hunting or localized ga thering, unless those are also complete scenarios, accounting for a full life but with emphasis on a specialized activity (e.g., the subsistence person who specializes in fish ing for himself and others and trades fish for game and plants, or the subsistence person who specializes in gathering food and medicinal plants and materials and tr ades those items for fish and game). 3.2 MAJOR ACTIVITIES Tables 2-4 show the thought process fo r considering the range and number of activities associated with majo r activity categories (hunti ng, fishing, gathering, and sweat-lodge purification). Tables 2 and 3 list a number of indi vidual activities within each major category; this is included because most no n-Indians have not learned much about traditional lifestyles and the comple xity of daily life. Table 2 shows the connection between activity categories.

Hunting occurs in terrain ranging from flat and open to very steep and rugged. It may also include setting traplines, waiting in blinds, digging, climbing, etc. After the capture or kill, field dressi ng, packing or hauling, and other very strenuous activities may occur, de pending on the species. Subsequent activities include cutting, storing (e.g., smoking or drying), etc. Fishing Fishing includes building weirs and platforms, hauling in lines and nets, gaffing or gigging, wading (for shellfish), followed by cleaning the fish and carrying them to the place of use. Activities associated with smoking and constructing drying racks may be involved. Gathering A variety of activities is involved in gathering, such as hiking, bending, stooping, wading (marsh and water plants), digging, and carrying. Ritual purification (sweat lodge) Sweat lodge building and repairing is intermittent, but collecting firewood is a constant activity. Materials and food use Many activities of varying intensity ar e involved in preparing materials for use or food storage. Some are quite vigorous such as pounding or grinding seeds and nuts into flour, preparing meat, and tanning hides. Many others are semi- active, such as basket making, flin t knapping, construction of storage containers, cleaning village sites, sani tation activities, home repairs, and so on.

Again, this is an iterative process that relie s on multiple lines of evidence. Rather than a complete listing of activities, Table 4 presents an example of the thought process used to perform the iterative cross-walk. In each case a gap identification step may be necessary, and greater uncertainty may require placeholder values until data are obtained. The last column, \"Totals for ma jor exposure factor categories,\" shows exposure pathways totals (such as soil ingestion) are estimated across activity categories. This is not a statistical summation but rather a judgment based on multiple lines of evidence. Each estimate has been checked against technical literature for confirmation. Table 4.

In each case a gap identification step may be necessary, and greater uncertainty may require placeholder values until data are obtained. The last column, \"Totals for ma jor exposure factor categories,\" shows exposure pathways totals (such as soil ingestion) are estimated across activity categories. This is not a statistical summation but rather a judgment based on multiple lines of evidence. Each estimate has been checked against technical literature for confirmation. Table 4.

CTUIR Scenario 187 3.3 THE FAMILY, THE DAY, AND THE LIFETIME This section describes a family-based ex posure scenario based on traditional CTUIR lifestyles and diets. Only the fish-based di et is discussed here, since it is to be applied within 20 miles of a major fishing ri ver. It is based on habits of members who live in the sagebrush steppe, gather nativ e foods supplemented with a home garden, have a high rate of subsistence activities , have a regular schedule of other cultural activities, and work as field workers monito ring natural and cultural resources, taking environmental samples, and doing reclamation or restoration work. The lifestyles are moderately active outdoor lifestyle s, with daily sweat lodge use. 3.3.1 Lifestyle of a Representa tive Traditional CTUIR Family The families are intended to be reasonable composites. Each family includes an infant/child (age 0-2 years) who breastfeeds for two years and crawls and plays; a child (age 2-6) who plays in the hous e and outdoors, a youth (age 7-16) who attends school, plays outdoors near his/her residence, and is learning traditional practices; two adult workers (one male, one female, age 17-55; the female breast-feeds the infant) who work out doors on reclamation and environmental and cultural activities and who also engage in subsistence activities; and an elder (age 56-75) who is partly at home and partly outdoors teaching and demonstrating traditional cultural practices. All members (except the infant from 0-2 years) partake in family sweat lodge use and in cultur al activities throughout the year. Location and Type of Residence: The residence is locat ed within the assessment area. The family lives in a house with littl e or no landscaping other than the natural vegetation. Each house has its own we ll for domestic use and a garden irrigated with groundwater or surface water (whichever is more contaminated). This is not a fully traditional pit house or tule mat house, but a typical reservation-quality house, with seasonally open windows. The road and driveway are not paved. 3.3.2 Activity Patterns of Each Family Member Infant: The infant breast-feeds for 2 years, and crawls on the floor (with house-dust exposure) from age 6 months to 2 years. Infants ingest mo re fluid per body weight than children do, and toddlers (6 months to 2 years) are likely to have the highest of the children's exposures due to crawling and mouthing behaviors, and their higher food and water per capita ingestion rates. Child (ages 2-6 years): Beginning at age 2, the child eats the same food as everyone else, participates in family sweat lodge, and spends some time accompanying the mother as she gardens and gathers. Youth (ages 7-16): The adolescent is learning to hunt, gather, and fish (and spends equal time in each activity in their respec tive locations), plays outdoors, and attends school.

Youth (ages 7-16): The adolescent is learning to hunt, gather, and fish (and spends equal time in each activity in their respec tive locations), plays outdoors, and attends school. CTUIR Scenario 188 Adult Worker (ages 17-55): Workers are assumed to wo rk for the Tribe collecting environmental samples, engaging in restorat ion/remediation or construction work, and caring for natural and cultural resources and tribal property. This type of activity is dusty in the summer and muddy in the winter. Both males and females are currently employed in this type of activi ty. Workers could be ex posed to external irradiation, surface soil and dust, vegetati on, surface water, sediments, seeps, and radon and daughter products in outdoor air and water. These workers have an average 8-hour workday. Adult Hunter/Fisher/Gatherer: Each adult also hunts (ma le), fishes (male), or gardens and gathers plants (fem ale). These activities are roughly analogous with respect to environmental contact, and therefor e are assumed to result in the same amount of soil or sediment ingestion for males and females. The additional time and contact during game processing and plant washing and preparation are also roughly equal. The location of hunting small game or fowl is in the same area as the residence, and the location of big game hunti ng covers a larger area, although the livestock are located in the same area as the residence. The time spent hunting or fishing versus livestock tending is propor tional to the diet and the size of the assessment area. The garden is at the place of residence and uses the same water as the household, while the gathering occurs in a larger area, also proportional to the size of the assessment area. All of the hunters, gatherers, and fishers spend some time near water, if it is present in the area, on activi ties such as washing plants or game, gathering aquat ic plants and mollusks/crustaceans, and so on, with concomitant exposure to mud or sediment. Elder (ages 56-75): The elder gathers plants and me dicines, prepares them, uses them (e.g., making medicine s or baskets, etc.) and teaches a variety of indoor and outdoor traditional activities. The elder al so provides child care in the home. 3.3.3 Specific Cult ural Activities This section considers activities that ar e engaged in at varying levels by the Tribe and by varying age-groups, and other fa ctors that affect exposure. Ritual Purification (Sweat Lodge) (ages 2-75): The daily use of the sweat lodge is an integral part of t he lifestyle that starts at age 2. Sweat lodge construction has been described in the open literature. Although the details vary among Tribes and among individual families, they are generally r ound structures (6 feet in diameter for single-family use) constructed of natural materials (i.e., branches, moss, leaves with a dirt floor covered with mats or cedar boughs) near a source of surface or groundwater. A nearby fire is used to heat rocks that are brought into the sweat lodge. Water (4L) is poured over the rocks to form steam (a confined hemispheric space with complete evaporation of the wate r which is available for inhalation and dermal exposure over the entire skin area) . Either groundwater or surface water may be used. Inhalation and heart rates may be hi gher depending on activities that occur during the sweat lodge ceremony (e.g., singing).

Either groundwater or surface water may be used. Inhalation and heart rates may be hi gher depending on activities that occur during the sweat lodge ceremony (e.g., singing). CTUIR Scenario 189 Cultural Activities: All age-groups participate in day-long outdoor community cultural activities once a month, such as powwows, horse races, and seasonal ceremonial and private cultural activiti es (together averaging about 0.5 hours/day). These activities tend to be large gatherings with a greater rate of dust resuspension and particulate inhalation. Indi viduals also tend to be acti ve, resulting in a greater inhalation and water ingestion rates. Basket Making: Exposure specific to basket ma kers is a well-recognized problem1, but data useful for exposure assessment are almost totally lacking. Gathering of some plants (e.g., willows, cattails, tule s, reeds, and rushes) can be very muddy, and river shore or lakeshore activities with sediment exposure may be underestimated. Washing, peeling, weaving rushes, and other activities results in additional exposure, such as dust deposit ed on leaves or soil adhered to roots. Some of the materials are held in the mout h for splitting, and cuts on the fingers are common. As more information becomes av ailable, it will be evaluated so that exposure factors for each route of exposur e account for these particular activities. Other Special Activities: It is recognized that there are special circumstances when some people may be highly exposed (and their exposure would be underestimated). For instance, some men hunt or fish fo r the general community, and many people provide roots and fish and game to elders in addition to their own families. Flint knappers may receive additional exposure through obtaining and working with their materials. Healers handle pharmacologically active plants, some of which may uptake contaminants differentially. Materi als released from firewood, smokes, and smudges may contain contaminants or affe ct physiological parameters of the person. These types of activities may requi re special consideration with respect to exposures. Seasonality: The changes in activity patterns over the annual seasonal cycle has been modified in modern times, but the ec ological cycle has not, so people must still gather plants according to when they are ripe, hunt according to game and fowl patterns, and fish when the spawning runs occur. Items are gathered during a harvest season for year-round use. While spec ific activities change from season to season, they are replaced by other activi ties with a similar environmental contact rate. For instance, a particular plant may be gathered during one month, while another month may be spent hunting, and a winter month may include cleaning and using the items obtained previously. Theref ore, since we are assuming that all activities are roughly equal, there is no decrease in environmental contact rates during winter months. 3.3.4 Time Allocation throughout the Day This section describes the time allocation t hat is reflected in daily exposure factors. The time adds up to slightly more than 24 hours per day, as is typical for any exposure scenario, in order to allow specif ic pathways to drive the risk should they 1 http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/envjust/documents/basketweaver.pdf CTUIR Scenario 189 Cultural Activities: All age-groups participate in day-long outdoor community cultural activities once a month, such as powwows, horse races, and seasonal ceremonial and private cultural activiti es (together averaging about 0.5 hours/day).

This also accounts for specialization by the person who spends more than an average amount of ti me in particular activities. Identical Activities: From the age of 2 to 75 year s, 15 hours of every day are similar: 8 hours sleep, 2.5 hours in other i ndoor activities, 2 hours in the sweat lodge, 1 hour in nearby outside activity, such as small game hunting, 0.5 hour in community cultural activities, and 0.5 hour travelin g on unpaved roads. These activities are referred to as common time . Infant: Standard infant exposure par ameters are used. Hous e dust is assumed to have similar concentrations of contaminants as outside soil. The infant is breast-fed for 2 years, assuming two different scenario s: (1) the mother has received 25 years of prior exposure from a contaminated area; and (2) t he mother has not received such exposure. The issue of feta l exposure remains to be determined. Child: The child, up through age 6, spends the same amount of common time in the same activities, and 4 hours indoors and 5 hours outdoors with t he mother as she gardens and gathers. Youth: Common time plus 6 hours at school 5 days/week (averaging 4.5 hours/day over a full week), 2.5 hour s indoors, and 3 hours outdoors playing or accompanying an adult or elder, learning traditional activi ties. It is assumed that the school is uncontaminated unless there is data about chemical usage or contamination, and it is also assumed that his or her near-re sidence outdoor time results in a higher amount of soil contact than at other ages; therefore, the youth's average contact rates are the same as the child and adult's. Adult: Common time plus 8 hours working 5 days/week (about 5.5 hours/day), 0.5 hour at home, and 3 hours in on e of the subsistence activities (hunting = 1 hour plus 2 hours processing, smoking, etc.; fish ing = 2 hours plus 1 hour processing; gathering/gardening = 1 hour gathering in th e assessment area, 1 hour gardening at home, and 1 hour washing, processing, etc.). Elder: Common time plus 3 hours at home providing child care, 3 hours outdoors teaching, 1 hour gardening or gathering, and 2 hours at home processing materials and making items. 3.3.5 The Lifetime Traditionally, daily tasks were somewhat di fferent for males and females: males tend to hunt and fish, while females gather and cook. However, even where activity patterns show gender dimorphi sm, the rates of environment al contact were and are probably similar. In addition, both women and men are employed as environmental and construction workers, as well. Theref ore, for the purposes of the exposure scenario, the genders have identical exposure factors.

In addition, both women and men are employed as environmental and construction workers, as well. Theref ore, for the purposes of the exposure scenario, the genders have identical exposure factors. CTUIR Scenario 191 Male Lifetime: The male lifetime consists of t he standard infancy, childhood, and youth. At age 17 he specializes in either hunting or fishing and begins working as a reclamation/restoratio n/environmental worker. These activities are specified solely to determine their locations, which may have di fferent contaminant concentrations. As an elder he changes his activity pattern s to teaching and demonstrating as described above. Female Lifetime: The female lifetime consists of the standard infa ncy, childhood, and youth. At age 17 she engages in gatheri ng and gardening and also works the same job as the male. During motherhood, the woman may remain at home, which is located in the same sparsely popul ated area, and she continues to garden and gather, so her exposure does not diminish. He r earlier exposure may result in a dose to the fetus and breast-feeding infant. 3.4 MEDIA, PATHWAYS, AND EXPOSURE FACTORS As described previously, exposure factor s are developed by cross-walking the activities described above with specif ic media-based exposure pathways. The identification of medi a pathways begins to sum exposur es; for instance, all the soil exposures from hunting, gathering, hous ehold activities, processing and using materials, food processing, and other ac tivities are summed qualitatively. Ground Water and/or Surface Water Pathways: Ground water and/or surface water are directly ingested as drinking wate r. Both are used to create steam in the sweat lodge. Other uses of these res ources include typical household use (e.g. flushing, cooking, bathing, and showering), irrigation of crops and/or garden, and livestock. Air and Dust Pathways: As a general rule, the air pathway can result in exposure to any present volatiles, aerosols, and resuspended dust. Dust resuspension from unpaved roads and other unvegetated surfaces should be included as part of the inhalation exposure pathway. If there is a potential for exposure, inhalation of fire smoke or smudge should be included becau se some of these pathways can be frequent and significant. Soil and Sediment Pathways: This pathway includes so il ingestion from hand to mouth activities associated with daily acti vities, gathering (e.g., digging roots) and gardening, food and material processing (e.g. grinding, scraping, pit cooking). This pathway also includes direct ingestion resu lting from residual so il on roots and bulbs. The as-gathered and as-eaten conditions of plants are importan t. Some vegetable foods are eaten raw on the spot after being brushed off. Grinding seeds and nuts also adds rock dust to the flour.

CTUIR Scenario 192 3.5 EXPOSURE FACTORS FOR DI RECT EXPOSURE PATHWAYS A description of activities for the purposes of developing exposure factors focuses on: Frequency of activity: Daily, weekly, monthly Duration of activity: Hours at a time Number of years Intensity of environmental contact and intensity of activity: For soil ingestion and dermal exposure, is the activity more than, less than, or equal to gardening, camping, cons truction/excavation, or sports? For inhalation rates and calorie needs, is the activity level more than, less than, or equal to standard EPA activity leve ls for specific activities with known respiration rates and caloric expenditure? The following table (Table 5) includes th ree adult scenarios: the suburban resident, the rural residential farmer-gardener, and the subsistence forager. The first two scenarios are typically used in risk assessm ents, and the third re flects the set of activities that compose the CTUIR lifestyle. Each scenario is intended to be physiologically coherent , which means that the dietary intake, activity levels, and inhalation rates are physiologically link ed. For instance, t he more sedentary suburban scenario is based on national data on typical lifestyles (light occupational activities sitting or standing, with some m oderate activity at home), while the rural residential farmer has a higher activity leve l, higher inhalation rate, and higher soil ingestion rate due to his fa rming activity pattern. The subsistence forager is still more active, with a proportionally higher inhalation rate, as well as a higher soil ingestion rate, due to a higher degree of soil contact. We have included the rural residential farmer-gardener information for consideration, since it describes an intermediate lifestyle between that of t he suburban resident and subsistence forager. The following table shows adult values, as does the dietary discussion above. Children's exposure factors are scaled from the subsistence forager rates, as is conventionally done in risk assessment (f rom the Children's Exposure Factors Handbook), with the exception of the soil ingestion rate, which is left at 400mg/d throughout the lifetime. Body weight is a consistent 70kg because that is the standard EPA assumption used in risk assessments.

For example, the Army assumes that the maximum individual daily amount of drinking water required by military personnel to remain combat-effective ranges from CTUIR Scenario 194 5-15L/day, depending on the c limate, season, and intensity of work.2 The Army Quartermaster assumes that military personnel in hot clim ates require 3 gallons per day as drinking water.3 Soil Ingestion: Soil ingestion by young children (0-6 years) is assumed to be 400mg/day for 365 days/year. This is hi gher than the prior EPA default value of 200mg/day (USEPA 1989), and is the child ren's upper bound value. This rate reflects both indoor dust and continuous outd oor activities analogous to gardening or camping, but it is less than a single-incident sports or construction ingestion rate. For adults, the soil ingestion value is also 400mg/day, reflecting an unspecified upper percentile (EPA 1997). Inhalation Rate: An inhalation rate of 30m 3/d is more accurate for the active outdoor lifestyle than the EPA default rate of 20m3/d (EPA 1997). Using EPA guidance, an average rate of 26.2m3/d is obtained from 8 hours sl eeping, 2 hours sedentary, 6 hours light activity, 6 hours moderate ac tivity, and 2 hours heavy activity. This represents minimal heavy activity (construc tion, climbing hills, etc.), and is an average rather than a reasonable maximum. Most other ex posure factors are upper bounds, so the use of a median rate for inhalat ion is inconsistent with the reasonable maximum exposure (RME) approach typica lly used in Superfund risk assessments, and could result in under-protection of child ren, the elderly, athletes, asthmatics, and the half of the population with abo ve-average inhalation rates. Sweat Lodge: Inhalation and dermal exposure in the sweat lodge are evaluated by assuming: (1) one hour of use daily; (2) 4 liters of water is poured on heated rocks resulting in instant vaporization; (3) t he sweat lodge is a hemisphere 6 feet in diameter; and (4) dermal exposure is over the entire body surface area. More detail is given in Appendix B. Children's Exposure Factors: Children's exposure factors are based on \"Child- Specific Exposure Factors Handbook\" 4 but scaled from the adult subsistence values for inhalation rate. The soil ingestion rate for children is a constant 400mg/day, without age stratification. 3.6 SUMMARY OF EXPOSURE FACTORS A summary of primary exposures are present ed in Table 6.

CTUIR Scenario 196 4 CONCLUSION This report has presented t he CTUIR scenario and supporti ng information for use in human health risk assessments. This report is intended to describe enough about the traditional subsistence lifestyle that a risk assessor who is familiar with developing exposure scenarios can under stand the derivation of the exposure factors even if she does not have an in-dep th familiarity with the CTUIR lifestyle. Where information is not presented, it is assumed that conventi onal parameters are suitable (e.g., skin surface area). The report describes the Tr ibes' environment. An overall river-based diet is developed, with major food-ty pe categories estimated as percentages and presented in a food pyramid. The most prevalent f ood source is fish. Exposure factors are developed based on traditional su bsistence lifestyles, with a ttention to the lifestyle, activity patterns, specific activities, da ily time allocation, and lifetime of a CTUIR person. Rates of inhalation, water ingestion, and particularly soil ingestion are higher than those of the general populat ion, due in part to increased outdoor activity in an arid climate.

CTUIR Scenario 198 APPENDIX A FISH CONSUMPTION RATE CTUIR Fish Consumption Rate = 620g/ d or 500 pounds per year (adult). A.1 INTRODUCTION Although many indigenous peoples living along coasts or major waterways originally had very high fish consumption rates, most are now suppressed due to destruction of fisheries, lost access to aboriginal lands, or awareness of contamination. Therefore, studies that asse ss the current fish consumpt ion rates are not measuring the true subsistence rate, but a modern suppressed rate. Ev en so, a subset of tribal members remains heavily fish-dependent, cr eating a bimodal distribution that is missed in most conventional survey methods. The Confederated Tribes (Cayuse, Umatilla , Walla Walla) have relied on resident and anadromous fish in the Columbia River and its tributaries for at least 10,000 years. Salmon and the people are inseparable , and people will and must continue to partake in the circle of life with salmon as a partner. We regard current fish numbers as a temporary decline, with continued im provement through concerted efforts in watershed restoration. Therefore, since H anford cleanup must remain protective for thousands of years, we are using our subs istence consumption rate, not the current average suppressed consumption rate. The subsistence consumption rate is an average of 620 grams per day for adults. This is known through anthro-historic al data, anecdotal information by early observers such as Lewis & Clark, nutriti onal analysis, and documentation from the era of dam construction (1920-19 50), interviews of current subsistence fishers, and literature review. Table A.1 shows examples of the range of cons umption rates that were reviewed.

Nevertheless, while the Cayuse Tr ibe emphasized hunting more than fishing and the Walla Walla and Umatilla Tribes em phasized fishing more than hunting, both CTUIR Scenario 200 diets are \"subsistence\" diets because they provide all the food and medicine that a family needs to survive and thrive. However, in this scenario we are using the term \"subsistence fisher\" to refer to original consumption rate s along the Columbia River and its major tributaries, which the Tr eaty of 1855 was intended to protect. The development of the CTUIR fish c onsumption rate was based on the following premise: Subsistence consumption rates were pr acticed by many or all members of a tribe, but today are practiced by a subset of tribal members; Within tribes or confederations of tr ibes there may be distinct patterns of natural resource use that are obscured by statistical cross-sectional surveys. Therefore, cross-sectional fish consumption surveys in tribal communities may not be able to identify subsistence fishers, and In order to develop a subsistence cons umption rate, subsistence fishers must be specifically identifi ed and interviewed, and existing studies must be reviewed to determine whether they are suitable for developing true subsistence rates, or combined/ suppressed consumption rates. Our goal was to identify the subsistence c onsumption rate, because that is the rate that the Treaty of 1855 was des igned to protect and which is upheld by case law. It also reflects tribal fish restor ation goals and healthy lifestyle goals. As other investigators have done (Walker, in particular), the CTUIR fish consumption rate was developed using multiple lines of evidence: literature review of ethnohistorical evidence, review of cross- sectional fish consumption surveys (a combination of subsistence and non-subsistence fishers), interviews of current subsistence fishers, and calo ric and nutritional analysis. A.3 CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE GUIDANCE The EPA Office of Water provides guidanc e for setting ambient water quality standards for surface water, and includes a consideration of fish consumption rates. The prior national fish consumption rate for the general popul ation, 6.5gpd, was based on the mean national per capita (for both consumer a nd non-consumers) consumption rate of freshwater and estuar ine finfish and shellfish from 3-day diary results that were reported in the 1973-74 National Purchase Diary Survey (Javitz 1980). The EPA Office of Water 5 now recommends a default fish intake rate of 17.5 grams/day to adequately protec t the general populatio n of fish consumers including sport fishers, and 142.4 grams/day for subsis tence fishers.

When tribes develop ambient water quality standards, EPA6 recommends using either an upper percentile of a cross-section or an average rate specific for a higher fishing group, according to the policies of the tribe. EPA says that the two numbers should be compared to ensure that the higher fishing group (if one is present within a general tribal population) is protected. In the case of the CTUIR, these two numbers are quite different (see discussion below), so the CTUIR rate is based on the average rate specific to the higher fi shing group rather than the average for the whole Tribe. The U.S. EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) also considers fish consumption in the Superf und program. OSWER's policy is to assume an ingestion rate of 54g/day for high recreat ional consumers of locally caught fish (OSWER directive 9285.6-03). This number is based on recreational, not Native American data. Region 10 of the U.S. EPA recommends the us e of results from local or regional seafood-intake surveys for use in the regional Superfund program. 7 If tribal-specific or local information is not available, EPA-OSWER recommends using the U.S. EPA Exposure Factors Handb ook, which recommends a mean and 95th percentile for the general U. S. population of 20.1g/day and 63g/day, respectively (USEPA 1997). For Native American s ubsistence populations the recommended value for mean intake is 70g/day and the recommended 95th percentile is 170g/day. The Washington State Department of Ecology recently recommended a draft statewide default of 177g/day to protec t all Washington residents including the highest consumers, subsistence fis hers. The draft report recommends, final default consumption values of approximately 178 and 175 g/day for marine and freshwater areas, respec tively. These values represent approximately the 90th percentile of the fish consumption rate distribution from the Toy et al. study and the 95t h percentile from the CRITFC study, respectively.8 State-wide criteria may us e the mid-point between these values, or 177 g/day as a reasonably protective default.

A.4 FISH CONSUMPTION SURVEYS OF CURRENT SUPPRESSED RATES Several studies have evaluated current tribal fish consum ption rates in the Pacific Northwest in order to evaluate current exposures and risks (Table A.2). None of them addressed the issue of original fish consumption rates which are protected by treaty or by judicial decisions, and none addressed the current tribal conditions which forced many people off the river and aw ay from their hereditary or usual and accustomed fishing sites. Additionally, none of them specifically consider the range of lifestyles within tribal communities, but as sumed that tribes ar e all composed of a homogeneous population, even if tribes with different histories, homelands, and languages were forced onto the same reservat ion. This results in bimodal or more distributions within many tribes. In the case of the Confeder ated Umatilla Tribes, there is a subset of tribal members who maintain high fishing rates and consumption rates (see next section). The studies summari zed in Section A.4 assumed that tribes were homogeneous in their activities and lifes tyles, and therefore took a statistical cross-section approach. In contrast, t he studies summarized in Section A.5 specifically focused on the s ubset of tribal members who maintain a true subsistence lifestyle, and on documenting original consumption rates.

The CRITFC survey was a r andom cross-section of tribal members CTUIR Scenario 203 (names were randomly selected from enrollm ent lists), with ultimate surveys of 126 Warm Springs, 133 Nez Perce, 131 CTUIR, and about 130 Yakama members. The mean age of respondents was 39 years old (l ess than 10% were elders 60 years old or older). Tribal members were contacted by phone, mail, or in person. They were asked to drive to a central location on a particular day, and answer a lengthy set of questions read from a script (for consist ency) by an interviewer. The overall response rate was 69% (31% of select ed people either refused, could not be located, or did not partici pate for unknown reasons). It is likely that traditional members were under-represented due to refusa l, lack of a phone, car, or permanent address, or inability to respond for t he small amount of payment ($40). Seven individuals reported t hat they ate more than 389g/day , or more than 99% of the amount eaten by fish consumers (4 people ate 486g/day, and one person each ate 648g/d, 778g/d, and 972g/d). T hese values were treated as statistical outliers and were eliminated from the database. No follow-up was done to find out whether these higher rates were accurate or not , but we assume that these people are true subsistence fishers. Because thes e numbers are based on a reported meal frequency and size, we assume that the underlying answers by the interviewees were accurate, because people can provi de information about meal frequency more easily than poundage. During the research for the Harris & Ha rper paper (1977) tradi tional members who had been included in the CRITFC survey were asked if they gave accurate information, and several said no. Some traditi onal fishers said they simply refused to participate, or reported lower consumption rates than reality, due to a fear of law enforcement or fear of bei ng accused of knowingly eati ng contaminated fish. Other factors are unknown, such as whether traditional members were away from home during a fishing season, or otherwise engaged in activities that prevented them from participating. The personal experiences of the people we are most interested in (elders and subsistence fishing families) make them less likely to answer questions, even when posed by a member of the co mmunity. Fishing families often have a family history of having to fish clandesti nely and being persecuted by authorities or jailed as a result of fishing in thei r own rivers to feed their families. The point of this discussion is that the makeup and history of t he community must be understood before conducting a conventional surv ey. In addition to the above items, we know that elders tend to eat more tr aditionally (including people who return to traditional ways as they get older). Within the Umatilla and Walla Walla membership there are people who lost access to their hereditary fishing sites, or who have full- time day jobs or other family circumstanc es that prevent them from designating a family member as a fish provider.

This survey was designed to focus on frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, annually) and portion size of fish and shellfish, bot h fresh and frozen. Commercial fishing and shellfishing is an important s ource of income for both tri bes, but for the Tulalip, \"at present, the consumption of shellfish is lim ited to a personal-use activity.\" Sample size goals were developed by assuming a homogeneous (not bimodal) population and a certain standard deviation. Random names were generated, and children were evaluated if a parent was included (lim ited to one child per family). The final sample sizes were 73 Tulalip and 117 S quaxin adults over 18 and 68 children. A scripted questionnaire with food models was used. 52 edible species were divided into anadrom ous, pelagic, bottom fish, shellfish, and other (canned tuna or trout) categories. Cons umption per body weight was recorded (average weight = 81kg). Participants were paid $25. There was no correlation of consumption with income (i.e., low income did not drive people to eat more fish; high income did not allow more fish as a luxu ry purchase; or the two factors balanced each other).

This paper describes and quantifies seaf ood consumption rates and acquisition and preparation habits of 202 first- and second- generation Asian-American and Pacific Islanders (API) from 10 ethnic groups (C ambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Mien, Sam oan, and Vietnamese) in King County, Washington, in 1997. A sample size of 200 fish consumers wa s the target, and 202 people participated, with 5-30 interviews per ethnic group. Becaus e it was not possible to pre-identify first and second generation API for random name generation, half the participants were invited to participate from roster s provided by community leaders for random contact, and half were volunteers who had pr eviously been recruited for a Dietary Habits Study. The interviewee pool was adjusted to reflect age and gender of the populations (from census and other informa tion), so the participants had to fit the ethnic, age, and gender profiles bef ore inclusion in the study. If groups were still too small, relatives of participants were active ly recruited. The sample size of some ethnicities was deliberately larger than others, accordi ng to a judgment about how well established that group was in the Sea ttle area (e.g., they knew where and how to get fish, etc.). The ma jority of the 202 respondents ( 89%) were first generation (i.e., born outside the United States). Ther e were slightly more women (53%) than men (47%), and 35% lived under the 1997 Federal Poverty Line. Participants were paid $25 or given a store voucher In general, the API members consumed s eafood at a very high rate.

Amer ican and Pacific Islander seafood consumption\u2014a community-based stud 13(4): 256-66. This paper describes and quantifies seaf ood consumption rates and acquisition and preparation habits of 202 first- and second- generation Asian-American and Pacific Islanders (API) from 10 ethnic groups (C ambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Mien, Sam oan, and Vietnamese) in King County, Washington, in 1997. A sample size of 200 fish consumers wa s the target, and 202 people participated, with 5-30 interviews per ethnic group. Becaus e it was not possible to pre-identify first and second generation API for random name generation, half the participants were invited to participate from roster s provided by community leaders for random contact, and half were volunteers who had pr eviously been recruited for a Dietary Habits Study. The interviewee pool was adjusted to reflect age and gender of the populations (from census and other informa tion), so the participants had to fit the ethnic, age, and gender profiles bef ore inclusion in the study. If groups were still too small, relatives of participants were active ly recruited. The sample size of some ethnicities was deliberately larger than others, accordi ng to a judgment about how well established that group was in the Sea ttle area (e.g., they knew where and how to get fish, etc.). The ma jority of the 202 respondents ( 89%) were first generation (i.e., born outside the United States). Ther e were slightly more women (53%) than men (47%), and 35% lived under the 1997 Federal Poverty Line. Participants were paid $25 or given a store voucher In general, the API members consumed s eafood at a very high rate. The average overall consumption rate for all seaf ood combined was 1.891 gr ams/per kilogram body weight/day (g/kg/day), with a median consumption rate of 1.439g/kg/day (or a mean of 117.2 and a median of 89g/70kg/ day). Seafood consumption based on CTUIR Scenario 207 gender, age, income, and fishermen status did not differ significantly. However, mean consumption rates varied significantly between ethnic groups with Vietnamese (2.63g/kg/day) and Japanese (2.18g/kg /day) having the highest average consumption rates, and Mien (0.58g/kg/day ) and Hmong (0.59g/kg/day) the lowest. The predominant seafood consumed was shellf ish (46% of all seafood). The most frequently consumed finfish and invertebrat es were salmon (93% of respondents), tuna (86%), shrimp (98%), cr ab (96%), and squid (82%). Fi sh fillets were eaten with the skin 55% of the time, and the head, bones, eggs, and/or other organs were eaten 20% of the time. Crabm eat including the hepatopanc reas was consumed 43% of the time. Outliers (more than 3 SD fr om the mean) had \"large but unc ertain\" ingestion rates. They were recoded to 3 SD. Again, fish consumption rates were skewed considerably for all fish groups. The ske wed distribution indicates that a few respondents had a larger consumption ra te than other respondents. Because outliers had already been rec oded within each fish group, these large consumption rates reflected the fact t hat some API members were, indeed, higher consumers of seafood. People over 55 ate more fish (131gpd) than younger people (111gpd). There was no correlation with income. Volunteer participant s ate very slightly more than roster recruits (random contact from lists). Fi shermen and non-fishermen did not show any statistical difference, and there was li ttle or no difference between first generation (foreign born) and second generation (bore here).

Harris interviewed 75 people in order to i dentify members of the special interest group (the higher fishing group). A subset of 35 traditional fishers, including many elders, was then interviewed in de tail using ethnographic methods. The ethnographic interview is actually a proce ss (Schensul et al. 1999a, b, Spradley 1979, Emerson et al. 1995, Fetterman 1998, Thornton 1998, Mihesuah 1998). It involves establishing community standing and personal credibility, and demonstrating cultural sens itivity and an understanding of what information is proprietary. Without this process, in formation collected from interviews or questionnaires with Native Americans risks being inaccurate. Interviewees were asked how the accuracy of their responses compared to other studies, including the CRITFC study, and many stated t hat they do not try to pr ovide accurate information (or actively seek to avoid revealing in formation) unless they know the person and know how the information could be used or mi sused. The authors consider this to be an essential part of the bioet hics and informed consent safeguards, even if this takes considerably more time than simp ly asking people to answer questions. Interviewees reported eating fish daily, wit h fresh and dried fish in equal weights. This amount reflects one 4-ounce portion of fresh fish and 4 ounces of dried fish, which is equivalent to 12 ounces of we t weight. Since these interviews, more research has been done which indicates that several forms of fish consumption were overlooked, including use of thickeners and fl avorings, and the use of whole fish and eggs were probably underestimated. In additi on, the CRITFC (1994) results indicate that half of the interview ees ate less than they did tw enty years previously. The resulting rate is 540 grams per day. Anecdotally, people are now eating more fish as the salmon runs are being restored in the Umatilla and Walla Walla rivers.

Walker reviewed the ethno-historical and scient ific literature to estimate the pre-dam fish consumption rates of tribes along the Columbia River. He estimated that total fish consumption (not harvest) was 1000 lbs per capita for lower Columbia tribes, of which 75% was salmon (Umatilla and Yakama estimates), and the Nez Perce also ate 1000 lbs per capita, of which 90% were salmonids (including trout and whitefish). Other early estimates are very close to th is. Hewes (1947, 1973) originally estimated from 50 to 900 pounds per year for Plateau tribes by estimating a total catch, subtracting an estimate of the amount of salmon that was traded, used as dog food or otherwise, and adding an additiona l 1/3 of the weight of the salmon to account for resident fish consumption dur ing the 1/3 of the year t hat salmon are not running (considering the dried, pounded (pemmican or powder) fish that are eaten in the winter). Walker improved on Hewes' estimate by usi ng historical observational counts of the Indian catch, rather than a global estimate of a tribe's entire catch for a season. The median annual per capita consumption of sa lmonids for the Columbia Plateau tribes derived by Walker was 585 pounds per capita. \"Walker's figures provide a more accurate picture of the catch... based on direct observation and ethnographic fieldwork.\" Other authors were also cited in this reference: Schalk (1985) pointed out that the early caloric estimates were for salmon flesh in the ocean. Since salmon lose calories as they migrate upstream, tribes living upriver would actually have to take more fish than tribes living downriver to obtain an equiva lent amount of calories. He estimated that 1.5 pounds of wet weight are equivalent to 1 pound dried, and that 20% of a whole fish is entrails. Schalk es timated that a family needs 250 to 500 dried fish per family, or 2000 pounds per family. Walker also cited Swindell (1942), who interviewed 55 family heads from Yakama, Umatilla, and Warm Springs (not specifically fishing families) for an average of 322 pounds/yr in 1941 (the time when the cannerie s were taking a large percentage of the fish, leaving fewer for the Indians).

CTUIR Scenario 213 A.5.9 Bimodality in Tribal Communities In the above discussion, we have suggested t hat the cross-sectional tribal surveys summarized in Section A.4 revealed a bimodal distribution, with a cluster of people consuming high amounts of fish . We believe that these are accurate reports from members of a distinct group of subsistence consumers, and that most of this group is missed in cross-sectional surveys because they decline to participate in conventional surveys. However, this raises the question of how a tribe or tribal confederation should be stratifi ed, and whether this reflects simply a high end tail of a normal distribution defined by an arbitr ary upper percentile or standard deviation, or whether there is a discern ible subset of tribal mem bers with a distinct lifestyle and/or a statistically detectable consumption rate. In the Sechena study, respondents were divided into low (<75th percentile) or higher (>75th percentile) consumers; the ba sis for this is not given. In the Walker (1999) study, Columbia River mainstem fishers were divided into three groups according to how many fishing sites were used by a fisherman; the basis for this was not given. In the three tribal cross-sectional st udies, there appear to be clusters of high consumers; since no follow-up was done to investigate the characteristics or accuracy of these individuals, we conc lude (as others have concluded) from indirect evidence that these people are members of a subsistence subset that is otherwise obscured by poor study des ign, and that their reports were indeed accurate. In our review of subsistence and cro ss-sectional studies, we have concluded that a threshold for subsistence c onsumption rates is roughly 1 pound per day, without regard to the shape of a distribution curve. The Confederated Umatilla Tribes have dist inct subsets of natural resource use according to the original tribe's home land; Cayuse emphasiz ed upland while Walla Walla and Umat illa tribes emphasized fishing more than hunting. During ethnographic interviews, se veral subsistence consumers confirmed our supposition that traditional subsistence fishers generally decline to participate in surveys by people they don't know, or gi ve information that they assume is correct rather than information that is accurate. A.6 CONCLUSION We conclude that the subsist ence consumption rate for t he Confederated Tribes is in the range of 540 to 650gpd or more (particula rly at permanent fishing villages such as Celilo). Within this range, we have concluded that the best estimate is 500 pounds per year (or 620gpd) as the cent ral tendency of subsistence fish consumption, as well as being recognize d in a widely cited legal decision. The CRITFC study (1994) is judged to reflect the median river user (350gpd from Walker) and minimum river user s (80gpd from Walker). This is comparable to the CRITFC 95 th and 99th percentiles (175-182gpd and CTUIR Scenario 213 A.5.9 Bimodality in Tribal Communities In the above discussion, we have suggested t hat the cross-sectional tribal surveys summarized in Section A.4 revealed a bimodal distribution, with a cluster of people consuming high amounts of fish . We believe that these are accurate reports from members of a distinct group of subsistence consumers, and that most of this group is missed in cross-sectional surveys because they decline to participate in conventional surveys. However, this raises the question of how a tribe or tribal confederation should be stratifi ed, and whether this reflects simply a high end tail of a normal distribution defined by an arbitr ary upper percentile or standard deviation, or whether there is a discern ible subset of tribal mem bers with a distinct lifestyle and/or a statistically detectable consumption rate. In the Sechena study, respondents were divided into low (<75th percentile) or higher (>75th percentile) consumers; the ba sis for this is not given. In the Walker (1999) study, Columbia River mainstem fishers were divided into three groups according to how many fishing sites were used by a fisherman; the basis for this was not given. In the three tribal cross-sectional st udies, there appear to be clusters of high consumers; since no follow-up was done to investigate the characteristics or accuracy of these individuals, we conc lude (as others have concluded) from indirect evidence that these people are members of a subsistence subset that is otherwise obscured by poor study des ign, and that their reports were indeed accurate. In our review of subsistence and cro ss-sectional studies, we have concluded that a threshold for subsistence c onsumption rates is roughly 1 pound per day, without regard to the shape of a distribution curve. The Confederated Umatilla Tribes have dist inct subsets of natural resource use according to the original tribe's home land; Cayuse emphasiz ed upland while Walla Walla and Umat illa tribes emphasized fishing more than hunting. During ethnographic interviews, se veral subsistence consumers confirmed our supposition that traditional subsistence fishers generally decline to participate in surveys by people they don't know, or gi ve information that they assume is correct rather than information that is accurate. A.6 CONCLUSION We conclude that the subsist ence consumption rate for t he Confederated Tribes is in the range of 540 to 650gpd or more (particula rly at permanent fishing villages such as Celilo). Within this range, we have concluded that the best estimate is 500 pounds per year (or 620gpd) as the cent ral tendency of subsistence fish consumption, as well as being recognize d in a widely cited legal decision. The CRITFC study (1994) is judged to reflect the median river user (350gpd from Walker) and minimum river user s (80gpd from Walker). This is comparable to the CRITFC 95 th and 99th percentiles (175-182gpd and CTUIR 389gpd) and median (63gpd), fu rther indicating that the CRITFC study captured data for the minimu m and median river users, not the maximum river users. The CRITFC \"outliers\" (reporting a c onsumption rate of 486-972gpd) are comparable to Walker's maximum river users (650gpd), which reflect subsistence use. Most per capita estimates of fish c onsumption rates for subsistence fishers are approximately 500 pounds per year, or 620gpd as a mean value. These results are based on direct observati on of early observers, fish buying records, interview with current members, caloric and nutritional calculations, and ecological and archaeological information. Salmon supplied 30 to 40% of the total calories in the river-based subsistence diet. At an average of 175 kcal per 100g of raw fish weight, 620gpd would provide roughly 1000 kcal daily, which is 40% of a 2500 kcal diet. This conforms with the estimates of H unn and others that salmon provide 30-40% of the subsistence diet. The number of people in the high cons umer or maximum river user group diminished as runs were decimated, dams were constructed, and awareness of contamination increased. However, the existence of the subsistence or maximum river user clearly persists to this day, and in fact may be increasing recently as runs are restored and health benefits of eating fish are emphasized.

It includes other cultural and religious practices as well, such as m edicinal and ceremonial uses of natural resources. Our experience in developing tribal subs istence-based exposure scenarios has led to a set of technical, ethi cal, and procedural rules: To be most useful to regulators and ot hers seeking to protect the health of subsistence users, the information should be developed with an eye toward satisfying appropriate court rules for admi ssibility of expert testimony. While both state and federal courts have such rules, Federal Rule of Evidence 702, on which many state court rules ar e modeled, is the most wi dely applied and interpreted. Rule 702 permits \"a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or educat ion\" to testify when his or her \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assi st the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. \" In response to two U.S. Supreme Court cases holding trial judges responsible fo r excluding unreliable expert testimony, Rule 702 recently was qua lified by amendment. To be admissible, the rule now requires federal courts to find: \"(1) t he testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" The subsistence scenario incor porates information from a variety of disciplines, including cu ltural and traditional envir onmental knowledge. To prevent a challenge to the admissibility of the subs istence scenario as being unreliable, we wish to ensure that the subsistence scenario has been developed as much as possible using general scientific criteria adopted from the Daubert case: 5 5 See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , 509 U.S. 579 (1993) (holding trial courts responsible for excluding unreli able scientific expert testimony); Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael , 526 U.S. 137 (1999) (holding trial courts responsibl e for excluding unreliable nonscientific expert testimony). An authoritative discussion of Daubert and the reliability tests for expert testimony is contained in the Federal Rules of Evidence Advisory Committee Notes, which accompany Rule 702. They include a \"nonexclusive\" list of considerations for reliability of scientif ic expert testimony under Daubert : (1) whether the expert's technique or theory can be or has been tested\u2014that is, whether the expert's theory can be challenged in some objective sense, or whether it is instead simply a subjective, conclusory approach that cannot reasonably be assessed for reliability; (2) whether the technique or theory has been subject to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error of the technique or theory when applied; (4) the existence and maintenance of standards and controls; and (5) whether the technique or theory has been gener ally accepted in the scientific community. Kumho found that depending on the particular circumst ances of the case, these factors may also apply to nonscientific testimony. Ot her factors considered by post- Daubert courts include: whether the expert's opinions were developed independent of liti gation or for the purpose of testifying; whether there exists too great an analytical gap betwe en data and opinion; whether obvious alternative explanations have been accounted for; and whether the same level of intellectual rigor is applied in Spokane Tribe Scenario 230 term which encompasses a broader range of activities than those necessary to sustaining human life such as eating and drinking.

Ri sk assessors can rely on ethnographic data, verbal representations from s ubsistence practitioners, and so on. We relied on (1) open peer-reviewed literature on exposures through different but analogous pathways and caloric c ontent of foods, (2) ethnographic documents and reports concerning traditi onal lifestyles and practices, and (3) statements from tribally recognized cu ltural experts. This latter expertise derives from their trad itional environmental knowledge, and is based on confidential information, so we cannot ve rify it in the sense of reanalyzing raw numerical data, but we can verify the expertise of the cultural experts who summarized their knowledge of resources and activity patterns for us. That another risk assessor could repeat the same steps and would construct essentially the same scenario, be cause the approach for developing an exposure scenario is fairly standardized. That the scenario is accepted by colle agues as reasonable and factual rather than eccentric, unreliable, or mere opi nion, or that it meets the \"general acceptance\" test set forth in Frye v.

We satisfy this criteria by obtaining peer review from qualified colleagues (\"the relevant scientific community\") even beyond the editorial peer-review proc ess. Does this mean that exposure scenarios for over 500 tribes must be peer reviewed and published in Risk Analysis in order to be admissible in cour t should they be challenged during a CERCLA or NEPA process? We believe that if a standardized process is followed and the scenario is reviewed by an advisory board of qualified peers that actual publication is not necessary, even though publication in a peer- reviewed journal is a commonly a ccepted standard for peer review. The scenario must be both scientifically relevant and reliable, and culturally relevant and reliable. The process must be culturally sensitive, respectful, draw on traditional environmental knowledge (such as the observational expertise of elders), and must be develo ped from within the tribe by a toxicologist/risk assessor in partnership with tribal cultur al and technical experts. Collaboration with the Cultural Resour ces Program provided the cultural assurance. Policy-level approval must be obtained. The process must m eet Institutional Review Board rules or their equivalent for conducting human research (which we believe includes cultural or anthropologic al research) such as informed consent, benefit to the tribal community, disclos ure of the risk of adverse consequences, and confidentiality. Repeated conversations with tribal program managers and/or policy makers ensured that there was an understanding of the way that the risk information was to be used, the potential adverse consequences of developing a scenario from a risk acceptance perspecti ve or precedent, and related concerns. the testimony as would be required in field practice. In addition to reliability, courts will require a testifying expert to be \"qualified,\" and the testimony mu st be relevant and helpful to the trier of fact. Thus, the emphasis is on testimony being relevant and reliable more than on whether there is a strict litmus test of generating a theory and stat istically testing a null hypothesis. Spokane Tribe Scenario 231 That each parameter can be tested or verified (documented, modeled, measured, or elicited from acknowledged experts), and that each assumption has been systematically validated. Ri sk assessors can rely on ethnographic data, verbal representations from s ubsistence practitioners, and so on. We relied on (1) open peer-reviewed literature on exposures through different but analogous pathways and caloric c ontent of foods, (2) ethnographic documents and reports concerning traditi onal lifestyles and practices, and (3) statements from tribally recognized cu ltural experts. This latter expertise derives from their trad itional environmental knowledge, and is based on confidential information, so we cannot ve rify it in the sense of reanalyzing raw numerical data, but we can verify the expertise of the cultural experts who summarized their knowledge of resources and activity patterns for us. That another risk assessor could repeat the same steps and would construct essentially the same scenario, be cause the approach for developing an exposure scenario is fairly standardized. That the scenario is accepted by colle agues as reasonable and factual rather than eccentric, unreliable, or mere opi nion, or that it meets the \"general acceptance\" test set forth in Frye v. United States , 293 F. 1013 (App. D.C. 1923), the predecessor case to Daubert.

Spokane Tribe Scenario 233 2 THE SPOKANE TRIBE AND ITS ECOCULTURAL LANDSCAPE The Spokane Indians are part of the Inte rior Salish group, which has inhabited northeastern Washington and northern Idaho since time immemorial.(1) The Spokane Reservation lies at the confluence of the Spokane and Columbia Rivers in northeastern Washington. Salmon was the most important commodity in the early economy of the Tribe. Sinc e the construction of Columbia River dams the anadromous salmon are no longe r available. Instead, Kokanee (landlocked sockeye salmon) and resident trout and other species have been substituted. Abundant game also supports an alternative game diet, al ong with a wide variety of roots, berries, and other plants. Because the reservation is still fairly pristine and undeveloped, it provides enough resources for some member s to continue a traditional subsistence dietary lifestyle, and for all memb ers to obtain traditional foods. The ecology of the reservation area is charac teristic of the arid montane areas of the northern Columbia Basin transitioning into the Okanagon highlands to the north. Annual precipitation is appr oximately 16 inches. The Spokane lands include the two major rivers (the Columbia River and one of its tributaries, the Spokane River) including the waters to their far banks, and various other large and small tributaries, springs, ponds, and wetlands. Mount Spokane is a central feature of the reservation landscape. A Douglas fir zone exists at the highest elevations, with Ponderosa pine and Western juniper zones with a variety of understories at lower elevations, and grassland-sagebrush shrub steppe and ri parian areas along the waterways.(7-9) Areas affected by activities at the Mi dnite Mine include the mined area on Mount Spokane and adjacent upland habitats, se veral seeps and springs with riparian habitats, and a major creek (Blue Creek) wh ich empties into the Spokane River arm of Lake Roosevelt, the reservoir created in the Columbia River by the Grand Coulee Dam.(10) The Spokane traditional lifestyle is governed by ecological seasons and the activities that people undertake in response. A signific ant portion of the population follows this lifestyle in full or in part. Hunting, fi shing, and gathering are essential to support nutritional, cultural, spiritual, and medicina l needs of tribal members. Hunting and gathering on the reservation is allowed bas ed on the needs of the family. Typically, all family members work in the field on a regular basis to keep the extended family unit stocked with a wide variety of plants and wildlife. While in the field, tribal members live off the land by consuming surface and spring water, wild plants, and wildlife. In addition to the ti me spent in hunting, fishing, or gathering, time is also spent cleaning, processing, and preserving hi des, drying vegetal food or medicines, and making a wide variety of items. The Spokane people use over 200 varieties of plants.(11) Huckleberries are gathered, as are a wi de variety of root s, shoots, moss, leaves, stems, cambium, seeds, and flower s. Most natural resources have several human uses(12,13) as well as providing multiple ecological functions and services. A more complete description of edible plants, ethnographic information, plant technology, ethnobotany, and ethnopharmacology is found in AESE.(4) Spokane Tribe Scenario 233 2 THE SPOKANE TRIBE AND ITS ECOCULTURAL LANDSCAPE The Spokane Indians are part of the Inte rior Salish group, which has inhabited northeastern Washington and northern Idaho since time immemorial.(1) The Spokane Reservation lies at the confluence of the Spokane and Columbia Rivers in northeastern Washington.

Continental U.S. with Spokane Reservation Location Spokane Tribe Scenario 235 3 GENERALIZED LIFESTYLE OF A REPRESENTATIVE COMPOSITE SPOKANE TRIBAL FAMILY This section describes a family-bas ed exposure scenario founded on traditional Spokane lifestyles and diet s (one fish-based diet and on e game-based diet). This hypothetical but representative family lives in a house in a sparsely populated conifer forest, tends a home garden, pursues a high rate of subsistence activities and a regular schedule of other cu ltural activities. The lifestyle is moderately active, with daily sweat lodge use and outdoor employment. The family composition was determined with the guidance of the Spokan e Tribal Culture Program and current tribal demographics. Each family includes an infant/child (age 0-2 years) who breastfeeds for two years and crawls and pl ays; a child (age 2-6), a youth (age 7- 16) who attends school, plays outdoors near his/her residence, and is learning traditional practices; two adult worker s (one male, one female, age 17-55; the female breastfeeds the infant) who work outdoors on reclamati on and environmental and cultural activities and who also engage in subsistence activities, and an elder (age 56-75) who is partly at home and par tly outdoors teaching and demonstrating traditional cultural practices. All members (e xcept the infant) partake in family sweat lodge use and in cultural activities throughout t he year. In actuality, a family typically includes members who are employed conven tionally and members who are full-time subsistence providers. 3.1 RESIDENCE A conventional suburban scenario would identify a person living at home and growing a garden. The subsistence family is s uperficially similar to this, but they live in a more open house, spend more time outdoors in cultural and subsistence activities, eat both garden and native f oods, and are fully interactive with the environment. The family spends its entire lifet ime on the reservation, rather than the suburban default assumption of 30 years. The house has no landscaping other than the natural Ponderosa and understor y, some naturally bare soil, a gravel driveway, no air conditioning, and a wood-burning st ove in the winter for heat. Each house has its own well for domestic use and a garden irrigated with groundwater and/or surface water. Each house has a nearby sweat lodge. The amount of indoor dust is not known, but is likely to be higher t han in suburban communities with manicured lawns, air conditioning, and paved streets. 3.2 GENERALIZED DAILY ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF EACH FAMILY MEMBER Due to space limitations, the average daily activity pattern is not described for each age range and each gender, but in the full scenario, such information would be included in this section. (6) While activities of Spokane males and females are different, they likely result in a sim ilar frequency and duration of environmental contact, so the genders may be separated or combined. The daily activity patterns can also be combined into entire lifetimes for the evaluation of cumulative risk.

The daily activity patterns can also be combined into entire lifetimes for the evaluation of cumulative risk. Spokane Tribe Scenario 236 3.3 SWEAT LODGE USE (AGES 2-75) The daily use of the sweat l odge is an integral part of the lifestyle that starts at age two. Sweat lodge construction has been described in the open literature.(14,15) Although the details vary among tribes and among individual families, sweat lodges are generally round structures (6 feet in diameter for singl e-family use). A nearby fire is used to heat rocks that are brought into the sweat lodge. Water (4L) is poured over the rocks to form steam (a conf ined hemispheric space with complete evaporation of the water, which is availa ble for inhalation and dermal exposure over the entire skin area). Water is ingested (1L is included in the total drinking water ingestion rate) and medicinal plants ar e used (not specifically included). 3.4 CULTURAL ACTIVITIES All persons participate in day-long outdoor group cultural activities once a month, such as pow-wows, horse races, and seasonal ceremonial as well as private family cultural activities. These activities tend to be large gatherings with a greater rate of dust resuspension and particulate inhalation. Individuals also tend to be more active during the ceremonies, resulting in greater inhalation and water ingestion rates. These activities are folded into the higher soil ingestion, water ingestion, and inhalation rates rather than being es timated on a single-event basis. 3.5 DIET The Spokane food pyramid looks markedly di fferent from the USDA food pyramid. Caloric needs are generally cited in the range of 2,000 to 4,000 kcal per day for adult males, depending on the level of activity . We use 2,500 kcal/day for the Spokane Tribe, based on a moderately active outdoor lifestyle and renowne d athletic prowess (as did Scholz(3)). The original diet of the Spokane Indians was based on salmon and included large and small game, r oots, berries, and many other plants .(2, 3,11) Hunn(16) estimated that 45% of the native Co lumbia Plateau dietary calories came from protein (fish and game), with higher estimates for upriver tribes such as the Spokane.(3) Historically, the Spokane Tribe cons umed roughly 1,000 to 1,500 grams of salmon and other fish per day.(2,3) The most robust upper bound estimate of original (predam) salmon intake by the Spok ane Tribe is the Walker estimate (cited in Reference 3) of 1,200 pounds per year of salmon per adult, or 1,426 gpd (about 3 pounds/day), yielding 2,566 kcal/day before migrat ion (i.e., if caught in the estuary) and 2566 x 0.64 = 1643 kcal/day after migrat ion from the ocean to the Spokane area. With the construction of the Gr and Coulee Dam, the anadromous salmon runs were destroyed, so there was a shift to big game and to Kokanee and resident trout. Because the intent of this scenario is to evaluate exposures that traditional members currently receive and that mo re members will receive as they regain a traditional diet, two diets were evaluated: a high fish diet and a high game diet. Eighty percent of each diet is native, augmented with vegetables grow n in a household garden. The current realistic high fish diet based on availability, percentage of the diet, and caloric content consists primarily of fish (885 g/d, somewhat lower than historical levels), supplemented by big game, aquat ic amphibian/crustacean/mollusks, small Spokane Tribe Scenario 236 3.3 SWEAT LODGE USE (AGES 2-75) The daily use of the sweat l odge is an integral part of the lifestyle that starts at age two.

The high game diet reverses the fish-game quantities, and both diets in clude identical amounts of native and domestic plants. Both forms of the diet are approxim ately 40% protein, 25% fat, and 35% carbohydrate (given the limited data availabl e for native foods), which is comparable to other hunter-gatherer diets.(17) Until recently, this diet was even higher in fish- derived protein, and was stable for at l east 5,000 years (based on archaeological evidence of salmon runs). The carbohydr ates are largely unprocessed and include many roots but little grain. The fats are from fish, game, nuts, and seeds. 3.6 DRINKING WATER Daily replacement water needs are approx imately 2L/100 pounds body weight (more during exercise or pregnancy).6 Athletic activity can result in a loss of 1.5 L/hour; replacement volumes are recommended as 1 to 1.5 ml/kcal of energy expended.(18) Harris and Harper(5) estimated an average water ingesti on rate of 3 L/day for adults, based on total fluid intake for the Conf ederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. However, that number did not account for all uses. This scenario includes adult water ingestion of 1L while at home (from the household water supply), 1L taken from home to the worksi te, 1L consumed from worksite sources, and 1L from the household or spring to rehydr ate during use of the sweat lodge, for a total of 4 L/d. 3.7 SOIL INGESTION Soil ingestion by young children (0-6 years) is assumed to be 400 mg/day for 365 days/year. This is higher than the prior EPA default value of 200 mg/day.(19) It reflects both indoor dust and continuous outd oor activities analogous to gardening or camping,(20) but is less than a single-incident sports or construction ingestion rate.(21,22,23) For adults, the soil ingestion value is also 400 mg/day, reflecting an unspecified upper percentile.(21) This value also better re flects the environmental setting, the typical residential situati on, gardening and gathering activities, the preparation and consumption of native and garden plants, the cons umption of other natural foods, and a variety of additional out door activities (work, play, cultural activities). However, it may still subst antially underestimate the amount of soil and sediment on garden produce and gathered plant foods. In particular, episodic events such as gathering in wetlands or road work could result in 1 gram of soil ingested per event,(21,22,23) which may be over and above the 400 mg ingested daily. If there is geophagy (eating dirt for micronutrients or sa lt), the ingestion would be higher yet. In fact, the intentional presence of some Mother Earth in food may be beneficial medically(23) and spiritually. 6 U.S. Air Force at http://www.capnhq.gov/nhq/cp/ encampments/AETC.htm#AETC. ; Coyle at http://www.veggie.org/veggie/fluid.exercise.shtml.

Spokane Tribe Scenario 238 3.8 INHALATION RATE We believe that an inhalation rate of 30 m3/d is more accurate for the Spokanes' active, outdoor lifestyle than the EPA default rate of 20 m3/d.(21) EPA(21) reviewed several extensive studies that exami ned ventilation rates based on direct measurement and activity diaries in developing the default rate of 20 m3/day. EPA recognizes that special populations, such as athletes or out door workers, have higher average rates and recommends calculating their inhalation rates using the following median hourly intakes for various activity levels (in m3/hr): resting = 0.4, sedentary = 0.5, light activity = 1, moderate activity = 1. 6, heavy activity = 3.2. For outdoor workers, a median rate is 1.3, wit h an upper percentile of 3.3, depending on the ratio of light, moderate, and heavy activities during the observation time. \"Inhalation rates may be higher among outdoor workers/athletes because levels of activity outdoors may be higher, therefore, this subpopulation group may be more susceptible to air pollutants and are considered a 'high risk' subgroup.\"(21) Using this EPA guidance, a median rate of 26.2 m3/d is obtained from eight hours sleeping, two hours sedentary, six hours light activity, six hours moderate activity, and two hours heavy activity. This represents minimal heav y activity (construction, climbing hills, etc.), and is a median ra ther than a reasonable maxi mum. The California Air Resources Board(25) also reviewed daily breathing rates based on activity levels and concluded that 20 m3/d represents an 85th percentile of typical American adult lifestyle (eight hours sleeping and 16 hours of light to moder ate activity), a lifestyle that is less active than an outdoor lifes tyle in a topography that includes steep slopes, as on the Spokane Reservation.

Spokane Tribe Scenario 239 4 A SCREENING-LEVEL COMPOSITE RME Due to the number of age groups, daily activities, and limited EPA funds for determining both media-specific exposure point concentrations as well as developing and subsequently running the risk model, EPA requested that the Tribe condense the scenario into a screening-level composite RME application for use in the Midnite Mine risk assessm ent (Table 1). The principl e of developing a screening scenario is to reduce the number of calcul ations by combining (not eliminating) pathways and age groups, and maximizing ex posure factors to a reasonable degree. The screening-level risk assessment then generally employs the composite RME and the upper 95th percentile exposure poi nt concentrations in each medium, wherever they occur throughout the site, so t hat any location, activity, diet, or water source has the chance to drive risk. This me ans that the result of the screening level risk assessment is not strictly location, pat hway, age, or activity specific. It only indicates whether unacceptable site-wide risk is possible and shows the spatial aspects of the risk profile if plotted on a base map. In the future, EPA or the Tribe will need to use the full scenario and location -specific exposure point concentrations to assess risk attributable to location, pat hway, age, or activity. Such information will be required to evaluate the remedial alter native during the feasibility study and to quantify residual risk once rem ediation has been completed. The full scenario was condensed as follows. The daily time allocation is 12 hrs/d indoors, 2 hours in the sweat lodge, 7 hours outdoors working, playing, and other non-subsistence activities, and 3 hours of subsistence activities in each contaminated area where these ac tivities might occur. This will result in more than a 24-hour day, but is necessary to reduce the number of calculations . Alternately, the person can live and subsist at the single most contaminated location. Soil ingestion remains at 400 mg/d for 365 days/year (100 mg from indoor sources and 300 from outdoor sources; for multip le contaminated sub-site s, each contributes 300 mg, which could result in more than 400 mg/d; alternately, the singl e most contaminated soil location can serve as the sole source of soil-based exposure). For application to other areas, such as wetlands, 1 gram per visit may be used. (21,22) Drinking water remains at 4 L/d, which is derived from the most c ontaminated source (this is duplicated for surface and groundwa ter if both are contaminated). This results in an upper bound sitewide risk estimate. Risks for an actual individual who specializes in certain activities (i.e., the hunt er or the fisher), spends mo re time in fewer locations or a single location, or fully utilizes a contaminated medium such as groundwater, could be as high as but no higher than this upper bound estimate. Subsequent analyses using either the complete scenar io or the composite RME can examine particular pathways and locations, or can be used to support risk management decision such as remedial goals, subs istence soil and water remedial screening levels, or tribal regulatory standards. Spokane Tribe Scenario 239 4 A SCREENING-LEVEL COMPOSITE RME Due to the number of age groups, daily activities, and limited EPA funds for determining both media-specific exposure point concentrations as well as developing and subsequently running the risk model, EPA requested that the Tribe condense the scenario into a screening-level composite RME application for use in the Midnite Mine risk assessm ent (Table 1). The principl e of developing a screening scenario is to reduce the number of calcul ations by combining (not eliminating) pathways and age groups, and maximizing ex posure factors to a reasonable degree. The screening-level risk assessment then generally employs the composite RME and the upper 95th percentile exposure poi nt concentrations in each medium, wherever they occur throughout the site, so t hat any location, activity, diet, or water source has the chance to drive risk.

The current 885 gpd is based on a comb ination of calories estimates, availability, interviews, and dietary balance. The current Spok ane diet relies on Kokanee (landlocked sockeye) and trout (bull or Dolly Varden, rainbow), suckers, whitefish, other species. Salmon and steelhead are obtained whenever possible. Mussels and crayfish were also eaten regularly. Both fish and game are eaten fresh, smoked, or dr ied, but there are no data on calories or contaminant concentrations according to met hod of preparation. No contaminant loss during preparation is assumed, since contaminants could become more concentrat ed as well as being lost with fat loss. The dietary data are not adequate to distinguis h fruit, berries, greens, roots, bulbs, fungi/moss, seeds/nuts, medicines, or sweeteners on a caloric bas is, nor domesticated from wild plants. If data for uptake from soil/sediment or dust/sediment load for a nat ive species becomes available, the intake of that species will be estimated. The proportion of abov e and below ground plants is based on reliance on tubers and bulbs, using USDA caloric information on domesticated plants from the same plant families. Intake of other plants (medicines, rose hips, etc.) occurs but was not determined. Dairy may be underestimated (cheese, milk), and e ggs are not specifically included, but should be included depending on the information supplied by tribal members. While many animal species are similar with respec t to how much nutrition they provide to people, their contaminant concentration will vary according to t heir habitat and ecological niche, as well as their location and size of home range. This is estimated through the ecological food web or actual sampling data. All of the exposure factors ar e constant through the year (i.e ., they apply 365 days/year). Table 2 shows some of t he major differences between EPA default exposure factors and our subsistence scenario. We are not pr esenting a sensitivity analysis in this article because the relative contribution of various exposure factors will depend on the concentration of contaminants in vari ous media and their physical parameters, and specific human activity patterns at the c ontaminated site. This will be the subject of another article. However, we expect that the major factors for subsistence lifestyles or lifestyles with high environment al contact rates will be soil ingestion, drinking water, exposure duration, and diet. We should note that the dietary factors in the Exposure Factors Handbook reflect major categories of the diet rather than a necessarily complete diet\u2014adding aver age caloric content for the categories identified in the Handbook totals about 2000 kcal/d for the general population, which is lower than actual national average calori c intakes by up to one-third. That other third of the diet is not likely to come from the contaminated site, so from an exposure perspective this does not detract from suburban dietary exposure estimates. The subsistence diet in this paper, however, yields a full day's calories (~2500 kcal). If one tried to construct a subsis tence diet solely from the Handbook , the caloric intake would fall short of an adequate amount even if the intake factors for Native Americans were used. One could err oneously equate \"subsistence\" with a modern diet supplemented with fish, game, and wild pl ants using intake rates that are given in the Handbook . This could be due to several fact ors: whether reservation dwellers were specifically sampled during the th ree-day recall surveys (versus urban or suburban dwellers who happened to be Native American), the difference between current reservation conditions (with USDA commodity foods) and a truly subsistence lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, and so on. Thus, developing a subsistence exposure scenario with a traditional diet and cu ltural practices specific to reservation living needs to rely primarily on ethnographi c data and cultural information, and only secondarily on national dietary survey data.

Spokane Tribe Scenario 243 5 DATA GAPS AND SOURCES OF UNCE RTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCREENING-LEVEL RME An incomplete list of data gaps and uncer tainties are briefly discussed below. The relative error caused by each uncertainty cannot be ascertained at this time. We believe that the overall uncertainty and vari ability are greater in tribal communities than in suburban communities due to the greater number of risk factors and the potential for several risk factors to cluster in particular communities and individuals. Because tribal members could be at great er risk due to both greater exposure and greater sensitivity, an additional safety factor or precautionary approach may be warranted in these types of situations. 5.1 MOBILE VERSUS STATIONARY RME The typical suburban RME for members of the general populat ion is a house-bound individual with a local garden, or a residential farmer who is largely self-sufficient. In these cases, the house and garden are assum ed to be located at the contaminated site and available for unrestricted use. The subsistence family also lives where the contamination occurs if this is physicall y possible, but may spend more time away from the immediate residence during subsistence activities. However, a subsistence RME should not assume that exposure is di luted by spending significant amounts of time in uncontaminated areas. For la rge sites with variable contaminant concentrations, problems arise when trying to perform a single risk assessment to evaluate multiple hot spots (as not-to -exceed concentrations), even if the risk assessment assumes that the person moves around from hot spot to hot spot or if all subsistence activities are assu med to occur where the upper 95th concentration limit occurs. Additionally, the problem of spatia lly integrating wides pread contamination still remains because, conceptually, 10 acres of contamination poses a greater risk than 1 acre with the same contaminant concentration. Temporally, persistent contaminants pose a longer ri sk, and therefore a gr eater total risk, than degradable contaminants. Unfortunately, the present regulatory framework does not use spatial or temporal risk metrics (such as risk acre -years, or dose per community gene pool across several generations) to account for this cumulative exposure over time and space and people. 5.2 SPECIAL ACTIVITIES There are special circum stances when some people ma y be highly exposed that have not included in the complete scenar io or the screening-level RME. For instance, some men hunt or fish fo r the general community, and many people provide roots and fish and game to elders in addition to their own families. Gathering of some plants (e.g., cattails, water potat oes, reeds and rushes) is a very muddy activity, and rivershore or lakeshore activi ties may underestimate sediment exposure (soil ingestion can be 1 gram per event(21,22,23)). Washing, peeling, weaving rushes, and other activities results in additional exposure. For example, basketmakers clean and wash their materials, incur cuts on their hands, and hold materials in their Spokane Tribe Scenario 243 5 DATA GAPS AND SOURCES OF UNCE RTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCREENING-LEVEL RME An incomplete list of data gaps and uncer tainties are briefly discussed below.

For example, basketmakers clean and wash their materials, incur cuts on their hands, and hold materials in their Spokane Tribe Scenario 244 mouth. Flintknappers may receive addi tional exposure through obtaining and working with their materials. In addition, there are poten tial pathways that are not specifically identif ied but which might contribute additional exposure, such as contaminated firewood used for smoking food, plants used for teas, flavoring, smudging, or medicine, contact with cont aminated animal parts (paints, bone ornaments, clothing), sitting on the ground for long periods of time while processing or during ceremonial activities, and so on. Even though the composite activity patterns are intended to reflec t reasonable maximum exposu res, there is a potential for underestimating some pathways (i.e., this is not a worst-case scenario). 5.3 COMMUNITY EXPOSURE BURDENS An entire community exposure burden estima te or population dose estimate may be needed that includes people who do not re side in but occasionally visit the contaminated area (this includes inadvertent intruders onto the site). If a resource is contaminated, the entire community is ex posed. The assumption that protecting the RME adequately protects everyone else may re sult in a failure to provide all the information that the tribe's governing body needs for informing its members. There may be sensitive individuals (children, elder s, the sick, the occ upationally exposed) who, arguably, may or may not be protec ted by using standard reference doses and other factors. Also, tribal leaders often ma ke decisions at the community rather than the individual level (i.e., t he survival of the individual may not be as im portant as the survival of the family or community, so t he community is also an appropriate unit of analysis). Therefore, decisions where ev eryone is exposed to a low level of contamination may be differ ent from and more stringent than decisions where a few individuals are at high risk or decisions w here risks are distributed over time, space, and populations rather than localized. We believe this to be an important but understated element of real risk and ri sk-based decision making (not to be dismissed as perceived risk, or cultural amplification of r eal risk, or a risk management determination). The nature and ex tent of community exposure can be estimated over time and space by esti mating the number of people and the number of generations that could live in each ar ea or concentration isopleth and be exposed (a community chemical effective dose equiva lent). The total number of generations and the number of people per generation need to be described in terms of the total number of people exposed, total dose fo r the community (or the gene pool), proportion of each generation exposed, and so on. Even more broadly, the total dose for a small community's combi ned gene pool or neuronal pool could be estimated. Finally, the propor tion of each generation that is affected, rather than simply the number of people (in a sm all population), can be determined. Spokane Tribe Scenario 244 mouth.

Even though the composite activity patterns are intended to reflec t reasonable maximum exposu res, there is a potential for underestimating some pathways (i.e., this is not a worst-case scenario). 5.3 COMMUNITY EXPOSURE BURDENS An entire community exposure burden estima te or population dose estimate may be needed that includes people who do not re side in but occasionally visit the contaminated area (this includes inadvertent intruders onto the site). If a resource is contaminated, the entire community is ex posed. The assumption that protecting the RME adequately protects everyone else may re sult in a failure to provide all the information that the tribe's governing body needs for informing its members. There may be sensitive individuals (children, elder s, the sick, the occ upationally exposed) who, arguably, may or may not be protec ted by using standard reference doses and other factors. Also, tribal leaders often ma ke decisions at the community rather than the individual level (i.e., t he survival of the individual may not be as im portant as the survival of the family or community, so t he community is also an appropriate unit of analysis). Therefore, decisions where ev eryone is exposed to a low level of contamination may be differ ent from and more stringent than decisions where a few individuals are at high risk or decisions w here risks are distributed over time, space, and populations rather than localized. We believe this to be an important but understated element of real risk and ri sk-based decision making (not to be dismissed as perceived risk, or cultural amplification of r eal risk, or a risk management determination). The nature and ex tent of community exposure can be estimated over time and space by esti mating the number of people and the number of generations that could live in each ar ea or concentration isopleth and be exposed (a community chemical effective dose equiva lent). The total number of generations and the number of people per generation need to be described in terms of the total number of people exposed, total dose fo r the community (or the gene pool), proportion of each generation exposed, and so on. Even more broadly, the total dose for a small community's combi ned gene pool or neuronal pool could be estimated. Finally, the propor tion of each generation that is affected, rather than simply the number of people (in a sm all population), can be determined. Spokane Tribe Scenario 245 5.4 BACKGROUND EXPOSURE AND CO MMUNITY-WIDE EXPOSURE FROM OTHER SOURCES Under the National Contingency Plan and subsequent EPA guidance, EPA is charged with evaluating incremental risk to humans caused by a release from the subject site. This means that when eval uating a Superfund site, EPA is not charged with evaluating risk associated with high concentrations of naturally occurring substances, such as arsenic measured in background soil, water, or food, if the concentrations were not increased by on-si te activity, nor risk associated with releases of contaminants from an other site. When there is background contamination (however that is defined), or widespread low- level contamination, this contamination contributes to cumulative exposure to many or all people in the community. From a human health standpoint, the origin of t he contaminant is irrelevant. However, from a liability- based regulatory standpoint such as CERCLA, the origin is paramount. In the case of the Spokane scenario, it is known that Columbia River fish are contaminated wit h PCBs and metals (there are existing fish advisories for Lake Roosevelt and for an upr iver portion of the Spokane River), but cleanup at the mine site is proceeding as if th is contamination is not present or that people are not exposed to it. When an entir e community is exposed to non-site contaminants, we believe that this should be included as part of the total risk burden, and that the clean-up goals for th e incremental risk posed by the site itself may need to be modified (see, for instance, OSWE R Environmental Justice Action Agenda, EPA 540/R-95/023, which states that \"OSWER supports Agency-wide efforts to develop scientifically valid standards to measure cumulative risk.\"). Other EPA approaches are more cumulative in nature, such as the Guidance on Cumulative Risk Assessment ( http://www.epa.gov/ORD/spc/cumrisk2.htm ); Toward Integrated Environmental Decision Ma king (EPA-SAB-EC-00-011; http://www.epa.gov/science1/ecirp011.pdf ); and various permitting programs based on total toxicant burdens in a watershed or airshed. As another example, the EPA approach to arsenic or other substances in drinking water is to require treatment to safe levels even if these are lo wer than natural background levels. 5.5 INDIVIDUAL EXPO SURE FACTORS The exposure assessment literature is lacki ng relevant information for subsistence activities. For instance, gardening or campi ng are typically used by risk assessors as an analogue for hunting and gathering activities , athletic physiological factors are used as an analogue for the more vigorous outdoor activities, sports nutrition information is used in checking diet, and so on. Several pathways are simply unknown, such as the use of medicinal plants (further, certain of these pathways need to be included in a way that does not vi olate confidentiality) . We believe that some factors, particularly soil ingesti on, are still underestima ted. The amount of exposure obtained as a person consumes wild foods (often without being able to wash them first as is assumed in a typical suburban scenario) is unknown, as is the amount of soil remaining on gathered vegetation even if it is washed, because environmental samples are generally not analyzed in an as-gathered or as- consumed condition.

Spokane Tribe Scenario 246 5.6 ECOLOGICAL FOOD WEB AS AN INPUT TO HUMAN EXPOSURE At present, the Tribe does not know if the ecological risk assessments being prepared by EPA for the Midnite Mine will pr ovide the appropriate information for estimating human subsistence dietary inform ation. Existing ecological and human health risk models are generally incompatible. Ecological models typically have more species but fewer pathways, while human health models have many more pathways but generally less trophic-level capability. The lack of transfer factors (soil to plant, and dispersion through the food web) may also pose a problem. EPA is attempting to address this nationally; it is especially important to include tr ibal considerations during these discussions. 5.7 SEASONALITY AND ACUTE EXPOSURES Some of the original activity patterns over the annual seasonal cycle have been modified in modern times, but the ecological cycles have not. Therefore, people must still gather plants according to when th ey are ripe, hunt according to game and fowl patterns, and fish when the spawning r uns occur. The Spokane Tribe Cultural Resources Program confirmed that although specific acti vities change from one season to the next throughout the year, th ese activites are replaced by other activities with a similar environmental c ontact rate. This scenario assumes that exposure is fairly homogeneous because even in winter months materials are gathered, cleaned, and used, and native foods are eaten (i.e ., all factors are applied 365 days per year). However, it is possibl e that excessive acute exposures occur, over and above the annually averaged exposure rates included in this scenario. 5.8 CO-RISK FACTORS Many co-risk factors cluster in tribal comm unities, including poverty, higher rates of existing health conditions (such as di abetes), poorer access to health care, inadequate infrastructure, 500 years of cumula tive psychological stress, employment in occupations with more chemical exposur es, and so on. Data on other factors such as enzyme polymorphisms related to detoxif ication or disease susceptibility are simply absent. Each of these factors is known to influence the health response to chemicals, although data are lacking about t heir combined effect as well as their prevalence in any particular tribal community.

Spokane Tribe Scenario 247 6 CONCLUSION Although the scenario discussed in this arti cle greatly improves the accuracy of risk- based decision making in Indian Country, much still remains to be done in order for tribes to achieve the same proporti onal degree of risk reduction that suburban communities have enjoyed for many decades. Existing human-health-based regulatory standards were not developed with subsistence in mind, so tribes are always less protected because they are alwa ys more exposed. This is not meant to indict standards as intenti onally ignoring certain populati ons, simply that there are situations and populations t hat did not receive attention when the regulations were written many years ago. The inequity of this situation has not been fully explored, but is the topic of current research. Addition ally, this scenario is not generalizable to other tribes, particularly the diet se ction, although the soil and drinking water exposure factors may prove to be fair ly similar for many tribal settings. The true worth of any risk assessment is me asured by whether its results are used, even if the ultimate decision is based mo re on other factors such as economics, technical feasibility, or pr ecaution. One of the goals of a project manager is to achieve a stable decision, or one that is durable over time, even if this is not explicitly stated. Decision stability is not merely due to compromise or consensus, but also to whether a community's expec tations are met regarding the specific metrics and impacts to be assessed. De cisionmakers or community leaders have certain information needs that can help design a truly useful risk assessment, even if the assessment takes form somewhat differ ently from the norm. We believe that deliberately incorporating community conc erns into both the risk assessment and the risk management decision makes decisions more stable and robust, not less scientific. It is a matter of opinion whether responding to community issues within the risk assessment itself, rather than def erring these items until a later risk management phase, improves the assessment and makes it more useful by tailoring it to the specific situation, or merely re sults in inconsistency by making results less useful for comparing risks between sites. We would also like to raise the bar for ri sk ethics. The traumatic history of federal actions against tribes is still recent history for many tribal nations and tribal members experience remnants of federal extermination and assimilation policies literally every day. This is a strong and discomforting st atement, but it is a reality that risk assessors and project managers must recognize if they work on tribal risk issues. It might even be said that tribes are still at wa r, a war that is being fought in the courts on a daily basis to preserve their rights, ju risdiction, resources, religion, homeland, and way of life. We do not want risk assesso rs to underestimate how serious this is to tribal members and tribal staff. Many or most tribal members can name ancestors who died defending their rights and homelands , and the current generation of tribal scientists honors this by vigilantly protec ting the rights and resources on which their culture and identity and existence depend.

There is a tendency to want to get the details right first, then step back and look at the implementation or consequences (i.e., to keep risk assessment separate from risk management).

Traditional tribal communities have no s edentary members except the frail elderly, whereas one-quarter of moder n American adults of all ages report no leisure time physical activity at all.1 We have estimated the activity levels associated with this lifestyle and diet using published anthropol ogical studies, ethnographic literature on foraging theory, hunting-gather ing lifestyles, and intervie ws with tribal members. Using EPA guidance on hourly inhalation rates for diffe rent activity levels, a reasonable inhalation rate for an average tri bal member's active lifestyle is an average rate of 26.2m3/d, based on 8 hours sleeping at 0.4m3/hr, 2 hours sedentary at 0.5m3/hr, 6 hours light activity at 1m3/hr, 6 hours moderate activity at 1.6m3/hr, and 2 hours heavy activity at 3.2m3/hr. Unlike most other exposure factors, which are upper bounds, the inhalation rate is an av erage rate. This could result in under- protection of children, the elderly, athlet es, asthmatics, and the half of the population with above-average inhalation rates. However, to be consistent with national methodology, we have rounded the rate to 25m3/day. A.2 POPULATION-SPECIFIC PHYSIOLOGY Perhaps the most relevant factors associat ed with ethnic specificit y of metabolic and inhalation rates are the thri fty genotype(s), insulin use, and oxidation and adiposity patterns (Goran 2000, Fox et al. 1998, Muzzin et al. 1999, Rush et al. 1997, Saad et al. 1991, Kue Young et al. 2002), as well as et hnic differences in spirometry (Crapo et al. 1988, Lanese et al. 1978, Mapel et al. 1997, Aidaraliyev et al. 1993, Berman et al. 1994). Research on the thrifty genoty pe suggests that there may be several stress response genes that enable indi genous populations to respond to environmental stresses and to the rapid trans ition between extremes, including feast and famine, heat and cold, disruption in circ adian rhythms, dehydration, seasonality, and explosive energy output or rapid tr ansitions between minimum and maximum exercise and VO2 max (Kimm et al. 2002, Snitker et al. 1998). These genes \"uncouple\" several energy expenditure parameters (Ki mm et al. 2002) and generally 1 http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/pdf/ 2001prvrpt.pdf and http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/pubrfdat.htm . Appendix = 25m3/d (adult) A.1 SUMMARY The inhalation rate in the indigenous scenario s reflects the active, outdoor lifestyle of traditional tribal members, including youth who are learning traditional subsistence skills, adult outdoor workers who also hun t, gather, and fish, and elders who gather plants and medicines, and prepare and use t hem (e.g., making medicines or baskets, etc.) and who teach a variety of indoor and outdoor traditional activities. Traditional tribal communities have no s edentary members except the frail elderly, whereas one-quarter of moder n American adults of all ages report no leisure time physical activity at all.1 We have estimated the activity levels associated with this lifestyle and diet using published anthropol ogical studies, ethnographic literature on foraging theory, hunting-gather ing lifestyles, and intervie ws with tribal members. Using EPA guidance on hourly inhalation rates for diffe rent activity levels, a reasonable inhalation rate for an average tri bal member's active lifestyle is an average rate of 26.2m3/d, based on 8 hours sleeping at 0.4m3/hr, 2 hours sedentary at 0.5m3/hr, 6 hours light activity at 1m3/hr, 6 hours moderate activity at 1.6m3/hr, and 2 hours heavy activity at 3.2m3/hr. Unlike most other exposure factors, which are upper bounds, the inhalation rate is an av erage rate. This could result in under- protection of children, the elderly, athlet es, asthmatics, and the half of the population with above-average inhalation rates. However, to be consistent with national methodology, we have rounded the rate to 25m3/day. A.2 POPULATION-SPECIFIC PHYSIOLOGY Perhaps the most relevant factors associat ed with ethnic specificit y of metabolic and inhalation rates are the thri fty genotype(s), insulin use, and oxidation and adiposity patterns (Goran 2000, Fox et al. 1998, Muzzin et al. 1999, Rush et al. 1997, Saad et al. 1991, Kue Young et al. 2002), as well as et hnic differences in spirometry (Crapo et al. 1988, Lanese et al. 1978, Mapel et al. 1997, Aidaraliyev et al. 1993, Berman et al. 1994). Research on the thrifty genoty pe suggests that there may be several stress response genes that enable indi genous populations to respond to environmental stresses and to the rapid trans ition between extremes, including feast and famine, heat and cold, disruption in circ adian rhythms, dehydration, seasonality, and explosive energy output or rapid tr ansitions between minimum and maximum exercise and VO2 max (Kimm et al. 2002, Snitker et al. 1998). These genes \"uncouple\" several energy expenditure parameters (Ki mm et al. 2002) and generally 1 http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/pdf/ 2001prvrpt.pdf and http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/pubrfdat.htm . Appendix A 253 support the logic of using a higher inhalat ion rate for active outdoor lifestyles, especially in Native American populations. A.3 SHORT-TERM VERSUS LONG -TERM INHALATION RATES Most federal and state agencies eit her use the EPA default value of 20m3/d or use activity levels to estimate short-term and long-term inhalation rates. For these exposure scenarios, activity levels were evaluated through anthropological data (foraging theory and activity descriptions in the anthropological literature) and confirmatory interviews with tri bal elders, and used the CHAD-based EPA recommendations for ventilation rates for the different activity levels. Several examples of similar approaches are: EPA's National Air Toxi cs Assessment (homepage: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw ) uses the CHAD database in its HAPEM4 model to estimate national average air toxics exposures, even though \"the lack of activity pattern data that extend over longer periods of times presents a challenge for HAPEM4 to predict the long-term (yearly) activity patterns that are required to determine chronic exposures.\" Therefore, \"an approac h of selection of a series of single day's patterns (from CHAD) to represent an individual's activi ty pattern for a year was developed.\" The California Air Resources Boar d (CARB 2000) reviewed daily breathing rates based on activity levels and m easured ventilation rates for many activities in the CHAD database. The average hourly rate for sleeping was 0.5m3/hr, light activities at 0.55m3/hr, moderate activities at 1.4m3/hr, and heavy rates of activity levels at 3.4m3/hr. The CARB concluded that 20m3/d represents an 85th percentile of typical adult sedent ary/light activity lifestyles. This is based on 8 hours sleeping and 16 hours of light activity with no moderate or heavy activity, or 1 hour per day of moderate and heavy activity each. In their technical guidance docum ent, \"Long-term Chem ical Exposure Guidelines for Deployed Military Personnel ,\" the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medi cine (USACHPPM) recommended an inhalation rate of 29.2m3/d for U.S. service mem bers. Deployed personnel were assumed to spend 6 hours sleepi ng at an inhalation rate of 0.4m3/hr, 4 hours in sedentary activities (at 0.5m3/hr), 6 hours in light duties (at 1.2m3/hr), and 8 hours in moderate duties (at 2.2m3/hr).2 EPA used 30m3/day for a year-long exposure estimate for the general public at the Hanford Superfund site in Wash ington state, based on a person doing 4 hours of heavy work, 8 hours of li ght activity, and 12 hours resting.3 2 http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/particulate_final/ particulate_final_s06.htm and http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/pm/pm_en.htm . 3 Air Filt ers from Hanford Area\"; Memorandum from Edwin L.

The indigenous soil ingestion rate is based on a review of EPA guidance, soil ingestion studies in suburban and indigenous settings, pica and geophagia, and dermal adherence studies. It is also based on Columbia Plateau subsistence lifestyles with their higher environ mental contact rates, and local climatic and geologic conditions. The soil ingestion rate of 400mg/d fo r all ages is the upper bound for suburban children (EPA 1997) and withi n the range of outdoor activity rates for adults. Subsistence lifestyles were not considered by the EPA guidance, but are generally considered to be similar in soil contact rate s to construction, utilit y worker, or military soil contact levels. However, it is lower than 480mg/d to allow for some low-contact days and balanced with many 1-gram days and events, such as root gathering days, tule and wapato gathering days, powwows, rodeos, horse training and riding days, sweat lodge building or repair days, grave digging, and similar activities. There are also likely to be many high or inte rmediate-contact days, depending on the occupation (e.g., wildlife field work, construc tion or road work, cultural resource field work). B.2 EPA GUIDANCE EPA has reviewed the studies relevant to suburban populations and has published summaries in its \"Exposure Factors Handbook\" (1989, 1991, and 1997). In the current iteration of the \"Exposure Factors Handbook\" 1, EPA reviewed the available scientific literature for childr en and identified seven key st udies that were used to prepare recommended guidelines for evaluat ing the amount of soil exposure. The mean daily values in these studies r anged from 39mg/day to 271mg/day with an average of 146mg/day for soil ingestion and 191mg/day for soil and dust ingestion. Based on these studies, EPA originally recommended a value of 200mg/day. EPA now recommends 100mg/d as a mean va lue for children in suburban settings, 200mg/day as a conservative estimate of the mean, and a value of 400mg/day as an 1 Environmental Protection Agency. 1997.

Appendix B 259 upper bound value (exact percentile not specif ied). Most state and federal guidance uses 200mg/d for children. For adults, the USEPA now suggests a mean soil ingestion rate in suburban settings of 50mg/day for adults (USEPA 1997), wh ich has been decreased from 100mg/d as recommended in earlier guidance. However, EPA says that this rate is still highly uncertain and has a low confidence rating due to lack of data. An adult soil ingestion rate of 100mg/day is most commonly used for residential or agricultural settings. Other EPA guidance such as the Soil Screening Level Guidance2 recommends using 200mg/d for children and 100mg/d fo r adults, based on RAGS HHEM, Part B (EPA 1991), or an age-adjust ed rate of 114mg-y/kg-d. A value for an ingestion rate for adult outdoor activities is no longer given in the 1997 \"Exposure Factors Handbook\" for adults as it is \"too speculative.\" However, the soil screening guidance still recommends 330mg/d fo r a construction worker or other outdoor worker, and risk assessments for constr uction workers typically use a rate of 480mg/d (EPA 1997, Hawley 1985). Other soil ingestion rates are also used by risk assessors. For example, some states recommend the use of 1 gram per acute soil ingestion event 3 to approximate a non- average day for children, such as an outdoor day. B.3 MILITARY GUIDANCE The US military assumes 480mg per exposure event4 or per field day. For military risk assessment, the US Army uses the Te chnical Guide 230 (TG) as the tool to assist deployed military personnel when assessing the potential health risks associated with chemical exposures.5 No database is available to estimate incidental soil ingestion for adults in general or for m ilitary populations either during training at continental US facilities or during deployment.

B 259 upper bound value (exact percentile not specif ied). Most state and federal guidance uses 200mg/d for children. For adults, the USEPA now suggests a mean soil ingestion rate in suburban settings of 50mg/day for adults (USEPA 1997), wh ich has been decreased from 100mg/d as recommended in earlier guidance. However, EPA says that this rate is still highly uncertain and has a low confidence rating due to lack of data. An adult soil ingestion rate of 100mg/day is most commonly used for residential or agricultural settings. Other EPA guidance such as the Soil Screening Level Guidance2 recommends using 200mg/d for children and 100mg/d fo r adults, based on RAGS HHEM, Part B (EPA 1991), or an age-adjust ed rate of 114mg-y/kg-d. A value for an ingestion rate for adult outdoor activities is no longer given in the 1997 \"Exposure Factors Handbook\" for adults as it is \"too speculative.\" However, the soil screening guidance still recommends 330mg/d fo r a construction worker or other outdoor worker, and risk assessments for constr uction workers typically use a rate of 480mg/d (EPA 1997, Hawley 1985). Other soil ingestion rates are also used by risk assessors. For example, some states recommend the use of 1 gram per acute soil ingestion event 3 to approximate a non- average day for children, such as an outdoor day. B.3 MILITARY GUIDANCE The US military assumes 480mg per exposure event4 or per field day. For military risk assessment, the US Army uses the Te chnical Guide 230 (TG) as the tool to assist deployed military personnel when assessing the potential health risks associated with chemical exposures.5 No database is available to estimate incidental soil ingestion for adults in general or for m ilitary populations either during training at continental US facilities or during deployment.

Soil ingestion has been widely studied from a perspective of exposure to soil parasite eggs and other infections. More recently, soil ingestion was recognized to be a potentially significant pathway of exposure to contaminants, and risk assessments initially used a high inadvertent, based on studies of pica children (e.g., Kimbrough 1984). This triggered a great deal of research with industry (e.g., the Calabrese series) or federal funding (e .g., the DOE-funded studi es of fallout and bomb test contamination).

Soil ingestion rates vary depending on the age of t he individual, frequency of hand-to-mouth contact, seasonal climate, amount and type of outdoor activity, the surface on which that activity occurs, and personal hygiene practices. Some children exhibit pica behavior which can result in intentional ingestion of relatively large amounts of soil.9 In general, two approaches to estimating so il ingestion rates have been taken. The first method involves measuring the pres ence of (mostly) non-metabolized tracer elements in the feces of an individual and in the soil with which an individual is in contact, generally in controlled (largely indo or) situations.

B.4.1 Studies in Children Early studies in children focused on pica (see below) and unique food-related events. In particular, one study of soil i ngestion from \"sticky sw eets\" was estimated at 10mg to 1g/d (Day et al. 1975). Hawley (1985) estimated that the amount ingested by young children during outdoor activity between May and October is 250mg/ d. For outdoor activities from May through October, Hawley estimated the inges tion amount as 480mg per active day, assuming that 8 hours is spent outdoors per day, 2 d/week. Other early tracer studies in American chil dren (Binder et al. 1986) resulted in large ranges of estimates of soil ingestion for se veral reasons. In the Binder study (as in all subsequent studies), the particular tracer element make s a large difference in soil ingestion estimates. Clausing et al. (1987) followed basically the same approach for Dutch rather than American children. Neit her study included the trace minerals from food or medicine. A third study (van Wijnen et al. 1990) used the same approach, and was the first to include a considerati on of camping and the presence or absence of gardens. Thompson and Burmaster (1991) reanalyzed the original data on children from Binder et al. (1986) to characterize the distribution of soil ingestion by children. In studies with large numbers of children, pica childr en may be present, but most studies did not try to diagnose pica. On t he other hand, not all children with high ingestion rates are pica children, so caut ion must be exercised when identifying pica children merely on the basis of high soil ingestion. The reanalysis indicates a mean soil ingestion rate of 91mg/d, and a 90 th percentile of 143mg/d. Davis et al. (1990), in Ca labrese's laboratory, incl uded an evaluation of food, medicine, and house dust as a better approxim ation of a total mass balance. As with the earlier studies, using titanium as the tr acer results in estimates of large soil ingestion rates, while Al and Si tracers re sulted in a narrower range of soil ingestion rates. However, Ti is problematic because of its variability in food, Al is difficult to control since it is the third most ab undant soil mineral and present in many household products, and Si is widespread and an essential trace element for plants and animals (although apparently not for humans ). This illustrates the difficulty of using mineral tracers to calculate mass bal ance and soil ingestion, but trace studies provide the most quanti tative estimates. Calabrese et al. (1989) based estimates of soil ingestion rate in children in a home and university daycare setting on measurements of eight tracer elements (aluminum, barium, manganese, silicon, titanium, vanadi um, yttrium, and zirconium). The study population consisted of 64 children between one and four years old in Amherst, Massachusetts. They used a method similar to Binder et al. (1986) but included an Appendix B 261 somewhat qualitative nature, but some studies include specif ic activities relevant to outdoor lifestyles.

(1989) based estimates of soil ingestion rate in children in a home and university daycare setting on measurements of eight tracer elements (aluminum, barium, manganese, silicon, titanium, vanadi um, yttrium, and zirconium). The study population consisted of 64 children between one and four years old in Amherst, Massachusetts. They used a method similar to Binder et al. (1986) but included an Appendix B 262 improved mass balance approach. They ev aluated soil ingestion over eight days rather than three days, and collected duplic ate samples of food, medicine, and house dust. In addition, the children used tr acer-free toothpaste and ointment. The adult (n = 6) validation portion of the study indicated that study methodology could adequately detect soil ingestion at rates expec ted by children. Recovery data from the adult study indicated that Al, Si, Y, and Zr had the best recoveries (closest to 100%). Zirconium as a tracer was highly va riable, and Ti was not reliable in the adult studies. The investigators conclude that Al , Si, and Y are the most reliable tracers for soil ingestion. This was also the first study to evaluate whether pica children were present in the sampled population; one diagnosed pica child was found. Stanek and Calabrese (1995a) adjusted their 1989 data fo r the 64 children. The primary adjustment was related to inte stinal transit time , which allowed an adjustment for clearance of minerals on days when fecal samples were not collected. They concluded that daily inta ke based on the \"overall\" multi-tracer estimates is 45mg/day or less for 50% of the children and 208mg/day or less for 95% of the children. When extended to an annual estimate, the range of average daily soil ingestion in the 64 children wa s 1-2268mg/d; the median (lognormal) was 75mg/d, the 90th percentile was and the 95th percentile was 1751mg/d. The known pica child was not included, and individual \"outlier\" results for individual tracers were also omitted. Even so, the range of rates is so large that it is evident that there are still methodol ogical difficulties. Stanek and Calabrese (1995a) also evaluat ed the number of days a child might have excessive soil ingestion events. An es timated 16% of children are predicted to ingest more than 1 gram of soil per day on 35-40 days of the year. In addition, 1.6% would be expected to ingest more than 10 grams per day for 35-40 days per year. Stanek and Calabrese (1995b) published a separate rean alysis combining the data from their 1989 study with data from Davis et al. ( 1990) and using a different methodology. This methodology, the Best Tracer Method (BTM), is designed to overcome intertracer inconsistencies in t he estimation of soil ingestion rates. The two data sets were combined, with estimates as follows: 50 th percentile = 37mg/d, 90th = 217mg/d, 99th = 535mg/d, mean = 104mg/d 758. Even with this method, they conclude that the lar ge standard deviation indica tes that there are still large problems with \"input-output misalig nment.\" They also write that soil ingestion cannot even be detected, in comparison to food, unless more than 200mg/d is ingested, rather than at the lower rates they indicated in 1989. Stanek et al. (2000) conducted a sec ond study of 64 children aged 1-4 at a Superfund site in Montana, using the same methods from thei r earlier study, with three additional tracers. Soil, food, and feca l samples were collected for a total mass balance estimate. The home or daycare setti ngs were not described, nor were the community conditions or the typical daily ac tivities of the children, and 32% of the soil ingestion estimates were excluded as out liers. In addition, only soil with a grain size of 250\u00b5m or less was used; no expl anation of concentration differences Appendix B 262 improved mass balance approach. They ev aluated soil ingestion over eight days rather than three days, and collected duplic ate samples of food, medicine, and house dust.

In addition, only soil with a grain size of 250\u00b5m or less was used; no expl anation of concentration differences Appendix B 263 between large and small grain sizes were given (see discussion on dermal adherence), and no concentration data were included. B.4.2 Studies in Adults Only a few soil ingestion studies in adul ts have been done because the attention has been focused on children, who are known to ingest more soil and are more vulnerable to toxicity of contaminants. Stanek, Calabrese, and co-authors (1997) conducted a second adult pilot study (n = 10 ) to compare tracers. This study was done as a method validation, and was \"not designed to estimate the amount of soil normally ingested by adults.\" Each adult was followed for 4 weeks. The median, 75th percentile, and 95th percentile soil ingestion estima tes were 1, 49, and 331mg/day, with estimates calculated as the median of the three trace elements Al, Si, and Y. B.5 STUDIES IN INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS Studies of soil ingestion in indigenous populations have largely centered on estimates of past exposure (or dose recons truction) of populat ions affected by atomic bomb tests, such as the Marsha ll Islands (tropical island) and Maralinga (Australian desert) evaluations. Haywood and Smith (1992) eval uated potential doses to abor iginal inhabitants of the Maralinga and Emu areas of South Australia , where nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in widespread residual radioactive contamination. Annual doses to individuals following an aboriginal lifestyle could result in annual effective dose equivalents of several mSv within c ontours enclosing areas of several hundred square kilometers. The most signific ant dose pathways are inhalation of resuspended dust and ingestion of soil by in fants. Haywood and Sm ith constructed a table showing hours per week spent sleeping, sitting, hunting or driving, cooking or butchering, and other activities. The aut hors state that in this climate virtually all food, whether of local origin or purchased, has some dust content by the time of consumption due to me thods of preparation and the nature of the environment. A total soil intake in the region of 1gpd was estimated based on fecal samples of nonaboriginals during field trips. This must be regarded as a low estimate of soil ingestion by aboriginals under camp conditions. In the absence of better information, a soil intake of 10gpd has been assumed in the assessment for all age groups. They noted a \"very high occurrence of cuts and scratches with a high percentage being classified as dirty...puncture w ounds on the feet were frequent.\" The Marshall Island indigenous peoples have also been studied. In a study of the gastrointestinal absorption of plutonium , Sun and Meinhold (1997) assumed a soil ingestion rate of 500mg/d. This was based on the primary work of Haywood and Smith who \"reported an average soil intake of 10,000mg/d in dose assessments for Appendix B 263 between large and small grain sizes were given (see discussion on dermal adherence), and no concentration data were included. B.4.2 Studies in Adults Only a few soil ingestion studies in adul ts have been done because the attention has been focused on children, who are known to ingest more soil and are more vulnerable to toxicity of contaminants.

In a study of the gastrointestinal absorption of plutonium , Sun and Meinhold (1997) assumed a soil ingestion rate of 500mg/d. This was based on the primary work of Haywood and Smith who \"reported an average soil intake of 10,000mg/d in dose assessments for Appendix B 264 the Emu and Maralinga nuclear weapons test ing sites in Australia.\" The authors state that: Haywood and Smith specific ally discussed the effects of lifestyle on plutonium ingestion for the Australian aborigin al people: an average soil intake of 1,000mg/d was established from the feca l samples of the investigators who made field trips to the affected areas. It is difficult to quantitatively compar e the amount of soil ingested by the Marshall Islanders and the Aboriginal people because of their different lifestyles. However, both societies liv e in close contact with their natural environment, although the Australian aborig inal people are nomadic, while the Marshallese have a lifestyle nearly like to that of industrial nations. LaGoy (1987) reported a maximum intake of 500mg/d for adults in developed nations who do not exhibit habitual pica. This value, then, was taken to be a reasonably conservative average for the Marshallese people. Therefore, this work adopts 500mg/d as the average lif e-time intake of soil by the Marshallese. Simon (1998) reviewed soil ingestion st udies from a perspective of risk and dose assessment. Certain lifestyles, occupations, and living conditions will likely put different individuals or different groups at risk to inadvertent soil ingestion. Because of their high dependence on the land, indi genous peoples are at highest risk for inadvertent ingestion, along with professions that may bring workers into close and continual contact with the soil. Most of the studies that Simon reviewed were related to geophagia (intentional soil ingestion; see below), which is relatively common worldwide. Simon recommends using a soil ingestion rate for indigenous people in hunting/food gathering/nomadic societies of 1g/d in wet climates and 2g/d in dry climates. He recommends using 3g/d fo r all indigenous child ren. Geophagia is assumed not to occur; if geophagia is common, Simon recommends using 5g/d. These are all geometric means (lognormal) or modes (triangular distribution), not maxima. These estimates are supported by studies of human coprolites from archaeological sites. For instance, Nelson (1999) noted th at human coprolites from a desert spring- fed aquatic system included obsidian chips (p ossibly from sharpening points with the teeth), grit (pumice and quartzite grains from gri nding seeds and roots), and sand (from mussel and roots consumption). Her conclusions are based on finding grit in the same coprolites as seeds, and sand in the same coprolites as mussels and roots. She concludes that \"t he presence of sand in coprolit es containing aquatic root fibers suggests that the roots were not we ll-cleaned prior to cons umption. Charcoal was present in every coprolite examined.\" B.6 GEOPHAGIA Despite the limited awarene ss of geophagia in western countries, the deliberate consumption of dirt, usually clay, has been recorded in every region of the world Appendix B 264 the Emu and Maralinga nuclear weapons test ing sites in Australia.\" The authors state that: Haywood and Smith specific ally discussed the effects of lifestyle on plutonium ingestion for the Australian aborigin al people: an average soil intake of 1,000mg/d was established from the feca l samples of the investigators who made field trips to the affected areas.

Most of the studies that Simon reviewed were related to geophagia (intentional soil ingestion; see below), which is relatively common worldwide. Simon recommends using a soil ingestion rate for indigenous people in hunting/food gathering/nomadic societies of 1g/d in wet climates and 2g/d in dry climates. He recommends using 3g/d fo r all indigenous child ren. Geophagia is assumed not to occur; if geophagia is common, Simon recommends using 5g/d. These are all geometric means (lognormal) or modes (triangular distribution), not maxima. These estimates are supported by studies of human coprolites from archaeological sites. For instance, Nelson (1999) noted th at human coprolites from a desert spring- fed aquatic system included obsidian chips (p ossibly from sharpening points with the teeth), grit (pumice and quartzite grains from gri nding seeds and roots), and sand (from mussel and roots consumption). Her conclusions are based on finding grit in the same coprolites as seeds, and sand in the same coprolites as mussels and roots. She concludes that \"t he presence of sand in coprolit es containing aquatic root fibers suggests that the roots were not we ll-cleaned prior to cons umption. Charcoal was present in every coprolite examined.\" B.6 GEOPHAGIA Despite the limited awarene ss of geophagia in western countries, the deliberate consumption of dirt, usually clay, has been recorded in every region of the world Appendix B 265 both as idiosyncratic behavior of isolated in dividuals and as culturally prescribed behavior (Abrahams 1997, Callahan 2003, Johns and Duquette 1991, Reid 1992) . It also routinely occurs in primat es (Krishnamani and Mahaney 2000). I ndigenous peoples have routinely used montmorillonite clays in food preparation to remove toxins (e.g., in acorn breads) and as condime nts or spices (in the Philippines, New Guinea, Costa Rica, Guatemal a, the Amazon and Orinoco basins of South America). Clays are also often used in medications (e.g ., kaolin clay in Kaopectate). But the most common occasion for eating dirt in many societies, especially kaolin and montmorillonite clays in amounts of 30g to 50g a day, is pregnancy. In some cultures, well-established trade routes and clay traders make rural clays available for geophagy even in urban settings. Clays from termite mounds are especially popular among traded clays, perhaps because they ar e rich in calcium (Callahan 2003, Johns and Duquette 1991 ). There are two types of edible clays, sodium and calcium montmorillonite10. Sodium montmorillonite is commonly known as bentonite; the name is derived from the location of the first commercial deposit mined at Fort Benton, Wyoming, USA. Bentonite principally c onsists of sodium montmorillonite in combination with 10 to 20% of various mi neral impurities such as feldspars, calcite, silica, gypsum, and others. Ca lcium montmorillonite, the second type of montmorillonite, is also known as \"liv ing clay\" for it principally consists of nutritionally essential minerals. Geophagia has long been viewed as pathol ogical by the Western medical profession. However, this practice is so widespread and physiologically significant that is presumed to be important in the evolution of human dietary behavior due to its antidiarrheal, detoxification, and mineral supplementation potentials (Reid 1992, Krishnamani and Mahaney 2000). Krishnamani and Mahaney (2000) propose seve ral hypotheses that may contribute to the prevalence of geophagy: 1. Soils adsorb toxins. 2. Soil ingestion has an antacid action. 3. Soils act as an antidiarrheal agent. 4. Soils counteract the effects of endoparasites. 5. Geophagy may satiate olfactory senses. 6. Soils supplement nutrient-poor diets. Some clays release calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, or zinc in amounts of nutritional significance (Johns and Duquette 1991). This is especially important in pregnancy and at high altitudes. Several studies of geophagia in pregnancy have been done. In countries such as Uganda, where modern pharmaceuticals are either unobtainable or prohibitively expensive, ingested soils may be very important as a mineral supplement, 10 http://www.the-vu.com/edible_clay.htm Appendix B 265 both as idiosyncratic behavior of isolated in dividuals and as culturally prescribed behavior (Abrahams 1997, Callahan 2003, Johns and Duquette 1991, Reid 1992) .

Soils act as an antidiarrheal agent. 4. Soils counteract the effects of endoparasites. 5. Geophagy may satiate olfactory senses. 6. Soils supplement nutrient-poor diets. Some clays release calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, or zinc in amounts of nutritional significance (Johns and Duquette 1991). This is especially important in pregnancy and at high altitudes. Several studies of geophagia in pregnancy have been done. In countries such as Uganda, where modern pharmaceuticals are either unobtainable or prohibitively expensive, ingested soils may be very important as a mineral supplement, 10 http://www.the-vu.com/edible_clay.htm Appendix B 266 particularly iron and calcium during pr egnancy (Abrahams 1997). One widely held theory suggests that iron deficie ncy is a major cause of geophagia11. Several reports have described an extreme form of geophagy (pica) in individuals with documented iron deficiency, although t here has been uncertainty as to whether the iron deficiency was a cause of pica or a result of it. Because some substances, such as clay, are believed to block the absorption of iron into the bloodstream, it was thought that low blood levels of iron could be the di rect result of pica. Some studies have shown that pica cravings in indivi duals with iron deficiency stop once iron supplements are given to correct the def iciency, suggesting that iron deficiency induces pica (and other) cravings during preg nancy. In addition, low blood levels of iron commonly occur in pregnant women and those with poor nutrition, two populations at higher risk for pica. Edwards et al. (1994) studi ed 553 African American wom en who were admitted to prenatal clinics in Washington, D.C. Seru m ferritin concentrations of pica women were significantly lower during the sec ond and third trimesters of pregnancy; the average values for three trimesters of pregnancy for both ferritin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were significantly lower in pica women than their nonpica counterparts. Although not significantly di fferent, the iron (66 vs. 84% RDA) and calcium (60 vs. 75% RDA) contents of the diets of pica women were less than those of nonpica women. Again, low ferritin and hemoglobin are hypothesized to result in pica. A further hypothesis is presented by Call ahan (2003). Regular c onsumption of soil might boost the mother's secr etory immune system. Monkeys that regularly eat dirt have lower parasite loads. In some cultur es, clays are baked before they are eaten, which could boost immunity from previous exposures. For decades aluminum salts, like those found in clays, have been used as adjuvants in human and animal vaccines. Adjuvants are compounds that nons pecifically amplify immune response. Aluminum compounds make effective adj uvants because they are relatively nontoxic; the charged surfaces of aluminum salts absorb large numbers of organic molecules. Note that Al was one of Ca labrese's preferred tracers due to the assumption that it is inert at trace leve ls and not adsorbed (it is quite toxic at high levels). B.7 ACUTE SOIL INGESTION AND PICA There is a gradient between geophagy and pica, and there is not a clear distinction between the conditions. Pica is an obsessi ve-compulsive eating disorder typically defined as the persistent eating of nonnutritive substances for a period of at least 1 month at an age in which this behavio r is developmentally inappropriate. The definition also includes the mouthing of nonnutritive substances. Individuals presenting with pica have been reported to mouth and/or ingest a wide variety of nonfood substances, including, but not limited to, clay, dirt, sand, stones, pebbles, hair, feces, lead, laundry star ch, vinyl gloves, plastic, p encil erasers, ice, fingernails, 11 http://www.ehendrick.org/healthy/001609.htm Appendix B 266 particularly iron and calcium during pr egnancy (Abrahams 1997).

Pica is generally thought of as a pediatric condition, but pica diagnoses include psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, developmental di sorders including autism, and conditions with mental retardation. T hese conditions are not characterized by iron deficiency, which supports a psychologic al component in the cause of pica. Pica is seen more in young children t han adults; 10-32% of children aged 1 to 6 may exhibit pica behavior at some point12. LaGoy (1987) estimated that a value of 5gpd is a reasonable maximum single-day ex posure for a child with habitual pica. In June 2000, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry appointed a committee to review soil pi ca. The committee settled on a threshold of pathological levels as consumption of more than 5000m g of soil per day but cautioned that the amount selected was arbitrary13. With this criterion, studies in the literature estimate that between 10 and 50% of children may exhi bit pica behavior at some point. While this threshold may be appropriate in relatively clean suburban settings, it may not be appropriate for defining the pica thres hold in rural settings where average soil ingestion is likely to be higher. The occurrence of pica has been discussed with respect to risk assessment, especially for acute exposures. Calabres e et al. (1997) recognized that some children have been observed to ingest up to 25-60g soil during a single day. When a set of 13 chemicals were evaluated for ac ute exposures with a pica exposure rate, four of these chemicals w ould have caused a dose approxi mating or exceeding the acute human lethal dose. Regulatory guidance recommends 5 or 10g/d fo r pica children. Some examples are: 1. EPA (1997) recommends a value of 10g/d for a pica child. 2. Florida recommends 10g per event for acute toxicity evaluation 14. 3. ATSDR uses 5g/day for a pica child15.

Appendix B 268 body of literature is not typically used to estimate a quantitative contribution to soil ingestion, it can give relative estimates of soil contact rates between activities. Two relevant papers from Kissel's laborat ory are summarized her e. Kissel et al. (1996) included reed gatherers in tide flats. The category of \"kids in mud\" at a lakeshore had by far the highest skin loadings, with an average of 35mg/cm2 for 6 children and an average of 58mg/cm2 for another 6 children. Reed gatherers were next highest at 0.66mg/cm2 with an upper bound of >1mg/cm2. This was followed by farmers and rugby players (approximately 0.4mg/cm2) and irrigation installers (0.2mg/cm2). Holmes et al. (1999) studied 99 individuals in a variety of occupations. Farmers, reed gatherers, and kids in mud had the highest overall skin loadings, up to 27mg/cm2. The next highest skin loadings on the hands were for equipment operators, gardeners, c onstruction, and utility workers (0.3mg/cm2), followed by archaeologists, and several other occupations (0.15-0.1mg/cm2). The higher skin loadings of reed gatherers, farmers, and gardeners are supporting evidence that these activities also have higher than average soil ingestion rates. One factor that has not received enough att ention is the grain size of adhering and ingested soil. Stanek and Cala brese (2000) said that variability in estimating soil ingestion rates using tracer elements wa s reduced when grain sizes of less than 250\u00b5m were excluded in order to reduce va riability. Driver et al. (1989) found statistically significant increases in ski n adherence with decreasing particle size, with particles above the sand-silt size di vision (0.075mm) adhering less than smaller sizes. Average adherences of 1.40mg/cm2 for particle sizes less than 150\u00b5m, 0.95mg/cm2 for particle sizes less than 250\u00b5m, and 0.58mg/cm2 for unsieved soils were measured (see EPA 199216 for more details). Soil samples should be sieved and concentrations should be evaluated for sizes below 0.075mm. A consideration of grain size could affect the estimation of soil ingestion rates because the mineral and organic composition within a particular soil sample can vary with particle size and pore size. If soil adherence studies are conducted in a manner wherein sand is brushed off the hands while smaller grain sizes remain adhered, then tracer ratios could be altered, and would be different from the original unsieved soil. Soil loading on various parts of the body is collected with wipes, tape, or rinsing in dilute solvents, which w ould generally collect the smaller particle sizes17. Soil adherence rate is correlated to gr ain size; soil samples must be sieved, and data for particle size <0.044cm (RAGSe, App. C, Table C-4) should be used for dose estimation. Inhalation is also related to particle size, so the dust resuspension estimate must also include particle size. 16 EPA (1992). Interim Report: Dermal Exposure Assessment: Principles And Applications. Office of Health and Environmental Assessmen t, Exposure Assessment Group. /600/8-91/011B 17 Soils are classified according to grain size (1mm = Very coarse sand; 0.5mm = Coarse Medium fine sand; = Silt; <0.002mm = Clay).

Appendix B 269 B.9 DATA FROM WASHED OR UNWASHED VEGETABLES Direct soil ingestion also occurs via food, for example from dust blowing onto food (Hinton 1992), residual soil on garden produc e or gathered native plants, particles on cooking utensils, and so on. However, t here is very little quantitative data about soil on vegetation as-gathered, as-prepared, or as-eaten, which is a separate issue from root uptake of soil contaminants in to edible materials. However, there is information on interception rate of dust particles deposited onto leafy surfaces, and information on soil ingestion by pasture animals. For example, Beresford and Howard (1991) found that soil adhesion to vegetation was highly seasonal, being highest in autumn and winter, and is an import ant source of radi onuclides for grazing animals. Palacios et al. (2002) evaluated l ead levels in the aerial part of herbage near a Superfund site. A water washing pr e-treatment of the vegetal samples considerably diminished the concentration of lead. Kissel et al. (2003) evaluated concentrations of arsenic and lead in rinsed, washed, or peeled garden vegetables. He found that concentrations of lead and arsenic in washed or peeled potatoes or lettuce were generally lower, as expected, although the concentration of lead in peeled potatoes was higher than in rinsed or washed potatoes. B.10 SUBSISTENCE LIFESTYLES AND RATIONALE FOR SOIL INGESTION RATE The derivation of the soil ingestion rate is based on the following points: The foraging-subsistence lifestyle is lived in close contact with the environment. Columbia Plateau winds and dust storms are fairly frequent, and incorporated into overall rate, rather than trying to segregate inges tion rates according to number of high-wind days per year, becaus e low-wind days are also spent in foraging activities. The original Columbia Plateau lifest yle\u2014pit houses, caches, gathering tules and roots\u2014includes processing and using foods, medicines, and materials. This is considered but not as part of today's living conditions. An average house is assumed to have li ttle landscaping other than the natural conditions or xeriscaping, some naturally bare soil, a gravel driveway, no air conditioning (more open windows), and a wood burning stove in the winter for heat. All persons participate in day-long outdoor group cultural activities at least once a month, such as powwows, horse races, and seasonal ceremonial, as well as private family, cultural activi ties. These activities tend to be large gatherings with a greater rate of dust re suspension and particulate inhalation. These are considered to be 1-gram events or greater.

These activities tend to be large gatherings with a greater rate of dust re suspension and particulate inhalation. These are considered to be 1-gram events or greater. Appendix B 270 400mg/d is based on the following: 1. 400mg/d is the upper bound for subur ban children (EPA); traditional or subsistence activities are not suburban in environs or activities. 2. This rate is within the range of out door activity rates for adults (between 330 and 480); the soil contact levels of subsistence activities are more like those of construction, utilit y work, or military activity . However, the rate is lower than 480 to allow for some low- contact days. The consideration of the number of windy-dusty days does not further quantify air particulates. 3. The low soil-contact days are balanced with many 1-gram days and events (as suggested by Boyd et al. 1999), such as root gathering days, tule and wapato gathering days, po wwows, rodeos, horse training and riding days, sweat-lodge building or r epair days, grave digging, and similar activities. There are also likely to be many high or intermediate-contact days, depending on the occupation (e.g., wildlife field work, construction or road work, cultural resource field work). 4. This rate is lower than Simon's (1998) estimate of 500mg/d and lower than the recommendations of 3g/d for i ndigenous children and 2g/d for indigenous adults in arid environments. It is also lower than the 5 or 10 grams he estimated for purely aboriginal lifestyles. For original housing conditions, a higher rate would be cl early justified; for today's housing conditions, a lower rate is adequate. 5. This rate does not account for pica or geophagy 6. Primary data is supported by dermal adherence data in gatherers and kids in mud . Tule and wapato gathering are kid-in-mud activities 7. This rate includes a consideration of residual soil on roots (a major food category) through observation and anec dote, but there is no quantitative data. B.11 REFERENCES Abrahams, P.W.

This rate is within the range of out door activity rates for adults (between 330 and 480); the soil contact levels of subsistence activities are more like those of construction, utilit y work, or military activity . However, the rate is lower than 480 to allow for some low- contact days. The consideration of the number of windy-dusty days does not further quantify air particulates. 3. The low soil-contact days are balanced with many 1-gram days and events (as suggested by Boyd et al. 1999), such as root gathering days, tule and wapato gathering days, po wwows, rodeos, horse training and riding days, sweat-lodge building or r epair days, grave digging, and similar activities. There are also likely to be many high or intermediate-contact days, depending on the occupation (e.g., wildlife field work, construction or road work, cultural resource field work). 4. This rate is lower than Simon's (1998) estimate of 500mg/d and lower than the recommendations of 3g/d for i ndigenous children and 2g/d for indigenous adults in arid environments. It is also lower than the 5 or 10 grams he estimated for purely aboriginal lifestyles. For original housing conditions, a higher rate would be cl early justified; for today's housing conditions, a lower rate is adequate. 5. This rate does not account for pica or geophagy 6.
