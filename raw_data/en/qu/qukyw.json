Since then, Shionogi has grown into a major pharmaceutical manufacturer on the back of key accomplishments along the way - the proprietary development of Shinomin , a sulfonamide drug; the in-house , the world's rst oxacephem antibiotic; and the success of blockbuster drug Crestor , a hyperlipidemia treatment. Growth has been driven by the Japanese market, but more recently, Shionogi has made a full-scale push into the US market, starting with the acquisition of US-based drug company Sciele Pharma, Inc. However, business performance deteriorated rapidly not long after the acquisition due to the global nancial crisis triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a series of failures in drug development, ending the prospects of several promising new drugs. Crestor , which had been driving earnings, also faced its patent expiry - one of the inevitable challenges of operating in the pharmaceutical sector. Shionogi then had to develop strategies to overcome the so-called \" Crestor Cliff\" to ensure the Group's sustained and steady growth. Sciele Pharma acquisition and disruption in US business On September 1, 2008, Shionogi acquired US-based drug company Sciele Pharma, Inc. for roughly \u00a5150 billion to support a full-scale push into the US market. However, barely two weeks after signing the deal, the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the global nancial crisis. Business conditions deteriorated rapidly and Shionogi's share price slumped. In addition, two new drugs that were to be sold via Sciele Pharma dropped out in the nal stages of development. All the time and cost expended on the drugs disappeared in an instant, leaving a gap of at least two years in the pipeline before the next drug candidate would be ready for approval. Meanwhile, some drugs sold by Sciele Pharma were approaching patent expiry and the company faced a string of operational issues related to product quality and supply, shaking the condence of the company's employees. However, Shionogi's president was unwavering in his belief that overseas markets offered the best business opportunities for the Group. The Company had taken a long time to build up its overseas sales network and there was no desire to step back now. When Shionogi launched proprietary drug Crestor , there was no option but to out-license it to UK-based AstraZeneca PLC due to a lack of overseas sales channels, so overseas revenue from Crestor was limited to royalty income. In an effort to change that situation, Shionogi decided to acquire Sciele Pharma, but the large acquisition completely changed Shionogi's nancial position after being almost debt-free. Between around 2008 and 2011, Shionogi faced sustained challenges at the operational level in the wake of the Sciele Pharma acquisition, but the Company also learned a great deal during that period as it worked to put the US business on an even footing. The US business had operated at a loss until recently and is steadily moving in the right direction.Turning point I : Learning Fiscal 2008-2011Shionogi's efforts to create sustainable corporate value-Three key phases of business risk unique to the pharmaceutical sector (FY2008\u0097 )- Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 04Handling the Crestor patent expiry Crestor became a blockbuster drug in Japan and overseas. In scal 2013, its peak year, Crestor generated royalty income of \u00a565.7 billion on the back of strong sales overseas, driving Shionogi's earnings. However, patent expiry was fast-approaching. Drug developers face the so-called \"patent cliff,\" when the end of patent protection for individual products can lead to a precipitous drop in prots. Products that generate royalty income face an even steeper patent cliff because out-licensed drugs are usually more protable due to lower costs. Facing the loss of more than \u00a560 billion in operating income in just a couple of years, Shionogi needed to do something to take the situation into its own hands, rather than awaiting a fate tied to conditions at another drug company. In 2013, just three years before the Crestor patent expiry, Shionogi and UK partner AstraZeneca PLC agreed to modify the terms of the Crestor royalty agreement, lowering the effective royalty rate in return for extending the period of royalty payments until 2023 at the latest. While the new agreement brought forward the Crestor Cliff - the biggest issue for management at the time - it ensured Shionogi would continue to receive royalty income from the drug even after the patent expired, providing a source of income to support growth over the medium and long term. Anti-HIV agent Tivicay - a new growth driver While efforts were being made to modify the royalty agreement for Crestor , Shionogi was also making steady progress with the development of a next-generation of strategic products. One of those drugs was anti-HIV Tivicay (dolutegravir), Ltd. Tivicay and combination drug Triumeq became blockbuster drugs, together generating global sales of \u00a31.3 billion in 2015, the third year since launch. Despite the phased but large reduction in royalty income from Crestor , Shionogi's total royalty income grew to \u00a5114.9 billion in scal 2016. The revenue sharing agreement for Tivicay was initially based on the joint development of the drug by Shionogi and ViiV Healthcare, but the agreement was modied in 2012. Shionogi agreed to transfer the commercial rights for Tivicay and related products to ViiV Healthcare in exchange for a 10% stake in ViiV Healthcare. As a result, Shionogi started receiving dividend payments as a shareholder in the company, as well as royalty income for Tivicay . Dividends increased as ViiV Healthcare's earnings grew, with dividends received by Shionogi exceeding \u00a510 billion in scal 2015. The changes to Crestor and Tivicay royalty agreements enabled Shionogi to comfortably overcome the Crestor Cliff. Updates to SGS2020 The strong growth in earnings after the Crestor Cliff gave our employees' condence, but there were also signs of a drop in intensity. The modied royalty agreements did not reinforce our underlying business; they had merely shifted the main source of royalty income from Crestor to the HIV franchise of dolutegravir-based drugs. Despite that, there was a growing sense of complacency within the Company that we had beaten the Crestor Cliff by increasing prots. At the same time, changes in society and our business environment converged, prompting us to update the Medium-Term Business Plan (SGS2020) in October 2016 in order to sustain growth after 2020. Under the updated plan, we have channeled business resources into areas where Shionogi has a strong position, aiming to grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare and helping to solve social issues. We are now in the nal stages of the plan. Based on a shared sense of urgency, every employee is working together to achieve the plan's targets and laying the foundations for the next phase of growth from 2020, which will mean overcoming the \"dolutegravir cliff\" in about a decade.Turning point II : Confidence and Pride Fiscal 2012-2015 Turning point III : From Complacency to Revival Fiscal 2016-2011 2022 2019 2017 2015 2013 (FY)Generating stable prots to support medium- and long-term growth Crestor Cliff assumption in Third Medium-Term Business Plan Revised royalty agreements for Cresto r and anti-HIV agents help overcome Crestor Cliff Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 05Grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcareVisionBasic Strategy in Updated SGS2020 Addressing society's needsFocusing on Japan and the US Strengthening bases in Europe and AsiaGrowth Regions and Areas Keys to Growth Infectious diseases, pain / CNS disordersBalancing innovation and healthcare affordabilityMedium-Term Business Plan SGS2020 (2014-2020) Grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare In March 2014, we launched Shionogi Growth Strategy 2020 (SGS2020), which set out our medium-term vision for Shionogi. We updated the plan in October 2016 to raise our goals even further. Under the plan's vision - Grow sustainably as a drug discov-ery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare - the Group is making a concerted effort to achieve its targets. In this section, we summarize the goals of the plan and the key themes for a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, given the increasing complexity of drug development and continued growth in the generic drug market. Our vision for Shionogi based on two themes 1 2Pharmaceutical companies are focused on drug discovery. That goes without saying, but at Shionogi, our commitment to drug discovery is particularly strong. Shionogi ranks 45th worldwide by sales in the global pharmaceutical market (scal 2016). Many pharmaceutical companies of similar size have diversied their businesses into generic drugs. In contrast, Shionogi's original pipeline ratio is roughly 70%, underscoring our proprietary strengths in drug discovery. Those capabilities are creating a steady stream of new global drugs, such as hyperlipidemia treatment Crestor and anti-HIV agent Tivicay . We are also working to discover new products in-house because it aligns with our corporate policy: \"Shionogi strives constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\" Given those factors, we have declared our commitment to growing as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company. That vision has made our path clearer. We have completely exited the generic drug market, where we had a small presence when SGS2020 was launched, and international investors have welcomed our move to clarify Shionogi's corporate character. In the original SGS2020 plan, announced in early 2014, our vision was to \"Grow as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company.\" In the latest version, which was updated in 2016, we have expanded that vision to include the phrase \"contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare.\" Recently, amid growing public controversy about rising health costs, pharmaceutical companies have faced severe criticism about the high price of some medicines. The public is starting to push back against the argument that high prices are warranted by the revolutionary nature of new drugs. As a drug company, we have to seriously address those concerns. Looking beyond our basic value to society as a drug manufacturer, we have to ask ourselves what kind of value we can create for society through drug discovery. That means looking at ways to solve broader social issues. That approach will also help to increase Shionogi's corporate value - another reason why we added the phrase \"contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare.\"A continued commitment to drug discovery A desire to lgrow sustainably contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare z Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 06Targeting resources on promising growth markets and therapeutic areas 1 2Shionogi has grown its business by focusing on the Japanese market. Under the updated SGS2020 plan, we are accelerating the Group's overseas business expansion. Our priority region is the US, the world's largest pharmaceutical market. The rst objective is to put in place systems that will allow us to develop and sell products as we do in Japan. We have already made some good progress. Shionogi teams in Japan and the US jointly developed proprietary drug Symproic , a treatment for opioid-induced constipation (OIC), and we are developing a new antibacterial drug as part of our response to the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Meanwhile, in Japan's super-aging society, there is a growing need for longer healthy life expectancy. Shionogi is focusing on the therapeutic area of pain / CNS disorders. We are helping to make life better for patients and their families by targeting symptoms that cause a signicant reduction in quality of life (QOL), such as pain and reduced cognitive function caused by certain medical conditions. We are focusing on infectious diseases and pain / CNS disorders as therapeutic areas where we can maximize our strengths in small-molecule drug discovery. Our strong position in infectious disease treatments is well-recognized, to the extent that the Shionogi name is synonymous with antibiotics in Japan, while small-molecule drugs are effective in the treatment of pain and CNS disorders. Those factors are behind our decision to select infectious diseases and pain / CNS disorders as priority areas. Infectious diseases are responsible for a high proportion of deaths worldwide each year and many elderly people in Japan succumb to pneumonia. We are already seeing a number of promising new treatments for infectious diseases from drug makers worldwide, while Shionogi has launched anti-HIV agents and flu drug Xofluza in recent years. Changes in the external environment mean pain / CNS disorders are a globally important treatment area. An increase in average life expectancy has led to a rise in the number of people living with medical conditions, resulting in greater need for medicines that alleviate pain and suffering associated with chronic disease. In this therapeutic area, we are developing drugs to treat cancer pain - a eld where Shionogi already has a strong track record - as well as treatments for depression, Alzheimer's disease and chronic coughing.Focusing on Japan and the US Infectious diseases, pain / CNS disorders Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 07In scal 2018 (April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019), the fth year of our current Medium-Term Business Plan - Shionogi Growth Strategy 2020 (SGS2020), sales increased for the fourth successive year and prots hit another record-high. We achieved the plan's scal 2020 targets for return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC) in scal 2016 and scal 2017, respectively, and they have both risen further since then. In scal 2018, ROE exceeded 20% for the rst time, under-scoring the real progress we have made across our business. In the year under review, we also achieved our scal 2020 target for ordinary income - one of the plan's growth KPIs. As of the end of scal 2018, we are making steady progress against our targets in all areas, except for new product sales and the cash conversion cycle (CCC). In scal 2018, the CCC increased by 2.7 months from the previous scal year, mainly due to a longer inventory turnover period. That reflected a substantial drop in cost of goods sold (COGS) amid a steep decline in sales of Crestor and Irbetan , which both have high COGS ratios, due to the impact of generics. Supported by greater focus on management efciency in all parts of the Group as well as operational improvements, we are targeting an industry-leading CCC of 7.0 months in scal 2020 by working closely with Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd. to rigorously control inventory. During SGS2020, global sales of Tivicay , Triumeq and Juluca are all based on our anti-HIV agent dolutegravir, have continued to increase, driving the Group's growth. We have also signicantly strengthened our ability to develop globally marketable products on the basis of our experience with Xofluza , Symproic and cederocol. Meanwhile, drug candidates from our pipeline are gaining steady momentum as future growth drivers, particularly our eight strategic products. With a solid lineup of new domestic and overseas drugs now in place, the domestic business is poised to move into a new phase of sales growth. However, one issue we still need to tackle is the large shortfall in sales of new products compared with scal 2020 targets. After achieving our target of \u00a5100 billion in scal 2019, we will turn our attention to reaching the targets in SGS2020 by stepping up efforts to reinforce our domestic and overseas businesses. Sustained efforts have led to a signicant improvement in the earnings structure, but during that process there have been many missteps and setbacks. Learning from those mistakes, we now have a clearer picture of three key points on which we need to maintain focus (see below) and the obstacles that stand in the way of the Group's medium- and long-term growth. We have no intention of letting up now as we enter the nal stages of SGS2020.Grow Sustainably as a Drug Discovery-Based Pharmaceutical Company Contributing to a More Vigorous Society Through Improved Healthcare Progress with the SGS2020 Medium-Term Business Plan Net sales \u00a5363.7 billion (Y o Y +5.5%)Operating income \u00a5138.5 billion (Y o Y +20.2%)Ordinary income \u00a5166.6 billion (Y o Y +20.1%)Prot attributable to owners of parent \u00a5132.8 billion (Y o Y +21.9%)Message from the President Increased for 4 consecutive yearsHigher than the levels achieved in prior scal years for 7 consecutive yearsHigher than the levels achieved in prior scal years for 4 consecutive yearsHigher than the levels achieved in prior scal years for 3 consecutive yearsPlease refer to pages 6-7 for more details about SGS2020. More information about Shionogi's performance in scal 2018 can be found on pages 82-83. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 08Continuing to focus on the three key points that dene Shionogi (1) Drive innovation primarily through R&D Supported by our world-class SAR engine for small molecule drug discovery, which allows us to efciently create innovative small-molecule pharmaceuticals, we have successfully launched a stream of competitive, ground-breaking new drugs such as Crestor , Tivicay and Xofluza , despite having signicantly fewer R&D personnel and lower budgets than major global pharma-ceutical companies. Those successes reflect our dogged pursuit of return on invested capital, which is helping us close in on the level of return that a next-generation drug company should be achieving. We consistently achieve a level of productivity in progressing the development of and obtaining approvals for our compounds that is substantially higher than would be expected based on our level of investment in R&D personnel and other resources. This underscores our very high level of R&D efciency compared with other pharmaceutical companies. That overachievement explains our strong reputation in the industry at the moment. Over the next decade, we will strive to create value using new business models, but our overarching aim will be to harness innovation in the pursuit of value, backed by efcient and effective R&D capabilities from product inception through to realization.(2) Balance the needs of four stakeholder groups Shionogi fully understands that companies rely heavily on four main stakeholder groups - shareholders and investors, customers, society and employees. Optimally balancing their needs is crucial to increasing corporate value. When we are unable to satisfy the demands of one of those groups, senior management has a duty to secure their understanding through dialog. We have seen many cases in recent years where companies that failed to build balanced relationships between those four stakeholder groups have suffered precipitous declines in corporate value as a result. At Shionogi, the ethos of our management approach is to ensure balanced relationships with our four stakeholder groups while responding flexibly to any changes in their interests and needs. (3) Pursue efficiency One of Shionogi's characteristics is its robust management structure, which allows us to intensively pursue efciency to achieve our disclosed objectives. By overhauling existing cost structures and approaches, we have been able to achieve an exceptionally high operating margin (38.1% in scal 2018) compared with peers, while also continuing to drive innovation to support growth. That rm commitment to targets and high operating margin are also key characteristics of Shionogi. We intend to continue targeting highly efcient business operations that are resilient to change.*1 Target set on May 9, 2018 *2 New products: New Products were dened in Updates to SGS2020 issued on October 31, 2016 *3 ROIC: Return on invested capital *4 CCC: Cash Conversion CycleFY2020 target FY2019 target FY2018 target *1FY2018 results FY2017 results Sales of new products *2 \u00a5200.0 billion \u00a5100.6 billion \u00a572.1 billion \u00a583.1 billion \u00a552.9 CCC *45.5 months Less than 7.0 months Less than 7.6 months 6.1 months 8.9 months 6.2 months Original pipeline ratioOver 50% Over 50% Over 50% 69% 74% ROE Over Over Shareholder return Please refer to pages 20-29 for more details about how Shionogi drives innovation.More information about R&D activities can be found on pages 76-79.Please refer to pages 70-71 for more details about Shionogi's stakeholder engagement. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 09Tackling three key issues to deliver growth over the longer term To continue growing in the medium and long term, we have to further reinforce our business to prepare for the \"dolutegravir cliff\", when prots from our HIV franchise are expected to decline due to expiration of patents for dolutegravir. During SGS2020, we are stepping up efforts to tackle a number of priority issues that will help us successfully overcome the dolutegravir cliff. We have about a decade to get ready for the cliff. That might seem like a long time, but in the pharmaceu-tical sector, which takes many years to research and develop new drugs, the clock is already ticking. That's why we are now sending quarterly messages to all Group employees and encouraging dialog to foster a shared sense of urgency and raise awareness about the changes that need to be made. In the near term, we expect a steady stream of new products to generate a certain level of growth, supported by stable prots from our HIV franchise. Looking further ahead, we plan to accel-erate global drug development and create a next-generation of growth drivers to take over from dolutegravir. In parallel, we will reinforce the domestic business - our main source of sales - and establish a global presence. However, even if we do succeed in nding new growth drivers to overcome the dolutegravir cliff, the next patent cliff awaits, which is one of the constant risks associated with doing business in the pharmaceutical eld. To mitigate the impact, we have to tackle another issue - create and provide new value across all areas of healthcare, not just pharmaceuticals, to build a stable earnings structure. Discover and develop next-generation growth drivers to take over from dolutegravir I have already highlighted Shionogi's powerful R&D capabilities, which are anchored by a strong commitment to innovation. We have made particularly good progress in recent years thanks to improvements to our drug development infrastructure overseas and a growing track record built up through the global devel-opment of proprietary drugs such as Xofluza , one of our new family of small-molecule drugs. However, there are still many areas we need to improve on, such as carefully selecting and accelerating the development of new drug candidates based on criteria such as marketability and competitiveness versus rival products. For a company of our size to take on the global majors, we need to hone our capabilities in three key areas: drug discovery, development momentum, and business judgment. In drug discovery, we will channel management resources into treatment categories or technologies where we already have a strong position in order to build a pipeline of competitive drug candidates that meet the needs in the society and the healthcare area. Regarding development momentum, we need to rapidly build a body of clinical evidence in strategic development projects to maintain and improve our competitiveness. And in business judgment, we have to be able to make the right decisions about drug candidates from various different perspectives. All three areas must work efciently together if we want to create promising drug candidates and launch commercially competitive products by 2028. Poor R&D productivity is under the spotlight in the pharmaceutical sector. Against that backdrop, we aim to increase our drug development success rate by using the best drug discovery approach for each target therapeutic area. That means trying different drug modalities* 1, particularly peptides, nucleic acids and other so-called middle-sized molecules, as well as small-molecule drugs, one of Shionogi's strengths. We will also continually explore potential business alliances to actively create and cultivate new growth drivers. Reinforce the domestic business and establish a global presence To drive Shionogi's medium- and long-term growth, we will continue to focus on our home market of Japan and the US, the world's largest pharmaceutical market, but we also aim to build up our business in China, which is projected to see the strongest growth in pharmaceutical demand over the next decade. We still need to reinforce our business base in some countries in Europe and the ASEAN region, which is estab-lishing new drug approval systems. However, ensuring we have strong positions in Japan and in the US and tapping into China's growth will be crucial to expanding our sales channels in other regions. We plan to build a solid business base worldwide by reinforcing proprietary sales capabilities and carefully identi-fying regions and therapeutic areas where partnerships are the best approach. In Japan, the activities of Shionogi medical representatives (MRs) have been underpinned by the concept of \"detail & trace\" for more than 60 years - which involves carefully explaining drug safety characteristics, as well as efcacy, and checking whether our products are achieving the intended Issue 1 Discover and develop next-generation growth drivers to take over from dolutegravir Issue 2 Reinforce the domestic business and establish a global presence Issue 3 Create new value and reinforce the business baseThree key issues to deliver longer-term growth Issue 1Issue 2Please refer to pages 20-29 for more details about how Shionogi drives innovation, and pages 76-79 for a more in-depth look at the Group's R&D.*1 Modality is a term used to classify different groups of therapeutic agents based on their physical properties. Modalities include small or middle-sized molecule drugs, protein drugs such as antibody drugs, cell therapies, and regenerative therapies. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 10outcomes for patients. We are backing up that existing approach with IT investment that gives us a clearer picture of MR behavior and upgrading infrastructure so that we can constantly update and share information with MRs about the medical institutions they should visit and the data they should communicate. We are starting to see some solid results from that approach, albeit at a gradual pace. In the US, we plan to rebuild our sales structure centered on Mulpleta , our drug for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure, which was launched in scal 2018, and cederocol, which is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We plan to increase marketing efciency by focusing on hospital/highly specialized businesses, a category into which both drugs t. That approach, together with prots from sales partners that distribute our vaginal atrophy treatment Osphena and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) treatment Symproic , should support a highly efcient business in the US. As one of our outside directors pointed out, if Shionogi fails to build a proprietary sales capability in the US in the next few years, it should consider becoming just an R&D-focused business in the US market. To ensure that does not happen, we will step up efforts to establish our presence in the US, including the launch of new products and the advancement of drug candidates in late-stage development. Create new value and reinforce the business base The current approach to social security provision is under question amid increasingly stretched healthcare budgets in advanced markets. Meanwhile, AI and ICT have opened the door to new ways of doing business in the pharmaceutical sector that were not possible in the past. Those trends mean we can no longer rely on our existing business model based solely on selling pharmaceutical products. Companies from many other sectors have already moved into the healthcare eld and current social welfare systems are set to undergo major changes. As patients gain access to more information and select their own preferred type of healthcare service, a drug could just become one of many options in the healthcare eld. To continue growing over the next 10 to 20 years in that environment, we will need to use our strengths in the creation of innovative drugs to make a sustained contribution to patient treatment and QOL. We will also need to continually search for healthcare areas where our expertise, skills, and experience in R&D can be put to good use in other services. We want to be a company that continues to help extend healthy life expectancy by exploring the possibilities of therapeutic and preventative vaccines, digital treatment option such as healthcare apps, and information services, and by drilling down into the issues that people face in all areas of healthcare, from pre-symptomatic and preventive care through diagnosis and treatment. Drastic and diverse changes in the pharmaceutical sector environment and peoples' lifestyles and values are forcing us to rethink the role that Shionogi should play in the future. Of course, as the President of Shionogi, I have absolutely no intention of letting up on efforts to achieve our targets for scal year 2020, the nal year of SGS2020, which underscores our clear commitment to stakeholders. However, at the same time, we are investing a signicant amount of time talking to stake-holders about the kind of company we want Shionogi to be after 2020, without being limited by existing approaches, and the growth strategies we will need to make that happen. We have identied three major trends in our environment that are likely to have major impact on our business in the future: We are approaching a major turning point in the management strategies we must utilize to effectively navigate our business environment, responding to those major trends, and the initiatives we develop in response have the potential to fundamentally affect the future of the Company. It will be extremely difcult for any single drug company to respond to the changes by itself. Shionogi has to forge alliances both with other pharmaceutical companies and with partners in other industries to complement its strengths and create new platforms in the healthcare eld. If we do not, Shionogi will struggle to adapt and stay competitive. To form alliances, potential partners have to be able to easily identify and have condence in Shionogi's strengths. To ensure Shionogi keeps growing after 2020, we therefore need to reinforce and maximize our strengths and work with partners to create new business platforms. Targeting sustained growth after 2020 (1) Growth in the global population and increasingly aging societies in upper middle-income countries (2) A faster pace of, and greater impact from, climate change and other environmental trends compared with the previ-ous decade, leading to changes in the prevalence of cer-tain diseases and healthcare needs. (3) Revolutionary advances in IT and AIIssue 3 Please refer to page 80 for more details about the domestic business. Please refer to page 81 for more details about our overseas business. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 11The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 and other trends are spurring growing interest in environment, social and governance (ESG) issues worldwide, which is putting more pressure on companies to play a greater role in realizing sustainable societies. As mentioned earlier, we face climate change, a rising global population and aging societies in upper middle income countries. Shionogi needs to address those accelerating environmental and social changes in order to grow sustainably by contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare. We have identied the material issues that matter most to Shionogi (materiality) and disclosed them to stakeholders. The social issues that we strive to address, and driving innovation to help solve those issues, dene our priorities, and we have accordingly highlighted a number of key ESG issues that Shionogi needs to tackle as a public entity. As with our efforts in personnel development, senior managers have to do their part to further strengthen our corporate culture, characterized by the phrase, \"automatically thinking and doing the right thing at all times.\"While partnerships with other companies will be crucial, there is nothing more important than our own people, who are the basis of Shionogi's strengths. Encouraging friendly competition between employees while respecting different values helps to drive various types of innovation. To grow as a company, we have to build an organization that blends knowledge and expertise from various sources by bringing together different people. That means recruiting younger employees who are not wedded to conventional wisdom and xed ideas, and respecting diversity, including people with global values.Based on that thinking, we formulated a Diversity Vision in scal 2018 to ensure that all of our employees are aware of our diversity & inclusion (D&I) initiatives. Through internal and external activities, we are helping employees deepen their understanding of D&I, while also raising awareness about different work practices and other workplace trends. Active efforts by management to promote D&I will be meaningless unless employees are also on board. That's why it will be very important to ensure D&I is incorporated into every aspect of our operations over the next few years. Shionogi has also introduced personnel training programs tailored to a wide range of people, from young employees and mid-career personnel to senior managers. The programs are attended by people from different teams across our organization to stimulate communication and encourage friendly competition. Our goal is to promote diversity and cultivate the next generation of business leaders. The President's Management Seminar, which I have held for seven years, starting in 2012, is another way we are working to train future leaders. My seminar, and the Management Seminars run by division heads, are used to foster the next-generation of business leaders and senior managers from the current manager cohort. To ensure that our senior managers have a full and detailed understanding of the Group's operations, executive ofcers have to work as general managers at a minimum of two divisions, including a division where they have no previous experience, while candidates for senior managerial positions are required to have management experience as the president of a Group company and as a non-executive director or auditor at a Group company. These various initiatives are designed to promote and sustain diversity. Another important part of a manager's job at Shionogi is to identify their successor. At the minimum, the next person to ll a role has to meet two criteria. First, as the manager of a pharmaceutical company, they must have specialist knowledge about pharmaceuticals and a detailed understanding of the pharmaceutical business, as well as a deep attachment to our industry. For a company seeking to form an alliance with Shionogi, it would be inconceivable for them to deal with the president of a pharmaceutical company who has no interest or knowledge in our industry. Second, managerial candidates need to have a vision for Shionogi 10 or 20 years in the future. New drugs take a very long time to develop, so we need to flexibly adapt our research and development strategies in line with projected changes in society, which is in constant flux. Today's business leaders have to be better at envisioning future conditions and incorporating that outlook into business management. That means they need to understand trends in IT and social welfare systems and have detailed knowledge about topics such as advanced economies, emerging economies and climate change. That's the type of person we want to lead Shionogi in the future.

Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 12Reinforcing governance and ensuring compliance are vital to sustaining our business activities in the long term. Shionogi has already taken numerous steps to improve corporate gover-nance. We have put in place systems and set out rules to ensure rapid, bold decision-making processes that are transparent and fair from the perspective of all our stakeholders - from patients and medical professionals to shareholders and investors, communities and employees. Aiming to achieve the highest levels of governance, Shionogi was also one of the rst companies in Japan to appoint outside directors in 2009, the year after I became President, and we have worked to create a more diverse board of directors, including the appointment of the rst female director from within the company in 2015. With compliance, we strive to ensure our staff comply with social norms and behave in an ethical manner as both employees and members of society, in addition to strict compliance with laws, rules and regulations. Our shareholder return policy is designed to maximize corporate value by sharing the benets of medium- to long-term prot growth with shareholders, while also balancing shareholder returns with the need to continue investing in the Group's growth and in strategic business initiatives such as partnerships. For scal 2018, we paid an annual dividend of \u00a594 per share, an increase of \u00a512 from the previous scal year. We have now raised the divided for seven consecutive years. Following on from scal 2017, we also repurchased and cancelled approximately 7.35 million shares of common stock, accounting for 2.3% of total issued shares before cancellation. In recent years, we have held treasury stock equivalent to around 3% of total issued shares, but after a review aimed at enhancing the flexible use of capital resources, we reduced our holding to 1.8% through cancellation. We plan to maintain the ratio at around 2%, aiming to increase corporate value while flexibly deploying capital. Going forward, we will continue to use our shareholder return policy to pass on the benets of Shionogi's growth to shareholders. Everyone at Shionogi is fully committed to achieving the goals of SGS2020 and ensuring that the Group continues to grow after 2020, while also realizing our corporate mission globally: \"To strive constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\" We will work to address various ESG issues as a company that seeks to grow sustainably contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare, and we will strive to help create a sustainable society as a company that provides both corporate value and social value to stakeholders.Governance and compliance Sharing the benefits of growth with shareholders A final wordPlease refer to pages 60-69 for details about corporate governance and pages 74-75 for more information on compliance.

Main guidelines used as reference Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), GRI, ISO 26000, SASB We conducted hearings with investors, experts and other external stakeholders and with related internal departments to conrm the suitability of the materiality map. Material issues were identied after discussions about the suitabil-ity of materiality by the Corporate Executive Committee and the Board of Directors We plan to regularly review material issues in line with revisions to business plans, progress with initiatives and changes in the social environment. Led by the Corporate Strategy Division (Corporate Planning De-partment, Finance & Accounting Department, Corporate Commu-nications Department), Human Resources & Administration De-partment, Corporate Social Responsibility Department and the Government Affairs Department, we created a materiality map to identify and categorize material issues from two perspectives - Im-portance to Society and Relevance to Shionogi's Business. Relevance to Shionogi's Business was assessed based on the updated SGS2020 Medium-Term Business Plan.STEP 1 Select social issues as materiality candidates Conduct hearings with stakeholdersPrioritize social issues Identify material issuesSTEP 2 STEP 3 STEP 4Our vision in the updated SGS2020 Medium-Term Business Plan is \"to grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare.\" To make that vision more tangible, we have carried out a materiality assessment to identify priority issues for the Shionogi Group. To grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare, we have identied and categorized material issues that matter most to Shionogi that provides value to four stakeholder groups - customers, local communities, shareholders and employees. To mark the start of Japan's new Reiwa era, we revisited the basic tenets of our business and identied material issues to help the Group refocus on the importance of growing sustainably contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare. Companies in the pharmaceutical sector and many other industries are grappling with rapid developments in the operating environment. Under those conditions, companies have to work with stakeholders to improve foresight, reduce business risk and harness their strengths to create new business opportunities that drive growth. Given that need, Shionogi has conducted dialogue with shareholders to identify material issues based on the Group's strategic direction, challenges, and demands from society. Shionogi will continue to focus on three priority material issues, while also contributing to the creation of sustainable society and driving the Company's growth by responsibly addressing and stepping up its response to various ESG issues. Based on that approach, Shionogi will make a concerted effort to be a relevant company for all stakeholder groups well into the future.Shionogi Group's material issues (Materiality) Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 16The dialogue process underscored our belief that Shionogi can meet the expectations of all stakeholders by providing value to society by tackling material issues. Going forward, we will disclose concrete initiatives and KPIs related to materiality to further step up our activities.As part of the materiality assessment process, we actively incorporated the views and insights of experts and other stakeholders, as well as internal feedback and hearings, to ensure our material issues reflected society's expectations and demands. During the process and checks on the suitability of materiality, we conducted dialogue with outside specialists about the future direction of our activities, receiving valuable advice based on a broad range of expertise. Our view is that companies should conduct their business activities based on identied material issues in order to contribute to the creation of a sustainable society and develop their businesses in a sustainable way. In this case, Shionogi appears to have used an appropriate process to identify materiality. Shionogi has identied three priority material issues - drive innovation, protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases and create a more vigorous society. All three issues are extremely important for both Japan and the world, making them ideal for materiality. Materiality enables companies to dene strategies that they should focus on, but it should also be linked to concrete actions. In the next phase, materiality should be folded into specic initiatives with KPIs, guiding sustained efforts to resolve the issues. We look forward to seeing Shionogi create value that contributes to society through business activities that address material issues.Dialogue with experts Katsuhiko Kokubu (Left) Professor, Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe UniversityEriko Nashioka (Right) CPA / CPTA, Representative Director, Institute for Environmental Management Accounting Dialogue processFeedback from expertsMateriality MapImportance to Society Very highVery high HighRelevance to Shionogi's BusinessMaterial issues to create new value for customers and society Material issues to realize a sustainable society and support Shionogi's growth Very high Material issues to create new value for customers Improve access to healthcare Supply socially responsible products and services Secure human resources to support growth Respect human rights Reinforce supply chain managementDrive innovation Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases Creating a more vigorous society Create new medicines that take into account economic efciency in healthcare Actively use diverse partnerships Help end suffering from pain Tackle psychological and CNS disorders Support environments for more creative and vigorous lives Create new value in the healthcare eld Address the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) Tackle the world's three major infectious diseases Promote proper use of anti-infectives Protect the environment Strengthen corporate governance Ensure complianceSDGs that Shionogi can help to achieve Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 17The Shionogi Group has identified three priority issues it needs to create new value for customers and society - drive innovation, protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases and create a more vigorous society. Leveraging our strengths as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, we aim to help create a society where people can lead more creative, vigorous and healthy lives. In this section, we look at the Shionogi Group's specific initiatives and outcomes in the three priority areas.Material Issues to Create New Value for Customers and Society Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 18Improve access to healthcare Initiatives to improve access to healthcare P44 Supply socially responsible products and servicesEnsuring quality and safety in products and servicesP46 Measures to stop counterfeit medicines P49 Secure human resources to support growthCultivating human resources to underpin competitivenessP50 Promoting diversity and inclusion P52 Protecting the health and safety of employees P54 Respect human rightsRespecting human rights P55 Ensuring the safety of participants in clinical trialsP55 Reinforce supply chain management Promoting CSR procurement P56 Protect the environmentResponding to climate change P58 Protecting water resources P58 Saving resources and reducing waste P59 Appropriately managing chemical substances P59 Initiatives to protect biodiversity P59 Strengthen corporate governanceEstablishing suitable corporate governance structuresP60 Stakeholder engagement P70 Strengthening risk management P72 Ensure complianceStrict compliance P74 Ensuring high ethical standards and transparency in business activitiesP75 Environmental activities Governance activities Social activities ES GShionogi's Material Issues (Materiality) page Drive innovationCreate new medicines that take into account economic efficiency in healthcareP20 Actively use diverse partnerships P28 Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseasesAddress the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)P30 Tackle the world's three major infectious diseasesP34 Promote proper use of anti-infectives P35 Creating a more vigorous societyHelp end suffering from pain P36 Tackle psychological and CNS disorders P37 Support environments for more creative and vigorous livesP38 Create new value in the healthcare field P40 Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 19Ensuring both innovation and healthcare affordability With many countries now grappling with the issue of a declining birthrate and aging population, the need to balance innovation with sustainable social security has become a fundamental global issue, to the extent of being taken up by the United Nations. The public is starting to push back against the argument that high prices are warranted by the innovative nature of new drugs. In our medium-term business plan, Shionogi Growth Strategy 2020 (SGS2020), we outline a vision of \"to grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare,\" and on that premise we remain committed to supplying drugs that combine efcacy with a reasonable price. In order to facilitate a focus on creating new drugs balancing innovation with affordable healthcare, we have maintained small molecule drug discovery as a key strength while also building on this platform to further strengthen our drug discovery capabilities by expanding into a new modality\u2014that of medium molecule drugs including peptide-based therapies. In addition to being comparatively inexpensive in the manner of small molecule drugs, peptides rival antibody therapeutics in their target specicity (ensuring high potency with relatively few off-target side effects), while also having a molecular property prole enabling access to intracellular targets, which antibody therapeutics can struggle to reach.

To that end, we seek to continue creating new drugs that balance innovation with healthcare affordability, by investing appro-priate sums in R&D and maintaining small molecule drug discovery as a key strength while also diversifying into nonstandard peptide drug discovery and deepening collaboration with all manner of partners including the IT industry, in order to expand into new modalities and acquire entirely new technologies. If we are to meet the needs of both our customers and society as a whole and become a source of new value in the healthcare eld, we think it essential that Shionogi remain committed to innovation, particularly as it applies to R&D. Ryuichi Kiyama, Ph.D. Corporate Ofcer, Vice President for Pharmaceutical Research DivisionDrive innovationMaterial Issues to Create New Value for Customers and Society Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 20Focus on in-house drug discovery Among pharmaceutical companies, some have scanty pipelines and therefore choose to supply patients with drugs licensed in from other companies. At Shionogi, though, we take a different approach. We believe that our job\u2014and indeed our raison d'etre\u2014is to be of use to patients by supplying them with products discovered in our pharmaceu-tical research and progressed right through to the stage of regulatory approval. We accordingly are focused squarely on in-house drug discovery. Over the past 14 years, we have succeeded in bringing seven proprietary drugs to market. Whereas the original pipeline ratio at most pharmaceutical companies is said to be 20-30%, we aspire to a ratio of 50-70%, and as at the end of March 2019, our original pipeline ratio was 69%. Given that our vision is to grow as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, we take pride in this high ratio as we think it is indicative of our strength in in-house drug discovery. While on the one hand Shionogi is strongly committed to in-house drug discovery, on the other hand R&D into new drugs has become increasingly difcult in recent years, demanding massive resources (people, goods, money) and a lot of time. Against this backdrop, we think innovation rests not just on research and development of pipelines originated in-house, but also on collaboration with academic experts and venture companies, as well as other pharmaceutical makers. In scal 2018, Shionogi set a budget of \u00a520 billion for strategic investments geared toward sustainable growth, with which we entered into 10 strategic collaborations. Please refer to page 29 for details of strategic investments Shionogi's strength in small molecule drug discovery Capabilities in drug discovery giving rise to innovative new drugs Shionogi's strength in research stems from our highly efficient SAR engine for small molecule drug discovery. The source of our competitiveness lies in the technological prowess of our medicinal chemistry team (responsible for design and synthesis of small molecule compounds), the pharmacology team (which performs multi-faceted evalu-ation of the compounds thus synthesized), and the safety and pharmacokinetics team, and in our experience in problem-solving via collaboration between the three. Through strong teamwork, we have been able to speedily and efficiently move through the SAR* 1 cycle, giving rise to globally competitive, last-in-class*2 compounds such as the hyperlipidemia treatment Crestor and anti-HIV agent Tivicay , as well as the flu drug Xofluza , with its entirely new mechanism of action. In order to continue discovering competitive new drugs, though, we think it essential to acquire new strengths to augment the base provided by this SAR engine for small molecule drug discovery.Seven proprietary drugs launched over past 14 years Original pipeline ratio (As of March 2019)Crestor Launch: and synthesis of small molecule compounds Multi-faceted evaluation High Speed SAR cycleSafety and pharmacokinetics team Pharmacology teamMedicinal chemistry team *1 SAR: Structure activity relationship *2 Last in class: Unrivaled medicines with clear superiority over others that have the same mechanism of actionTivicay Launch: 2014 Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 21Shionogi's strengths in antibiotic drug discovery Shionogi has been engaged in -lactam antibiotic drug discovery for 30 years now, and we continue to discover new drug candidates. By combining approximately 60 years of antibiotics research with -lactam chemistry, we have created an original platform for drug discovery that still continuously enables us to generate new drugs. In antibiotics research it is important to spend years collecting clinical isolates and analyzing their characteristics. Shionogi has amassed a considerable library of bacteria over the years, and this now constitutes a considerable advantage in our antibiotics drug discovery. Shionogi's independent surveillance for resistant bacteria At Shionogi, we also have spent more than 25 years conducting our own surveillance for resistant bacteria, and the data thus obtained is proving invaluable in promoting antimicrobial stewardship and AMR countermeasures. We also participated in joint surveillance programs with three academic groups* 2. Anti-HIV agent Tivicay leverages Shionogi's strengths in small molecule drug discovery Shionogi's research into anti-HIV agents began in the 1980s. At the time, HIV research had not advanced far, and even if a hit compound was identified, subsequent SAR research tended not to proceed very smoothly. Against this backdrop, Shionogi identified a number of candidate compounds. In the process, we discovered a two-metal binding pharmaco-phore model that later played a role in the discovery of Xofluza as well. In this model, both the metal binding unit and the hydro- phobic unit such as benzyl moiety are important pharmacophores in integrase inhibitory activity. The compounds have inhibitory activity when the metal binding unit chelates with two metal ions coordinated by three acidic residues of the active site of integrase* 3 and the hydro- phobic unit is a certain distance away from the metal binding unit. We had to discontinue development of our first candidate compound owing to concerns about its safety, but then by simultaneously pursuing development of not just one but three candidate compounds, ultimately we succeeded in creating the last-in-class compound dolute-gravir (brand name: Tivicay ). This was the crystallization of a team effort, in which we never gave up no matter how many failures we encountered, and continued aspiring to ever-higher goals. In 2016, Tivicay earned Shionogi the Heroes of Chemistry Award, an award given by the American Chemical Society for innovation in chemistry, and in 2017 we went on to claim the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan Award for Drug Research and Development.1.

Our HIV franchise*1 of dolutegravir-based drugs posted global sales of \u00a34,420 million in scal 2018, and continues to grow.Past and future of Shionogi's R&D into anti-HIV agents While on the one hand people are now living longer with HIV, they must spend a lifetime taking drugs to suppress the virus. There is a need to improve QOL by exposing newly diagnosed HIV patients to fewer drugs at the start of treatment, thereby alleviating side effects and reducing dosing frequency. There is now a mountain of clinical data regarding Tivicay , demonstrating both potent antiviral activity and a high barrier to resistance. Use of Tivicay as the key drug has made it possible to develop two-drug combinations as an alternative to the standard treatment regimen of three or more drugs, resulting in the launch in recent years of Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) and Dovato (dolutegravir + lamivudine). Based on favorable results from Phase III trials, regulatory applications have been submitted in the US and Europe for use of Shionogi's proprietary anti-HIV drug candidate cabotegravir in combination with rilpivirine, as a monthly injectable treatment (long-acting parenteral formulation, or LAP) for HIV. In these trials, patient preference data showed that a majority of partici-pants preferred the LAP over daily therapy. Cabotegravir also is under study for HIV prevention, for which there is clearly a public health need, and as such is expected to offer a new option for both the treatment and prevention of HIV. We believe that Shionogi carries a responsibility to continuously come up with new treatment options as a means of further improving QOL for people living with HIV, while also preparing for the potential emergence of resis-tance to Tivicay . On that premise, we already have discovered a new anti-HIV drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action, and we are furthermore focusing on research into an HIV cure. For Shionogi researchers, the discovery of Tivicay rep- resents a great success story, as Tivicay is highly potent, has not caused any drug-resistant viruses, has few side effects, can be administered without regard to meals, and has almost no drug/drug interactions. Tivicay' s discovery also led to the discovery of Xofluza . Talking to patients at international academic symposia, though, we have been made keenly aware of these patients' grave fears about developing side effects that would force them to discontin-ue medication. This has instilled in us the realization that there is always room for improvement in HIV medications. While it is proving difcult to discover compounds to partner with Tivicay in a single-tablet regimen without affecting Tivicay 's efcacy, we are working as one to discover a suitable partner as expeditiously as possible, by combining the SAR engine for small molecule drug discovery that is our core strength with innovative ideas. In the knowledge that daily pill-taking is a chore for many, we are working also on a long-acting formulation for injection every three months, all the while also persisting in our search for an HIV cure.

This unique discovery triggered the start of internal competition to synthesize a new superior family of compounds, with the commitment of our research team ultimately leading to the creation of Tivicay . This also prompted us to go ahead with research regarding the cap-de-pendent endonuclease enzyme within the influenza virus, based on the idea of similar binding behavior. Our research team, condent that the science in HIV integrase inhibitors could be adapted for cap-dependent endonuclease inhib-itors, took their know-how from Tivicay in a new direction, resulting in the discovery of Xofluza . This illustrates how passing on expertise and internally cultivating both human resources and technology is a key part of our approach to small molecule drug discovery at Shionogi, constituting a solid foundation for our drug discovery platform. Novel flu drug Xofluza has revolutionary mechanism of action Shionogi launched the novel flu drug Xofluza in Japan on March 14, 2018. A cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor originated by Shionogi, Xofluza suppresses the replication of influenza viruses by a mechanism different from existing flu drugs. As Xofluza is an oral tablet requiring only a single dose, it is expected to improve compliance as well as conve-nience, and contribute to improving QOL for patients suffering from influenza. Roche plans to take a leading role in developing and marketing the drug globally, except for Japan and Taiwan. We believe that partnering with Roche will enable us to hasten delivery of Xofluza to patients around the world.

We previously have had peptide drug candidates that were in-licensed from other companies, but now we plan to undertake our own peptide drug discovery research. (1) Use of PDPS drug discovery platform to enhance drug discovery efciency In February 2016, Shionogi entered into a joint research and development agreement with PeptiDream Inc., with a view to utilizing the latter's proprietary Peptide Discovery Platform System (PDPS) to identify nonstandard cyclic peptides against multiple drug discovery targets. Nonstandard peptides are expected to reduce side effects, given their high affinity and selectivity for specific intracel-lular and extracellular targets. In June 2017, Shionogi went on to become the first Japanese company to enter into a non-exclusive license agreement for the use of PDPS. Under this agreement, we have taken on new joint R&D projects with PeptiDream, and accelerated innovation by bringing together the strengths of both companies. (2) PeptiStar Inc., a CMO* 1 specializing in nonstandard peptides Currently, no country in the world is home to a CMO that can stably provide high-quality peptide APIs at low cost. With this in mind, Shionogi, PeptiDream and Sekisui Chemical inked a joint venture accord in August 2017 to establish PeptiStar, Inc. to engage in research and devel-opment, manufacturing, and sales of peptide APIs, in the view that a new CMO possessing specialized technology for peptide therapeutics could help expand the market for these drugs. This joint venture is the world's first CDMO* 2 to engage in research and development and manufacturing of a broad range of peptide APIs, from standard peptide APIs to nonstandard peptide APIs with a cyclic structure incorporating non-natural amino acids, and it aims to provide stable supplies of high-quality peptide APIs at low cost. Japan leads the world in peptide drug discovery, and it is expected that this new venture will bring together expertise and know-how from across Japan to create a CDMO specializing in this area, underpinned by the knowledge and technologies related to nonstandard peptide drugs possessed by PeptiDream. PeptiStar will be capable of manufacturing at least 100 kilograms of peptide APIs annually, more than any other company in Japan. Peptide therapeutics are cheaper to manufacture than antibody drugs, and by commercializing peptide manufacturing we seek to strike a balance between innovation in drug discovery and costs. (3) Using PDCs* 3 to strengthen our presence in the CNS area In January 2019, Shionogi entered into a joint venture agreement with PeptiDream for the discovery and devel-opment of peptide drug conjugates (PDCs). Shionogi is active in drug discovery for CNS indications, and as this technology improves the migration of drugs to the brain, we expect it to add to our strengths in this area.

This joint research aims to establish a new approach to discovering drugs targeting the brain, through the discovery of nonstandard cyclic peptides that can pass through the blood-brain barrier. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 25Discovery story for Xofluza , a drug capitalizing on group value chain Xofluza is an innovative new drug designated under the Sakigake scheme for accelerating the approval process. Through a concerted effort to deliver this product to patients even one day sooner, the Shionogi Group succeed in gaining approval for and launching Xofluza within roughly three years of commencing Phase I trials. If Shionogi is to continue advancing innovation and growing as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, we think it essential that all value chain actors not only play their own roles, but also pull together to promote evolution of the value chain as a whole. Promptly providing medicine to those in need through value chain evolution Innovative new drug discovery in the infectious disease area is Shionogi's strength Research Even before the discovery of the HIV integrase inhibitor, researchers recognized the structural similarities between HIV integrase inhibitors and cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors, forming the belief that if HIV integrase inhibitors were brought to market, the science could be adapted for cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors. However, when it actually came to deployment in other programs of the chelate drug discovery know-how gained from Tivicay , many things did not go as expected, leading to much trial and error. Some programs even needed to be suspended halfway, so it came as something of a shock when I observed binding of our seed compound* 1 to the active center of cap-dependent endonuclease. When problems became evident with our rst drug candidate, and the realization came that development could go no further, I was the only person left out of a team once composed of several researchers. I was shattered and didn't think I could go on, but I was urged not to quit and took up the challenge again, resulting in Xofluza . The active form of Xofluza has a chemical structure that is highly unusual in medicinal chemistry, in order to heighten its efciency. That we were nonetheless able to create Xofluza is testament to our researchers' never-failing passion, innovative ideas and chemical knowledge base. *1 Compound found in early screening to have certain level of activity against drug discovery targetTakao Shishido Drug Discovery & Disease Research Laboratory Makoto Kawai Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratory Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 26Drive innovationGlobal development also completed in quick time CMC technologies led to design and development of optimal formulation Approval in rst round of Sakigake designation system for pharmaceutical productsDevelopmentCMC Regulatory affairsUndeterred by difculties, the project team worked tirelessly to come up with the best strategy that would enable us to launch the drug in scal 2017, so that we could full our mission of delivering Xofluza to patients as soon as possible. The development schedule called for Xofluza to launch within roughly three years of clinical trials commencing, and to that end it made full use of the influenza season every year. Starting Phase III studies in the season following completion of Phase II studies was quite a challenge and likely appeared nearly impossible, as did completion of the global Phase III study with about 1,500 enrollments in a single season. In the global trial in particular, a single mistake could lead to major delays, especially if a flu season was missed, so the team worked together to cover each task, going beyond national borders, divisions and roles to make sure there were no blunders. I think that the secret to our success was strong teamwork. The team shared the same goal and played their roles in a cooperative spirit based on mutual trust, enabling them to work together as a single unit. Members of other projects also cooperated on all fronts to make Xofluza a success, so our achievements were really due to everyone's strengths, not just to those of Xofluza project members. Japan has the highest standard of influenza treatment in the world, built on early diagnosis and treatment. Shionogi's next mission is to take this impressive level of treatment to the rest of the world and reduce, if even by one, the number of people who become ill and die of influenza\u2014a serious problem all over the world.In order to complete development in as short a time as possible, work on nding the optimal formulation proceeded at unprecedented speed. Not all activities were successful, and we experienced disappointments. Nonetheless, when tablets of an unplanned strength were required during clinical development, we were able to supply the investigational medicinal product (IMP) three to six months earlier than usual. At the manufacturing stage, too, we were able to keep the technology transfer period 11 months shorter than normal. Facing the pressure that failure would not be tolerated, members of the IMP Manufacturing Center were involved in the establishment of a small-scale commercial manufacturing process at the Settsu Plant, and this allowed a smoother shift to commercial manufacturing. In this manner, CMC personnel took on the strategic challenge of minimizing the product development period, thereby bringing the best conceivable drug to market in the shortest possible time. Under the Sakigake designation system, the process from ling to approval takes six months or less, as there already has been a prior assessment consul-tation process. In 2015, applications were received for over 50 drugs in the rst round of the Sakigake designation system. Xofluza received Sakigake desig- nation in the expectation that it would prove efcacious in patients at high risk of complications, such as the elderly and children, and this focused the public's attention on the drug. Even for drugs with Sakigake designation, though, the requirements are the same as for drugs undergoing the normal process, in terms of the documentation needed to support lings for manufacturing and marketing approval, and the aspects screened by author-ities. For this reason, shortening the review period hinges on nding solutions ahead of time to issues deemed likely to be raised by the regulators. This required us to quickly reach a mutual understanding with the authorities and address potential issues without delay. In order to realize our goal of bringing Xofluza to the world as soon as possible, we pulled together as a team and achieved Shionogi's maiden approval under the Sakigake designation system.

In this era of diversifying healthcare needs, there seems to be risk in having both a great deal of infrastructure and not much infrastructure. To maintain large infrastructure, it is necessary also to keep a bulging pipeline. However, this adds to the volume and type of work that in theory should be performed in-house. Through external partnerships, we seek to enhance overall productivity through collaboration in areas where it would be difcult for us to go it alone. By keeping our head ofce functions comparatively lean while at the same time retaining certain strengths in this ever-changing world, we aim to stay nimble and ensure that our presence is felt.Active use of diverse partnerships Win WinMedium molecule drug discovery Regenerative medicineVaccines, diagnostics Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 28Drive innovationStrategic alliances geared toward sus- tained growth after 2020 While Shionogi will continue to develop pipeline projects created in-house, we think expansion of pipeline projects and technologies through alliances also is essential for driving innovation. In order to flesh out our product pipeline over the medium and long term, in scal 2018 Shionogi set aside a special budget of \u00a520 billion for strategic R&D investment in addition to ordinary R&D expenses, and entered into a number of strategic business alliances. In the eld of infectious diseases, Shionogi traditionally has focused on HIV, influenza virus, and multidrug-resistant bacteria. In recent years, though, we have expanded the scope of our research to include the three major infectious diseases (HIV as well as tuberculosis, and malaria) and intractable infectious diseases. To that end, we have in-licensed research assets geared toward accelerating our research into the three major infectious diseases, while also investing in entirely new technol-ogies for the treatment of intractable infectious diseases. In the pain/CNS area, we have in-licensed assets that should enable us to provide a broader range of treatment options, thereby fleshing out underpopulated portions of our pipeline. We also have expanded into new modalities in order to address medical needs that have not been met by small molecule drugs, acquiring new technologies that will further our research into medium molecule drugs. Against this backdrop, we plan to harness our competitive edge in small-molecule drugs and develop an order of priority for investment of our limited resources, in order to achieve ongoing improvement in R&D efciency, both in-house and at partner companies. To further contribute to better health through the use of IT, we look to deepen our collaboration with the IT sector and other industries, tackling new modalities including digital therapeutic apps. In this manner, we aim to provide patients with an increasingly diverse range of treatment options.

The damaging effects caused by resistant bacteria are already responsible for an estimated 700,000 deaths per year globally, and future projections of the impact of unresolved AMR surpass the projected number of deaths caused by cancer by 2050. As AMR also could have a grave impact on the global economy, it potentially could pose a high direct and indirect cost to society. In the future, lack of effective antibiotics could make routine medical interventions extremely dangerous or even impossible. For these reasons, AMR must be regarded as a global, regional, and national priority for health organizations and governments, to be addressed with the utmost urgency on a global scale. Address the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)Deaths attributable to AMR per year by 2050, if no action is taken More than 10 millionEstimated economic impact $100 trillionProtect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseasesMaterial Issues to Create New Value for Customers and Society As a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, we must ask ourselves what Shionogi can do for society. One answer springs to mind, and that is \"freeing people from the threat of infectious diseases.\" Throughout history, mankind has been under constant threat from infectious diseases. No sooner is a new agent introduced than the pathogen develops resistance to it; this has been a persistent battle that continues today. As globalization gathers pace, borders are becoming more porous and people are able to move freely around the world, creating an urgent need for pandemic preparedness. At a time when other large pharmaceutical companies have moved away from the infectious disease area, I believe it is incumbent on Shionogi to maintain and further develop this particular strength, not just in the treatment of infectious diseases, but also in their prevention and diagnosis. Takuko Sawada Director, Executive Vice President Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 30Combating worldwide public health challenge of AMR The reality is, though, that many pharmaceutical companies have moved away from infectious disease area, as despite being a public health challenge of utmost importance, from a business perspective this is an area in which profits are hard to come by. Not only is it becoming more and more difficult to conduct R&D into new antibiotics, but also initiatives that restrict the use of new antibiotics have led to uncertainty around market size. It has been reported that only five of the world's top 50 pharmaceutical companies currently have an antibiotics pipeline. Against this backdrop, Shionogi has made an on-going commitment to the R&D of new antimicrobial therapies, and we will vigorously pursue such activities to ensure that both patients and society as a whole will benefit from new antibiotics. SGS2020 identifies \"Protecting people from the threat of infectious diseases\" as one of major social issues we should address, and declares that Shionogi will remain committed to developing new drugs against infectious diseases that lack effective medical treatments, and to promoting antimicrobial stewardship. In 2018, we published the Shionogi AMR Position Paper detailing our point of view and efforts in this regard, and we will continue driving forward our commitment to becoming a leading company in the fight against AMR, by promoting antibiotic R&D, proper use, and access to antibiotics. Long-term commitment to improving R&D to provide novel treatments for infectious diseases Shionogi's involvement in the field of infectious diseases essentially began when we began importing streptomycin in the years following World War II. Subsequently, we commenced sales of Ilotycin (licensed in from Eli Lilly) in 1952, and in 1959 we launched the long-acting sulfonamide Shinomin , the first proprietary product to come out of our research. The drug was out-licensed to Roche, helping to treat patients with infectious diseases worldwide. We also released the sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination Baktar , which is still widely used by patients worldwide. Shionogi now has been involved in infectious disease R&D for over 60 years, either independently or via strategic alliances with other companies/organizations, and we seek to continue generating new products in this field by drawing on that extensive experience in antibiotic drug discovery. At Shionogi, we also have spent more than 25 years conducting our own surveillance for resistant bacteria, and the data thus obtained is proving invaluable in promoting antimicrobial stewardship and AMR countermeasures. Shionogi's efforts to combat AMR also have been recognized externally. In a recent Antimicrobial Resistance Benchmark 2018 survey, Shionogi was the only Japanese pharmaceutical company to qualify for inclusion, and was recognized along with the seven other large research-based pharmaceutical companies. Especially, Shionogi was highly recognized in the survey as having the highest annual ratio of investment in R&D for anti-infectives of any of the companies surveyed (based on investment as a proportion of net sales). Shionogi is also active in the field of antiviral treatments. Over the years we have released a number of innovative anti-infectives including the anti-HIV agent Tivicay and related pipeline drugs, and the flu drug Xofluza . WHO and United Nations Initiatives to Tackle AMR WHO Global Action Plan Global cooperation spearheaded by World Health Assembly Global Action Plan setting out five strategic objectives 1. Improving awareness and understanding of antimicro- bial resistance 2. Strengthening the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research 3. Reducing the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures 4. Optimizing the use of antimicrobial agents in human and animal health 5. Developing an economic case for sustainable investment United Nations High-Level Meeting (September 2016) World leaders signaled an unprecedented level of atten- tion to curb the spread of multidrug-resistant infections. Countries reaffirmed their commitment to develop national action plans on AMR. Leaders recognized the need for stronger systems to monitor drug-resistant infections and the volume of anti- microbials used in humans, animals and crops, as well as increased international cooperation and funding. Leaders also called for new incentives for investment in research and development of new, effective and afford-able medicines, rapid diagnostic tests, and other import-ant therapies to replace those that are losing their power.

Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 32Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseasesWHO List of Antibiotic-Resistant \"Priority Pathogens\" On February 27, 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its rst-ever list of antibiotic-resistant \"priority pathogens,\" a catalog of 12 families of bacteria that pose the greatest threat to human health. Stating that \"Antibiotic resis-tance is growing, and we are fast running out of treatment options,\" the WHO stressed the need to develop new antibi-otics. The 12 pathogens on the list are divided into three categories according to the urgency of need for new antibiotics, with carbapenem-resistant bacteria slotting into the critical category where the need for new antibiotics is considered particularly urgent. Development of cefiderocol Many of the pathogens in the critical category (deemed in the most urgent need of new R&D) are resistant to carbapen-em-type antibiotics, and drugs effective against these pathogens are in high demand worldwide. Shionogi is devel-oping cederocol as a candidate for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections, and we believe it could evolve into a valuable weapon in the ght against the three carbapenem-resistant pathogens positioned by the WHO as the highest priorities. Clinical trials with a view to gaining approval are proceeding as planned\u2014including a Phase III study in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacterial infection and another Phase III study in nosocomial pneumonia\u2014and applications have been led in the US and Europe. Shionogi remains fully dedicated to tackling the global public health threat of AMR. New initiatives for hard-to-treat bacterial infections Looking ahead, Shionogi's strategy for AMR drug discovery will be to continue research into small-molecule anti-infectives targeting multidrug-resistant bacteria, while also expanding our horizons to include research into hard-to-treat bacterial infec-tions. To that end, in scal 2018 we made strategic investments in companies possessing entirely new modalities for the treatment of hard-to-treat bacterial infections. By combining our alliance partners' unique strengths with our own knowledge and experience in small molecules and infectious diseases, we aim to discover new therapies that would be beyond the scope of other companies.

Swiftly halting the spread of these diseases is an important theme of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Shionogi's strategic investments in fiscal 2018 also included the in-licensing of research assets with potential to accelerate drug discovery, with a view to helping beat these three major infectious diseases. HIV Shionogi has contributed greatly to the treatment of HIV through the discovery of Tivicay (dolutegravir), an HIV integrase inhibitor that has high levels of efficacy and safety and minimal risk of drug resistance. Currently, US, European and domestic HIV treatment guidelines recommend Tivicay as one of the first-line drugs for treatment-na\u00efve patients, making it an important new treatment option for all HIV positive patients. Although HIV treatment has come a long way, there remains a need for further improving patients' quality of life (QOL) by exposing them to fewer drugs and reducing dosing frequency. With a view to meeting these unmet needs, Shionogi is supplementing research work already under way with a focus on long-acting parenteral (LAP) formulations and realizing a cure for HIV. Tuberculosis and non-tuberculous myco- bacterial (NTM) diseases Each year, more than 10 million people reportedly fall ill with tuberculosis, and co-infection with HIV is another significant public health issue. Shionogi is actively engaged in addressing these challenges, by such means as licensing in the anti-tuberculous drug candidate S-004992 from China-based C&O Pharmaceutical Technology, as well as research assets from Hsiri Therapeutics. Malaria Along with HIV/AIDs and tuberculosis, malaria is one of the three major infectious diseases. Although it is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, there are reports that malaria distribution has been altered by global warming and other aspects of climate change, potentially leading to an increase in infections. Shionogi started joint research with Nagasaki University, to form the core of a new open innovation base for industry-academia collaboration both inside and outside Japan, and establish a platform aimed at eradication of malaria. Initiatives to promote proper use of medicines By promoting the proper use of anti-infectives, Shionogi works constantly to prevent the emergence of new drug-re-sistant bacteria and viruses, and to ensure that patients can continue to receive treatment, both now and in the future. In our sales activities, Shionogi does not remunerate sales staff based on sales volume of antibiotics, as highly recognized in the Antimicrobial Resistance Benchmark 2018 survey. We expect that delinking of sales volume from revenue reward will support more proper use over the long term, leading to better patient outcomes and improving antibiotic sustainability. In manufacturing antibiotics, Shionogi is working to reduce environmental burden. In addition to promoting proper use of antibiotics, Shionogi In the tuberculosis area, Shionogi has started joint research with Hsiri Therapeutics, which has an asset of small molecule lead compounds with a novel mechanism of action and extremely potent activity to mycobacteria. By entering into external alliances in this manner, we seek to pursue drug discovery targeting both tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases. The idea is to combine the malaria research assets and network of Nagasaki University, which has a worldwide presence in emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, with Shionogi's expertise in small molecule drug discovery, to engage in world-class malaria research. There are plans also for Shionogi and Nagasaki University to form the core of a new base for open innovation incorporating external institutions with a range of technologies.Hsiri Therapeutics, Inc.

We organize and provide relevant information to promote proper use and stewardship of antibiotics, by such means as conducting surveillance programs aimed at gathering accurate epidemiological data, and rigorously analyzing industry guidelines. In order to promote proper use of our flu drug Xofluza , we also have been assiduously conducting further analysis on mutant viral strains and drug safety, and making our ndings public. Public awareness and education programs To promote proper use of anti-infectives, it is absolutely essential to conduct awareness-raising and educational activities that result in the understanding and spread of correct information concerning the prevention and control of disease and infection. Shionogi is actively engaging in such activities. In an industry-government-academia collaboration geared toward combatting infectious diseases in children under ve years of age, in scal 2018 Shionogi hosted a total of ve seminars (attended by 339 nursery school operators and staff), to raise awareness about the MHLW's \"Infection Control Guide-lines for Nurseries,\" as revised in 2018. As a means of raising awareness among the general public as well, Shionogi has created a video explaining the guidelines and a website (Kodomo Kansensho Navi) to help parents navigate the subject of infectious diseases in children. Shionogi also invited experts from across Japan and Asia to attend the SHIONOGI Infectious Disease Symposium 2019 for a discussion of AMR countermeasures in each country. Our aim in doing so was to broaden engagement in efforts to address the threat of AMR, and promote international cooperation. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as leishmaniasis and Chagas disease also continue to threaten lives, particularly in developing countries. There has been limited progress, though, in developing effective antibiotics, giving rise to an interna-tional public health problem. Shionogi has been working with partners with various expertise in the healthcare area to find workable solutions to the numerous unmet needs in infectious diseases, and are applying the same approach to NTDs. Contributing to the GHIT Fund*1 Shionogi has been a contributor to the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund) since it was founded in 2013, as Japan's first public-private partnership. In addition to contributing to the GHIT Fund, we also have received funding. Under the auspices of the fund, Shionogi is actively working to eliminate the threat not just of NTDs but infectious diseases in general, including by taking part in a program to discover candidate compounds to treat leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. Participation in DNDi*2 drug discovery consortium Together with several other pharmaceutical companies, Shionogi has been a participant in the DNDi's \"Neglected Tropical Diseases Drug Discovery Booster\" consortium since its establishment in 2015. This consortium is an attempt to accelerate drug discovery for the world's most neglected diseases\u2014leishmaniasis and Chagas disease\u2014and also reduce associated costs. The consortium has started several screening projects for the parasites that cause leishman-iasis and Chagas disease, and most have discovered promising compounds with improved antiparasitic effects. Already, each project has reduced the costs of synthesizing compounds by tens of thousands of dollars and shortened the drug discovery period by roughly 50-70%. In recognition of these achievements, the consortium received the DNDi Project of the Year Award for 2016.Please refer to pages 58-59 and our EHS Report for details of Shionogi initiatives to reduce environmental burden as an antibiotics manufacturer. http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/csr/activities/environment.html Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 35Material Issues to Create New Value for Customers and Society Helping to alleviate cancer pain over a period of 30 years Back in the late 1980s when the WHO released its cancer pain treatment guidelines, prescription narcotics (opioid pain relievers) for cancer pain were not widely used in Japan. Shionogi already was supplying drugs for pain relief, and we received a request from the then Ministry of Health and Welfare to develop prescription narcotics. This proved to be a major turning point for Shionogi in the area of pain relief. In line with our Company Policy of striving constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve, we took on the development of MS Contin tablets, which we launched in 1989. In the 30 years since then, Shionogi has worked in tandem with regulatory authorities, academia, and medical professionals, to promote the proper use of palliative care and cancer pain relief. In recent years, we have launched Symproic tablets for the alleviation of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), with a view to realizing better pain management and improving the QOL of patients troubled by OIC. Amid changes in the healthcare environment including the promotion of community-based healthcare and an accompa-nying rise in the importance of in-home care, we released tamper-resistant OxyContin TR tablets designed to encourage proper use of prescription narcotics in Japan, and prevent their misuse and abuse. Going forward, we will continue striving to develop and market products that provide appropriate relief for cancer pain, addressing both the needs of patients and medical profes-sionals, and changes in the social climate.Help end suffering from painCreating a more vigorous society Among the social challenges that Shionogi seeks to address, one is the \"cre- ation of a more vigorous society.\" New drugs and other medical advances have extended average life expectancy around the world, but we still see room for improvement from the standpoint of healthy life expectancy. For example, we seek to help those with chronic pain (against which earlier drugs did not have sufcient analgesic effect) to lead more active lives. We also seek to relieve patients, their families, and friends from the impact of psychiatric/nervous system disorders and restore fuller participation in society. These aspirations inform many aspects of our daily activities. Yoshiaki Kamoya Senior Executive Ofcer Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 36Measures to encourage proper use of pain relievers Shionogi seeks to create a society in which patients suffering from cancer pain are able to use prescription narcotics with peace of mind. Recently the problem of prescription drug abuse, notably the opioid crisis in the US, has spread throughout the world, becoming a serious social problem.To ensure that this problem does not arise in Japan, not only are we working to expand our lineup of drugs to alleviate cancer pain, but also we are taking steps in advance against misuse of opioids. In addition to helping create a society in which patients can get relief from cancer pain without causing abuse of opioids, we will work toward realization of Target 3.5 in the United Nations' Sustainable development goals (SDGs), \"Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.\" Combatting psychological and CNS disorders Expanding treatment options for ADHD ADHD is a neurodevelopment disorder characterized by three main symptoms\u2014inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity\u2014and is a brain function impairment treatable by psychosocial therapy/support and medication. Shionogi has and Vyvanse as treat- ments for ADHD, under a 2011 licensing agreement with Shire plc. (now Takeda Pharmaceutical) concerning joint development and commercialization in Japan. Intuniv is a selective 2A adrenergic receptor agonist, the novel mechanism of action for the treatment of ADHD, and is a non-stimulant administered once daily. Launched in May 2017, Intuniv is now widely used in Japan. Furthermore, in June 2019 Intuniv won approval for the additional indication of treatment for ADHD in adults (aged 18 and over).Vyvanse is a once-daily drug that stimulates the release of dopamine and noradrenaline, and blocks their reuptake. It is a prodrug that is therapeutically inactive until it undergoes gradual conversion to an active pharmacologic agent in the body, thus preventing a rapid rise in the active agent's serum level while ensuring that a steady serum level is maintained thereafter. Shionogi received manufacturing and marketing approval for Vyvanse in March 2019. Because Vyvanse is designated as raw material for stimulant, it was approved for marketing on the condition that certain measures be taken\u2014that it should be given only to appropriate patients under prescription by medical experts well-versed in diagnosis/treatment of ADHD, and that it should be handled only by medical institutions and pharmacies, where risks including dependence can be fully controlled. Shionogi seeks to contribute to treatment of ADHD patients by providing Intuniv and Vyvanse as new treatment options.Drug abuse prevention campaign with Aichi Prefecture May 2018: Shionogi is collaborating with Aichi Prefecture on a campaign to prevent drug abuse. To ensure that this problem does not arise in Japan, Shionogi pledges to do more to help create a society in which steps are taken in advance to prevent misuse of opioids, so that patients can get relief from cancer pain without causing abuse of opioids.Dina Mired, UICC President Princess Dina Mired of Jordan pays a courtesy call on Shionogi November 2018: Princess Dina Mired of Jordan, who serves as President of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), paid a courtesy call on Shionogi. We are focusing efforts on the treatment of cancer pain, and we were commended by Princess Dina for our support in helping to alleviate the pain of cancer patients by promoting the proper use of opioids and increasing access to such drugs.

Shionogi intends to build a sustainable society by creating an environment in which the children who will become our future leaders are able to maximize their potential and lead fulfilling lives. The Ofce for Children's Bright Future at Shionogi seeks to lighten the psychological burden on children with a develop-mental disorder, with a twin focus on gaining greater understanding from society, and building and realizing a support system. As a partner in the support of children with a developmental disorder, we work together with local govern-ments and academia, with an eye to harnessing the core competencies of all involved. Shionogi has participated in a number of collaborative initia- tives, and in May 2018 we entered into a new business alliance with Iwate Prefecture. In Hiroshima Prefecture, with which we had earlier formed a partnership in March 2018, we received recog-nition as a company conducting leading initiatives that can serve as a model for supporting people with disabilities. Through this proactive approach, we aim to promote the growth and health of children who will become future leaders. We also seek to lighten the psychological burden on such children in order to help build a society in which individuals can tap their innate potential and thrive.Partnering with local governments In order to achieve earlier detection and intervention and realize lifelong support, Shionogi works in tandem with lo-cal governments to identify challenges particular to each region, and implement the necessary countermeasures. Promoting understanding Public seminars designed to promote wider and greater understanding of a developmental disorder (Osaka, Hiroshima, and Iwate prefectures) Improving the knowledge and practical skills of support staff Workshops to enhance knowledge and practical skills among the various professions supporting children with a developmental disorder (Osaka Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture, Sanuki City and Higashikagawa City in Kagawa Prefecture, Iwate Prefecture, and Yokohama City) Training event for nursery and kindergarten teachers March 2018: Partnership with Hiroshima Prefectural Government to support our children's bright futureFrom left, Hidehiko Yuzaki, Governor of Hiroshima Prefecture, and Isao Teshirogi, Shionogi President and CEOPartnering with academia With a view to building and realizing a support system for children with a developmental disorder, Shionogi is working alongside academic institutions to develop and promote useful new tools and methodologies. Development of new tools Development of tools to gauge the support needs and challenges faced by children with a developmental disorder, based on observation of such children at school (Universities: Education eld) Promote training of support staff Creation of training packages for special needs educa- tion coordinators at dedicated special needs schools and at elementary, middle, and high schools with a focus on special needs education (Osaka Ohtani University: Faculty of Education) Improving the knowledge and practical skills of support staff Creation of guidebooks to support occupational health staff in assisting workers with adult ADHD symptoms (University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan: Institute of Industrial Ecological Sciences' Occupational Health Practice and Management Department) Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 38Creating a more vigorous societyInitiatives to remove communication barriers for sight- and hearing-impaired people Communication Barrier-free Project (CBF-PJ) Ensuring that all patients have access to necessary infor - mation to receive benefits of best possible medicines Pharmaceutical products have a direct impact on human health and life, and as such patients are provided with infor - mation\u2014for example, through medication guidance from medical professionals\u2014to ensure that drugs have maximum efficacy and minimal side effects. At Shionogi, we think it extremely important that all patients\u2014whether able-bodied or disabled\u2014have access to the information necessary for medications to work properly. To that end, Shionogi has instigated the Communication Barrier-free Project, which seeks to improve the manner in which infor-mation is conveyed and eliminate communication barriers when people with disabilities receive medication instructions. People with disabilities\u2014in particular those with hearing or visual impairments\u2014sometimes do not take medications as prescribed if they have not received sufcient information. While people with disabilities may struggle to take in infor-mation, this problem also can stem from the manner in which information is conveyed. Shionogi conducts activities aimed at educating various parties about the existence of such communi-cation barriers. In 2018, we held a number of awareness-raising seminars targeting medical professionals, attended by 712 doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and so forth, from ten university and public hospitals. Our aim is to contribute to creating a more vigorous society by ensuring that every individual\u2014able-bodied or otherwise\u2014receives the best possible medicines to protect their health and wellbeing, and is able to take these medicines in the appro-priate manner.

Example: Addition of new \"Ear mark\" card*1 varieties There are varying degrees of hearing impairment, and as such the type of consideration paid to patients also needs to vary. The university hospitals that hosted our seminars have since taken steps to better meet the needs of hearing-impaired individuals by adding new \"Ear mark\" card varieties and taking greater care when communicating with such patients.

Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 39The current approach to social security provision is under question amid increasingly stretched healthcare budgets in advanced markets. Meanwhile, AI and ICT have opened the door to new ways of doing business in the pharmaceutical sector that were not possible in the past. Those trends mean we can no longer rely on our existing business model based solely on selling pharmaceutical drugs. We seek to continue contributing to patients' treatment and QOL through our strength in the creation of innovative drugs, while also drawing on our expertise, skills, and experience in R&D to explore the possibilities of therapeutic and preventive vaccines, digital treatment option such as healthcare apps, and information services. By doing so, we aim to identify and address the issues that people face in all areas of healthcare, from pre-symptomatic and preventive care through diagnosis and treatment.Create new value in the healthcare field Investigational digital therapeutic, AKL-T01 (SDT-001) AKL-T01 (Shionogi Group development code: SDT-001) for ADHD in-licensed from US-based Akili Interactive. Shionogi has acquired the development and commercialization rights for this product in Japan and Taiwan. In clinical trials conducted by Akili in the US, AKL-T01 showed a good therapeutic effect. Shionogi seeks to address the needs of ADHD patients by providing a new digital treatment option with SDT-001, along with the proprietary drugs Intuniv , which is currently on the market in Japan, and Vyvanse , which won approval in Japan in fiscal 2018.

Since its establishment in April 2016, Shionogi Healthcare has registered three consecutive years of growth by responding flexibly to changes in the operating environment. Going forward, Shionogi Healthcare remains committed on a daily basis to delivering new health value to patients through the provision of excellent products and service and appropriate information. 05,00010,000 4,8696,7927 ,2468,115 FY2016 FY2015 FY2017(Millions of yen) FY2018*1 Responding to societal changes arising from social security system reforms In light of the pressure on public finances due to rising healthcare expenditures, consumers are being called upon to take responsibility for their own health, and practice self-care. In 2017, Shionogi launched Pylon PL granules as a cold medicine. The product was very well received by consumers, leading to the 2018 release of a larger packet. By supporting self-medication in this manner, Shionogi aspires to further improve consumers' QOL. Addressing the evolving needs of the self-care market June 2018: Capital alliance with Rohto Pharmaceutical Shionogi formed a collaborative relationship with Rohto Pharmaceutical, with a view to meeting the diversifying needs of consumers looking to extend healthy life expectancy. The aim is to draw on the respective strengths of each company in working to improve QOL for as many people as possible. Capturing the needs of a super-aging society January 2019: Launch of Shionogi Health Mail-order Service, offering mail order sales of functional foods In order to strengthen our presence in support for the pre-frail and promote the long-term health of seniors, Shionogi took over the Takara Group's functional food business, commencing direct sales of health foods. As a company seeking to support consumer health, Shionogi will focus not just on pharmaceuticals for the treatment of illness, but also on developing foods contributing to preventive and pre-symptomatic care, and on the supply of information.Products launched in scal 2018 2018 July Popon ai August Isodine Clear gargle Apple/Mint Pylon PL granules (24) Cinal EX chewable tablets e Cinal EX granules e 2019 March Kenkotsu Keikaku Cinal L white EXIA *1.

Under Shionogi's intellectual property strategy, we protect various innovations, such as drug compounds, applications, crystalline forms, manufacturing methods, formulations, drug discovery targets and basic research technologies. As part of drug in-licensing and out-li-censing activities, we conduct due diligence with respect to intellectual property and take every possible step to prevent Shionogi's business activities from infringing a third party's intellectual property. We also carry out brand design activities aimed at building trust in the Shionogi brand and preventing counterfeiting. Shionogi works to protect its intellectual property, employing all legal means necessary if Shionogi's intellectual property appears to have been infringed. Shionogi does not consider that the system of intellectual property rights is in itself a barrier to drug access, but we are aware that in certain situations a degree of flexibility is required. In view of this, until the issue of drug access is resolved, we will refrain from applying for and enforcing patents in developing countries facing economic challenges that are classied as LDCs* 1 or LICs*2. Meanwhile, developing countries account for more than 40% of the total global supply volume of the anti-HIV agent Tivicay (dolutegravir), which is licensed to ViiV Healthcare, combination drugs Triumeq and Juluca . Registering dolute- gravir in the Medicines Patent Pool has allowed generic manufacturers to manufacture dolutegravir, either as a single-in-gredient formulation or combined with other anti-HIV agents, and distribute it to more than 130 low-income and lower middle-income countries. As one of the patent holders of dolutegravir, Shionogi contributes to this initiative. *1 LDCs: Least Developed Countries *2 LICs: Low Income CountriesWith a view to improving access to healthcare, we issued the Shionogi Global Health Access Policy Statement, which sets out our commitment to fullling our corporate mission by working, not only through our own efforts but also with a wide range of partners, to contribute to better health for people around the world, especially in developing countries. Specically, we are progressing with the initiatives outlined below. Shionogi's initiatives for access to healthcare have received external recognition. With specic reference to its AMR initiatives, Shionogi was the only Japanese pharmaceutical company to qualify for inclusion in the Antimicrobial Resistance Benchmark 2018 survey, and was also recognized in the survey as having the highest annual ratio of R&D investment for anti-infectives of any of the companies surveyed (based on investment as a proportion of net sales). Please refer to page 35 for details of the GHIT Fund and proper use of anti-infectives; pages 30-33 for details of AMR initiatives.Detailed information on the Shionogi Global Health Access Policy Statementhttp://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/policy/access.htmlShionogi believes that its basic stance should be as stated in the Company Policy: \"to strive constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\" With this stance established as the basis of our value to society, we have progressed to our present position with our sights rmly set on the basic mission of a pharmaceutical company: to protect the health and wellbeing of the people we serve. Access to healthcare is a serious issue for many people around the world, and Shionogi is committed as part of its social responsibility as a pharmaceutical company to continuing the pursuit of this Company Policy through earnest initiatives to improve healthcare access. Improve access to healthcareMaterial Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's Growth Initiatives to improve access to healthcare 1) Since its foundation in 2013, we have been a continuous participant in the GHIT Fund, Japan's rst private-public partnership of its kind, through which we are working proactively to overcome infectious diseases. 2) To improve access to healthcare, it is important to communicate medical knowledge accurately, improve disease awareness and rates of diagnosis among patients, and promote the proper use of medicines. To support the proper use of anti-infectives, we participated in the Industry Roadmap for Progress on Combating Antimicrobial Resistance, which aims to ght antimicrobial resistance by implementing the Davos Declaration of January 2016. 3) Since the patent for the anti-HIV agent dolutegravir, which is licensed to ViiV Healthcare, is available free of charge, generic manufacturers can manufacture low-priced generic versions and distribute them to more than 130 low-income and lower middle-income countries. 4) To reduce infant, child, and maternal mortality rates in Narok County, Kenya, we are collaborating with the international NGO World Vision to support improved access to healthcare services and improved nutrition through the Mother to Mother SHIONOGI Project. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 44Improving access to healthcare in Africa: Mother to Mother SHIONOGI Project One project through which Shionogi seeks to serve the health of people worldwide is an initiative operated since 2015 in partnership with the international NGO World Vision. The aim is to reduce mortality among pregnant women and new mothers and babies in the Osupuko district of Narok County, Kenya. Kenya has very few clinics for its large land area, which means that it is very difcult to arrange for pregnant women to receive the antenatal care that would ensure mother and child can return home in good health after the birth \u2014 a perfectly normal expectation in Japan. To tackle the high mortality rate for pregnant women and children up to 5 years of age along with other issues affecting mothers and their young children, we are engaged in building clinics and providing healthcare services to remote regions through traveling clinics and other projects. We are also working to improve access to healthcare by providing education on healthy living, nutrition, hygiene and related matters to healthcare professionals, local health workers, and community members. The expansion of facilities through building of clinics, obstetrics wards, and other facilities has meant that, compared to before the start of the project, the number of pregnant women receiving antenatal examinations (4 times or more) has increased by 40-fold (from 5 before the project to 198 in its third year), the number of births at related clinics by 3.5-fold (from 6 before the project to 21 in its third year), and the number of children under ve years receiving preventive vaccination by 23-fold (from 13 before the project to 305 in its third year). These gures reflect a progressive improvement in local health conditions. With the project now in its fourth year, local awareness and behavior has begun to change as people appreciate the impor-tance of giving birth at a medical facility and of receiving healthcare services at a clinic. Toward achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), we will continue supporting good health practice for mothers and babies worldwide to contribute to the health of people around the world. Participation in Access Accelerated*1 Shionogi has participated in Access Accelerated since 2017. The Mother to Mother SHIONOGI Project is an initiative to improve access to healthcare for mothers and babies by enhancing local health services. As an Access Accelerated program, it was featured in the Access Accelerated Year Two Report. We will continue to promote initiatives through Access Accelerated to contribute to reaching one of the health targets of SDG 3: to reduce premature deaths from non-communicable diseases by one-third by the year 2030 through prevention and treatment and to promote mental health and well-being.*1 Access Accelerated: an initiative that brings together more than 20 pharma- ceutical companies from Japan, the US, and Europe to work with the World Bank, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), governments and other bodies to improve access to non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention, treatment and care in low- and lower middle-income countries. A baby born at a health center with its mother Hygiene education in action: mothers learn how to purify water Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 45Our approach to manufacturing: high-quality drugs in stable supply at competitive cost To put into practice the Company Policy, we take Safety, Quality, Delivery, Low Cost, and Environmental Consciousness as the basis of our manufacturing activities. Going forward, we will continue to maintain an awareness of these five principles as we pursue earnest initiatives to realize a stable supply of high-quality drugs at reduced cost. Initiatives to improve manufacturing quality To consistently deliver a stable supply of high-quality drugs, Shionogi has put in place a quality assurance system based on Japanese and overseas GMP* 1, allowing us to pass the inspec- tions of regulatory authorities in the US and Europe. Each drug product must undergo an individual inspection for compliance with GMP . Shionogi obtains a GMP compliance certificate for all products before initiating drug manufacturing at our facilities. At our manufacturing facilities, each lot is subject to tests and inspections to monitor product quality at every stage from receipt of raw materials through to the finished product. We also perform quality trend assessment and stability monitoring in an effort to realize continuous quality improvement. All data relating to drug manufacturing and quality are subject to appropriate document management to ensure the completeness of data as part of a system to consistently deliver the best possible medicines. *1 GMP: Good Manufacturing Practice (regulations for pharmaceutical manufac- turing control and quality control) Initiatives for stable supply Shionogi undertakes analysis of procurement risk for each product and responds through multisourcing and designation of safe inventory levels. By implementing this management cycle, we work to strengthen our system of stable supply. At the three Shionogi plants, we have put in place risk management and business continuity management systems to prepare for the event of suspension of operations through earthquake, fire, explosion, new strains of influenza, terrorist attacks or other major disasters and to facilitate rapid recovery and continuity. In this way, we work to ensure a system that will allow us to fulfill our responsibility to provide a stable market supply in all eventualities. We maintain regular communication with significant contract manufacturers and suppliers in Japan and overseas to ensure that they share the Shionogi approach to stable supply and to set key performance indicators as common reference points to promote mutual understanding and strengthen coordination.We support the Principles set out in PSCI* 2 (whose code of conduct we require business partners to comply with) and, by complying with Japanese subcontracting law and other relevant regulations, we ensure that procurement activity is founded on honesty, fairness, equity, and transparency. At the same time, we work for sustained increase in corporate value so as to win still greater trust from our stakeholders. *2 PSCI: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (a non-profit body formed by more than 40 pharmaceutical companies worldwide to promote CSR-based procurement in the pharmaceutical industry) Please refer to page 72 for details of our risk management and business continuity management systems; page 56 for details of PSCI. Detailed information on the PSCI Principles (a code of conduct we require our business partners to comply with) https://pscinitiative.org/resource?resource=1In the more than 140 years since its foundation, Shionogi has never been responsible for a case of pharmaceutical damage to health. In keeping with the Company Policy of \"striving constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve,\" our commitment to never allowing errors to occur has been passed down undiluted throughout our history. Accordingly, we strive to ensure quality and safety so that customers know they can rely on Shionogi medicines. Supply socially responsible products and servicesMaterial Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's Growth Ensuring quality and safety in products and services Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 46The new company Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd., was established on October 1, 2018, to integrate the manufacturing-related functions of the Shionogi Group and began operations on April 1, 2019. In addition to pharmaceutical manufacturing functions, Shionogi Pharma is equipped with manufacturing and sales capabilities with functions in quality assurance and in supply chain, sales, and operations management. It thus has potential to develop a contracting business not only in drug manufacturing but also in investiga-tional drug studies, analytical testing, pharmaceutical engineering, and other areas. Through strengthening of manufacturing-related functions, we aim to move swiftly ahead with measures to ensure stable supply at reduced cost, maximize the value of long-listed drugs, and expand our contracting business. In this way we will not only advance Shion-ogi's business strategy, but also contribute to maintaining and improving the health of people around the world. Establishment of Shionogi Pharma Technology development and manufacturing bases Settsu Plant (Head Office): main plant handling formulation and packaging for global distribution Kanegasaki Plant: integrated manufacturing base specializing in antibiotics Tokushima Plant: manufacturing plant for general APIs, inter - mediates, and highly potent APIs Amagasaki Office: R&D (manufacturing technology develop- ment), manufacturing base for investigational drugs One-stop contract manufacturing system \u2014 offering solutions to customer issues Shionogi Pharma's strengths lie in the following three points: *1 CDMO: Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization On the basis of these strengths, Shionogi Pharma aims to provide services that meet customer needs and to contribute to the further development of the pharmaceutical industry. Shionogi aspires further to become a technology development-focused manufacturing company with emphasis on manufacturing technology, developing new manufacturing methods and products for global application. Shionogi Pharma operated booths at the CPhI Japan exhibition in March 2019 and at Interphex Japan in February and July 2019. There, we engaged in dialog with customers from Japan and overseas to analyze what issues customers face as a rst step toward building a contract operations business.1. As a CDMO*1, Shionogi Pharma is equipped with all relevant functions from preparation of, formulation, and packaging to analysis and pharmaceutical engineering. It is thus able to provide a one-stop contract manufacturing system covering all stages from drug development to commercial manufacturing.2. Technological prowess built up over a long history3. Experience and trust based on a record of stable supply of high-quality drugs Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 47A socially responsible system of quality management The mission of the Corporate Quality Management Division is to ensure compliance with all regulations in operations relating to quality, safety, and pharmaceutical regulatory affairs, and to thereby ensure the reliability of these activities across the whole Group. This means that it coordinates closely with Group companies worldwide in the US, Europe, Asia, and other regions, working to improve the quality of Shionogi products and infor-mation, ensure safety through a robust pharmacovigilance system, and implement pharmaceutical compliance in the rapidly changing regulatory environment. In this way, it helps to fulll Shionogi's responsibilities as a corporate citizen. Going forward, we will continue to comply with regulations and take advance measures to avoid risk so as to make Shionogi a company that patients can have condence in and all stakeholders can trust. Action on quality assurance To strive constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve, businesses must act efciently with an approach to risk that takes preventive measures in advance rather than reacting after an issue has emerged. Among the quality risk scenarios envisaged, some are associated with the launch of new businesses and the establishment of new Group companies. Anticipating potential risk and devising mitigating measures makes it possible to respond appropriately and minimize the impact if and when the risk materializes. Through the Shionogi Group Quality Policy, which is subject to continuous improvement, Shionogi confirms that all products and data in Japan and overseas, from the development to the post-marketing stage, are covered by appropriate risk-pre-ventive action of this kind. Additionally, to implement these activities Group-wide, including in overseas operations, we put in place a quality assurance system compliant with the regulation of the relevant country. In addition to presenting a unitary policy, we also operate integrated information management, thus realizing a global quality assurance system for Shionogi products.

Accordingly, we operate procedures for reliably gathering and evaluating safety information at all stages from development to post-marketing and have put in place a system which allows necessary safety measures to be rolled out rapidly through close coordination between safety management divisions in all Group regions, including overseas. Additionally, for drugs where it is considered necessary, a special pharma-covigilance system is put in place with specic procedures stipulated for the individual product. Through measures of this kind, we promote proper use tailored to the specic character-istics of the product. Detailed information on the Shionogi Group Drug Safety Policy http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/policy/safety.htmlEducation for improved safety awareness In order to ensure that safety measures are correctly imple- mented, it is vital that management and employees understand the importance of gathering and evaluating safety information. At Shionogi, in order to handle safety information appropriately, we formulate procedural manuals and provide in-house education. Within Japan, as well as regular training on gathering of safety information designed mainly for medical representatives (MR), we also provide safety education for general employees. In this way we work to improve awareness of safety in our business management. Safety education: fiscal 2018 achievement record: Safety control divisions 5 courses; Medical representatives 6 courses; Management 1 course; Company-wide education 1 course Measures to stop counterfeit medicines There is an increasing risk worldwide from counterfeit medicines, which not only represent a missed opportunity for patient treatment but may also result in health damage. Shionogi believes that, in addition to reliably delivering products to patients around the world living with disease, we also need to protect patients through initiatives to prevent the counterfeiting of medicines. To do this, Shionogi not only participates in industry activities to prevent the circulation of counterfeit medicines, but is also working under the lead of the Quality Assurance Department on a product security strategy through the Global Anti-Counterfeit Committee, whose members are drawn from various functions in Japan, the US, and Europe. Within Japan, in response to the case of a counterfeit version of a hepatitis C therapeutic drug that emerged in January 2017, a range of ministerial ordinances have been revised, resulting in a major review of in-house distri-bution management procedures and a comprehensive inspection of drug package seals and other areas. Going forward, we will carry on with continuous improvement of sealing, packaging and other areas, staying abreast of techno-logical advances and of practice across the rest of the industry.Patients Healthcare professionalsAdverse event Information gatheringAdverse event Evaluation and reviewAdverse event Review and decisionSafety Information provisionPharmacovigilance (PV) Adverse event report/safety measures Ministry of Labour, Health and WelfareOverseas regulatory authorities Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 49Cultivating human resources to underpin competitivenessFor Shionogi, creation of value depends wholly on its human resources. A diverse environment where people learn to respect and integrate different values and perspectives in a mutually motivating atmosphere can stimulate wide-ranging innovation. Leveraging this rich individuality as an energizing force, we provide our employees with opportunities to grow towards a future career path and provide them with a supportive work environment. This enables us to secure human resources who can drive sustained growth, leading both to personal growth and to growth of Shionogi as a company.

We focus on individual strengths and value the ability for self-realization in the workplace. Within the context of everyday discussion and dialog, we encourage individuals to proactively seize opportunities by communicating their wishes to senior staff based on future career projections. In response, senior staff create an environment that supports growth by assigning projects to optimally match team members' strengths. In this way, we promote self-motivated human resources development oriented toward career growth.Secure human resources to support growth Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 50Material Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's GrowthCultivating next-generation leaders Employee growth is the essential driver of Shionogi's growth. To deliver new value to society, we establish an outline of the human resources prole and the managerial prole that the company requires, and managerial staff take corresponding responsibility for employee development. So that each individual employee can evolve toward continuous devel-opment in their thinking and their actions, we support all employees to take control of their own future growth. The President's Management Seminar The President's Management Seminar, which is led by the President in person, is a forum set up in 2012 to cultivate senior management candidates. Each year around ten candidates are selected to participate in a total of seven to nine seminars held roughly every month over the course of the year. In the seven years since its inception, the program has turned out over 50 graduates in all, including half of our current corporate ofcers and around 40% of heads of organization. Through this program, Shionogi cultivates its next generation of leaders by developing diverse human resources with a tenacious approach who can consider issues from a company-wide perspective. Senior management development through man- agement experience at Group companies Senior management candidates take on roles as presidents, non-executive directors, and auditors of Group companies, where they gain management experience. The president of the Shionogi Group himself conrms the content of discussions at Group companies. At the twice yearly general meeting of shareholders and at business brieng events, the president of the Shionogi Group and ofcers of Group companies are engaged in comprehensive discussion, providing them with a forum to deepen their understanding of the stakeholder perspective and hone their business instincts. Divisional rotation of corporate officers Shionogi carries out a system of corporate ofcer rotation across divisions. This rotation allows corporate ofcers to experience management of a number of divisions so that they can practice management not as the representative of one division but from a company-wide perspective.Outline of Human Resources Development Basic Skills Management Skills Operations Skills The President's Management Seminar Top Management Candidate Training Early Management Candidate TrainingCareer Training Elective TrainingYoung Employee Training Introductory Each Division TrainingManager Training Management Candidate Training 50s 40s30s Logical thinking Personal communication skills Planning skillsManagement perspectives LeadershipManagement problem resolutionBusiness operations skills Enhancement of management skills Self transformation Basic adult life training Acquisition of specialized knowledgeProfessional personnel training Basic adult life training Development of specialized skillsBusiness execution skills Team managementIndividual Training Organization Building Top Management Young Employees Mid-Level Employees Group-Wide Joint New Employee TrainingElective training Grade-based trainingElite trainingToday's Managers Train the Managers of TomorrowLearning on the jobSupport for Professional Self Development On-the-job training Coaching Communication of skills and knowhow PDCA cycle through practical work experienceDevelopment by evaluation Monitoring of goals Personnel system Encouragement to take business skills assessment exam Encouragement and support to take English communication test Support for correspondence coursesSupport for attending classes e-learningGroup Training Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 51Promoting diversity and inclusion Continuous innovation is vital to ensure that companies remain viable and continue fullling their responsibility to society. Shionogi emphasizes diversity and inclusion as a driving force of innovation. Learning to respect and integrate diverse values and perspectives within a mutually motivating atmosphere can stimulate wide-ranging innovation, which increases our ability to benet patients and society and in turn strengthens Shionogi's business viability.Guided by this approach, in 2018 we established a system to promote diversity and inclusion on a Group-wide basis by creating the Diversity Council, which coordinates the separate efforts of individual organizations to facilitate diversity and inclusion. A Diversity Vision was also created so that all employees can engage in promoting diversity and inclusion on the same level as each other. Creating a supportive workplace for people with disabilities Shionogi is actively engaged in employing people with disabilities from the following perspective: progressing with the adaptation of workplaces so that people with and without disabilities can work vigorously. Since 2014, we have been working to create supportive work environments in which people with disabilities can develop their abilities. To create further employment oppor - tunities, in April 2018 we established Shionogi Smile Heart Co., Ltd., which was certified as a special subsidiary company in July 2018. Aspiring to be an organization where barriers to commu- nication are removed and all people can fully tap their innate potential and thrive irrespective of their disability status, we are rolling out an initiative known as the Project for Barrier-Free Communication. As the project applies equally to our own organization, we are working on ways of guaranteeing appropriate access to information so that anyone can participate in meetings independently. Using voice recognition apps to convert speech to text and inserting subtitles into video presentations are among the specific measures for employees with hearing impairment whose introduction is making it the norm for all employees to have guaranteed access to information. Meanwhile, as part of in-house training activities, we use simulations and other methods to give employees an understanding of the unique experience of hearing impairment. Going forward, we will continue working to create an environment where people with disabilities who wish to work can join the Shionogi family, where they can pursue their career vigorously, their individual abilities are respected and their work duties and working environment are adapted to their particular disability. Please refer to page 39 for details of external initiatives as part of the Project for Barrier-Free Communication.Diversity Vision (Establishment in December 2018) Understand yourself and others, and celebrate individual diversity. Allow the wide variety of unique qualities to inspire creativity and innovation. We will have an unbiased understanding of others, knowing that everyone has a different perspective; connect and resonate with diverse personalities to foster an inclusive spirit and generate abundant ideas; and, driven by such spirit and ideas, create new value and grow with society for our collective future. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 52Secure human resources to support growthSupporting work-life balance To help our employees achieve an appropriate work-life balance, we have taken steps to offer more convenient work solutions by actively introducing a discretionary work system and a flextime system. Close to 100% of eligible female employees take childcare leave and return to work after - wards, while more than 20% of eligible male employees currently take childcare leave. We have also introduced a variety of options to support diverse employee lifestyles. These include a system that lets sales staff choose their work location to adjust to major life changes, such as getting married or taking on childcare responsibilities, a leave system for volunteering, a leave system for bone marrow donors, and a leave system to support learning.Since 2005, we have been working to comply with Japanese legislation designed to create more supportive environments for child-rearing. This requires us to draft a series of employer action plans, whose content has included efforts to increase the uptake rate of annual paid leave, intro-duction of partial pay for childcare leave, and support for employee personal development during leave periods. We have also held relevant training seminars for managerial staff and have introduced a system of interviews to give guidance to employees about to start or complete a leave period. In recognition, we have three times received the Kurumin Mark, which is awarded by the Japanese Ministry of Labour, Health and Welfare to companies that support child-rearing. Promoting the empowerment of women At Shionogi, we are committed to providing employees with a work environment in which they can develop their strengths, express themselves as individuals, and develop professionally regardless of gender. As a result of our initiatives to date, the ratio of female managers has been rising steadily and now stands at 10% in our domestic Group companies. With the male-female gap in average years of service also now closed (males 17.1 years, females 17.8 years), Shionogi is evolving into a company where it is considered only natural that women are active in the workplace. In response to Japanese legislation for female empow- erment, employers are required to publish relevant action plans. In scal 2019, as part of our plan for the period April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2021, we set the goal of having at least 10% of managerial positions occupied by women by the end of scal 2020. Among other initiatives in our continuing support for women's professional advancement, we plan to (1) conduct seminars and other educational activities on the subject of diversity company-wide (2) hold seminars on female career development for managerial staff (3) introduce a discretionary work system, a flextime system, and a homeworking system (4) look at measures to support employees returning to work from child-rearing leave, for instance provision of useful information during leave on a voluntary basis. Awards for Diversity New Diversity Management Selection 100 Shionogi has rolled out initiatives to support employee career development and to promote female advancement in the Human Health Care Division. The thinking behind these and other initiatives is that supporting diverse human resources to develop their strengths will not only lead to personal growth but will also contribute to the growth of the organization. These efforts were recognized when Shionogi was selected for inclusion in the scal 2015 New Diversity Management Selection 100 project. Leading Company for Women's Advancement in Osaka City As a company that takes active measures to create a supportive work environment for women, Shionogi was certied in scal 2015 as a leading company for women's advancement in Osaka City. Kurumin Mark Shionogi has three times been awarded the Japanese Minister of Labour, Health and Welfare's Kurumin Mark, which recognizes it as a company that supports child-rearing. 'Eruboshi' Grade 3 award and certification as an outstanding equal opportunities employer Shionogi Techno Advance Research, a Shionogi domestic Group company where around half of employees are women, aims to realize a work environment where women can continue energetically pursuing their career while coping with life's milestones such as pregnancy, childbirth, child-rearing, and taking on career responsibilities. As part of these efforts \u2014 partly in response to a survey of workplace morale in scal 2016 \u2014 the company was inspired to set up a Women's Advancement Promotion WT, whose activities are led by employees. In December 2017, the company received Grade 3, the highest rating, in the 'Eruboshi' awards, which were set up under Japanese legislation for female empowerment. In May 2018, it was designated by Osaka Prefecture as an outstanding equal opportunities employer. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 53Protecting the health and safety of employees Health management Shionogi takes focused measures to provide an environment in which employees can approach their work vigorously and thereby maintain health. We believe that this not only increases employee productivity but also helps to secure high-quality human resources. Our basic approach to activ-ities to maintain and improve health is set out in the Shionogi Health Declaration 2018, which guides our efforts to adapt and improve the work environment. Selected as Health and Productivity Stock for Four Consecutive Years In February 2019, Shionogi was selected as a Health and Productivity Stock and as one of the 'White 500' group of organizations certied for Outstanding Health and Productivity Management. Health and Productivity Stocks are stockmar-ket-listed enterprises selected in a program operated jointly by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange to recognize companies that take a managerial perspective on employee health management and offer a strategic response. Shionogi's activities to maintain and improve health have received strong public recognition, indicated by our inclusion in the selection for the fourth successive year since 2016. Occupational health and safety We work to protect employee safety and health and create an optimal work environment by putting in place a relevant management system, operating a Health and Safety Committee, and taking other measures to prevent work-related accidents and ensure health and safety in the workplace. The Settsu and Kanegasaki Plants have received certifi- cation under OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management System Standards) and practice continuous improvement. Meanwhile, to create a safer operating environment by preventing accidents due to chemical substances, we have put in place a management system using safety data sheets and maintain optimal chemical hazard guidelines. Please refer to our EHS Report for details of health management and occupational health and safety.http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/csr/activities/environment.htmlDetailed information on Shionogi Health Declaration 2018http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/csr/index.html Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 54Secure human resources to support growthEnsuring the safety of participants in clinical trialsShionogi, which has declared its wish to create a more vigorous society, recognizes the importance of respect for human rights and related initiatives. We believe that it is important for each employee to respect human rights and to act from a high ethical stance in accordance with international standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO's international labor stan-dards. The Shionogi Charter of Conduct, which lays down standards for employee conduct, contains clear statements regarding Respect for the Individual and Acceptance of Diversity.Since joining the PSCI* 1 in 2017, Shionogi has been progressing with human rights initiatives embracing all of its corporate activities, including suppliers. Action on UN Global Compact With business operations set to extend worldwide, Shionogi has the responsibilities of a global corporate citizen and needs to contribute to resolving social issues as part of its management activities. Accordingly, in August 2019 Shionogi declared its participation in the United Nations Global Compact. In the interests of sustainable growth, Shionogi endorses the essential values expressed in the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact relating to human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. Going forward, Shionogi will continue to support and respect the protection of human rights, avoid complicity in human rights abuses, and promote still more energetically global-level initiatives to eliminate forced labor and child labor. Clinical trials carried out by Shionogi are conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, the ICHGCP and other guidelines, and Japan's Pharmaceutical Affairs Law or other regulations applicable in the country where the trial is conducted. In the case of participation in a clinical trial, written informed consent is obtained based on the free will of the participants and the utmost efforts are made to protect the participants' human rights, ensure their safety and improve their well-being. Specically, in all clinical trials that Shionogi carries out, the highest priority is shown for ethical concerns. To guarantee the appropriateness of the trial in scientic and medical terms, it is conducted in accordance with a trial protocol that has been reviewed and approved by independent review committees established within the Company and within the medical insti-tution (ethics committee/institutional review board). Additionally, during the conduct of the clinical trial, a staff member of the medical institution is responsible for collecting safety information on the participants, and where safety infor-mation relating to newly observed serious adverse events in the participants is received, a prompt report is made to the partici-pating medical institutions and the regulatory authority of the relevant country in accordance with GCP , the regulatory provi-sions of the country, and company regulations. In this way, the utmost efforts are made to ensure the safety of participants in the clinical trial.Human RightsPrinciple 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 55Material Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's GrowthPromoting CSR procurement Participation in PSCI The PSCI Principles form a code of conduct which we require business partners to comply with. They cover a comprehensive range of elds including not only the environment and health and safety but also employment rights, ethical standards, and associated systems of management. Shionogi not only supports the PSCI Principles itself, but also requires its suppliers to abide by them. Audit activity We require suppliers of important pharmaceutical raw materials to undergo an EHS* 1 audit to check on safety measures in the manufacturing process and elsewhere and ensure environment-conscious operations. Our Suppliers' EHS/CSR Management Guidance sets out EHS risk categories and risk management procedures for suppliers and stipulates which conditions they must meet according to their assigned management level. We carry out a survey using the PSCI's self-assessment questionnaire to confirm the supplier's status in areas including ethics, labor, the environment, and health and safety. In fiscal 2018, 24 suppliers consented to the code of conduct based on the PSCI Principles and underwent a questionnaire-based written audit. Subsequently, visits were made to nine of the suppliers to carry out on-site audits. *1 EHS: Environment, Health and SafetyDetailed information on PSCI Principles https://pscinitiative.org/resource?resource=1PSCI Principles (Extracted items only) [Ethics] [Environment] [Health and Safety] 1.

Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 57Material Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's GrowthResponding to climate change Protecting water resourcesShionogi recognizes global warming and other climate change issues as themes to be addressed by management and is progressing with measures to reduce CO 2 emissions. It is also taking action to identify climate change-related risks and opportunities. To do this, we have carried out assessments of their probability of occurrence and potential nancial impact, adopting the denitions of the TCFD* 1 and making reference to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report*2 and the RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios. Shionogi is actively working on CO 2 emission reduction to contribute to global warming alleviation, and to that end has adopted the goal of reducing CO 2 emissions in scal 2020 by 33% from the scal 2005 benchmark. Since achieving a major CO 2 reduction in scal 2014 through fuel switch, we have continued to steadily decrease CO 2 emissions, for instance by introducing highly efcient facilities and reviewing operating methods. Our EHS Report discloses Group greenhouse gas emissions, including those of overseas operations, with the relevant greenhouse gas emissions (marked with a check) subject to third-party guarantee. High-quality water is a resource essential to pharmaceutical manufacturing. Water shortage in the water catchment areas where our plants are located would have a major impact on business continuity. For each of the main business locations involved in Shionogi's manufacturing and research, we have therefore conducted an assessment of the water supply necessary for current and future business continuity and of water-related risks, including increased probability of flooding due to climate change-related extreme meteorological phenomena. These assessments were carried out using the international assessment tools WRI Aqueduct and WWF Water Risk Filter. As a result of an overall judgment based on these assessments, combined with past insights and experience, Shionogi has concluded that its current and future water-related risk is relatively low. Going forward, we will consider consultations with experts in the assessment of water-related risk. By additionally integrating risk assessment based on WRI Aqueduct into the supplier selection process, we are working to identify and reduce potential supplier risk. Shionogi is working to protect water resources by using them more effectively and managing wastewater quality. In addition to our efforts to conserve water, we set voluntary standards for wastewater quality that exceed mandated levels and carry out constant monitoring. Initiatives on AMR To reduce environmental burden at Shionogi antibiotics manufacturing sites, antibiotics contained in wastewater are subject to an inactivation process before being sent to an on-site wastewater treatment facility, where checks are made to ensure that any substances released into the natural environment are at a harmless level.

Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 58Protect the environmentAppropriately managing chemical substances Initiatives to protect biodiversityWe use a wide range of chemical substances in pharmaceutical research, development, and manufacturing. Included among these are chemical substances with potential impacts on human health, ecosystems, and the global environment. For the sake of compliance, we believe that it is important not only to strictly observe PRTR legislation and the wide range of other regulations relating to chemical substances, but also to appropriately manage chemical substances and observe voluntary standards more stringent than legally mandated values in order to limit emissions into the air, wastewater, water, and soil.Initiatives on AMR Action in response to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a worldwide challenge. As an antibiotics manufacturer, Shionogi believes that action to suppress the emergence of resistant bacteria is vital and we are taking relevant action with the cooperation of suppliers. Shionogi has completed an audit of plants that manufacture antibiotics and all domestic suppliers. For details of the audit results, see our EHS Report. To promote biodiversity-conscious environmental activity, we at Shionogi set Action Targets, undertake employee education, and take action in compliance with the Invasive Alien Species Act and the \"Cartagena Act\" (Act Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modied Organisms). Saving resources and reducing waste Environmental strategy for plastics resources The increasing world population and economic development have contributed to creating a society characterized by mass production, mass consumption, and mass disposal. This has given rise to environmental issues such as depletion of natural resources, destruction of the natural environment, and pressure on nal waste disposal sites, with resulting calls to limit the consumption of natural resources and alleviate the environmental burden. Meanwhile, at the G20 summit held in Osaka in June 2019, participating nations agreed on a target of reducing marine plastic waste to zero by the year 2050. A strategy to deal with plastic resources is thus becoming an urgent priority. Shionogi is itself a user and disposer of resources, for instance as pharmaceutical raw materials and in research materials and equipment. In accordance with the Shionogi Group EHS Policy, we are working to reduce the generation of waste and promote reuse and recycling, and at the same time working to reduce the environmental burden associated with the products we sell. In addition to changing the materials used in packaging and containers and saving material by downsizing, we are progressing with the switch to carbon-neutral biomass plastics and high-quality recycled plastics, whilst ensuring that product quality and stable supply are maintained. Policy Action Products affected ReduceChange of tray material (from plastic to paper) All ampoule, vial, and tube products Change of thickness of eye drop container (thinner) All eye drop preparations Change of thickness of PTP packaging material (thinner) Flomox tablets Elimination of plastic buffer material from bottle packaging Irbetan tablets, etc. Reuse RecycleLabeling of plastic container packaging with identication mark All products Switch to mechanically recyclable PET lm Intuniv tablets Renewable Switch to biomass bottles (made with plant-derived polyethylene) Cymbalta capsules, Irbetan tablets, Piresp a tablets Supporting local community education through the Aburahi Botanical Gardens Shionogi operates the Aburahi Botanical Gardens, which serves as a place for preserving rare plants, including endangered species, and for education on biodiversity Students at Aburahi Elementary School enjoy dyeing workshops using plants grown in an herb garden built on the school grounds. They also learn about medicinal plants by touching and observing plant roots, leaves, seeds, and fruits in the Botanical Gardens. These classes are organized in partnership with Koka City Kusuri Gakushukan (Pharmacological Learning Center) and other local corporations, with experts from the botanical gardens of Kobe and Kyoto Pharmaceutical Univer-sities serving as guest lecturers.

The Group denes corporate governance as a structure for transparent, fair, timely and decisive decision-making that pays due attention to the needs and perspectives of shareholders, customers, employees, local communities and other stakeholders. Based on this, the Group formulated the Basic Views and Guidelines on Corporate Governance in October 2015 to realize the best possible governance. In accordance with the Group's Basic Views and Guidelines on Corporate Governance, Shionogi practices fair and transparent management supported by strict compliance, constructive communication with stakeholders, and continuous implementation of measures addressing change in the operating environment. Corporate governance structure Shionogi has adopted a Company with a Board of Auditors governance structure to support efficient management oversight. Under this system, the Group is working to strengthen the audit capabilities of its auditors and the monitoring functions of the Internal Control Department to ensure business execution is based on appropriate management decisions. In order to separate business management and business execution, the directors are responsible for making management decisions in line with the Group's medium- and long-term plans, while the executive ofcers are responsible for implementing business strategy, resulting in business execution based on rapid and flexible decision-making. Half the Company's directors are outside appointments, and we plan to enhance their supervisory functions further to reinforce management oversight. Board of Directors In principle, the Board of Directors meets every month to make decisions on important matters that affect Shionogi's business and to oversee business execution. Aiming to strengthen the board's oversight of business execution, we appointed two outside directors in scal 2009 and added another outside director in scal 2012 to promote highly transparent and equitable management by drawing on perspectives from outside the Company. In scal 2015, we appointed our rst female director to the board and increased the number of directors to six in order to strengthen management further and promote diversity. All three outside directors are independent appointments and are tasked with ensuring accountability and a high level of transparency in management. The Board of Directors is advised by the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Compensation Advisory Committee, which are chaired by outside directors. To ensure that management decisions are equitable and well-informed, these committees carefully assess the aptitude of candidates for director positions, the impact directors have on business management, and the suitability of individuals for certain roles and their respective levels of remuneration.All the Company's directors are committed to practicing transparent and fair management while supporting sustained growth and increasing corporate value over the medium and long term. From left: Guidelines on Corporate Governancehttp://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/cg/basic.html Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 60Material Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's GrowthAudit framework To ensure that the directors and each organization in the Company conduct their duties in a legally compliant and appro-priate manner, the Company has established systems to enable members of the Board of Auditors and the Internal Control Department, which is responsible for conducting internal audits, to carry out audits of business execution and exchange opinions with the representative directors as required. The Board of Auditors has ve members, comprising two standing members and three outside members. All three outside members of the Board of Auditors are independent appoint-ments. The members of the Board of Auditors attend meetings of key management bodies, such as the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Meeting, providing their opinions as necessary. Also, in accordance with corporate auditing standards, members of the Board of Auditors conduct business and accounting audits to verify whether directors and corporate ofcers responsible for business execution are carrying out their duties in a legally compliant and appropriate manner. Business execution framework Shionogi has introduced an executive ofcer system to support dynamic and flexible business operations, enabling the Group to respond rapidly to signicant changes in the operating environment. The Company has also established the Corporate Executive Meeting as a body to discuss business execution. It is composed of directors, auditors and the corporate ofcers responsible for business execution and meets every week in principle. The Corporate Executive Meeting is a forum for discussing issues related to business execution and important management matters. Role of Advisory Committees Nomination Advisory Committee The Nomination Advisory Committee supports the Board of Directors in an advisory role. Comprised of a majority of outside directors and chaired by an outside director, the Nomination Advisory Committee meets at least once a year to discuss director, corporate auditor and corporate ofcer candidates proposed by the Company, and assesses each proposal individually based on comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's experience, knowledge, capabilities, and so forth, in order to assess the suitability of candidates in a fair and equitable manner. Its conclusions are then reported to the Board of Directors.(Meetings held in scal 2018: One) Compensation Advisory Committee The Compensation Advisory Committee supports the Board of Directors in an advisory role. Comprised of a majority of outside directors and chaired by an outside director, the Compensation Advisory Committee meets at least once a year to discuss the suitability of individuals for certain roles and their respective levels of remuneration, including base remuneration, performance-linked compensation, and stock compensation. Its conclusions are then reported to the Board of Directors.(Meetings held in Report 2019 61Analysis and self-evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors \u2014summary of results Shionogi is committed to improving the Board of Directors' effectiveness, and to that end the Board has been conducting a self-evaluation annually since scal 2016.The Board of Directors analyzed and evaluated its effectiveness in scal 2018 by conducting questionnaires and interviews of individual directors and corporate auditors, with a focus on \"6. Directors and the Board, (1) Framework, (3) Roles and Responsibilities, and (6) Operation\" in the Basic Views and Guidelines on Corporate Governance set by the Company. The following is a summary of the results: Framework We assess that the Board of Directors has currently secured the necessary framework from the standpoint of various attributes, including expertise and experience, and diversity. However, issues for the future include the election of directors of foreign nationality and the election of female outside directors from the standpoint of further diversity. The Board of Directors will consider ways to further strengthen the governance framework while taking the Company's business devel- opment into account. Roles and Responsibilities Addressing issues identied in the previous scal year The need to further enhance reporting on management development was identied as an issue in the previous scal year, as was the need for supervising the status of management development. Reports were made and opinions exchanged at meetings between outside directors and the president. To further enhance reporting on compliance and the operation of internal controls, reports on the status of compliance activities are presented twice annually, as of 2018. Issues for the future Matters identied as issues for the future include enhancement of discussions regarding the medium-term business plan, enhancement of explanations and debate concerning management development (in terms of the selection process and development progression), and further enhancement of compliance frameworks and the content of compliance reporting. The Board of Directors will continue to consider ways to flesh out its roles and responsibilities. Operation Addressing issues identied in the previous scal year An observation tour of the Shionogi Pharmaceutical Research Center (SPRC) was held to further stimulate discussion at Board of Directors meetings, the need for which was cited as an issue in the previous scal year. In addition, with respect to advance briengs on important and highly specialized subjects, the Board of Directors conducted timely advance briengs and considered changing its advance brieng methods. Issues for the future Matters identied as issues for the future included potential for obser - vation tours to facilities other than the SPRC and improving methods for providing basic information that facilitates better understanding of pharmaceutical companies. The Board of Directors will continue to consider ways to improve its operation. Remuneration amounts for directors and corporate auditors Total director remuneration is determined within limits set by resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders. It encompasses base monthly remuneration, performance-linked bonuses determined by results for the scal year and other factors, and restricted stock compensation (medium-term performance-linked and long-term) introduced in scal 2018. Outside directors only receive base remuneration. Base monthly remuneration is determined according to the position and responsibilities of directors with due consideration for the operating environment and global trends. Bonuses are short-term incentives based on a calculation matrix linked to performance, including the achievement of prot targets in each scal year. Stock compensation is awarded based on a similar matrix of directors' positions and roles. In particular, medium-term performance-linked compensation is aimed at encouraging directors to pursue continuous enhancement of corporate value by further increasing the linkage between director compensation and medium- and long-term business performance, while at the same time further promoting value sharing with shareholders. Performance targets include net sales and operating income, driven mostly by new products and core businesses, as well as return on equity (ROE) and the growth rate of total shareholder return (TSR) relative to competitor companies. These indicators were determined after a comprehensive evaluation of factors such as quantitative targets in the medium-term business plan and operational issues, and are premised on the Company achieving the vision laid out in its medium-term business plan, which is to \"grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare.\" Base remuneration accounted for approximately 75% of total remuneration in scal 2013, but less than 50% in the last scal year. We aim to further reduce the proportion of base remuneration to about 40%. Total corporate auditors' remuneration is determined within limits set by resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders. It is made up entirely of base monthly remuneration. Shionogi has established a Compensation Advisory Committee to support the Board of Directors in an advisory role. Chaired by an outside director and comprised of a majority of outside directors, this Committee deliberates thoroughly on the subject of directors' remuneration.Based on the above, we conclude that the Board of Directors is operating appropriately and effectively. We will use the results of this self-evaluation as a basis for continuous improvements to make the Board of Directors even more effective.

Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 63Teppei Mogi Independent Outside Director Ten years have now passed since your appointment as an independent outside director. Could you comment on how Shionogi has changed in that time? During those ten years, Shionogi has developed and launched a steady stream of (mostly proprietary) new drugs, all the while spending less on R&D than major global pharmaceutical companies. As a consequence, Shionogi has evolved into a highly protable company, in my view. At the time of my appointment, Shionogi faced an enormous challenge in determining how to overcome the so-called \" Crestor Cliff\" (referring to the expiration of patents for the cholesterol-lowering drug Crestor in 2016-2017). In the end, the company was able to surmount this crisis through global expansion of its HIV franchise. I believe this was no coincidence, but rather the consequence of a careful plan comprising far-sighted concentration of resources on new drug candidates, and selection of the globalization strategy deemed best suited to Shionogi. Just as expansion of the HIV franchise has buoyed Shionogi earnings, I expect to see a similar contribution from the development and global rollout of Xofluza , an flu drug. On the other hand, while Shionogi has worked tirelessly over those ten years to build a global presence, progress has not always been smooth. It is critical, in my view, that Shionogi continues to launch proprietary drugs both domestically and in overseas (including emerging) markets, with a view to helping more people achieve better health while at the same time generating prots for the company. I believe Shionogi must draw on its experiences thus far to pursue further globalization. How would you evaluate Shionogi's corporate governance? In that ten-year period, companies have become more cognizant of the importance of corporate governance. Shionogi is a front-runner in this respect, which I understand has earned it plaudits from the various stakeholders. The Shionogi Group has appointed a total of six outside ofcers (both directors and corporate auditors), many with extensive experience at other companies, and these individuals engage in a frank exchange of opinions at Board of Directors meetings. Because of the highly specialized nature of the pharmaceutical industry, it is difcult for these outside ofcers to contribute directly to the scientic aspect of Shionogi's business. At Board of Directors meetings, though, the outside ofcers receive regular updates from those directly responsible for operations, and they furthermore partic-Q 1 Q 3 Q 2Q 4Interviews with independent outside directors and corporate auditors ipate in debate over important management decisions. Therefore, I believe that Shionogi effectively handles the separation of management and business execution. As a lawyer, I am particularly interested in the company's compliance system. I have observed that top management is constantly impressing upon employees the importance of compliance, and it seems the message is getting through; in my years as an outside ofcer, I have never once witnessed a major problem from a compliance perspective. There is always room for improvement, though. Going forward I would like to see the company build a global compliance system that is even more effective and more united, extending to overseas Group companies. Please describe your overall impression of the Board of Directors' management and discussions. As noted in my response to the second question, those responsible for business execution make timely and appropriate reports on operational progress and challenges. This ensures candid debate over important management decisions among the Board of Directors, including outside corporate auditors. At Board meetings, I am always astounded at the level of intuition demonstrated by individuals whose experience in top management comes from industries other than pharmaceuticals. Fortunately, earnings have grown steadily over the past ten years and the Board of Directors has never been called on to make choices that could alter the fate of the company. Even if such a situation arose, I am condent that the Board of Directors would be able to reach the appropriate decision after suitable debate. What are your expectations for Shionogi over the next ten years? The business climate surrounding drug companies is by no means favorable, given the global trend toward curtailing healthcare expenditure. For Shionogi to leverage its drug discovery and development capabilities and generate high prots against this backdrop, I think it remains important for the company to single out and selectively invest in leading-edge drug seeds deemed to have long-term potential, with a focus on elds in which Shionogi can excel. In this respect, I have high hopes for the company's numerous peptide discovery programs in the area of medium-sized molecules. From the standpoint of social contribution, too, I have high expectations for actualization of Shionogi's mission to \"protect people from the threat of infectious diseases.\" In a world in which healthcare is becoming ever more sophisticated, there remain people without access to even the most basic forms of medicine, including prevention of infectious diseases. By contributing to better health for such people, I believe Shionogi can further enhance its global reputation while at the same time increasing corporate value over the longer term. Over the next ten years I think it will be important for the Company to determine how best to pursue further globalization through the worldwide supply of pharmaceuticals bearing the Shionogi name. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 64Strengthening governanceStronger corporate governance and adherence to Japan's Stewardship Code have become increasingly important for companies looking to achieve sustained growth, expand corporate value, and discharge their social responsibilities to the full extent. As a leading-edge drug discovery company aspiring to ensure optimum health and realize a safe and secure society, I think Shionogi bears a particularly heavy responsibility. The Company's Board of Directors already is committed to fair and transparent decision-making informed by lively exchanges of ideas and searching questions, and it is actively engaging in improvements to corporate governance. If Shionogi is to achieve ongoing growth and evolution as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, I think it is crucial also that the Company continue to steadily and resolutely implement management strategies and business plans that take a medium- to long-term stance on R&D investment, human resources, and so forth. As an outside director, I aim to draw on my extensive knowledge and wide-ranging experience as an executive in the eld of nance and accounting to make an active contribution to fair and transparent management, to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. I was appointed to the post of outside director on June 18, 2019. In addition to serving as an executive for an integrated energy company based in Kansai, I also have chaired the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry since December 2015, where my contributions have included industry promotion aimed at furthering the growth and development of Osaka and Kansai, support for SMEs, and town planning. In my view, an outside director's most important mission is to express an independent opinion on whether or not company management is discharging its responsibilities to stakeholders\u2014whether they be customers, communities, employees, or shareholders and investors\u2014in a fair and equitable manner. At the same time, I aim to support the Company in its various initiatives to address future challenges and enhance corporate value. To ensure that Shionogi retains its reputation as an excellent pharmaceutical company and exemplary member of society, I aim to continue drawing on the experience and expertise I have gleaned to date, to provide appropriate advice with respect to crucial management decisions, and contribute to growing the company and raising management standards. I have been involved with many companies over the years, in the role of accounting auditor as a Certied Public Accountant, and more recently in the role of outside director for several listed companies. As a newly appointed independent outside corporate auditor, my goal this year is to deepen my understanding of Shionogi's basic policy and operations, while at the same time leveraging my professional expertise in nance and accounting to ascertain whether any matters are in particular need of review, whether or not migration to International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) is proceeding apace, whether or not information is being appropriately disclosed to shareholders, and whether or not Shionogi initiatives related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are adequately covered in publications including our annual Integrated Report. From an operational perspective, too, I am keen to assess whether or not the R&D pipeline is being replen-ished sufciently, whether or not there is timely recognition of impairment losses on intangible assets, and whether or not the changing times dictate improvement in such areas as risk identication and management, as well as governance and internal controls. To that end, I plan to maintain an open dialog with those involved. As an outside ofcer, I think that in meetings of the Board of Directors and Board of Auditors, my role is to say things that internal ofcers cannot say, and comment on any issues that appear to have gone unnoticed. QQ Could you describe your aspirations as a newly appointed outside director? What role do you envision for yourself in addressing challenges faced by Shionogi?

He promoted the First Medium-Term Business Plan and Second Medium-Term Business Plan, and laid a foundation for generating prots. Since becoming Representative Director and Chairman in 2008, he has focused on further enhancing the operation of Board of Directors meetings and contributed substantially to energizing the Board of Directors as Chairman of the Board, such as by fostering an environment that enables outside directors to actively express their opinions and requests, and by enhancing the quality and quantity of information provided. He also has appropriately supervised management's business execution. Shionogi therefore continues to reappoint Mr. Shiono as a Director.Dr. Isao Teshirogi became Representative Director and President and CEO in 2008. He has pushed forward with global research and development and expansion of overseas business in Europe and Asia to achieve the goals of the Third Medium-Term Business Plan, and secured a medium- to-long-term prot foundation through globally competitive drug discovery capabilities and evolution of the Company's royalty business model. Given the steady achievement of the quantitative targets in the Medium-Term Business Plan SGS2020, which was formulated in scal 2014, he carried out an update of SGS2020 in October 2016. As part of that update, he set new quantitative targets from the perspectives of growth, efciency and shareholder returns. These targets also were achieved ahead of schedule, particularly prot targets. Based on these results, Shionogi continues to reappoint Dr. Teshirogi as a director, in the belief that he can make the Company \"grow sustainably as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company contributing to a more vigorous society through improved healthcare.\" Since her appointment as a Director of the Company in 2015, Ms. Takuko Sawada has been responsible for business execution of the Corporate Strategy Division as Senior Vice President of the Corporate Strategy Division and as a Senior Executive Ofcer.

Shionogi therefore continues to reappoint Mr. Mogi as an Outside Director. At Board of Directors meetings, he provides legal points and suggestions on protection of intellectual property, raises concerns about business tie-ups, and offers advice on corporate governance, risk management and compliance systems, including those of overseas subsidiaries.

Shionogi therefore continues to reappoint Mr. Kato as a Corporate Auditor.Mr. Shinichi Yokoyama has extensive experience and broad insight as a corporate executive, and makes appropriate recommendations on directors' management decisions and performance of duties from an independent standpoint as a Corporate Auditor. He was appointed as an Outside Corporate Auditor.At meetings of the Board of Directors and Board of Auditors, he makes appropriate recommendations on management decisions and performance of duties mainly related to nance and accounting, from a professional standpoint based on his extensive experience and broad insight as a corporate executive at a nancial institution. His insight into pharmaceuticals and the pharmaceutical industry has deepened, and he makes observations indicating the direction the Company should take for the future in a wide range of areas, including advice on the product portfolio and product strategy and opinions on improving the risk management system.Akira Okamoto Standing Members of the Board of AuditorsIkuo Kato Standing Members of the Board of AuditorsShinichi Yokoyama Independent Outside Corporate Auditors Shionogi Integrated Report professional expertise in nance and accounting. He has held the important post of Chairman and Advisor of the Japanese Institute of Certied Public Accountants, as well as a number of public ofces, and has extensive experience and broad insight as an outside director and outside corporate auditor. He has not been involved in company management in any capacity other than as an outside director or outside corporate auditor, but based on his experience as a certied public accountant, we believe that he is eminently qualied to carry out audits of the Company from the viewpoint of nance and accounting. Shionogi appointed Mr. Fujinuma because we expect that he will reflect this experience in audits of the Company, with respect to the appropriateness of directors' management decisions and execution of duties, from an independent point of view as an Outside Corporate Auditor.

We make every effort in our daily business activities to contribute to all stakeholders. In the course of these business activities, we believe it is important to always ask ourselves \"For whom does a company exist?\" and to interact in the most balanced manner possible with our four stakeholder groups: (1) shareholders and investors, (2) customers, (3) society, and (4) employees. Based on this belief, we have formulated Shionogi's Action Guidelines and the Shionogi Charter of Conduct, which are our codes of conduct, as well as the Shionogi Group Compliance Policy as a standard for compliance.

Based on this recognition, the Company discloses information to all stakeholders in a fair, timely, appropriate and continuous manner. In our communication with shareholders and investors, the Company subscribes to a spirit of fair disclosure. In addition to disclosing information fairly and at the appropriate time, management and the department in charge of investor relations cooperate in proactive initiatives to promote sustained growth and increase corporate value over the medium and long term. In addition, we have created a system to encourage closer cooperation among departments, facilitating dialog regarding issues including management strategy, shares, investor relations, nance, and ESG. We also have appointed an ofcer to oversee this system.

This enables us to quickly provide accurate information regarding the quality, efcacy, and safety of our products. In scal 2018, we received roughly 73,000 inquiries, including approximately 21,000 inquiries concerning Xofluza , for which Shionogi received manufacturing and marketing approval on February 23, 2018, after selection as a candidate for Sakigake designation system* 1. We believe we assist in patient treatment by responding accurately and quickly to pleas for the urgent provision of information. The Drug Information Center is the contact point for customers. It collects valuable information through inquiries, and shares this with relevant departments to work on improving the quality of products by rectifying problems and strengthening risk management. Looking ahead, Shionogi will continue to provide information promptly and accurately, in order to contribute to the health of as many patients as possible while further promoting optimal use of information. *1 Sakigake designation system: A part of Japan's Revitalization Strategy, this sys- tem designates pharmaceutical products that are being developed ahead of oth-er countries and have shown exceptional clinical efcacy in the early clinical trial stage. It is aimed at facilitating their early commercialization through various kinds of support. Engagement with employees Morale survey measuring employee satisfaction From 2009, Shionogi periodically conducts a morale survey for the purpose of keeping tabs on employee satisfaction and reflecting the results in personnel policies. In the most recent survey, the employee satisfaction score of 3.93 not only surpassed the benchmark score of 3.68 for leading companies in Japan, but also demonstrated improvement over the previous score of 3.91. SING of the Year awards As a means of globally recognizing and awarding activities that embody the Company Policy, we have presented the \"SING of the Year\" awards every year since 2012. Through this initiative we seek to set in place and promote a \"culture of recognition,\" in order to boost employee motivation and further strengthen our organization. Exchange of opinions with directors We hold opinion exchange meetings that aid in resolving employees' concerns by providing an opportunity to communicate directly with directors regarding management policy and issues. These meetings also allow rank-and-file employees to express their opinions, which may then contribute to policy enhancement. Labor festivals At Shionogi there is a favorable relationship between the labor union and management. Labor festivals held annually across Japan are attended by many employees including directors, with employees' families also welcome. These events help to foster a sense of unity by promoting communication between labor and management. Engagement with society Socie, our social contribution support association Shionogi established Socie as a social contribution support association in 1997. The Company, its employees and the employee labor union cooperate in supporting Socie members' voluntary social contribution activities. Management and employees work together in carrying out social contribution activities, using funds provided by Shionogi and the labor union at the time Socie was established, and through monthly contributions from employees and the Company. Socie provides assistance to areas affected by earthquakes, storms, volcanic eruptions, and other disasters, as well as to surrounding regions in Japan and overseas. It also makes annual donations to groups that contribute to society, such as the Japanese Red Cross Society and the Japan Guide Dog Association.Commemorating 2,700th Broadcast of Shionogi Music Fair Since August 1964, Shionogi has sponsored the music program Shionogi Music Fair, which airs on Saturdays from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM on a television station associated with Fuji Television Network. To commemorate the 2,700th broadcast in 2018, the show was taped in front of a live audience. Going forward, the Company will continue to sponsor high-quality musical programs that help promote the musical culture of Japan as one way to contribute to society. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 71Strengthening risk management Shionogi continues work on building an internal management system in accordance with the Shionogi Group Risk Management Policy established in 2015. With the October 2018 establishment of Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd. to take charge of manufacturing operations, we redoubled efforts to thoroughly raise awareness about the aforementioned policy among existing group companies as well, in order to facilitate business continuity. We are also working toward an organizational climate and culture that brings to light risks with potential to threaten business continuity, and ensures the timely reporting to management of all manner of information by Group companies and organizations. Chaired by the General Manager of the Corporate Strategy Division, which oversees groupwide risk management activities, the Corporate Strategy Meeting is a key discussion body for all manner of risks affecting operations. In this manner, every Shionogi employee endeavors to protect and make effective use of the Group's valuable business assets, through groupwide risk management activities and a constant and high level of risk awareness. Crisis management system Under our Crisis Management Standard, which serves as the basic policy for crisis management, Shionogi aims to build a comprehensive crisis management system that includes guidelines for various countermeasures and accompanying manuals, and enables rapid response in the event of an emergency. Shionogi places the highest priority on employee safety conrmation in the event of a huge natural disaster, and mandates regular training using the safety conrmation system, as well as stockpiling in case of emergency and reviews of disaster task forces, both centrally and at each business site. In scal 2018 there were a number of natural disasters wreaking extensive damage, prompting a further review of disaster task forces (in terms of both organization and manuals), and additional stockpiling. Business continuity planning (BCP) Shionogi formulates business continuity plans (BCPs) for each link in the value chain, so that we can continue to fulll our corporate social responsibility and supply our products and services to medical institutions in a stable manner even in the event of an emergency. With respect to the supply of pharmaceutical products, in scal 2018 we established Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd. to take charge of manufacturing operations. At that time we conducted a BCP review, resulting in a rebuild of both our risk management system and business continuity management system. In addition to the above, we regularly conduct training at both the management and front-line levels to ensure the ongoing viability of operations.Risk management system Business continuity management systemPerform risk analysis Assess business continuity management risksIdentify priority risks Identify important operations Analyze business impactBCP management outline BCPMonitor status of risk response Conduct inventory of business resources at important operations Conduct BCP training Response procedures (initial response)Audit BCMS Recovery procedures (provisional and full) Plan and implement risk response Assign order of priority to products Formulate business continuity strategyConduct risk inventory and create risk register Manifestation of risk covered by BCMS Implementation of BCP Initial response RecoveryOverview of risk management system and business continuity management systemShionogi Group Risk Management Policy http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/policy/riskm.html Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 72Strengthening governanceRisk category Risk description Systemic and Regulatory RiskIn the pharmaceutical industry, revisions to Japan's National Health Insurance (NHI) system are being considered, including revisions to the NHI drug price system. These trends could affect the results of Shionogi. In addition, tougher Japanese and overseas regulations in areas such as the development and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals could present us with additional expenses or make it difcult for its products to comply with regulations. This could impact our performance. Risk of Adverse Drug ReactionsPharmaceuticals entail the risk of unanticipated adverse drug reactions that could lead to the termination of sales, product recalls, and other outcomes that could affect the results of Shionogi. Pharmaceutical R&D RiskPharmaceutical R&D requires substantial commitment of resources and time. In addition, new drugs are subject to numerous uncertainties prior to the start of actual sales. Intellectual Property RiskShionogi uses patents as intellectual property to protect the pharmaceuticals it discovers and generate income from them. However, the various types of intellectual property may be unable to provide adequate protection, or may infringe on the intellectual property of third parties. Furthermore, the expiry of intellectual property rights (patents) of pharmaceuticals developed by Shionogi or the launch of generics after such expiry could affect the results of Shionogi. Risk of Dependence on Certain ProductsXofluza and Cymbalta product sales and royalty income from Tivicay, Triumeq and Juluca roughly account for a combined 48% of net sales (scal year ended March 31, 2019). If an unexpected factor were to cause a drop in or the discontinuation of the sales of one of these products, this could impact our performance. Risk of Alliances with Other CompaniesShionogi engages in diverse forms of alliances with other companies with respect to joint research, development and marketing, and other activities. These alliances include collaboration with research and development projects, in and out licensing of technologies and also marketing. If such collaboration were to either change or cease, it could impact our performance. Risk of Natural Disasters or PandemicsThe sudden occurrence of a natural disaster, pandemic, or other unforeseen incident could lead to the closure of plants, laboratories or other business sites, which could affect the results of Shionogi. Capital Market and Foreign Exchange RiskFluctuations in stock and foreign exchange markets that exceed the projected range could affect the results and nancial position of Shionogi. Litigation RiskThrough its business activities, Shionogi is exposed to the risk of litigation related to medication side effects, product liability, workplace disputes, fair trading and other issues. Litigation in those and other areas could affect the results of Shionogi.Business and other risks Below, we list and outline the main types of risk that could have a signicant impact on Shionogi's operations. The below list does not include all risks to which the Shionogi Group is exposed; other potential risks include political and economic factors affecting business activities, as well as IT security and information management. Forward-looking statements in the text reflect the Group's judgment as of March 31, 2019.

The Compliance Unit sits within the CSR Department, and provides support for compliance initiatives proposed by the Compliance Committee as well as undertaking a variety of activities including compliance training and surveys. In cooperation with the Compliance Unit, compliance managers (head of each organization) work together with compliance promoters (at least one appointed from each department) on devising compliance initiatives specic to each department or unit. Employees who have served as compliance promoters for at least three years are recognized as \"compliance masters\" by Shionogi, as a means of further strengthening compliance and raising awareness across the company. In June 2019, a total of 172 employees were recognized as compliance masters.Strict compliance Shionogi Compliance Handbook Shionogi Group Compliance Policy http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/compliance/compliance_02.html Shionogi Group Anti-Corruption/Anti-bribery Policy http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/compliance/compliance_03.html Guidelines for The Prevention of Corruption/Bribery for Shionogi Business Partners http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/compliance/compliance_04.htmlClinical Trial Data Transparency Policy http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/policy/clinical-trial.htmlEthical considerations in animal experiments http://www.shionogi.co.jp/en/company/policy/animal.htmlAt Shionogi, compliance remains our No. 1 priority\u2014in short, the basis for company survival. Compliance in Shionogi means compliance not only with laws, rules and regulations, but also with social standards, and it also includes ethical behavior. This approach underpins every aspect of our business. We have published the Shionogi Group Compliance Policy, under which all directors and employees are required to comply with laws and regulations as well as practicing ethical behavior. We also have published both Japanese and English versions of the Shionogi Compliance Handbook, which sets behavioral criteria to be observed in the course of daily operations. In this manner, we are striving to deepen understanding and recognition of the importance of compliance across the Group as a whole. Our intention is for all employees to consistently hold themselves to the highest ethical standards in order to support sustained growth for Shionogi.Ensuring complianceMaterial Issues to Realize a Sustainable Society and Support Shionogi's Growth Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 74Ensuring high ethical standards and transparency in business activitiesCompliance promotion initiatives The Compliance Committee meets four times a year to report on and debate compliance-related matters, also preparing reports for the Corporate Executive Meeting and the twice-yearly Board of Directors meetings. Compliance managers work together with compliance promoters on the preparation of compliance risk management (CRM) action plans specic to each department or unit, following a Plan-Do-Check-Act model. Through these activities, Shionogi aims to achieve company wide observation of compliance principles. In order to identify and address compliance issues, we also conducts regular compliance awareness surveys among directors and employees in the Group. These surveys provide insight into the understanding and penetration of compliance, which can then be reflected in the aforementioned CRM planning, for a solution that encompasses the entire corporate culture. Shionogi moreover offers regular compliance training for compliance managers and promoters, where Compliance Committee chairman expounds on the importance of compliance while seeking to promote greater awareness and understanding. We also regularly provide rank-specic and role-specic training for division heads and executives as well as personal information management ofcers, in addition to offering periodic training for all employees on such subjects as information security, pharma - ceutical safety, harassment, and bribery. Initiatives to improve transparency Pharmaceutical companies around the world are facing increased scrutiny of their data reliability in clinical trials and transparency for the relation between corporate activities and medical institu-tions. In addition to complying with laws and ordinances, Shionogi aims to maintain the trust of society by observing the industry's self-imposed norms. As an additional measure, we have formulated original guidelines based on even higher ethical standards. Shionogi has formulated \"Transparency Guidelines for the Relationship between Corporate Activities and Medical Institutions,\" \"Transparency Guidelines for the Relationship between Corporate Activities and Patient Associations,\" and \"The Shionogi Code of Practice,\" in order to maintain high ethical standards and transparency. This includes the appro-priate disclosure of funding provided to medical professionals and medical institutions. In the view that fair dealings and fair competition are one of essential elements of compliance, in 2014 the Company also enacted the \"Shionogi Group Anti-corruption/Anti-bribery Policy,\" which is a clear policy statement prohibiting corruption including the payment of bribes. The Company furthermore has formulated \"Guidelines for the Prevention of Corruption/Bribery for Shionogi Business Partners,\" which outlines the compliance requirements to be observed by Shionogi business partners in the hope of further strengthening systems for preventing acts of corruption and/or bribery. R&D ethics In the drug discovery research, Shionogi has a policy entitled \"Ethical Considerations in Animal Experiments,\" which sets out to ensure that proper consideration is given to animal welfare by scientically verifying that animal-use protocols are in accordance with the internationally recognized \"principles of the 3Rs (replacement with alternative methods, reduction in the use of laboratory animals, and renement of methods for reducing pain).\" To further enhance the quality of animal experimenters, Shionogi also conducts regular education and training sessions for the employees involved, on appropriate methods for animal experimentation as well as for the breeding and upkeep of experimental animals. When it comes to clinical development, Shionogi endeavors to ensure the safety of participants in clinical trials while also maintaining transparency through appropriate disclosure in accordance with our Clinical Trial Data Transparency Policy. Establishment of internal reporting system Shionogi has established an internal reporting system comprising an internal reporting desk and an external reporting desk. We are making every effort to have this system known and used not just by employees but also by third parties, to promote the early discovery as well as prevention and amelioration of compliance violations. To provide an avenue for consultation on compliance issues, Shionogi furthermore provides all directors and employees with emergency and helpline contact details including those for the reporting desks. Please refer to page 55 for further details on how Shionogi strives to ensure the safety of participants in clinical trials. Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 75Vision of Pharmaceutical Research DivisionInnovation in drug discovery to meet societal needs As a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, Shionogi considers the original pipeline ratio to be important. At the same time, we believe it is impossible to consistently create better drugs when bound by preconceived ideas. We aim to establish new approaches to drug discovery that draw on various ideas from both inside and outside the Company. Strategy for achieving our visionLeverage strength in small molecule drug discoveryPharmaceutical Research Division keyword 1 Medium molecule drugskeyword 2 Open innovationkeyword 3 Encouraging sense of adventure in researchers Hopes are high that \"medium molecule drugs\" such as nucleic acid drugs and peptides will produce the next generation of pharmaceuticals. At Shionogi, we aim to harness the chemical technologies and expertise we have developed in the eld of small molecule drug discovery, and apply these also to the discovery of medium molecule drugs.Shionogi has sought to promote collaborative research with partners, by such means as joining the UK's Cambridge Therapeutic Consortium. We look to accelerate innovation by combining our drug discovery capabilities with the intellectual know-how of academic institutions.Innovation tends to be lacking when research is just a job. To instill in our researchers a true sense of adventure, Shionogi evaluates not only research results but also the processes. Furthermore, we have established a novel program dubbed \"Y Collaboration\" that encourages individuals to independently search out and propose collaborative research partners. Vision of CMC R&D DivisionResearch and development of original CMC technology: Creating valuable products meeting societal needs The CMC R&D Division contributes from a total healthcare perspective to the creation of innovative products with potential to full societal medi- cal needs. In order to develop such innovative products, the Division undertakes CMC research and works to acquire new CMC technologies to augment its existing scientic base. By maximizing use of partnerships both inside and outside of Shionogi, the CMC R&D Division strives to bring new value to the healthcare eld, transcending traditional paradigms for pharmaceutical development. Strategy for achieving our visionGrow the Company by developing better people, technology, and partnerships CMC R&D Division keyword 1 Fostering well-rounded employeeskeyword 2 Providing new solutions for drug discovery researchkeyword 3 Pursuing even higher levels of expertise Shionogi takes a proactive stance toward education aimed at building well-rounded employees, including an exchange program offering training at Shionogi Inc. in the US, and rotation between different divisions.Shionogi has been able to use CMC technologies to achieve breakthroughs, improving the body's absorption of chemical compounds that had a pharmacological effect but were difcult to the body to absorb. The CMC R&D Division seeks to continue providing new solutions through involvement from the drug discovery research stage.Shionogi seeks to create new value through the use of sophisticated CMC technologies for such tasks as developing products that are as effective as possible in meeting patient needs, identifying the synthetic routes best suited to reducing COGs* 1, and developing new analytical solutions premised on cutting-edge technology. *1 COGs: Cost of goods soldIn the process of creating new drugs and delivering them to patients, a pharmaceutical company must rely on contributions from multiple business divisions. At Shionogi, every link in the value chain\u2014from research (drug discovery and CMC), to development, manufacturing, and sales\u2014has its own vision and formulates strategies to achieve the goals contained therein, working together when necessary to realize those objectives and in doing so consistently creating new value.Shionogi's business: value chain Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 76Vision of Global Development DivisionEfcient and consistent development for the good of patients around the world By 2020, we aim to have launched 10 or more products globally. To that end, we seek to maintain a high rate of success in conrmatory (Phase 3) clinical trials by swiftly and accurately identifying compound attributes during early-stage clinical trials, in order to make a science-based go/no-go decision. We furthermore plan to contribute to maximizing product value by extending our data collection horizons beyond what is needed for regulatory submissions, to also include data supporting post-launch marketing. Strategy for achieving our visionBuild a framework for independently creating and offering pipeline products globallyGlobal Development Division keyword 1 Use of big datakeyword 2 Strengthening global operationskeyword 3 Global Development Division headquartered in Japan Further improvement in productivity is key to realizing this vision. Shionogi works constantly on achieving greater efciency in clinical trials, using real-world data for such purposes as identifying suitable clinical trial participants and creating influenza transmission models.Shionogi is building a global development framework spanning Japan, the US, and Europe, to facilitate speedy and high-quality development. Under a shared global development policy with Shionogi Inc. in the US and Shionogi B.V. in Europe, Shionogi is endeavoring to globalize its operating team.In an era marked by growth in global clinical trials, the Global Development Division within the parent company in Japan fulls the important role of managing development projects across our global sites. As headquarters for Shionogi's global operation, the Division is charged with ensuring that the Company's know-how is world-class, and conducting high-quality clinical trials. Achievements in fiscal 2018: Progress of our next growth drivers and expansion of pipeline and technology through investment toward sustained growth R&D is an integral part of being a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, and in this respect we positioned scal 2018 as a year in which to develop growth drivers for 2020 and beyond. Overall, we made steady progress in R&D, aided by active investment in eight high-priority projects. Over and above our typical budget for R&D, we set aside a special budget of \u00a520 billion for strategic R&D investment, entering into 10 new strategic collaborations with a view to building a stronger development pipeline for the medium and long term. Please refer to page 29 for details of strategic collaborations.

In the eld of infectious diseases, we created a novel flu drug candidate, while in frontier areas (disease areas other than the core therapeutic areas of infectious diseases, pain, and CNS disorders), we created a drug candidate for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). CMC Research: Contribution to maximizing value of new development candidates In CMC research, we succeeded in improvement of API purity and formulation stabilization for cederocol, a candidate for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infec-tions, accelerating its development ahead of a planned launch in the US. We also pursued development of a commercial inhalation device in preparation for the launch of S-770108 (pirfenidone inhalant), a treatment candidate for idiopathic pulmonary brosis. In trials, our inhaler demonstrated compet-itive results relative to rival devices from other companies.Steady advances by development products In scal 2018, Shionogi also progressed development of late-stage development products, achieving steady advances both domestically and overseas. Most notably, we led for approval of the flu drug Xofluza in the US and obtained approval on October 24, two months earlier than planned. As a result, alliance partner Roche was able to begin marketing before the start of the flu season.

By endeavoring to do so in a far more productive manner, Shionogi can secure a future for our drug discovery research and development activities. Shionogi strives to meet the nation's increasingly diverse medical needs by supporting the government's communi-ty-based healthcare approach through the provision of information tailored to specic communities. Strategy for achieving our visionBuild highly efcient sales model while at the same time strengthening organization and human resourcesHuman Health Care Division keyword 1 Incorporation of IT into sales activitieskeyword 2 Support for MRs' provision of informationkeyword 3 Human resource development Basic information on drugs is accessible to all, via channels such as the internet. As such, medical professionals rely on MRs to provide more specialized knowledge. Shionogi strives to enhance the quality of information provided through use of IT to monitor, analyze, and verify MRs' daily activities, to aid in identifying customers' needs in advance.For MRs to respond to customers' increasingly diverse needs, they require not only information and knowl-edge, but also the ability to convey this appropriately. At Shionogi, we have established a code of practice for information dissemination, based on new guidelines on ethical drug detailing activities issued by the MHLW in 2018. We are also using these guidelines and code of practice to identify opportunities for improvement, in order to better serve our customers' needs.In order to develop the human resources needed to facilitate Shionogi's future growth, the Human Health Care Division uses various activities both inside and outside the company to instill in employees critical thinking skills and the ability to take action. We are now seeing employees draw on that experience in their engagement with local communities and by generic competitors hit a plateau in 1H FY2018Sales-growth phase by our own earnings power Sep: Launch of Crestor authorized generic Dec: Launch prescription drugs in Japan (YoY comparison) Sales of new products Increased 52.8% YoY (Billions of yen)Achievements in fiscal 2018: Growth in domestic business Concentration of management resources led to increased sales of strategic products, driving domestic sales higherIn domestic sales of prescription drugs, Shionogi focused its management resources on strategic products, primarily Cymbalta As a result, sales of strategic products were \u00a567.8 billion (rising 63.1% year on year) and sales of new products amounted to \u00a573.8 billion (rising 52.8% year on year). Sales of Xofluza , the flu drug launched in March 2018, were \u00a526.3 billion. Sales growth turned positive on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter because of growth in the aforementioned strategic products along with a diminishing impact from the launch of generic versions of Crestor and Irbetan in the previous scal year. During scal 2018, Shionogi reorganized its domestic sales operations, and set up a \"Specialty Product Ofce\" for specialty With that reorgani- zation, Shionogi established a structure that will enhance its expertise in specialty products and allow management resources to be further focused on strategic products with a large market size.

Strategy for achieving our visionMaximize product value through a combination of in-house sales, business alliances, and export operationsGlobal Business DivisionShionogi's business: value chain Achievements in fiscal 2018: Growth of overseas business Maximizing product value through both in-house sales and alliances In the US, in April 2019, Shionogi entered a new marketing agreement for Symproic with BioDelivery Systems International (BDSI). On our own, Shionogi Inc. launched Mulpleta in the US, a treatment for thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. In Europe, Shionogi obtained regulatory approval for both Rizmoic (sold under the brand name Symproic in Japan and the US) and Mulpleta . We have entered into multiple sales alliances for Rizmoic , with Sandoz responsible for sales in Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands, Molteni Farmaceutici covering Italy and Poland, and Ferrer as our partner in Spain. In China, too, Shionogi has forged new alliances, licensing both Mulpleta and the anticancer agent epertinib to the Edding- pharm Group. By combining in-house sales with a range of alliances with highly respected partners with complementary capabilities, the Global Business Division seeks to maximize the value of Shionogi products. Our overseas sales have shown growth above the prior-year in all major regions, and rigorous cost management has brought the US business into the black in 2018 after years of operating losses. Globally speaking, we are continuing to build a foundation for business expansion, with the next key step being progression of cederocol through the regulatory approval process in the US and Europe.

Based on this change in the product mix, the CCC target for scal 2020 was changed from 5.5 months previously to 7.0 months. With cooperation from manufacturing subsidiary Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd., established in April 2019, the Group is working as one to control inventories and shorten the CCC. * Return on equity: Prot attributable to owners of parent \u00f7 (Shareholders' equity + accumulated other comprehensive income) \u00d7 100 (%) * Return on invested capital: After-tax operating income \u00f7 (Interest bearing debt + Shareholders' equity + Non-controlling interests) \u00d7 100 (%)* Cash conversion cycle: The number of days between investing cash (for raw materials, product purchases, etc.) and the time when that is ultimately converted into cash again.

2019Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 931. Basis of Preparation The accompanying consolidated fi nancial statements of Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (the \"Company\") and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Group\") are prepared on the basis of account- ing principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure require- ments of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated fi nancial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan. In preparing the accompanying consolidated fi nancial statements, certain reclassifi cations have been made to the consolidated fi nancial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a format which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, the notes to the consolidated fi nancial state- ments include certain information which is not required under accounting principles generally accepted in Japan but is pre- sented herein as additional information. Certain amounts in the prior year's fi nancial statements have been reclassifi ed to conform to the current year's presentation. Such reclassifi cations had no effect on consolidated profi t or net assets. 2. Summary of Signifi cant Accounting Policies (a) Principles of consolidation and accounting for investments in affi liates The accompanying consolidated fi nancial statements include the accounts of the Company and all companies controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. The Company has not applied the equity method to its investments in seven affi liates, including TAKATA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., for the purpose of the consolidated fi nancial state- ments for the year ended March 31, 2019 since the effects on profi t and retained earnings on the accompanying consolidated fi nancial statements were immaterial. Investments in affi liates not accounted for by the equity method are carried at cost. All signifi cant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The fi scal year end of seventeen overseas consolidated subsidiaries is December 31, which is different from that of the Company. These subsidiaries are consolidated by using the fi nancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31. The fi scal year end of one overseas consolidated subsidiary is June 30, which is different from that of the Company. For consoli- dation purposes, fi nancial statements for this subsidiary are prepared as of and for the year ended December 31. For such overseas consolidated subsidiaries, adjustments have been made for any signifi cant transactions taking place during the period from January 1 to March 31. (b) Foreign currency translation All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and the gain or loss on each translation is credited or charged to income. Revenue and expense items arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are generally translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the respective transac- tion dates. Gain or loss on foreign exchange is credited or charged to income in the period in which such gain or loss is recognized for fi nancial reporting purposes. Assets and liabilities of the overseas consolidated subsidiar-ies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries are translated into yen at the average exchange rates. The components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests are translated at their historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from translating the foreign currency fi nancial statements are not included in the determination of profi t or loss and are reported as \"Translation adjustments\" in accumulated other comprehensive income and \"Non-controlling interests\" in the consolidated balance sheet. (c) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and in banks and other highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to cash subject to an insignifi cant risk of any change in value and which were purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. (d) Short-term investments and investments in securities Securities are classifi ed into three categories: trading securities, held-to-maturity debt securities or other securities. Trading securities, consisting of debt and marketable equity securities, are stated at fair value. Gain and loss, both realized and unreal-ized, are charged to income. Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost. Marketable securities classifi ed as other securities are carried at fair value with any changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, reported as a separate component of net assets. Cost of securi-ties sold is determined by the moving average method. Non-marketable securities classifi ed as other securities are carried at cost determined by the moving average method. Investments in investment partnerships are stated at the amount of net assets attributable to the ownership percentage of the Company. (e) Money in trust for cash management Money in trust for cash management is carried at fair value. (f) Derivatives Derivatives are carried at fair value. (g) Inventories Inventories are principally stated at lower of cost, determined by the average method, or net selling value. (h) Property, plant and equipment (other than leased assets) Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are sum-marized as follows: Buildings and structures 2 to 60 years Machinery, equipment and vehicles 2 to 17 yearsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries March 31, 2019Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 94 Significant r enewals and additions are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. (i) Intangible assets (other than leased assets) Amortization of intangible assets is calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Expenditur es relating to computer software developed for internal use are charged to income as incurred unless these are deemed to contribute to the generation of future income or cost savings. Such expenditures are capitalized as assets and amor-tized by the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives, generally a period of 5 years. (j) Leased assets Finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership are depreciated to a nil residual value over the period of the lease contract using the straight-line method. (k) Goodwill Goodwill is amortized over periods of no more than 20 years by the straight-line method. (l) Research and development expenses Research and development expenses are charged to income when incurred. (m) Income taxes Income taxes are calculated based on taxable income and charged to income on an accrual basis. Certain temporary differences exist between taxable income and income reported for financial reporting purposes which enter into the determina-tion of taxable income in a different period. (n) Allowance for doubtful accounts The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries provide an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount calculated based on their historical experience of bad debts on ordinary receiv-ables plus an additional estimate of probable specific bad debts from customers experiencing financial difficulties. (o) Provision for employees' bonuses Provision for employees' bonuses is provided at the estimated amount of bonuses to be paid to the employees in the following year. (p) Provision for sales returns The Company provides a reserve for sales returns at the amount of estimated loss expected to be incurred subsequent to the balance sheet date based on a product sales margin and histori-cal sales return ratio. Certain consolidated subsidiaries provide a reserve for sales returns at the amount of estimated loss expected to be incurred subsequent to the balance sheet date based on total product sales and historical sales return ratio. (q) Retirement benefits The asset and liability for retirement benefits are provided based on the amount of the projected benefit obligation after deduct-ing plan assets at fair value at the end of the year. The r etirement benefit obligation is attributed to each period by the benefit formula basis. Prior service cost is amortized as incurr ed by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years, which is within the estimated average remaining years of service of the eligible employees. Actuarial dif ferences are amortized from the year following the year in which the gain or loss is recognized, principally by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years, which is within the estimated average remaining years of service of the eligible employees. Unr ecognized actuarial differences and prior service cost, net of tax effect, are recognized as \"Retirement benefit liability adjustments\" in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of net assets in the consolidated balance sheet. (r) Hedge accounting The Company utilizes derivative transactions for mitigating the fluctuation risks of trade receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, forecast transactions and interest rates of loans from financial institutions. Hedging instruments are forward foreign currency exchange contracts, currency options and interest rate swap agreements. Hedged items are trade receiv-able and payable denominated in foreign currencies, forecast transactions and interest rates of loans from financial institutions. Gain or loss on derivatives positions designated as hedges is deferr ed until the loss or gain on the respective underlying hedged items is recognized. Interest-rate swaps which meet certain conditions are accounted for as if the interest rates applied to the swaps had originally applied to the underlying debt (special accounting treatment). Receivables and payables hedged by forwar d foreign exchange contracts which meet certain conditions are translated at the corresponding contract rates (allocation method). The Company evaluates the ef fectiveness of its hedging activities by comparing the movements of cash flows of hedging instruments and the corresponding movements of cash flows of hedged items. However, with regard to the forward foreign exchange contracts accounted for by the allocation method and the interest-rate swaps accounted for by the special accounting treatment, the evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted. (s) Distribution of retained earnings Under the Company Act of Japan, the distribution of retained earnings with respect to a given financial period is made by resolution of the shareholders at a general meeting held subse-quent to the close of the financial period. The accounts for the period do not reflect such distributions. (Refer to Note 20.) (t) Accounting standards issued but not yet effective Accounting Standard and Implementation Guidance on Revenue RecognitionOn Mar ch 30, 2018, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (the \"ASBJ\") issued \"Accounting Standard for Revenue Recogni-tion\" (ASBJ Statement No.29) and \"Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition\" (ASBJ Guidance No.30). (1) Overview This is a comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recog-nition. Specifically, the accounting standard establishes the following five-step model that will apply to revenue from customers:Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 951. Identify the contracts with a customer 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contracts 3. Determine the transaction prices 4. Allocate the transaction prices to the performance obligations in the contracts 5. Recognize r evenue when or as the entity satisfies a perfor- mance obligation (2) Scheduled date of adoptionThe Company expects to adopt the accounting standard and the implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. (3) Impact of the adoption of accounting standar d and imple- mentation guidance The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this accounting standard and the implementation guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 3. Accounting Changes (1) Change in accounting policiesRevised Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries, etc. for Consolidated Financial Statements and related Practical SolutionEffective from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the Company has early adopted \"Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to For eign Subsidiaries, etc. for Consolidated Financial Statements\" (revised 2018) (PITF No.18) issued by the ASBJ on September 14, 2018. The impact of this change on the consolidated financial statements was immaterial. (2) Change in pr esentation Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect AccountingThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have adopted \"Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting\" (ASBJ Statement No.28, February 16, 2018) (herein-after, the \"Partial Amendments\") from the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. As such, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are included within investments and other assets and long-term liabilities, respectively, and related income tax disclosures have been expanded. As a r esult, deferred tax assets under current assets decreased \u00a511,762 million and deferred tax assets under invest-ments and other assets increased \u00a5726 million in the consoli-dated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. In addition, deferred tax liabilities under current liabilities decreased \u00a50 million and deferred tax liabilities under long-term liabilities decreased \u00a511,036 million. Deferr ed tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relating to the same taxation authority were offset against each other, and total assets decreased \u00a511,036 million compared to the balance prior to this change. Also, Note 11 \"Income T axes\" in the notes to the consoli- dated financial statements has been expanded in accordance with Note 8 and Note 9 of Interpretive Notes to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting. However, comparative information for the year ended March 31, 2018 has not been disclosed in Note 11 in accordance with the transitional provi-sions set forth in Article 7 of the Partial Amendments. 4. U.S. Dollar Amounts The translation of yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts is included solely for convenience, as a matter of arithmetic com-putation only, at \u00a5111.00 = U.S. $1.00, the approximate rate of exchange in effect on March 31, 2019. This translation should not be construed as a representation that yen have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at the above or any other rate. 5.

Financial Instruments (1) Overview(a) Policy for financial instrumentsThe Group obtains necessary funding principally by bank bor-rowings and bond issuance under the business plan for its main business for the production and sales of pharmaceuticals. Temporary surplus funds are managed by low-risk financial assets. Derivatives are utilized for mitigating risks described in the latter part of this note and not utilized for speculative purpose. (b) Types of financial instruments and related risk Trade receivables, notes and accounts receivable, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. Trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to the fluctuation risk of foreign currencies. Short-term investments and investments in securities are exposed to fluctuation risk of market price. T rade payables, notes and accounts payable, are due within one year. Certain trade payables denominated in foreign curren-cies for the import of raw materials are exposed to the fluctua-tion risk of foreign currencies. Loans and bonds are utilized principally for necessary financing under the business plan and those maturity dates are due in 1 year, at the longest, subse-quent to March 31, 2019. Derivative transactions ar e made for hedging foreign cur- rency fluctuation risk of trade receivables, trade payables, forecasted transactions and intercompany loans receivable denominated in foreign currencies by using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency option contracts. Refer to \"Hedge accounting\" in Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Account-ing Policies\" for information on hedge accounting such as hedging instruments, hedged items, hedging policy, evaluation method of effectiveness of hedging activities and so forth.Shionogi Integrated Report 2019 100(c) Risk management for financial instruments (i) Monitoring of cr edit risk (the risk that customers or counter - parties may default) In accor dance with the procedures determined in the Company, the Accounting and Finance Department and related sections of the Company periodically monitor the conditions of major customers, manage collection due dates and balances of each customer and try to identify credit risk of customers with worsen-ing financial conditions at the early stage and mitigate the risk. Consolidated subsidiaries perform the similar credit manage-ment in accordance with the internal rules of the Company. The Company enters into derivative transactions with finan - cial institutions with high credit ratings to mitigate the counter-party risk. The maximum amount of cr edit risk at balance sheet date is represented as the carrying value of financial assets exposed to the credit risk. (ii) Monitoring of market risks (the risks arising fr om fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and others) The Company utilizes forward foreign currency exchange con- tracts and currency option contracts for hedging to mitigate fluctuation risk identified by each foreign currency of trade receivables, payables, forecasted transactions and intercompany loans receivable. The Company continuously r eviews securities holdings by monitoring periodically the market and financial condition of the securities' issuers (companies with business relationships with the Group) and also reviews holding conditions for securities other than held-to-maturities by evaluating the relationship of those companies. The Accounting and Finance Department enters into deriva - tive transactions under the rules determined in the Company and utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and currency option contracts within the normal range of transactions. The Accounting and Finance Department manages information on transactions by reporting periodically to the Board of Directors' meetings. Consolidated subsidiaries do not utilize derivative transactions. (iii) Monitoring of liquidity risk (the risk that the Gr oup may not be able to meet its obligations on scheduled due dates) The Company manages liquidity risk with the Accounting and Finance Department preparing and updating cash flow plans on a timely basis and keeping necessary funds based on the reports prepared by each department. (d) Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When ther e is no quoted market price available, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives in Note 13 \"Derivative T ransactions\" are not necessarily indicative of the actual market risk involved in the derivative transactions.(e) Concentration of credit riskAt March 31, 2019 and 2018, 71% and 48%, respectively, of outstanding trade receivables represented receivables due from a specific and large-scale customer. (2) Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets, fair value and the difference as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, are shown in the following table. The following table does not include financial instruments for which it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value (Please refer to Note 2 below).

Notes and accounts r eceivable\u2014trade and affiliates Since notes and accounts r eceivable are settled in a short time period, their carrying value approximates fair value. Short-term investments and investments in securities W ith regard to short-term investments and investments in securities, fair value of debt securities is mainly determined by quoted market price or price offered by financial institutions and that of equity securities is determined by quoted market price. Refer to Note 5 \"Short-Term Investments and Investments in Securities\" for the information of securities by holding purpose. However , the carrying value of money in trust for cash management included in short-term investments approximates fair value, because these items are settled in a short time period. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable\u2014trade and affiliates and accrued income taxes Since these items ar e settled in a short time period, their carrying value approximates fair value. Curr ent portion of long-term debts The fair value of bonds is determined by quoted price of fered by financial institutions. The fair value of long-term loans is based on the pr esent value of the total of principal and interest discounted by the estimated interest rates to be applied if similar new loans are made.
