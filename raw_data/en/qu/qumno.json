Only a few locations managed to lock out the virus, including the Cayman Islands. Cayman, as it is referred to locally, became a haven to avoid the coronavirus. It is a three-island Caribbean country best known for its world-class beaches, its high-end real estate and its tax neutrality. It is home to an estimated population of 71,000 people and more than 113,000 companies in around 260 square kilometres (Cayman Islands Economics and Statistics Office 2021; Cayman Islands General Registry 2021; Hendry and Dickson 2018). These features are commonly known. In contrast, little is known about how smaller nations have balanced competing demands of public health and economics in managing COVID-19. This chapter analyses how the Cayman Islands put public health first. 2COVID-19 reached Cayman's shores shortly after larger nations had already found themselves in deep water. The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 (Cucinotta and Vanelli 2020). On 22 January 2020, Caymanian public health authorities started to 'closely monitor' the evolution of the virus, despite no local cases detected (Ragoonath 2020a). A week later, surveillance stepped up, with 'enhanced border controls' in ports and airports (Cayman Compass staff 2020). By mid-March, early fears of local transmission triggered a full border closure and a 3-month hard lockdown (Whittaker 2020a; Cayman Islands Government 2021c). A year and a half later, Cayman has abolished social distancing, carries out local general and genomic COVID-19 testing and is conducting a successful vaccination campaign (Cayman Islands Government 2021a). However, economic woes have come to stay (Saunders 2021), with the tourism sector deprived of international visitors and their workers surviving off small grants and subsidies. 3Fears of a healthy population undergoing a sick economy are mounting. This chapter critically analyses the Cayman Islands' response to COVID-19. Smaller countries' research has fallen through the cracks, with scholarship focusing on Western, developed countries. Instead, this chapter navigates Cayman as a case study to cover the gaps of global research. The research is structured in three main sections covering contextualisation, public health response, economic response and a final reflection on the post-pandemic future. The bibliography melds international and local sources. The author is based locally and has spared no effort to integrate local sources. When using media sources, only those considered established and reliable have been considered. 4Though self-described as 'the islands that time forgot', Cayman is not as isolated as a small island would have you believe. There are four keys needed to analyse Cayman's context in full: regional, small, legal and political. The following paragraphs will examine each in turn. This will open the door to understanding Cayman's response to COVID-19 analysed later in the chapter. 5Caribbean countries face region-specific challenges. Escobedo et al (2020) have identified vulnerability to 'frequent natural hazards [...], reduced investment in health and research and fragile public health systems' among such challenges. The United Nations occasionally publishes reports on Caribbean economies in the form of country studies covering COVID-19 macroeconomic and human impact assessment data (Naitram 2020a 2020b). These reports make recommendations on how to manage the post-pandemic, having considered economic and social data, but do not delve into the specifics of the policy response. Overall, the Caribbean proved resilient in its public health response. This was despite a clash of the two main risks materialising. On the one hand, Caribbean countries like Cayman are exposed to a range of natural disaster risks (i.e. hurricanes and earthquakes). The Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano eruption in 1995 in Montserrat, Hurricane Ivan in 2004 in Grand Cayman (the largest of the Cayman Islands) or a pan-Caribbean earthquake in 2020 with the epicentre close to Cayman expose Caribbean countries to losses measured in billions, significant environmental risks and potential loss of life. On the other, man-made disruptions (i.e. COVID-19 and reputational crises involving AML and taxation) also bring risk. Cayman's public policy response to COVID-19 happened in the context of both man-made and exposure to natural disasters. Late January 2020 brought a 7.7 magnitude earthquake, followed by a tsunami alert (Morales 2020) and one of the most active hurricane and tropical storm seasons in history (Harris 2020). Meanwhile, man-made disruptions included the European Union adding Cayman to its list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes from February to October 2020 (Council of the European Union 2020). In addition, the Tax Justice Network (2021) has placed Cayman as the top of their financial secrecy index. Cayman has been working tirelessly to pass legislation and engage in public relations, even creating a designated Ministry to spearhead their communication efforts (Panad\u00e8s-Estruch 2020b). Cayman now faces several challenges to overcome that stem from the COVID-19 pandemic. 6Cayman's smallness brings economic challenges. This created specific COVID-19 risks including but not limited to 'securing essential goods and services, including inbound logistics for their value chains' (UNCTAD 2020). The pandemic has placed extra strain in less diversified economies such as Cayman. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund identify high reliance on tourism and exposure to climate change as significant risks for the Caribbean region (World Bank Group 2021; International Monetary Fund 2021). Consequently, several Caribbean countries which depend on tourism have suffered downgrades of their sovereign rating (Haroon 2021). Those risks affect Cayman too. So far, it has managed to perform better than expected during the pandemic: its sector-based economy also relies on financial services and real estate; both performing beyond expectations during the pandemic. However, COVID-19 has put a significant number of tourism-related businesses and individuals under strain. 7Cayman is also a British Overseas Territory: its COVID-19 response navigates between UK sovereignty and setting their own course. This is a 'curious club' group of diverse, small and remote countries (Panad\u00e8s-Estruch 2020a: 13). Their strategic locations are a strength, with locations mostly in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Legally, being a BOT means that these countries are under UK sovereignty, which yields an unmatched layer of stability and good governance in the region. The highest authority in the Cayman Islands is a UK-appointed Governor, who represents Her Majesty on island (Hendry and Dickson 2018). Benwell, Clegg and Pinkerton (2020) conducted a study on the BOTs' COVID-19 response. Their research is valuable for BOTs in general. However, it is of limited relevance to the current study because it only sampled a Caribbean BOT. 8Politically, the 2021 General Election was carried out as normal, where many others could not. The elections were conducted 'fairly and according to the Law', despite a long list of recommendations for improvement by the domestic observers (Roberts 2021a; 2021b). The result led to a change of Government from the People's Progressive Movement to PACT, a coalition of independents formed after the election. 9This critical assessment analyses how public health took priority over economics by covering both responses separately. McLaughlin, then Premier of the Cayman Islands, summarised Cayman's approach as: 'we are not going to allow economic considerations to kill our people' (Whittaker 2020a). Panton, the new Premier since May 2021, has said that '[n]othing is of greater importance to [him] and [his] government than the wellbeing of our people' (Cayman Compass staff 2021). The two sections that follow test these claims. 10Cayman's zealous approach to public health has made the islands relatively COVID-safe. Caribbean countries in general have scored well in their public health response, on the understanding that their ageing population, weak health systems and their isolation cannot withstand a spike in cases. A study including the 15 Caribbean countries within CARICOM and five others concluded that the range of measures implemented regionally are similar, with differences in timing and intensity (Murphy, Jeyaseelan et al 2020). 11Even for Caribbean standards, Cayman has scored exceptionally well. Cayman had suppressed local transmission as early mid-July 2020 and has prevented any further COVID-19 waves. Only two people have officially died from COVID-related causes including one Italian cruise ship passenger at the beginning phase of the pandemic. Cayman is considered a very low-risk jurisdiction, with the United States Center for Disease Control classifying it as 'low risk' and included in the 'green list' of the United Kingdom since mid-June 2021 (US Centre for Disease Control: 2021; United Kingdom Department for Transport: 2021). 12This section covers the main milestones in the public health response. Some of the factors that encouraged Cayman to put public health first are the smallness of the country and the common understanding that the weight of a COVID-19 wave could put the local healthcare system under considerable strain. In considering Cayman as a public health case study under COVID-19, this chapter focuses on four key points, including border closures, lockdown, testing capabilities and UK advantages. 13Border closures were enforced since 15 March 2020 and strict quarantine upon entry still applies at the time of writing this chapter. The two international airports, in the islands of Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac have been closed to commercial flights, with only a few Government-approved repatriation flights allowed. The port has been closed to all international traffic, receiving shipments only. All incoming passengers required the explicit approval from the Government upon entry and were subjected to strictly monitored quarantine, regardless of residence status or nationality (Cayman Islands Government 2021d). Initially, those arriving between March 2020 and June 2021 had to undergo a quarantine of 14 days in publicly managed facilities. Progressively, the process became slightly more relaxed, permitting quarantine to take place in approved private residences if the person arriving agreed to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet. The initial 14-day quarantine was eventually reduced to 10 days, later halved, days for fully vaccinated travellers who had received two doses at least two weeks prior to arriving and had a recognised vaccination certificate. Quarantine is expected to cease from 14 October for the vaccinated and borders are expected to reopen fully on 27 January 2022. However, these two milestones are both conditional upon achieving a high local vaccine uptake. 14Lockdown and curfews happened early and suddenly. A 3-month full lockdown took place in mid-March to mid-June 2020: supermarkets, liquor stores and pharmacies were the only shops that could open (Cayman Islands Government 2021a). Individuals were assigned designated days to visit supermarkets under strict enforcement. From 23 March 2020, night-time curfews were applied from 8pm to 6am (Whittaker 2020b). Lockdown eased progressively until transitioning to normality in late June 2020, lifting the curfew as well. Social distancing and general use of masks are still recommended but have not been compulsory since the end of lockdown, with specific exceptions. - 1 On 29 July 2021, the positivity index was of 0.55% (640 positive test results out of 116,164 tests [(...)](#ftn1) 15Local testing capacity improved quickly. Since April 2020, testing has taken place locally, free of charge and is available to all those that wish to get tested to discard infection or to travel. Local testing has made it possible to perform comprehensive testing to all those that wish or need to get a test. At the time of writing, the positivity index was extremely low, at 0.55%. [1](#ftn1) Incoming visitors are tested pre-departure and on the day after the quarantine is completed. In the height of the pandemic, incoming visitors were also tested upon arrival to Cayman at the airport. 16The benefits of Cayman's links to the UK links were very apparent during the pandemic. The UK assisted its British Overseas Territories with military (naval) capacity, public health support and, crucially, vaccines. Since early 2021, the UK has supplied Cayman with over 100,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, free of charge (Wheaton 2021; estimated from Cayman Compass' home page 2021) [2](#ftn2), enough to vaccinate all those eligible that wish to do so, regardless of age group, medical conditions or immigration status. By July 2021, 70% of Cayman's population has received at least one dose (Cayman Islands Government 2021c). The vaccination campaign continues, with the current Government engaging in a vaccination drive shortly after their election, the organisation of a raffle to those getting their vaccinations and with repeated messages from many public figures encouraging vaccine uptake. The Governments, before and after the 2021 General Election, set a high local uptake of 80% as a condition to reopen the borders. On the one hand, the high percentage of required vaccinated population is justified to make sure the island is as close to herd immunity as possible. On the other hand, the island's media have voiced concerns on whether reaching the 80% is realistic, mainly due to an adjustment in the estimated population figures from 65,000 to 71,000 and due to children being not eligible for the vaccine yet counted towards the total of the population (Klein 2021b). Public Health England, the UK's top health administrative body, provided support to Cayman, both in terms of expertise in health issues in general and in setting up local testing facilities (Ragoonath 2020b). In addition, the UK provides military capability to assist the territories in the event of a natural disaster. 17A strategy combining the four elements of border closures, lockdown, local testing and UK advantages have kept the virus at bay, but the islands remain vigilant. Other public health actions include keeping public gathering restrictions (capped to 500 people in attendance outdoors), enforcement of mask-wearing in medical establishments and public transportation and periodic engagement with the public via official channels including social media outlets. 18Economics has taken a back seat in Cayman public policy so far but it appears that Keynes is back behind the wheel. This section covers the main COVID-19-related expenditures and how they have been funded. The aim is to critically assess the economic strategy developed in Cayman to extract the lessons learned. 19Caribbean economies are suffering the economic impact of COVID-19 and Cayman is no exception. Most Caribbean economies face what Byron, Laguardia Mart\u00ednez, Montoute and Niles have summarised as 'grim prospects' (Byron et al 2021:99). Albeit this study covers independent Commonwealth nations and excludes BOTs like Cayman. Though Cayman is among the most resilient in the Caribbean: the country did neither need to apply for regional funding (Ragoonath 2020d), nor needed funding from the United Kingdom (Panad\u00e8s-Estruch forthcoming). 20COVID-19 has also damaged Cayman's economy. GDP growth has suffered significantly. In 2020, it changed from predicted growth to a 6.7% contraction (Jefferson and Tibbetts 2021). This is due entirely to COVID-19 crisis management measures, leading namely to a contraction of 76.6% in the hotels and restaurant sector; a fall of 31.5% in the transportation sector and a fall of 24.7% in others including arts, entertainment and household activities resulting from lockdown, curfew and border closures. Consequently, the Cayman Islands Government has run a deficit for the first time since its modern fiscal framework was put in place in 2012. 21COVID-19-related expenditures justify Cayman's economic deficit. The total estimated cost of the Government's response to COVID-19 was estimated at KYD 46.7 million (USD 56.95 million) by the Auditor General (2020). Cross-policy stipends were the emergency plasters to avoid local economic collapse. Some of the actions taken in the first three months included one-off payments to vulnerable people, stipends to taxi drivers, grants to Caymanian nationals that worked in tourism and were affected by the pandemic's closures, allowing pension withdrawals from private-sector plans, a pension contribution holiday for the private sector and support to Caymanian-owned micro and small businesses (Auditor General 2020). In just the first three months, from March to June 2020, the Auditor General (2020) confirmed that Government had spent KYD 21.5 million (USD 26.22 million), with an additional estimated cost of at least KYD 25.1 million (USD 30.6 million). - 3 The Cayman Islands Public Finance and Management Act (2020 Revision), s. 34(3)(iii). 22Cayman running a deficit implies a significant curtail of the local fiscal autonomy in favour of the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 triggered public cash shortages in Cayman, leading to an estimated cash shortfall of 7%. As a response, the UK negotiated a framework for fiscal responsibility setting restrictions to fiscal management and public borrowing (Panad\u00e8s-Estruch 2020). The framework for fiscal responsibility became binding in 2013, via the Public Financial Management Law (2013 Revision). Having complied strictly with the framework for fiscal responsibility before the pandemic has put Cayman into a good starting position to face the crisis, but it was impossible to avoid all COVID-related economic impacts. Currently, the Public Financial Management Act (2020 Revision) stipulates that the UK's FCDO approval is required for the country's major financial decisions unless there is compliance in full with the principles of responsible financial management. Some of the local financial decisions falling under the FCDO approval requirement are, for instance, the country's Strategic Policy Statement (the Government's inaugural speech on the budget guidelines for the following two years), the annual budget and borrowing. [3](#ftn3) The COVID-19 response has pushed Cayman into deficit, thus not complying with the principle of operating under surplus. Therefore, the UK FCDO approval requirement has been triggered. 23The line of credit and its use have consolidated the move towards a Keynesian approach to COVID-19 recovery. Other sources of funding include capital reserves and new strands of coercive revenue (Panad\u00e8s-Estruch, forthcoming). It is welcome that local banks offered the line of credit on reasonable terms as a display of national unity, though concerns remain regarding its costs and its use in the next year. 24McTaggart, the then minister responsible for finance under whom the line of credit was conceived and procured, stated on television that he 'would like to see is all Cayman-based banks doing a national effort and presenting a bid together' (Ragoonath 2020c). Five of the largest banks put the only bid forward and won the contract. Actually drawing from it, however, requires approval from the UK's FCDO, which means that Cayman needs to justify its use and persuade the UK that this is a good course of action. - 4 The Cayman Islands uses the US Federal Reserve prime interest rate. 25The line of credit is expected to optimise the cost of financing, but it does not come for free. It will be on stand-by for 18 months. Afterwards, 'amount[s] advanced and unpaid [...] will be converted to a 15-year fixed rate amortising loan' (Ragoonath 2020c). Achieving prime rate of 3.25% for both the amounts advanced in credit and the resulting loan is a good move, as this is the best rate available in Cayman. [4](#ftn4) However, there are concerns about opening costs, even if the line of credit would not be used. Set-up costs amount to USD 2.4 million plus a stand-by fee of 70 basis points per annum for all amounts not used from the line of credit. Overall, this is not a cheap effort, but a fair effort to minimise COVID-19's economic impact. 26The new Government views the role of the line of credit differently. Recent developments have changed perceptions about the line of credit and it is now at the forefront of Cayman's Keynesian approach to economic recovery. Initially, the plan was to seek early market engagement to minimise costs: to ask for money before others and before the full extent of need shows to soften the blow. In this sense, its role was 'to mitigate the effects of Government's loss of revenue and increased [COVID-19-related] expenditure' (Jefferson and Tibbetts 2021). The PPM Government (2017-2021) announced repeatedly their intention to set up the line of credit to avert future disaster only as a last resort. McTaggart, former Minister of Finance and Economic Development, whose term saw the procurement of the line of credit, argued that 'we hope we don't have to use it, but it is there as a backup' (Cayman Islands Government 2021b). Saunders, who took over as new Minister for Finance and Economic Development, initially argued that the 'Government will continue to refrain from borrowing as long as possible, but it may become necessary if the borders remain closed and the economy is not operating at its full potential' (Klein 2021a). Recently, Saunders has stated that the line of credit will be used fully to fund capital investment (Klein 2021c). No longer a last resort, it is now an essential part of the recovery plan. 27The economic strategy of Cayman shows how public health was put first and the economy had to adapt. All in all, the Cayman Government acted wisely and promptly in minimising the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. It is a fair effort in optimising costs and ring-fencing expenditure. No expense was spared to keep the local population well and the national economy afloat, and the fiscal side of public management had to comply. 28The first lesson learned is the value of clear, consistent communication: the Government chose lives over dollars. The public health-first policy remained consistent between the outgoing and incoming Governments. Equally, citizens have understood how important it was to follow the guidance, underpinned by a comprehensive system of fines for violations to COVID-19 Regulations, which led to high compliance and prompt eradication of the virus. This saved thousands in the cost of treatment and, more importantly, averted loss of life. 29The second lesson is that COVID-19 was expensive and might jeopardise Cayman's policies. Cayman was in the best possible given its fiscal responsibility policies and its reliance on more services than tourism. However, the high costs of an early eradication of the virus and strict protocols to enter the country will have an impact on the future spending capacity in Cayman. The Government published a five-stage reopening plan in July 2021 (Cayman Islands Government 2021e). The stages comprise reducing the quarantine period, reducing restrictions on commercial flights, the limited introduction of tourism starting on 9 September 2021, reducing quarantine restrictions foreseen from 14 October 2021 and the introduction of unvaccinated visitors aged under 12 from mid-November 2021. Finally, 27 January 2022 is the expected date for the full lifting of border restrictions. However, progressing through the reopening plan is conditional upon achieving a high vaccination rate of 80% of the total population, including all those who are not eligible for vaccination. This is based on scientific advice but looks difficult to achieve, at least, before each checkpoint in the plan is reached. 30Cayman has many post-pandemic challenges ahead. However, its consistent and protective approach to local public health, coupled with a strong fiscal responsibility binding framework, its resilient financial services sector and an overheating real estate sector have put Cayman in a much better position than many of its Caribbean neighbours. The remaining question is how long the economy can wait for the reopening plan to get up to speed. Delays in opening the border imply a tourism sector that remains dormant, a wholesale and retail sectors that underperform and arts and entertainment sectors that suffer. The tentative and conditional reopening plan has created a paradox where some believe that it is not necessary to be vaccinated until the country reopens, even though reopening depends on those people getting vaccinated. Unless the equation changes, the Cayman Islands may have to choose between spending more sunk costs to keep workers on stand-by or letting those tourism doubloons flow back through the borders. "}
