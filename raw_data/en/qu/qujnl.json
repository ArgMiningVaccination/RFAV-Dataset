Life's moving in a faster pace and it's taking its toll on us. We live in constant stress and forget to listen to our bodies, their needs (therefore, our needs)... we don't sleep enough, we don't eat right, we don't exercise enough and don't satisfy our emotional needs. All this leads to- surprise surprise...an illness which brings us to a full stop! Now we are forced to give our bodies and spirits our undivided attention. An illness makes us reflect on where we've gone wrong and what needs to be fixed or changed. You've got the possibility to make this change and the time is now...feel free to contact me at my clinic in Coimbra, Portugal and together we'll find the right way for you to heal, whether it's with Bach flowers, Aromatherapy, Acupressure, Meditative Imagination, the right nutrition, Healing, medicinal herbs, talks or their combination. The consultation sessions can be held face-to-face and/or online. Bach Flowers practitioner (BFRP), Acupressurist, Life Coach, Healer, Aromatherapist, Mediator, Naturopath N.D, Herbalist. Life is full of ups and downs and we're trying to master both. My motto is \"search for the solution not the problem\"... for the problem is always there visible to us, what is hidden, however, is the solution. I believe that both \"The doctor\" and \"The patient\" are within each of us and that my job is to awaken the doctor so that he can control the situation and heal the body. I believe that in order to draw our attention to the fact that we run our lives in a way that is not good for our well-being, our body creates an illness, whether physical or mental. I convey this way of thinking to all my patients, those who seek relief for their body, mind and spirit. Taking the person, as a whole, with all of his imbalances (which might have created an illness or an emotional disturbance) and helping him bring balance and recovery back into his life using different methods: western medicinal herbs, touch therapy, first-aid homeopathy, aromatherapy, vitamins and minerals, psychotherapy, nutrition and much more... Bach flowers are remedies extracted from 38 different non-toxic and non-edible flowers, the 39th remedy is the Rescue Remedy that is well-known for many years now and is a combination of some of the other remedies. The remedies are the fruits of labor of Dr. Edward Bach's research of 7 years, he managed to complete all 38 remedies between 1928 and 1934. Alternative medicine and its therapists combine both conventional and alternative know-how in order to treat the body, mind and spirit and allow the person to heal from within out, and sometimes even improve his quality of life and correct his daily misconduct. Aromatherapy is one of the methods in alternative and complementary medicine where we use essential oils and base oils (or vegetable oils) that are made from aromatic flowers, medicinal herbs, spices and trees. Our job as nutritionists is to construct and create menus that will eventually serve and contribute a change in lifestyle and a healthier more balanced conduct. Transferring and channeling energy from the universe to the person that needs it. This energy encourages the process in which organisms' health is restored. While running after success, money, power and position, we often forget to do what's right for us, what makes us happy and content, the simple things in life that can change a sad moment into a happy one. I do believe that one of my jobs is to remind my patients of those things. The contents provided here cannot be displayed due to your current [cookie settings](#).
