In the United States, where practitioners incorporate healing traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries, acupuncture is considered part of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The term \"acupuncture\" describes a family of procedures involving the stimulation of anatomical points on the body using a variety of techniques. The acupuncture technique that has been most often studied scientifically involves penetrating the skin with thin, solid, metallic needles that are manipulated by the hands or by electrical stimulation. Practiced in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years, acupuncture is one of the key components of traditional Chinese medicine. Acupuncture became better known in the United States in 1971, when New York Times reporter James Reston wrote about how doctors in China used needles to ease his pain after surgery. American practices of acupuncture incorporate medical traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries. The report from a Consensus Development Conference on Acupuncture held at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1997 stated that acupuncture is being \"widely\" practiced\u2014by thousands of physicians, dentists, acupuncturists, and other practitioners\u2014for relief or prevention of pain and for various other health conditions. According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey, which included a comprehensive survey of CAM use by Americans, an estimated 3.1 million U.S. adults and 150,000 children had used acupuncture in the previous year. Between the 2002 and 2007 NHIS, acupuncture use among adults increased by approximately 1 million people. Tui na or tuina, is a form of [Chinese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) [manipulative therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipulative_therapy) often used cupping.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_cupping) Chinese Tui na body treatment that uses Chinese [martial arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts) principles in an effort to bring the [eight principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_principles) of [Traditional Chinese Medicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_Medicine) (TCM) into balance. The practitioner may brush, knead, roll/press, and rub the areas between each of the joints, known as the eight gates, to attempt to open the body's defensive (wei) chi and get the energy moving in the meridians and the muscles. The practitioner can then use range of motion, [traction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_%28orthopedics%29), and [massage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage), with the stimulation of [acupressure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupressure) points. These techniques are claimed to aid in the treatment of both acute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions, as well as many non-musculoskeletal conditions. [[4]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_na#cite_note-4) Tui na is an integral part of TCM and is taught in TCM schools as part of formal training in [Oriental](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental) medicine. Many [East Asian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian) [martial arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts)schools also teach Tui na to their advanced students for the treatment and management of injury and pain due to training. As with many other traditional Chinese medical practices, there are several different schools with greater or smaller differences in their approach to the discipline. It is related also to Japanese [massage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage) or [anma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anma) ( [](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%8C%89) [](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%91%A9)). In ancient China, medical therapy was often classified as either \"external\" or \"internal\" treatment. Tui na was considered to be one of the external methods, thought to be especially suitable for use on the elderly population and on infants. There is reason to believe the practice dates from as early as 3000 B.C.; the earliest record of cupping is in the [Ebers Papyrus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebers_Papyrus), one of the oldest medical textbooks in the world, describes in 1550 B.C. [Egyptians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt) used cupping. Archaeologists have found evidence in [China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) of cupping dating back to 1000 B.C. In [ancient Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece), [Hippocrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates) (c. 400 B.C.) used cupping for internal disease and structural problems. This method in multiple forms spread into medicine throughout Asian and European civilizations According to T [raditional Chinese Medicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) (TCM) cupping is a method of creating a vacuum on the patient's skin to dispel stagnation \u2014 stagnant blood and lymph, thereby improving [qi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi) flow \u2014 to treat [respiratory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_%28physiology%29) diseases such as the [common cold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold), [pneumonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia) and [bronchitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis). Cupping also is used on back, neck, shoulder and other [musculoskeletal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system) conditions. Its advocates say it has other applications, as well. Florida Statute 457, and Rule Chapter 64B1 states: Effective March 1, 2002, adjunctive therapies shall include acupoint injection therapy which shall mean the injection of herbs, homeopathics, and other nutritional supplements in the form of sterile substances into acupuncture points by means of hypodermic needles but not intravenous therapy to promote, maintain, and restore health; for pain management and palliative care; for acupuncture anesthesia; and to prevent disease.
