Dear colleagues Welcome to the James Lind Alliance priorities for dementia research. Alzheimer's Society is committed to ensuring that research funding is used as effectively as possible to alleviate the impact and burden of dementia and to improve the quality of life for people affected by the condition. It was for this reason that Alzheimer's Society commissioned Professor Carol Brayne from the Institute of Public Health at the University of Cambridge to lead this exercise to select priorities related to the treatment, diagnosis, prevention and care in dementia, so that future funding may be targeted to the areas of highest need. The prioritisation process has produced a number of outcomes that we would now like to see taken forward. While these will not be used directly as priorities for Alzheimer's Society's Research funding, we hope that these questions will be addressed in the wider research field. The headline of these is a top 10 list of priorities for dementia research, but underneath this is a wealth of further research questions that might be addressed. Importantly this exercise involved matching priorities against the current evidence, allowing us to show where the priorities reflect genuine gaps in evidence. These priorities represent the collective view from a wide range of stakeholders representing people affected by dementia, practitioners and clinician groups. We now see it as the role of all those interested in dementia research to consider these priorities and the contribution that they can make to advance our knowledge of quality of life in dementia. Dementia represents a great unmet need and research is required on all fronts. Developing priorities for biomedical research covering the causes and mechanisms of dementia was deliberately not included in the scope of this exercise, but remains of high importance. We hope that you find the research priorities outlined here of interest and agree with their importance.

The new urgency is welcomed, since dementia poses one of the greatest health and social challenges to both developed and developing nations in the 21st century. 1 | Priorities for dementia research In the UK, the Prime Minister has committed to a dementia challenge that will seek to improve detection of dementia, develop communities that are dementia friendly, following the G8 Summit on dementia, has committed to increase government funding to over \u00a3130 million by 2025. Despite the increased investment, dementia research is still underfunded in comparison to other diseases. It is therefore important to prioritise the new funding so that it seeks to answer questions that will have the most impact for people affected by dementia. Building on this need to ensure funding is targeted effectively, Alzheimer's Society initiated a priority-setting partnership in collaboration with the James Lind Alliance and experts in public health. The priority setting partnership sought to bring together a wide range of organisations representing the views of people affected by dementia, practitioners and clinicians to collectively agree on priorities addressing the care, treatment, diagnosis and prevention of dementia. The result of this exercise has been to produce a top 10 list of priorities that are considered to be of high importance for research. In light of increased funding, these priorities are extremely timely, and offer a framework for all interested in dementia research and care to consider how directly to improve the quality of life for people affected by dementia. Alzheimer's Society involves people affected by dementia in our Research funding programme, and so these priorities will be different. It is hoped that the priorities here will help guide funders to identify gaps in the knowledge and guide research funding.Top 10 priorities for dementia research 2 | Priorities for dementia research The following questions were prioritised by people with dementia, carers, and health and social care professionals to inform the future of dementia research. The priorities were launched at Alzheimer's Society's Research conference on 27 June 2013. The final top 10 priorities 1 What are the most effective components of care that keep a person with dementia as independent as they can be at all stages of the disease in all care settings? 2 How can the best ways to care for people with dementia, including results from research findings, be effectively disseminated and implemented into care practice? 3 What is the impact of an early diagnosis of dementia and how can primary care support a more effective route to diagnosis? Particular questions were raised about the impact of early diagnosis on: Health-related outcomes for people with dementia and their carers (including impact on the progression of the disease and life expectancy, mental health, quality of life, attitudes of healthcare professionals to treatment for people with dementia, and on outcomes for carers, including quality of life and mental health). Wider outcomes in society for people with dementia and carers/family (including financial planning, insurance issues, employment prospects, independence, access to other healthcare services, driving). Health and social care services. Particular questions about more effective routes to diagnosis in primary care included: Routes to faster referral to specialists, where appropriate. The best way to communicate a diagnosis of dementia, including who is the best person to communicate the diagnosis and where it should be delivered; how best to involve relatives and carers taking confidentiality into account. The psychological impact of a diagnosis of dementia on the person and carers. 4 What non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological (drug) interventions are most effective for managing challenging behaviour in people with dementia? This question included alternatives to anti-psychotic drugs; activities and stimulation; person-centred and behavioural care techniques; which therapies are most effective in different care settings; the effectiveness of involving carers (family/home carers or care staff); effectiveness for different sub-types of dementia.3 | Priorities for dementia research 5 What is the best way to care for people with dementia in a hospital setting when they have acute health care needs? This question included uncertainties about the effectiveness of a coordinated, specialist unit for people with dementia within an acute hospital, instead of admission to usual hospital acute ward and the impact on length of stay, the experience and outcomes for the person with dementia, progression of the disease, cost-effectiveness and use of the ambulance service (potential to reduce transfers between wards/hospitals). 6 What are the most effective ways to encourage people with dementia to eat, drink and maintain nutritional intake? This question included the role of professional and lay carers; whether assistance with feeding/drinking improves other outcomes e.g. weight, physical functioning, behavioural symptoms, progression of the disease; effectiveness of food supplements and any adverse effects of food supplements; potential role of a trained hydration team in hospitals and other care settings; role of speech therapy in improving/maintaining swallowing and chewing reflex. 7 What are the most effective ways of supporting carers of people with dementia living at home? Particular questions were raised about: The specific type of help that is effective, including questions about support from paid carers, consistency of paid care, help during the night, specialist care provider service for home care, fast support response, training for family carers, day care centres, respite care, provision of information, help with paperwork, transport, telephone help lines. How health and social care services can best be coordinated and accessed including to improve speed of access to support, one point of contact rather than several agencies, improved communication between services. Outcomes asked about were: the factors that enable people with dementia to stay at home as long as possible and delay institutionalisation, maintain quality of life for people with dementia and carers, maintain physical and mental health for carers. 8 What is the best way to care for people with advanced dementia (with or without other illnesses) at the end of life? This question included references to alternatives to withdrawing food and drink. 9 When is the optimal time to move a person with dementia into a care home setting and how can the standard of care be improved? Particular questions included whether it is better to move a person with dementia to a care home at an earlier or later stage of the disease for outcomes including quality of life, trauma to the person with dementia, behaviour, physical function, costs; consideration of conditions for staff (salaries, career structure and training) in improving care; monitoring of standards of care, characteristics of a good care home. 10 What are the most effective design features for producing dementia friendly environments at both the housing and neighbourhood levels? This question included the consideration of design/adaptation of housing e.g. signage, scenery, space & light; for different cultural and ethnic minority groups; design features that best support and enable people with dementia and carers to maintain quality of life, manage symptoms, minimise behavioural problems, slow progression of the illness and allow people to stay in their own homes for longer?Process for setting priorities 4 | Priorities for dementia research Building the partnership Alzheimer's Society initiated the Dementia priority setting partnership with the James Lind Alliance in November 2011 to identify the priorities for dementia research. The project covered research into the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of dementia. The whole project was initiated by the Public Health Advisory Committee of Alzheimer's Society and a team from the University of Cambridge. NIHR CLAHRC (collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research) for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and Alzheimer's Society carried out the survey and analysis supported by the steering group. James Lind Alliance (JLA) The James Lind Alliance is a non-profit making initiative that brings together patients, carers and clinicians to identify the priorities for research for a particular health condition. It was established in 2004 after the realisation that what researchers want to research can be very different from what patients and clinicians want researched. The JLA has developed excellence in the process and provide an impartial overview and structure to guide partnerships. It aims to ensure that the process is fair and free from bias, and ensure patients, carers and clinicians have an equal voice. To date, the JLA has successfully completed 16 partnerships which have initiated considerable interest and publicity and, as a result, research has been funded to begin to address the priorities. There are a number of ways to set priorities for research, but Alzheimer's Society decided that the JLA methodology was rigorous and well-researched with clear, proven and positive outcomes. Working with the JLA has been a great success and a very positive experience. Steering group A steering group was convened to coordinate and oversee the project, consisting of 13 members representing people with dementia and their carers, health and social care professionals and researchers. The steering group consisted of: Nicola Hart, Alzheimer's Society Claire King, Alzheimer's Society Research Network volunteer Denise Wilson, NIHR Dementia & Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (DeNDRoN) Graham Stokes, Bupa Carol Brayne, University of Cambridge Louise LaFortune, University of Cambridge Sarah Kelly, University of Cambridge Angelique Mavrodaris, University of Warwick Jill Manthorpe, King's College London Tony Bayer, Cardiff University Claire Lawton, Cambridge and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust. The group was chaired by Katherine Cowan from the James Lind Alliance and was supported by Mark Fenton, Editor of UK DUETs (UK Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatments). 5 | Priorities for dementia research Partner organisations Organisations and representatives who can advocate for people with dementia and their carers and health and social care professionals were invited to take part in the process. Following an introductory meeting on 11 April 2012, there was great enthusiasm for the project, and a wide range of organisations signed up as partners to the project. Partner organisations have played an instrumental role in promoting the survey to collect the questions that people want to see answered through research into the areas covered by this project and prioritising those that are the most important. Identifying the questions SurveyA survey was designed through consultation with stakeholder groups to collect people's questions on the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of dementia. The survey was distributed in print and online, and was launched on 1 April 2012. It was open for three months. Alzheimer's Society, together with steering group members and partner organisations, distributed the survey to their members and contacts, including people with dementia and their carer, health and social care professionals, and members of the public. Over 4,000 questions were collected from the survey respondents. Demographic data from the respondents was analysed to ensure that, as far as possible, the responses were representative of the whole community. Questions were submitted from a range of people of various ages and backgrounds. Health and social care professionals, members of the public with no experience of dementia and people from Black and Minority Ethnic groups were particularly challenging groups to access, and several extra steps were taken to specifically target these groups. Collating the results Alzheimer's Society awarded a grant to the University of Cambridge to sort through the data and the steering group supported this. Each question was checked against up-to-date systematic reviews to ensure it could not already be answered by high quality robust evidence. Only a very small number of questions were identified as known questions and removed from the list. Duplicate questions or those covering similar topics were combined and, where necessary, questions were re-formatted to represent research questions. Any questions that were out of the scope of the survey (treatment, diagnosis and care of dementia) were excluded. This significantly reduced the number of questions, however further short listing was required to reduce the l ist to a manageable size for prioritisation. The steering group made the decision to remove questions that were only submitted by one or two people. These questions were reviewed by the steering group and Alzheimer's Society's Helpline staff, who re-entered any that they felt were common enquiries. Sorting through the questions was a huge task that took several months to complete. Once the process of sorting through the data was complete, 146 questions were remaining. These are listed in Appendix A. All questions that could not be answered by up-to-date evidence will be published on NHS Evidence in the UK Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatment (UK DUETs) at www.library.nhs.uk/duets The questions that were removed will also be on DUETS to ensure no information is lost.6 | Priorities for dementia research Prioritising the questions The long list of questions was sent out to partner organisations at the beginning of May 2013, to rank their top 10 priorities. Each partner organisation was able to submit one vote. To do this, many organisations consulted with their members and colleagues. For example, Alzheimer's Society's vote was formed through consultation with the Research Network, a group of 250 people people with dementia, carers and former carers. Thirty-six organisations participated, representing the views of people with dementia and their carers and representing the views of health and social care professionals. The votes were collated bringing together separate totals for people with dementia and their carers, and health and social care professionals. The top 25 questions that were ranked the highest priority were taken as a shortlist through to the final workshop where the top 10 were decided. Deciding the top 10 questions Partner organisations were invited to send a representative to a workshop on 12 June 2013, to contribute to deciding the top 10 questions. The workshop was attended by people with dementia and their carers, and health and social care professionals. There were 18 attendees in total. Participants were sent the short list of questions in advance to think about their priorities and familiarise themselves with the questions to aid discussion. The workshop, which was chaired by the JLA, used Nominal Group Technique, a method involving a number of small group sessions and ranking exercises. Each participant was given the opportunity to express their views on which questions they thought should be prioritised and to hear other people's perspectives. After a long day of lengthy discussions, debates and compromise, the top 10 questions for dementia research were agreed through consensus. Participants from the workshop said:' I learnt a great deal from the people I met at the event and I really appreciated the opportunity to express my views. I was very pleased with the priorities that were agreed at the meeting.' ' Carers often feel so isolated, but this was a chance to put our hard-won expertise to use for the benefit of others - so thank you for the opportunity to do this, I think we all had our horizons widened.'Next steps With commitments made by the government to increase funding in dementia research, these research questions - that have been prioritised by people who are affected by dementia - are extremely timely. Alzheimer's Society will work with the steering group, partner organisations and funding bodies to ensure that these questions are appropriately addressed by the wider research community.
