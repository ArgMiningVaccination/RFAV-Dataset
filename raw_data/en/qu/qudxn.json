Thank You! https://NadjaLind.com This music is designed to relax your nervous system, so it feels like you are enveloped in a bright, warm, summery cocoon: supported, safe, joyful, and loved. A bundle of six beautiful, warm and relaxing ambient tracks in a variety of tailor-made powerful binaural frequencies to choose from: Alpha, theta, delta brain waves and and the whole range in just one sweep and two infinity loop versions in order to meet your needs at any given moment. The music is a fantastic aural summer breeze coddling you into the warm rays of the sunset sun. Tropical birds and cicadas and some ASMR gently tickle your eardrums and nervous system. For me, this music is like a safe, warm, welcoming, friendly place. I feel instant relief from feeling lonely, stuck, or stressed out. Then I ramp to creativity, flow, and feeling LOVE and connection. On a so-called \"normal day,\" what happens is usually a gradual disconnect from my true joyful nature as well as from my surroundings. I experience a narrowing of my awareness, the shrinking of my power, and the lessening of my energy. Building up protective shields and masks in order to be able to \"function and act in the world\" uses a great deal of my precious energy\u2014energy that could be invested in playful creativity, sparking new solutions to problems or challenges, and feeling more in touch, alive, meaningful, and aware. With LOVE, I aimed to create a musical switch to loosen up the shells I unconsciously build around myself in order to protect myself from the constant overflow of information, expectations, mental pollution, and distracting energies from the environment. I felt like creating some more binaural alpha + theta + delta waves, conveyed on a melodic composition of layered sounds flavored with some brain-goosebumps-inducing Auto Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) recordings, which allow the nervous system to relax and become free of daily stressors and automatic shielding and contraction mechanisms. I aimed to envelope you in a safe, warm blanket of sound and a variety of entrainment waves to choose from, where you can allow yourself to let go of the protective, rigid guards that dissociate you from your true pleasureful Self. Each repetition of this composition allows you to let go and open up more and more, so your inner state becomes more fluid, more de-light-ful, more focused, and more colorful and pristine, in order to connect to your playful and free-flowing true creative nature. One morning I recorded the tropical birds you hear singing along with the music on a Safari trip I was invited to in Maasai Mara. So whenever I hear their chirps I am vividly taken right back to the Keekorok Lodge amidst a fantastic, colorful, beautiful sunrise in the stunning vastness of Kenya's wilderness in awe of nature. Birds singing has always soothed me and since this experience even more so. I designed the Loop versions to be able to extend your experience for how ever long you would like it to last and not be distracted out of your frequency just because the track is over. :-) So with any music player capable of single looping songs you can determine by yourself when the track is over so to say. Each version of LOVE FOR LIFE has ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) effects and different binaural frequencies: 1.) LOVE FOR LIFE [asmr, alpha theta delta alpha sweep] This version of 'LOVE FOR LIFE' is 23.30 minutes long and comes with sweep of binaural frequencies starting at 14 Hz alpha continuously sweeping down through all binaural theta frequencies to 1 Hz delta brain entrainment. Towards the last third of the track the entrainment sweeps up the binaural ladder again. This music is designed to relax your nervous system, so it feels like you are enveloped in a bright, warm, summery cocoon: supported, safe, joyful, and loved. delta (0.5 to 2 Hz) deep restorative dreamless sleep encourage the production DHEA and melatonin supporting general well-being theta (3 to 7 Hz) frequencies are associated with hypnotic trance state healing visualization reprogramming the subconscious downloading information reducing stress & anxiety alpha (8 to 13 Hz) frequencies are associated with focus creativity peak performance flow presence Since I've always loved the surprising effects of ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) I've added some ambience recordings and sounds to tickle your eardrums and stimulate your brain as well. 2.) LOVE FOR LIFE [asmr, alpha] This version of 'LOVE FOR LIFE' is 23.30 minutes long and comes with a pure 9 - 11 Hz binaural alpha frequency brain entrainment.
