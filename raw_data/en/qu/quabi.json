The primary pathogens of concern were the Hepatitis B and C viruses and the human immunodeficiency vi rus which are found in blood and body fluids. What NIOSH Did #We met with managers and employees to discuss clinic policies and procedures. #We performed a visual inspection of the clinicprocedure rooms and offices. #We observed acupuncture, moxibustion, andcupping procedures performed at the clinic. What NIOSH Found #Sharps containers were generally not locatedwithin easy reach of the practitioner whiletreatments were being performed. #The cupping jars, gauze, and gloves used by thepractitioner were contaminated with blood duringcupping procedures. #The protective sheath around the acupunctureneedles provides some protection fromneedlesticks.

During this visit, we met with management and employee representatives to discuss clinic policies and procedures; performed a visual inspection of the clinic procedure rooms and offices; and observed ac upuncture, moxibustion, and cupping procedures. Although there have been reports of acupuncture procedures resulting in patients becoming infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV, these incidents were, in most cases, related to exposure to improperly sterilized reusable needles. With the current standard practice of using single-use, sterile acupuncture needles, this risk is greatly decreased. However, there is still a potential risk to the acupuncture practitioner for BBP exposures from needles freshly removed from a patient's skin. Furthermore, the cupping procedure used at DIAOM extracts several milliliters of blood and the cupping jars, ga uze, and gloves used by the practitioner can be contaminated with blood from this pr ocedure, posing another potential risk for infection with BBPs. In addition, we noted that sharps cont ainers and gloves were located beyond easy reach of the practitioner during treatments and an ozone generator was occasionally used in the clinic for odor control. We offer several recommendations for decreasing the risk of occupational exposures to the employees at DIAOM. NIOSH investigators found that acupuncture and cupping procedures can expose employees to BBPs. All exposures to blood should be evaluated by a physician. Ozone generators and latex gloves used at the DIAOM have the potential to cause illness in susceptible employees. Exposure to ozone and latex should be minimized.

In response to this request, NIOSHinvestigators conducted a site visit in October2000. BACKGROUND Acupuncture The Chinese tradition of acupuncture dates backat least 2000 y ears. 1 This practice gained attention in the United States (US) in 1972 whena New York Times reporter wrote about havingreceived acupuncture while traveling withPresident Nixon in China. 2 In 1975, the first US acupuncture school (The New England School of Acupuncture) was opened in Watertown,Massachusetts. In 1982, the profession foundedthe Accreditation Commission for Colleges ofAcupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM)which, in 1990, became recognized by the USDepartment of Education as an agency foraccreditation at the master's degree level. 3 I n 1997, the National Institutes of Health issued aconsensus statement declaring acupuncture to bean effective treatment for certain medicalconditions. 4 There are roughly 10,500 licensed acupuncturists in the US providing about 9-12 million patient visits annually. Mostacupuncture practitioners are required to takeboard exams offered by the National Commissionfor the Certification of Acupuncture and OrientalMedicine (NCCAOM) to become certifiedpractitioners. 5 Local acupuncture regulatory agencies may offer an additional certificationprocess in certain states. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles into the skin at specific points. 6 Otherprocedures often used in conjunction with acupuncture include moxibustion , which involves the burning of moxa (Latin chrysanthemum\"),7 and cupping , in which a lancet is used to puncture the skin, after which asmall glass jar is heated and placed over thepunctured area, creating a vacuum that draws outapproximately three to five milliliters (mL) ofblood. 8 Transfer of viral infections, including HIV, HBV, and HCV, may occur betweenpatients or from patients to practitioners ifneedles are not properly sterilized betweenuses. 9,10,11,12,13,14 However, sterile, single-use needles are almost universally used in the UStoday and are regulated by the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) as approved medicaldevices. 15 The needles are surrounded by a protective plastic sheath, or guide tube, thatprevents the needle from being inserted toodeeply into the skin. This sheath also helpsprevent inadvertent needlesticks to thepractitioner. Many herbal products are used byacupuncture practitioners to treat a variety ofpatient concerns. These are classified by theFDA as dietary supplements and as such are notsubject to the strict regulations required forcompounds classified as drugs. 16 Dallas Institute of Acupuncture & OrientalMedicine Practitioners at the DIAOM have been offering acupuncture and other Oriental medicineprocedures since 1996. They maintain a staff ofapproximately 14 faculty and 60 students whoprovide care to approximately 25 clients perweek. All students must complete a clean needletechnique course prior to beginning their trainingat the DIAOM. This course is sponsored by theCouncil of Colleges of Acupuncture and OrientalMedicine (CCAOM), 17 and its content is based on recommendations from the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) regardingpreventing transmission of BBPs. 18 Neither students nor faculty are required to receive amedical exam or any vaccinations to work at theDIAOM. If they sustain a needlestick or otherPage 2 Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0341-2839sharp object injury, they are sent to a physician for evaluation. Solid-bore, individually packaged, 28-38 gauge single-use needles are utilized for acupunctureprocedures. Needles, gauze, and cotton that havebeen contaminated with blood or other bodyfluids are disposed of into sharps containerslocated in each treatment room. Tweezers,forceps, and other reusable devices are soaked ina bleach solution between uses. Latex and non-latex gloves are available for all practitioners, andtheir use is encouraged but not mandatory. Thegloves are stored in a supply room outside of thetreatment rooms. All surfaces in the treatmentrooms are cleaned with a 3% hydrogen peroxidesolution between patient treatments. The DIAOM maintains a collection of over 300 Oriental herbs and pills in a room withintheir office facility (Appendix A). Theseproducts are imported from China and, becausethey are classified as \"dietary supplements\" (notas \"drugs\"), they are not subject to any routineregulatory oversight in the US. 16 Specific herbs and/or pills are selected for treatment of a client'sillness and then may be burned, ground with amortar and pestle, or used in their original form.An ozone (O 3) generator is occasionally used for the purpose of controlling odors. METHODS During the site visit, NIOSH investigators metwith management and employee representativesto discuss clinic policies and procedures,performed a visual inspection of the clinicprocedure rooms and offices, and observedacupuncture, moxibus tion, and cupping procedures utilized at the clinic. EVALUATION CRITERIA Bloodborne PathogensIn the health care setting, BBP transmission canoccur when health car e workers (HCWs) are exposed to the blood or body fluids of infectedpatients. 19 Occupational exposures that may result in HIV, HBV, or HCV transmissioninclude needlestick and other sharps injuries;direct inoculation of a virus into scratches,lesions, abrasions, or burns on the skin(percutaneous); and inocul ation of virus onto the mucosal (mucous membrane) surfaces of theeyes, nose or mouth through splashes. HIV,HBV, and HCV do not s pontaneously penetrate intact skin, and airborne transmission of theseviruses does not occur. In 1987, CDC developed universal precautions to help protect HCWs and patients from infectionwith BBPs in the health care setting. 20 These recommendations stress that blood is the mostimportant source of HIV, HBV, and other BBPsand that infection control efforts should focus onthe prevention of exposures to blood and the useof available vaccines. In 1991, the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) issuedthe BBP Standard. 21 It requires that (a) HBV vaccine be made available to HCWs who are atrisk of occupational HBV exposure, (b) writtenexposure control plans be developed, (c)engineering and work practice exposure controlsbe implemented, and (d) HCWs receive annualtraining in BBP exposure prevention. In 1995,CDC introduced the concept of standardprecautions emphasizing that blood and bodyfluids of all patients should be considered potentially infectious. 20,22,23 The core elements of standard precautions comprise hand washing afterpatient contact, the use of barrier precautions(e.g., gloves, gowns, goggles, and face shields) toprevent mucocutaneous contact, minimal manualmanipulation of sharp instruments and devices,and disposal of these items in puncture-resistantcontainers. Needlesticks and Sharps Injuries On November 6, 2000, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act (NSPA) became public law.24 This Act mandates specific revisions to OSHA'sHealth Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0341-2839 Page 3BBP Standard21 in accordance with specific language included in the NSPA. These revisionsinclude a requirement that in workplaces wherethere is a risk for percutaneous exposures toblood or other body fluids, a sharps injury log bekept in addition to the OSHA Log and Summaryof Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (Form200). This sharps injury log must includedetailed information on the injury, including thetype and brand of device involved in the incident,the department or work area where the exposureincident occurred, and an explanation of how theincident occurred. Hepatitis B Persons infected with HBV are at risk for chronicliver disease (e.g., chronic active Hepatitis,cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma)and can potentially infect others. The probabilityof HBV transmission after an occupationalexposure is dependent upon the concentration of the virus in the implicated body fluid, the volumeof infective material transferred, and the route ofinoculation (e.g., percutaneous or mucosal). Oneof the most common modes of HBV transmissionin the health care setting is an unintentionalinjury from a needle contaminated with bloodfrom a patient who is Hepatitis B surface antigen(HBsAg) positive. 25 The risk of transmission after a needlestick exposure, if the exposedperson is not immune, is about 30% if the source patient is positive for Hepatitis B e antigen(HBeAg). 26,27 The incidence of HBV infection among HCWshas decreased since the early 1980s. 28 T h e decline is attributed to the implementation ofstandard precautions in health care settings,including the increasing use of barrierprecautions and personal protective devices(gloves, goggles, etc.) and increasing levels ofHepatitis B vaccination coverage amongHCWs. 29,30,31 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the HospitalInfection Control Practices Advisory Committee(HICPAC) recommend that workers potentiallyexposed to blood or blood-contaminated bodyfluids receive vaccination with the HBV vaccine,which provides pre- and post-exposure protection against HBV infection. 32,33 Three intramusculardoses induce a protective antibody response in >90% of healthy recipients for at least 12 years,and routine booster doses of Hepatitis B vaccineare not considered necessary. 34,35,36 One to two months after completion of the three-dose series,post-vaccination testing should be done for allHCWs who are at risk for BBP exposures.Persons who do not show the presence ofantibodies to HBV after the primary vaccineseries should complete a second three-dosevaccine series or be evaluated to determine ifthey are HBsAg positive. Re-vaccinated personsshould be retested at the completion of the secondvaccine series. Non-responders who are HBsAgnegative should be considered susceptible toHBV infection and should be counseledregarding precautions to prevent HBV infectionand the need to obtain Hepatitis B immuneglobulin (HBIG) prophylaxis for any known orprobable exposure to HBsAg-positive blood. 20 For exposed persons who are not immune, eitherbecause they have not received the HBV vaccineseries or because they are non-responders,multiple doses of HBIG have been shown toprovide an estimated 75% protection from HBVinfection following percutaneous exposure toHBsAg-positive blood when initiated within oneweek of exposure. 37,38,39 These i ndividuals should also receive the HBV vaccine series.40 HBV is resistant to drying, simple detergents, andalcohol, and has been found to be stable onenvironmental surfaces for at least sevendays. 41,42,43,44,45,46 Thus, indirect inoculation can occur via inanimate objects (e.g., contaminatedmedical equipment or environmental surfaces).However, HBV has shown to be inactivatedby several intermediate-level disinfectants,including 0.1% glutaralde hyde and 500 parts per million (ppm) free chlorine from sodiumhypochlorite (i.e., household bleach). 47,48 Heating to 98\u00b0C for two minutes also inactivates HBV.49 Hepatitis C HCV was identified in 1988 as the primary causeof non-A, non-B Hepatitis, and as a major causeof acute and chronic Hepatitis worldwide. HCVtypically circulates at lower titers in infectedblood than HBV and is not transmitted efficientlythrough occupational exposures to blood. 50,51Page 4 Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0341-2839Hence, HCV is most likely to be transmitted only by large exposures to blood, such as through the transfusion of blood or blood products frominfectious donors or sharing of contaminatedneedles among injection drug users. 19 The actual risk of infectivity has not been well-defined forHCV. The average incidence of HCV infectionafter needlestick or sharps exposure from aknown HCV-positive source patient ranges from0 to 7%, with one study reporting thattransmission occurred only from hollow-boreneedles compared with other sharps. 51,52,53,54,55 No transmission to HCWs has been documentedfrom intact or non-intact skin exposures toblood. 51 The risk for transmission after exposure to fluids or tissues other than blood has not beenquantified, but is expected to be low. 40 There is currently no vaccine available for HCV,and post-exposure prophylaxis with immuneglobulin does not appear to be effective inpreventing HCV infection. 56 Even in the absence of available pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis,individual worksites shoul d establish policies and procedures for after percutaneous ormucosal exposure to anti-HCV positive blood toaddress individual worker's concerns about theirrisk and outcome. 57 The HCV status of the source and the exposed person should bedetermined and, if indicated, follow-up HCVtesting should be performed to determine ifinfection develops in the exposed worker. 50 Data are limited on survival of HCV in theenvironment. Rapid degradation of HCV occurswhen serum containing HCV is left at roomtemperature. 58 I n c o n t r a s t t o H B V , t h e d a t a suggest that environmental contamination withblood containing HCV does not pose a significantrisk for transmission in the health care setting,with the possible exception of the hemodialysissetting where HCV transmission related toenvironmental contamination and poor infectioncontrol practices has been implicated. 59,60,61,62,63,64 Human Immunodeficiency Virus Most occupational exposures to HIV do not result in infection. The risk of infection varies with thetype of exposure and factors such as the amountof blood involved in the exposure, the amount of virus in the blood, and whether treatment wasgiven after the exposure. Among HCWs, theaverage risk of HIV infection after a needlestickor cut exposure to HIV-infected blood fromfreshly contaminated sharps is 0.3% (about 1 in300). 65 Stated another way, 99.7% of needlestick/cut exposures do not result ininfection. The risk of HIV infection afterexposure of the eye, nose, or mouth to HIV-infected blood is estimated to be 0.09% (about 1in 1000). 66 There have been no documented cases of HIV transmission due to an exposureinvolving a small amount of blood on intact skin.Although episodes of HIV transmission afternon-intact skin exposure have been documented,the average risk for transmission by this route isestimated to be less than the risk for mucousmembrane exposures. 67,68 The risk for transmission after exposure to fluids or tissuesother than HIV-infected blood also has not beenquantified, but appears to be considerably lower than for blood exposures. 69 After an occupational exposure to HIV,employees should be tested for HIV status, and ifnot positive, should be followed-up for up to sixmonths. Post-exposure prophylaxis is animportant element in the management of anoccupational exposure to HIV. 70 The use of zidovudine (ZDV) and other antiviral drugs aftercertain occupational exposures may reduce thechance of HIV infection. 71 A physician familiar with the risks of HIV infection and the sideeffects of the drugs should be consultedimmediately after an exposure to determinewhether post-exposure treatment is appropriateand, if so, the selection of the regimen to use.Prevention of occupational exposures,particularly percutaneous injuries, is the primarymeans of avoiding occupationally acquired HIVinfection. Studies have indicated that HIV is readily susceptible to a variety of disinfectants. 72 The titer of HIV in blood is reduced by 90-99%within several hours after drying, and it furtherdiminishes with time. 20,73 There is no evidence for HIV transmission from environmentalsurfaces.Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0341-2839 Page 5Sterilization and Disinfection Standard sterilization and disinfection procedures recommended for patient care equipment areadequate to sterilize or disinfect itemscontaminated with blood or other body fluidsfrom people infected with BBPs. 20 Because foreign material may interfere with thesterilization or disinfection procedure, devicesmust first be adequately cleaned. 74 All spills of blood and blood-contaminat ed body fluids should be promptly cleaned by a person wearingappropriate gloves and us ing an Environmental Protection Agency-approved disinfectant or a1:10 to 1:100 solution of household bleach. 20 Visible material should first be removed withdisposable towels or other means to preventdirect contact with blood. The area should thenbe decontaminated with an appropriatedisinfectant. 20 Latex Natural latex is an intracellular milky fluidproduced by the laticifer cells of the tropicalrubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. It is manually harvested and, through multiple processes, isconverted into natural rubber latex (NRL). This,in turn, is used for the manufacture ofcommercial latex products, including latexgloves, balloons, and condoms. Over the last 20years, reports of adverse reactions to NRL haveincreased, and latex allergy has been recognizedas an occupational health hazard. Studies inHCWs have shown latex allergy prevalence ratesof 2-16.9%. 75,76,77 Several reasons may exist for the increase in reports of latex allergy and otheradverse reactions to latex. The use of latexgloves has increased significantly since theintroduction of universal precautions to preventthe transmission of HIV, HBV, and otherinfectious agents. To meet the increased demandfor latex gloves, some manufacturers mayproduce more allergenic gloves because ofchanges in raw materials, processing, ormanufacturing procedures. Also, physician andpublic awareness of latex allergy has increased.Routes of exposure to NRL include dermal,mucosal, percutaneous, and inhalation. NRLsensitization is also associated with allergies to certain foods, including ba nana, avocado, potato, tomato, passion fruit, kiwi fruit, papaya, andchestnut. 78,79 The prevention of adverse latex reactions depends on the identification ofindividuals who are allergic so that they canavoid exposure to NRL- containing products. If latex allergy is suspected, a physician familiarwith latex allergy should be consulted. RESULTS During our observation of procedures at the DIAOM, we noted the following: 1. Sharps containers were generally located in a corner of the treatment rooms beyond easy reachof the practitioner while treatments were beingperformed. Approximately 30 pounds of sharpscontainers are disposed of as biohazardous wasteon a monthly basis. 2. Three to five mL of blood were extracted during the cupping procedures. The cupping jars,gauze, and gloves used by the practitioner werecontaminated with blood from this procedure.Contaminated c upping ja rs are placed on a tray covered with a reusable, absorbent liner. Thepotential for cross-contamination exists if thisliner cannot be appropriately decontaminated.Decontamination procedures were not observedduring the NIOSH site visit, but the DIAOMmanagement told us that they planned to replacethe liners with a disposable adsorbent product. 3. The protective sheath around the acupuncture needles provides some protection fromunintentional needlesticks. However, there is stilla potential for needlesticks after the needle isremoved from the patient's skin. 4. The burning of moxa created a noticeable, strong odor and visible smoke in the treatmentroom. DIAOM personnel reported that asmokeless form of moxa is available. 5. Gloves are stored outside of treatment rooms; none were available in the individual treatmentrooms.Page 6 Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0341-28396. An O3 generator is occasionally used for the purpose of controlling odors. The O3 generator was not used during the NIOSH site visit. 7. There is no exhaust ventilation or containment provided in the herbal storage room where theherbs and other products are prepared (i.e.,crushed or mixed). DISCUSSION Although the pr actice of acupuncture has historically resulted in HIV, HBV, and HCVinfections in patients, these incidents were, inmost cases, related to the utilization of reusableneedles that were not properly sterilized. 9-14 With the incorporation of single-use, sterileacupuncture needles, this risk is greatlydecreased. However, there is still a potential riskto the acupuncture practitioner of exposures fromneedles freshly removed from a patient's skin. Inaddition, the cupping procedure used at DIAOMproduces several milliliters of blood, andexposure to this blood is a potential risk forinfection with any of the BBPs. O 3 generators (electronic devices that emit O3 by design) are commercially available and widely promoted asair cleaning devices that eliminate chemicalpollutants, remove indoor allergens, kill moldsand bacteria, and \"freshen air\" in the indoorenvironment. no carefully conductedstudies (published in the peer-reviewed literature)have substantiated that O 3 removes these pollutants innocuously.80,81 In fact, studies have found that in addition to being a primarypulmonary irritant, O 3 can react with other chemicals in the indoor environment to createinsidious and more irritating chemicalcompounds. 82,83 RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Immediately following an exposure to bloodor body fluids, or to objects potentiallycontaminated with blood or body fluids, thefollowing should occur: areas of skin exposed toneedlesticks and cuts should be washed with soapand water; after splashes to the nose, mouth, orskin, the area should be flushed with water; andafter splashes to the eyes, the eyes should beirrigated with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigants. 23 2. All workplace needlesticks, cuts from othersharp objects, or splashes onto the skin, eyes,nose, or mouth should be immediately reportedand evaluated by a physician familiar withoccupational BBP exposures. A program shouldbe put into place that emphasizes and ensures thatthis reporting and medical follow-up is takingplace. 21, 84 3. In accordance with CDC recommendationsand OSHA requirements for HCWs, allemployees should be offered the HBV vaccinefree of charge. 32,85 One to two months after completion of the three-dose vaccination series,employees should be tested for antibody toHepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Boosterdoses of Hepatitis B vaccine are not considerednecessary, and periodic serologic testing tomonitor antibody concentrations after completionof the vaccine series is not recommended. 4. Employers should provide education to employees regarding the prevention of HCV inthe occupational setting, and such informationshould be routinely updated to ensure accuracy. 57 The DIAOM should establish policies andprocedures for follow-up after percutaneous ormucosal exposure to anti-HCV positive blood toaddress individual worker's concerns about theirrisk and outcome. 5. A sharps injury log should be kept in accordance with the 2000 NSPA. 24 6. Employees should be provided with accurateand up-to-date information on the risk andprevention of infection from all bloodbornepathogens. After any sharp injury or splash to theeyes, nose, or mouth, DIAOM managementshould refer the exposed worker to anoccupational or infectious disease physician todiscuss the need for post-exposure treatment andfollow-up. 40 7.

Because of the potential for employees to develop allergy to latex, the use of latex glovesshould be limited to those situations where latexis considered necessary to prevent skin exposureto infectious agents. If latex gloves are chosen,use powder-free low-protein gloves. Considermaking gloves available in treatment rooms sothat practitioners will have easy access to themduring procedures. 9. All spills of blood and blood-contaminated body fluids should be promptly cleaned by aperson wearing appropriate gloves and using anEnvironmental Protection Agency-approveddisinfectant or a 1:10 to 1:100 solution ofhousehold bleach. 20,40 Visible material should first be removed with dis posable towels or other means to prevent direct contact with blood. Thearea should then be decontaminated with anappropriate disinfectant. Latex gloves do notprovide adequate prot ection from disinfection agents, since the chemicals may causedeterioration of the glove material. Consideration should be given to using vinyl or nitrile rubber gloves instead of latex. Nitrile, for example,could safely be used with most disinfectantsincluding ethyl alcohol , hydrogen peroxide, glutaraldehyde, and sodium hypochlorite(bleach). 86 Nitrile also offers adequate protection from bodily fluids. 10. The use of O3 generators s hould be avoided. If an ozone generator is used, employees need tobe informed of ozone exposures as part of theOSHA Hazard Communication Standard orWorker Right-to-Know regulations. 87 Source control, dilution ventilation, proper filtration, andprudent mechanical hygiene practices are farmore effective alternatives to managing andalleviating indoor environmental pollutants thanuse of O 3 generators. 11. The use of source control ventilation should be considered when dust-producing (e.g.,crushing) activities are performed. Additionally,since a smokeless version of moxa is available,consider its use where feasible.REFERENCESPage 8 Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. 2000-0341-283910.
