A ttachment 4-N DC-ADM 8 19, Section 1, Bulletin #1 Page 1 of 2 BULLETIN Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Policy Subject: Religious Activitie s Procedures Manual Section 1 - General Procedures Policy Number: DC-ADM 819 Section 1 , Bulletin #1 Original Issue Date: March 22, 201 3 Date of Issue: Authority: Effective Date: October 4, 2021 Signature on File October 11, 2021 George M. Little The purpose of this B ulletin is to outline the Department's accommodation of Fellowship Meals in Depart ment policy DC-ADM 819, \"Religious Activities ,\" Section 1 . The additional language below has been added to Subsection E. Food Services and shall now read: 4. Fellowship Meals1 a. All faith groups accommodated with communal meetings and not currently already being accommodated with a Ceremonial or Fellowship Meal shall be permitted to have up to two Fellowship Meals per calendar year. (1) Faith groups currently accommodated with two Ceremonial Meals are not affected by this bulletin . (2) Faith groups currently accommodated with either one Ceremonial or one Fellowship Meal may be accommodated with one additional Fellowship Meal per calendar year. b. All eligible general population ( GP) inmates, regardless of indigent or non- indigent status, will be able to share in their religious community's Fellowship Meal. c. Government funds will not be used to subsidize the purchase of specialty food items for Fellowship Meals of inmates of any particular faith and Optional Menu Items may not be ordered or purchased for Fellowship Meals. d. With the exception of Holiday Meals being fixed on the date established by the Department, a local faith community may select any regular lunch or supper meal , in its entire ty, served during 1 5-ACI-5C-07 DC-ADM 8 19, Section 1, Bulletin #1 Page 2 of 2 the week on which their Fellowship Meal takes place - to be served as its Fellowship Meal. This selection must be done 30 days in advance of the date of Fellowship Meal with the approval of the Corrections Food Services Manager (CFSM). If no selection is made by the group, the Chaplaincy Program Director (CPD) in consultation with the CFSM will select the meal to be served. e. The Fellowship Meal serves as the regular lunch or supper meal for participating inmates that day. It is not an extra meal in addition to what the Department serves to other inmates that day . Facilities will ensure that inmates participating in the Fellowship Meal do not consume the lunch or supper meal served during the regular feeding time, as the Fellowship Meal replaces this meal. f. This same lunch or supper meal served as the Fellowship Meal will be served to the entire inmate population as its lunch or supper meal with the Fellowship Meal generally occurring at the end of the regular lunch or supper feeding. g. Fellowship Meals will take place in a location(s) determined by the CFSM in consultation with the Facility Manager/ designee, in light of the need for cohorts and/or zones. If inmate movement is not permitted, the Fellowship Meal will be served to inmates in their cells. h. Inmates who receive religious diets will receive their religious diets as their Fellowship Meal unless they inform the CPD/designee one week ahead of the date of the Fellowship Meal that they will forgo their religious diet and consume the Fellowship Meal. The CPD will inform the CFSM which inmates will forgo their religious diet during the Fellowship Meal. i. Only one Fellowship Meal will take place per day, unless Food Services and the Chaplaincy staff are able to accommodate more than one Fellowship Meal per day. j. When communal Fellowship Meals are permitted by zone or otherwise, i nmates participating in the Fellowship Meal will have 30 additional minutes after the last inmate has received his/her meal for fellowship. This time of fellowship may include prayers, reading of sacred texts, singing of religious songs, etc. k. By November 15 each year, the CPD/designee will meet with faith groups who have group meetings under the auspices of the Chaplain' s Office to propose dates for two Fellowship Meals to take place within the next calendar year. Proposed dates must be appro ved by the CPD , CCPM, CFSM, and DSCS. Each institution will inform the Division of Treatment Services of the proposed dates that Fellowship Meals will take place the next calendar year by December 15. Fellowship Meals not scheduled by December 15 of the preceding year will not be considered for the next calendar year. l. Faith groups will not be considered for a Fellowship Meal whose average attendance at group meetings is fewer than five participants for the past 12 months and whose groups have not met at least monthly the prior 12 months. The minimum requirement of group meetings will be proportionally waived during those months when no group meetings were permitted (e.g., due to a State of Emergency , etc. ). m. Inmates may attend up to two Fellowship Meal(s) per year, provided they identify, in the Unit Management System, with the religion being accommodated with a Fellowship Meal. n. Each SCI will establish a deadline by which eligible inmates must sign up to participate in each Fellowship Meal. o. Individual inmate participation can be revoked in light of abuses of the accommodation, security concerns, etc. DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 1 - General Procedures 1-1 Issued: 3/22/2013 Effective: 3/29/2013 Section 1 - General Procedures A. Inmate Participation 1. Opportunities for religious activities are open to the entire inmate population, without regard to race, color, nationality, sexual orientation, or creed.1 2. An inmate may designate his/her religious preference upon intake and may request to change his/her religious pr eference once every six months by signing an Inmate Request to Change Religious Preference Form (Attachment 1 -A) in the presence of his/her Facility Chaplaincy Program Director (FCPD). Noting a religious preference on this form is for self -identification purposes only and does not bind the Department to accommodate any religious belief or practice, other than respecting the inmate's right to believe as he/she chooses . The FCPD will forward the completed Inmate Request to Change Religious Preference Form to the Inmate Records Office. Inmate R ecords will note changes in religious preference in the mainframe within 30 calendar days of submission. Religious accommodations and participation by inmates in primary religious gatherings and activities may be limi ted to those inmates who are formally registered as identifying with that respective religion and who have demonstrated a sincerely held religious belief. 3. Religious services and programs shall be centralized for General Population status inmates. Partici pation or non- participation in religious programs is voluntary on the part of each inmate. 4. Custody Level 5 inmates will receive visitation from faith group chaplains at their cells as noted in Subsection D. below . 5. An inmate desiring to participate in a religious activity may request to attend a scheduled activity by submitting a DC- 135A, Inmate's Request to Staff Member , to the FCPD. 6. Upon request, a General Population inmate is to be excused, without pay from work , up to once a week to attend one scheduled primary religious gathering. As institutionally feasible, and upon request, an approved General Population inmate is also to be excused, without pay from work, to participate in a special holy day service (e.g., Mass on a Catholic Day of Obligation, Evening Prayers during Ramadan, the Passover Seder, Hanukah candle lighting, Holy Thursday/Good Friday/Christmas Eve services, etc.). Only with the permission of an inmate's supervisor, may an inmate be excused from work, without pay, to attend other religious activities (e.g., instructional classes, studies, retreats, seminars, etc.). 7. Facilities with segregated housing units (e.g., Young Adult Offenders [YAO], Diagnostic Classification Centers [DCCs], initial Receptio n Units, Forensic Treatment Centers [FTCs], Outside Service Units, etc.) and/or other units with limited access to the Religious 1 5-ACI-7F-05, 5-ACI-3B-07 DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 1 - General Procedures 1-2 Issued: 3/22/2013 Effective: 3/29/2013 Services Area should make every attempt to accommodate inmates in segregated housing units with opportunities separate from the General Population to practice their faith communally. 8. Facilities may elect to summon inmates for scheduled religious activities via an \"all call\" and/or a \"call -out\" system. For those religious activities for which a call -out is used, failure on the par t of a General Population inmate to attend at least half of the scheduled activities within a designated time period, as set by the facility, or the inmate missing a consecutive number of scheduled activities, will result in the inmate being automatically removed from the \"call -out\" for that faith group for a period of six months. After six months, the inmate may request to be added to the call -out for that particular religious activity. 9. While the Department does not ordinarily require an inmate to profes s a religious belief, when the nature of the religious activity or practice (e.g., at tending a holy day observance, participating in a sacred ritual/religious fast/ceremonial meal, ordering or possessing religious devotional articles and/or wearing religious headgear, etc.) pertains specifically to a particular belief, only those inmates who have designated their religious preferences and who are recommended for participation in said religious activity by the faith group leader will be included. Minimally, participation in special holy day observances, including ceremonial meals, will be limited to those inmates who have participated in at least half of the primary worship gatherings which have taken place six months prior to the observance (as applicable). 10. When considered necessary for the security and good order of the facility, the Facility Manager, in consultation with the FCPD, may restrict or limit attendance or suspend a religious activity. 11. If a state of emergency exists, the Facility Manager/desig nee will determine the appropriate level of religious activities to be offered. B. Religious Services Area 1. Each facility will provide a separate physical location for use as a Religious Services Area that shall be made available for religious activities.2 This space will be faith- neutral when not in use. F aith group symbols will be displayed only when a respective faith group is using the Religious Services Area and will be stored at the conclusion of the religious activity. As approved, other areas in the facility may be used for religious gatherings, including the gym and classrooms. At the discretion of the Facility Manager/designee, secure outdoor areas within the perimeter of the facility may be authorized for use by nature- based faith communities (e.g. , Native American, etc.). 2. Reasonable, accessible, secure and separate storage space for faith group communal sacred objects will be provided by the facility in the Religious Services Area and 2 5-ACI-7F-07 DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 1 - General Procedures 1-3 Issued: 3/22/2013 Effective: 3/29/2013 maintained by the FCPD/designee. The Communal Sacred Objects Chart (refer to Section 3, Attachment 3- C) summarizes the approved sacred objects for use in religious gatherings. 3. Communal sacred objects stored in the Religious Services Area are subject to search. To ensure sacred objects are respected, the searching of communal sacred objects used in religious gatherings shall be done in the presence of the FCPD/designee. 4. All religious activities will be under the supervision of the FCPD, a Facility Chaplain, a Religious Contract Service Provider, or an approved des ignated corrections employee. Security personnel will be present as determined by the Facility Manager/designee. 5. Religious Vendors, Public Visitors and approved volunteers may facilitate religious gatherings, provided they are supervised by a FCPD, a Fac ility Chaplain, a Religious Contract Service Provider, or an approved designated corrections employee. Security personnel will be present as determined by the Facility Manager/designee. At the discretion of the Facility Manager, the use of security cameras may be used to monitor religious activities. 6. All religious activities will be scheduled through the FCPD and approved by the Facility Manager/designee. As is feasible, primary religious gatherings and holy day observances will be scheduled at a time consistent with the religious practices and beliefs of each respective faith group. For holy day observances which take place at times that conflict with formal count times (e.g., ceremonies, fast -breaking, prayers, etc., that take place after sunset or at ni ghtfall), facilities may elect to adjust their formal count time or to place inmates participating in the holy day observances on an out -count. 7. Religious Library With the approval of the Facility Manager/designee, facilities may provide a Religious Library to facilitate the lending of religious literature and audio/visual resources as permitted by policy. Religious music, instruction, and sacred language teaching tapes may be lent to inmates. a. The FCPD will ensure that all resources in the Religious Library have been screened and inventoried on a basis determined by the facility. Resources available for loan or for viewing only in the Religious Services Area must meet the content standards of DC-ADM 803, \"Inmate Mail and Incoming Publications.\" b. The FCPD will maintain a record of borrowed resources. c. Facilities may opt to place all non- reference religious reading materials in the facility's general library for easy access to all inmates. d. The FCPD will ensure that Security Level 5 Housing Unit inmates have access to religious literature as outlined in Subsection D. below . DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 1 - General Procedures 1-4 Issued: 3/22/2013 Effective: 3/29/2013 e. A publisher or religious charitable organization may donate religious tapes, videos, CD's, and DVD's to the Religious Services Department for review by the FCPD and Security and for inclusion in the Religious Library for general distribution to inmates as appropriate. Such donated publications may come from any source to the extent that the publications will enhance religious offerings without compromising security operations. f. Donated religious literature in a language other than English will need to be reviewed first by a staff person who is fluent in that language and who is able to verify that the content of the literature meets all specifications in Department policy DC- ADM 803. If no staff member is fluent in the language of the donated religious literature, the FCPD may contact the Religion, Volunteer, and Recreational Services Program Administrator, BTS, for assistance. g. Inmates may donate sacred texts and religious literature to the Religious Services Department for placement in the Religious Library, as the FCPD deems appropriate. 8. Display of Religious Literature Religious literature, displayed in the Religious Services Area, will reflect the faith groups in the facilit y, will be labeled according to faith group and will be displayed in an equitable fashion. 9. If a state of emergency exists, the Facility Manager/designee will determine the appropriate level of religious activities to be offered. C. Religious Worship and/or Ritual Practices 3 1. Sacred and Foreign Languages a. Sacred texts and prepared liturgical/formal prayers may be recited in the sacred language required by the respective religion (e.g., Hebrew, Arabic, etc.). b. Messages and teachings (e.g., sermons, homilies, khutbahs, meditations, etc.) must be delivered in the English language. c. The Facility Manager, in consultation with the FCPD and the Religion, Volunteer and Recreational Services Program Administrator, BTS, may authorize the delivery of programs in other l anguages (e.g., Spanish) only when it is appropriate in order to accommodate the overall needs of the population. If no staff, contractor or volunteer knowledgeable of the language used in the gathering is available to supervise the religious activity, the facility may cancel the program. 3 5-ACI-7F-05 DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 1 - General Procedures 1-5 Issued: 3/22/2013 Effective: 3/29/2013 d.

The baptistery/whirlpool/bathtub is to be cleaned with a disinfectant prior to and after each use. b. A baptismal candidate who has a contagious disease, open cut or sore, or infection: (1) will be referred to medical prior to a baptism ceremony; (2) may not be permitted to experience baptism by immersion as long as his/her health condition poses a risk of contracting or transmitting infectious, contagious, or communicable diseases; he/she may be baptized by the po uring or sprinkling of water; (3) will have his/her baptism by immersion deferred until that time when he/she is verified by medical as not presenting a risk of contracting or transmitting infectious, contagious, or communicable diseases. c. Baptisteries must be filled no sooner than two hours prior to the baptism(s) or, if the baptistery is filled more than two hours prior to the baptism(s), it must be securely covered until the time the baptistery is utilized. 5. Review of Religious Practices The Facility Manager/designee may periodically review religious practices to determine whether a religious practice remains within the scope of best correctional practice. If the Facility Manager/designee determines that a religious practice jeopardizes facility safety , security and/or the good order of the facility, the practice may be temporarily suspended. The Religion, Volunteer and Recreational Services Program Administrator, BTS, shall be notified of all suspensions of religious activities. The religious practice may resume only upon completion of a thorough evaluation of the practice by BTS, legal and the Executive Deputy Secretary, with respect to compelling governmental interests and least restrictive alternatives. D. Inmates in Special Housing 1. A representative of the Religious Services Department will visit inmates housed in Security Level 5 Housing Units, the facility infirmary, mental health units, and other segregated housing units on a daily basis in accordance with Department policy 6.5.1, \"Security Level 5 Housing Units.\" As directed by the FCPD, Faith Group Chaplains shall visit inmates housed in Security Level 5 Housing Units , the facility infirmary, mental DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 1 - General Procedures 1-7 Issued: 3/22/2013 Effective: 3/29/2013 health units, and other segregated housing units a minimum of once a week.4 All Chaplains entering/exiting the unit shall sign in/out on the DC -702.

The FCPD shall develop local procedures to permit a Security Level 5 inmate access to books from the Religious Library based on the inmate's custody status and management phase/level. 5. The facility will ensure that the Religious Services Department is notified when an inmate is admitted to an outside hospital. As feasible, the FCPD/designee will visit inmates admitted to outside hospitals in accordance with Department policy DC-ADM 812, \"Inmate Visiting Privileges,\" Section 1 .

Financial donations may not be designated for specific inmates. j. Food items for inmate consumption at ceremonial meals may not be donated by any outside individual, organization, vendor or community.

When not in use, incense and matches used in communal religious gat herings, will be secured in the Religious Services Area. 5. Oils (Sacred) a. Many Christian (e.g., Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, etc.) clergy use anointing oils in the context of blessing new converts, rites of passage, and/or praying for individuals in nee d of healing. The use of anointing oils by Christian clergy is permitted, provided the oil is contained in a small clear plastic see -through container and provided inmates do not have access to this oil. b. It is acceptable for Muslims, prior to attending Jum'ah, to apply a very small amount of scented oil on their wrists. The Religious Services Department may establish a safe and secure procedure by which Muslim inmates have a small DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 3 - Religious Articles and Accoutrements 3-11 Issued: 1/24/2013 Effective: 2/1/2013 amount of scented oil applied to their wrists upon entering Jum'ah. Muslim inmates may assist in applying scented oils on the wrists of inmates entering Jum'ah; however this distribution shall be closely monitored by a chaplain. c. Any inmate in possession of a quantity of sacred oil outside the R eligious Services Area shall be in the possession of contraband. 6. Tobacco (Sacred) a. The religious use of sacred tobacco shall not be prohibited as a result of the Department's no -smoking requirements; however, the location in which sacred tobacco may be used may be restricted. b. The ceremonial use of tobacco is a legitimate group religious practice for Native Americans. The most common use of sacred tobacco is in the Sacred Pipe Ceremony in which a small amount of sacred tobacco is mixed with sacred herbs (e.g., cedar, sage, sweet grass). c. Native American chaplains shall be permitted to bring an appropriate amount of sacred tobacco into the facility for ceremonial use only. d. Facilities that have Native American religious programs shall develop operational procedures that allow for the ceremonial use of tobacco under the guidance of a Native American Chaplain. e. Sacred tobacco shall not be smoked, except as part of the pipe ceremony in the presence and under the supervision of a Native American Chaplain. f. The burning of sacred t obacco by inmates not in the context of a Sacred Pipe Ceremony is strictly prohibited. 7. Wine (Sacramental) a. Communal Sacred Rites (1) If a sacred rite requires the use or presence of sacramental wine (e.g., Catholic Communion, Jehovah's Witnesses Memorial Service, etc.), the approved outside celebrant (Facility Chaplain, Religious Contract Service Provider, Religious Vendor, approved volunteer or public visitor) may bring into the facility up to two ounces of sacramental wine in a small clear plastic see- through container. (2) An inmate is prohibited from receiving sacramental wine unless speci fied elsewhere in this policy. The celebrant will remove any leftover wine and the container from the facility after each use. DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 3 - Religious Articles and Accoutrements 3-12 Issued: 1/24/2013 Effective: 2/1/2013 b. Individual Sacred Rites (1) If a bona fide sacred rite requires the consumption of sacramental wine (e.g., Orthodox Christian Communion), the following procedures will be followed: (a) the FCPD will first verify with the Religion, Volunteer and Recreational Services Program Administrator, BTS, that t he sacred rite is a bona fide rite and one which the Department can accommodate; (b) if so, the Religion, Volunteer and Recreational Services Program Administrator, BTS, will inform the facility of the parameters within which this rite can be accommodated; (c) approved individual sacred rites will take place in a location approved by the Facility Manager/designee an d approved via a Gate Clearance; and (d) the frequency of individual sacred rites accommodated in this way will be determined in light of the availability of a community clergy, staffing, time, space and scheduling limitations. (2) For Orthodox Christian Communion, The FCPD will permit an approved Orthodox Christian priest to administer the sacrament of Orthodox Communion under the condition that a droplet of wine has been dried on the wafer and is for sacramental purposes only. The wafer on which a droplet of wine has been dried is subject to search and may be consumed by the inmate. All accoutrements used for an individual sacred rite are subject to search. 8. Searching Communal Sacred Objects Whenever possible to avoid an unnecessar y escalation in tension in the facility , a Faith Group Leader shall be physically present when correctional staff search communal sacred objects secured in the Religious Services A rea to witness that sacred objects are respected as they are searched for co ntraband.

Least Restrictive Means Within security and budgetary limitations and in light of available resources, the Department seeks to accommodate the sincerely held religious beliefs of every inmate. In accommodating religious beliefs, the Depar tment will use the least restrictive means necessary, provided they do not interfere wit h security priorities and with the normal operation of each facility. 2. Holy Day Observances a. The Bureau of Treatment Services (BTS ) will inform each facility how holy days will be accommodated for respective faith groups each year. b. Facility Chaplaincy Program Directors (FCPDs)/designees will announce these holy day observances to the inmate population by these three means: (1) posters/memos on inmate and Religiou s Service Department bulletin boards; (2) written announcements on the institutional channel; and (3) verbal announcements at faith group gatherings. c. Inmates seeking to be accommodated with holy day observances not already accommodated must request such via the religious accommodation process as outlined below. 3. Religious Accommodation Request a. An inmate seeking an accommodation must submit the appropria te request form to his/her FCPD in order for t he request to be considered. (1) A Religious Accommodation Request Form (Attachment 4-A) is to be utilized by individual inmates who seek an accommodation not already accommodated in his/her institution (e.g. a holy day observance, a separate service, adding a sacred article to the Religious Articles Catalog , etc.) and which does NOT relate to a request for an i ndividual religious diet. (2) A Religious Diet Request Form (Attachment 4-B) is to be used by inmates seeking to be accommodated with a religious diet. b. Within five working days of receiving a Religious Accommodation/Diet Request Form the FCPD/designee will sign and date the form and return a copy to the inmate.

FCPDs/Facility Chaplains may use the Interview Guide - Religious Accommodation Requests (Attachment 4-C) to assist them in evaluatin g accommodation requests. 2. Issues to Consider When reviewing an inmate's accommodation r equest, the FCPD/Facility Chaplain will: a. explore the least restrictive means to accommodate the request; b. weigh the potential impact granting this request will have on security or any other programs. For example, does the accommodation r equested involve: (1) practices that could be used to intimi date others, gain psychol ogical control of others, or put an inmate in a leader ship position over another inmate? (2) items which pose a fire hazard? (3) scents which could mask illegal substances? (4) objects that could easily be manipulat ed to become instruments to harm oneself or others? c. review available mate rials about the religion; d. consult an appropriate faith gr oup leader and BTS (as applicable); DC-ADM 819, Religious Activities Procedures Manual Section 4 - Religious Accommodations 4-3 Issued: 6/8/2018 Effective: 6/15/2018 e. review any evidence that demonstrates si ncerity or lack thereof on the part of the inmate; f. discern whether resources (e.g. an outsi de faith group leader or volunteer, space, supervisory staff, material s, etc.) are available to accommodate the request; g. determine whether a medical condition exists that raises questions about an inmate's health being compromised if the request was accommodated; h. calculate the cost of allocating re sources to accommodate this request; and i. explore other alternatives to acco mmodate the inmate's request which do not compromise security and the se curity of the institution. 3.
