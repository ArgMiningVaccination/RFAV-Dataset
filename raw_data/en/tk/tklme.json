Optimal health is achieved through the use of patient education, natural medicine, conventional medicine, and other alternative modalities. Naturopathic medicine uses the healing power of nature, identifies the root cause of illness, and treats the whole person. So, what is the difference? The difference is Medical Doctors treat symptoms you have without searching for the cause. They use pharmaceutical drugs that covers up the true problem. Naturopathic medicine and Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) spend more time on educating their patients, running diagnostic tests, and treating the whole person with natural, non toxic therapies. Natural medicine is a power tool. We use the therapeutic order to provide you the greatest benefit with the least harm.
