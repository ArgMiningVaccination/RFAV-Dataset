Whip up plant-based recipes with tips from the pros. There are plenty of good reasons to choose a diet rich in nutrient-packed fruits and vegetables. \"They boast plenty of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds that contribute to health and disease prevention,\" says [Christine Palumbo, RDN](https://christinepalumbo.com/), who is based in Chicago. \"Vegetables offer a big bang per bite,\" adds [Marisa Moore, RDN](https://marisamoore.com/), an integrative and culinary registered dietitian in Atlanta. For starters, the [fiber](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/fiber-benefits-food-sources-supplements-side-effects/) and water in veggies and fruit help with digestion and make you feel full, which could help you avoid overeating and potential weight gain, notes Palumbo. The [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/vegetables-and-fruits/) also suggests that fruits and vegetables with a [low glycemic load](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/101/nutrition-basics/the-glycemic-load.aspx) (meaning they're digested at a slower pace) can help prevent blood sugar spikes, which increase hunger. A [review published online in April 2019 in the journal ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478664/) [Frontiers in Nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478664/) even found that a veggie-filled [diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/best-worst-diet-plans-for-weight-loss/) could up the number of \"good\" microbes in your gut responsible for health factors, including body weight and blood sugar control. Also, many veggies and fruits come with more than just one perk. \"While a red bell pepper can cover your [vitamin C](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/ascorbic-acid) for the day, it also delivers a dose of [vitamin A](/drugs/vitamin-a-oral-injection) and plant compounds like carotenoids, which offer an [antioxidant](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/antioxidants-health-benefits-best-sources-side-effects-more/) benefit,\" says Moore. [According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/), [vitamin C](/diet-nutrition/vitamin-c/) helps the body absorb iron and [keeps the immune system functioning properly](https://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/ways-to-keep-your-immune-system-healthy/), while vitamin A is important for vision and plays a role in supporting the immune system too, the [NIH also notes](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-Consumer/). Plus, antioxidants prevent damage in the body caused by free radicals, which are produced by several factors ranging from air pollution to tobacco smoke, according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16739-antioxidants--heart-health).

And one [ study published in August 2019 in the ](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.012865) [Journal of the American Heart Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.012865) found that eating more [plant-based foods](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/plant-based-diet-food-list-sample-menu/) and fewer animal foods lowered the odds of getting [heart disease](https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-disease/) and dying from a [heart attack](https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-attack/guide/) or [stroke](https://www.everydayhealth.com/stroke/guide/). Another [study](https://n.neurology.org/content/94/11/e1112), [ published in February 2020 in the journal ](https://n.neurology.org/content/94/11/e1112) [Neurology](https://n.neurology.org/content/94/11/e1112), found that people who ate a [vegetarian diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/going-vegetarian-benefits-risks-types-sample-menu/) rich in veggies, nuts, and soy had a lower [risk of stroke](/stroke/guide/symptoms/) compared with nonvegetarians. What's more, [a review published in January 2021 in the ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33275398/) [Journal Hypertension](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33275398/) discovered that plant-based diets can [lower blood pressure](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hypertension/living-with/lifestyle-changes-help-you-lower-blood-pressure/) (both the top and bottom numbers), even when people still ate small amounts of meat and dairy. Exactly how many plants should you be eating each day? Though following a [plant-based diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/plant-based-diet-food-list-meal-plan-benefits-more/) can help you get your fill, an easy guideline for everyone from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is to fill half your plate with fruit or vegetables at each meal. \"If it's tough to get veggies or fruit in for your breakfast, double up on them at lunch or dinner,\" says Palumbo. And once you check out these plant-loving Instagram accounts, that won't be a problem. Your goal: \"Keep an open mind,\" says Moore. \"Experiment with new ways to prepare vegetables and think of ways to fit more vegetables in \u2014 even where you wouldn't always add them,\" Moore says.
