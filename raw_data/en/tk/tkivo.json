On the other hand, vitamins A and E are not which leads to organ damage as a result of overdosage. Nov 25th, 2020 1:05 pm That may be the case, but excess Vitamin C collects in the kidneys to form an oxalate. This is a key ingredient in calcium oxalate stones which are the most common types. This was confirmed by my Urologist and by many research papers: [JacobV91325]wrote: []Vitamin C is a 'water soluble vitamin' which means mega doses just get flushed out of the body like water.

Just noting that the upper tolerable daily intake, or excess, of vitamin C would be 2,000 mg. A cup of orange juice ranges from 50 mg to 150 mg depending on the source, e.g., pure concentrate, juice/diluted from concentrate, direct raw orange. A typical adult multivitamin has 180 mg.

I found that interesting as I did not know that. Nov 26th, 2020 6:41 pm veggies high in vitamin C include broccoli, cauliflower and brussel sprouts. Plus you get the fiber Dec 4th, 2020 4:42 pm I indeed remember learning this bit of trivia studying as an undergraduate long ago. As I recall, the instructor said that Pauling was highly ridiculed among the scientific community and even his colleagues for his controversial support for taking this supplement at high dose for health benefits, especially in cancer treatment, to the extent that he was dis-invited by many scientific organizations that would have awarded him some honorary titles in later years of his career. History has been kinder to him since his passing, so that he is mostly celebrated for his contribution to chemistry and is lesser criticized now for his unscientific views in medicine.

I don't know about injections, but I only see good things to taking it in supplement form every day. Mar 9th, 2021 2:03 pm I'm not talking about megadoses, a dose of 500mg or 1g is fine. Mar 9th, 2021 4:47 pm While there is no evidence that high dose intravenous vitamin C is can \"stop\" or \"cure cancer\", there is some early research that high dose IV vitamin C may help boost effectiveness of standard cancer treatments. [Scarborough1]wrote: []i know this is an older thread but I believe vitamin C can stop cancer as long as you keep doing it. i have met people who survived \"terminal\" cancer for years with IV Vit C. The doctor I know who uses it, uses very high doses and has been doing this for yrs. He says he has never had a patient develop kidney problems. It is also used by integrative doctors for other chronic illnesses. Mar 9th, 2021 5:56 pm One can choose to believe in aliens or Lizard people.
