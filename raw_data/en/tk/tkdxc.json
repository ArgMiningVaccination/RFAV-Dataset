Mr. Mayank Sharma, Lecturer (PE) Directorate of Education, Delhi.iv Physical EDUCATION-XII v Physical EDUCATION-XII vi Physical EDUCATION-XII PREFACE Physical education refers to Education through physical activities \"to achieve all round development of an individual\". And for achieving this aim, the objectives must include - physical development cognitive development social development emotional development and development of motor skills of the learner. Physical Education has moved from being an extra-curricular part of school syllabus to being an integral part of the curriculum since UN convention on the rights of the child on May 1st 2012, brought in through article 31 \"The child's right to play\". In India, too, with the focus on \"Swasth Bharat\", the primary thrust is on wellness, preventive health care and awareness. This makes it essential that physical fitness issues are addressed at different levels of schooling. With this objective, CBSE has made Physical Education compulsory in its schools to train children for a healthier lifestyle. A sound Sports Policy must regulate the implementation of school sport consistently for all learners, irrespective of ability, across all schools in an age appropriate way based on the principle of equity. This policy applies to all the schools affiliated to CBSE. Keeping in mind the need for inclusion and the right for each child to good health, there is a chapter on Physical Education and Sports for Children with Special Needs that deals with the meaning and importance of adapted physical education and the role of special educators for Children with Special Needs (CWSN). As an essential part of education, Physical Education helps the learners acquire skills that improve their performance, sharpen knowledge of strategy and tactics, and helps them to transfer knowledge from one context to another, including sport and recreational and outdoor activities. Participation in Sports and Games builds confidence, teaches the necessary knowledge and skills for working with and relating to others, and provides the learning opportunities to develop skills like qualities of leadership and teamwork skills. This learning is transferred to other learning vii Physical EDUCATION-XII areas, when, for example, students cooperate and work together in groups in other subjects in the school setting and in their lives outside of school. As students learn 'in, through, and about' movement, they gain an understanding that movement is integral to human expression and can enhance their lives. By demonstrating the benefits of an active life style, they encourage others to participate in sports, dance, exercise, recreation, and adventure pursuits. Physical Education provides a solid foundation for preparing our citizens to live healthy life by involving in active lifestyle and also helps to prepare a base of a pyramid where excellence is at the top. It provides a pathway into the many careers that involve working with people, such as education, health, justice, and the social services. As a subject of study, this textbook of Physical Education highlights a holistic understanding of health, focussing on the importance of exercise, games and sports, nutrition and the environment. This book also discusses the psycho-social and mental health related issues of not just sportspersons, but also children at large and collective responsibilities for healthy community living. About the Book The Handbook of Physical Education has a goal-oriented, activity-based and investigative approach. Learning Outcomes are laid out before each chapter listing the desired goals the learner must imbibe in each lesson. Learning Outcomes are assessment standards indicating the expected levels of learning that children should achieve for that Lesson. These outcomes can be used as check points to assess learning and would help teachers to understand the learning levels of children in their respective classes individually as well as collectively. Holistic Learning refers not only to an all-round development of the learner, but also to a cross-curricular approach. It also means learning must be related to life. The Discussion section that precedes each chapter encourages the learner to examine existing knowledge and to relate what he is learning to his/her life. The learning thereby becomes more meaningful to the child. Physical education engages and energises students. It provides authentic contexts in which to learn. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this subject, cross references have also been integrated into the curriculum. There is a chapter on Anatomy and Physiology and on Psychology. Students challenge themselves to develop their physical and interpersonal skills. viii Physical EDUCATION-XII The approach towards learning is Experiential or learning through experience. This is distinct from rote or didactic learning, in which the learner plays a comparatively passive role. Experiential learning entails a hands-on approach to learning that moves away from just the teacher at the front of the room imparting and transferring their knowledge to students. It makes learning an experience that moves beyond the classroom and strives to bring a more involved way of learning. Extension Activities are an integral part of the Book and students learn as they research, conduct surveys, debate, discuss, write and draw cartoons and design posters. They experience movement and understand the role that it plays in their lives. Additional information has been given in a box in the Do You Know Section which provides some input, thereby encouraging students to research and acquire additional information.ix Physical EDUCATION-XII CONTENT Unit-I : MANAGEMENT OF SPORTING EVENTS 1-32 Unit-II : CHILDREN AND WOMEN IN SPORTS 33-70 Unit-III : YOGA AS PREVENTIVE MEASRUE FOR LIFESTYLE DISEASE 71-122 Unit-IV : PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 123-158 Unit-V : SPORTS AND NUTRITION 159-198 Unit-VI : TEST AND MEASUREMENT IN SPORTS 199-226 Unit-VII : PHYSIOLOGY AND INJURIES IN SPORTS 227-264 Unit-VIII : BIOMECHANICS & SPORTS 265-306 Unit-IX : PSYCHOLOGY AND SPORTS 307-352 Unit-X : 1 Physical EDUCATION-XII UNIT I MANAGEMENT OF SPORTING EVENTS Overview W Functions of Sports Events Management (Planning, Organising, Staffing, Directing Controlling) W Various Committees and their Responsibilities (pre; during and post) W Fixtures and its procedures - Knock-Out (Bye and Seeding) and League (Staircase and Cyclic) W Intramural and Extramural - Meaning, Objectives and its Significance W Community Sports - Purpose and benefits After completing the study of the unit, you will be able to: W describe the functions of Sports Event Management W classify the committees and its responsibilities in sports event W differentiate the different type of tournament W prepare fixtures of knock out and league W distinguish between intramural and extramural sports events W design community sports program 2 Physical EDUCATION-XII Q. Have you heard about fixtures in sports? Discuss in your group and share your views with the class. 1.1 Functions of Sports Events Management Planning Planning is the foremost function in sports as it gives a view of future course of action. To be effective, a plan should be specific, logical, flexible and complete in all aspects and should assist in controlling future events. A plan must comprehend all the other functions of management like organising, staffing, directing and controlling in order to achieve the predetermined goals. In sports and sports events, planning plays important role to make the event run smoothly, effectively and remain free from conflict. Effective planning must clearly define aims, goals and objectives of the event. It should also explain the procedure or method to achieve the target in simple and easy to understand language. A sports plan should be prepared in a professional manner incorporating the elements of commitment, enjoyment and voluntary effort.3 Physical EDUCATION-XII Organising Organising is a next step after planning. It is a process of execution of the plan. This includes distributing resources and organising personnel in order to achieve the goals established in the planning stage. Organising stage determines the type of jobs and responsibility to achieve planning objectives. Preparation of organisation chart with various positions and reporting should be illustrated in this stage. Staffing This refers to identifying key staff positions, and ensuring that proper talent is serving that specific job duty in order to achieve the aims and objectives of an organization. In this process recruitment and selection of qualified employees take place. After hiring personnel, orientation, training and professional development are also parts of this stage. In orientation new persons are introduced to the nature, goals and policies of events to keep them tuned in to the goals of the organisation. Various training programmes are conducted to provide professional training to the staff at this stage. In sports events, recruitment of staff as per organisation's needs should be done. Example, the apex post may be for Director of the event, in second line Deputy Director and then Assistant Director of Sports event may be created. Directing Directing personnel is a leadership quality, and includes letting staff know what needs to be done, by whom and also by when. It includes supervision of personnel while simultaneously motivating them. Without directing, planning or organising has no meaning. It is a function of guiding, inspiring and instructing people to accomplish organizational goals. Controlling Controlling refers to all the processes that leaders create to monitor success. It involves establishing performance standards, measuring actual performance and comparing them for irregularities. It is a important function of management as controlling involves imparting instructions to employees and also ensuring that those instructions are followed. To organise any sports event, instructions given to members of the organising committee towards achieving common goal i.e., organising a sports event in this case, must be carried out sincerely for an event to be successful. Higher order management people control lower order people to ensure efficient and effective use to resources.4 Physical EDUCATION-XII I. Tick the correct option. 1. The basic function of management is: a. controlling b. budgeting c. planning d. organising 2. In which of the following functions of sports event management \"recruitment process\" take place? a. Planning b. Staffing c. Controlling d. Directing II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. Explain the role of planning in organizing Sports Event. 2. Why controlling function is important in sports event management. III. Answer the following in 150-200 words 1. Elaborate the functions of sports event management. 1.2 Formation of Committees To organise any sports event, various committees are formed for its systematic and smooth conduct. As we have discussed earlier, to conduct sports events lots of professional planning and preparation is required. Formation of committees should be based on three levels of management - top, middle and lower levels. Depending upon the level or area of the sports event, suitable people are chosen for staffing various committees. Example, for an intramural event, members of the governing body or the Principal will remain the top level of management, whereas in an extramural event, the Director/Deputy Director/Supervisor of the state/ zone may be at the top level of management. They prepare polices or aims and objectives of the sports event. Middle level of Management consists of department heads, physical education teachers etc, to execute policies and achieve aims and objectives. The Lower level of management consists of teachers, administrators, finance officers etc. They implement the orders and directives of the top level.5 Physical EDUCATION-XII Hierarchy of Organising Committee to conduct Intramural Event in School/ institution Chairperson (Principal of School) Convener (Physical Education Teacher) Members (Teachers of School) Head Boy/Girl (Sports Secretary/President) Hierarchy of Organising Committee to conduct Extramural Event in Schools/ institutions Director of Physical Education and Sports in State Government (Chairperson) Deputy Director/Assistant Director/Supervisor Sports (Convener) Physical Education Teachers of different Schools (Members) There is no fixed number of committees to be constituted to organise a sports event; it depends on the number of participants, level of event, area of specialization, dedication of volunteers etc. By and large we can formulate 4 committees under an organising committee. Look at the following chart to study their details of work and their responsibilities.6 Physical EDUCATION-XII 1.2.1 Technical Committee This committee covers the technical aspect of the events like requisitions to procure sports equipment, conducting matches on time through selected officials (referees, umpires, judges, timekeepers etc.) for their respective games/sports. Pre-sports event/ tournament: Before the event, it is the job of the Technical Committee to put forward a requisition to purchase equipment, invitation and confirmation from officials to conduct sports event, cleaning and layout of the fields, arrangement of equipment and stationery, preparation of fixtures, rules and regulation of the sports event. During sports event/ tournament: While the tournament is in progress, the Technical Committee is responsible for conducting matches, presence of the jury, cleaning and layout of the fields, collection of score sheets and other related papers from officials, preparation of merit list, etc. Post sports event/ tournament: After the event is over, the Technical Committee arranges for the cleaning and layout of the fields, maintenance of the field, and placing of all equipment back to store. 1.2.2 Logistics Committee This committee has a wider scope of work ranging from transportation, boarding and lodging to refreshment, decoration and conducting ceremonies that form a part of the event. This committee may have various sub-committees as per requirement. The Logistics Committee looks after the Opening Ceremony, hires photographer/ videographer, makes arrangements for the Victory Ceremony and the Closing Ceremony including arrangement of refreshment, decoration, reception, entertainment, light and sound, medical aspect etc. Pre sports event/ tournament: It is the duty of the Logistics Committee to look after Placement/Arrangement/Requisition of purchase of stationery, chairs, tables, 7 Physical EDUCATION-XII souvenirs, light and sound equipment, bouquets, sending invitations to stakeholders including other schools/ institutions and VIP guests, requisition of purchase of medals and certificates, arrangement of refreshments, arrangement of boarding and lodging, selection of volunteers, preparation of first aid kit and arrangement of medical facilities. During sports event/ tournament: While the event is in progress, the Logistics Committee is responsible for the conduct of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, checking registration, distribution of refreshment, management of spectators, handing over of medals and certificates, transportation of players/participants from place of stay to the field and back. Post sports event/ tournament: After the event, the Logistics Committee supervises cleaning of the venue, and placing of the items back in their appointed places. 1.2.3 Finance Committee The role of the Finance Committee is primarily to provide financial oversight for the event. It is involved in all aspects related to the finances of the sports event like planning, accounting, decision-making etc. Finalization of sponsorship, keeping an eye on inflow and outflow of finances, purchase of equipment and other items required for conducting the event, settling payments of officials are key areas of focus of the committee. It is the backbone of the sports tournament. It pitches to different companies and attracts them for sponsorships for the event. Pre sports event/ tournament: Before the event, It is the responsibility of Finance Committee to prepare the budget, to purchase sports equipment, stationery, medals, certificates, and other requirements as desired by the other committees, as well as preparing and finalizing the MoU with sponsors. During sports event/ tournament: During the course of the event, the Finance Committee keeps a check on the outflow and inflow of finances including payment and remuneration to officials. Post sports event/ tournament: Once the event is over, the Finance Committee examines all records related to settlement of the bills and accounts, and prepares the financial report. 1.2.4 Marketing Committee The Marketing Committee develops plans and strategies to place the event in the market with the purpose of generating publicity and sponsorships. Publicity can 8 Physical EDUCATION-XII be done through various modes like social media, print media, TV, e-mail etc. and sponsorship can be generated in terms of cash or kind by making media partners, food partners, drink partners etc. through calling on, meeting various companies etc. Marketing Committee also organises campaigns related to the event. Pre sports event/ tournament: The Marketing Committee prepares a strategy for arranging for sponsorships, publicity of the event, arranging meetings or calling on sponsors, preparation of MoUs for sponsorships etc. During sports event/ tournament: The Marketing Committee issues press release(s), works with media, manages methods of communication, fulfils the requirements of sponsors as per MoUs, arrangement for telecast of event etc. Post sports event/ tournament: Once the event is over, the Committee issues a press release, and may arrange for a re-telecast of the event.

Winning helps that team or player reach the next round, and after a specified number of matches, a player or a team wins the Championship. While watching a tournament, you would have seen sometimes a player or team lose a game, and get eliminated from the tournament. However, in some tournaments they remain in the game despite losing. Why is this so? Basically, there are different types of fixtures in different tournaments based on duration, cost, manpower, level, interest etc. that you will study here. 1.3.1 Tournaments Tournament is a series of games or matches played among players or teams to determine the winner. It provides an opportunity to demonstrate skills, evaluate one's performance and motivate players to perform well, attract people towards sports to make sports popular and provide healthy entertainment. There are various types of tournament formats based on advancement or elimination criteria of players or teams. Study the three tournament formats listed below. Knock - Out Tournament: In a Knock-Out Tournament a player or team continues to play matches until it is defeated. In this type of format, players or teams have to consistently give their best performance to avoid elimination. Such a tournament saves cost and time and makes each match intensive because of fear of elimination. Since fixtures are drawn on the basis of lots, there is the possibility of a match between two good teams or players even in the early stages. In this system a good team can be eliminated even at the earliest stage due to getting defeated by chance or by accident. League or Round Robin: In League or Round Robin Tournament, a player or team will play the matches that are allotted before the start of the tournament. Fixed number of matches are given to players and teams. Players or teams will get equal chance to play with each other. Thus, the true winner emerges from this format and ranking can be prepared for all participating players or teams. However, this format involves more money, time and facilities as compared to the Knock-Out Tournament and there is no provision of seeding for extraordinary teams and players. Combination: They are the combination of Knock-Out and League format. Depending upon the need and importance of the tournament, Combination Tournaments can 11 Physical EDUCATION-XII be Knockout- League, League-Knockout, Knockout-League-Knockout etc. These tournaments are conducted when there are (a) a large number of participants, (b) participants are spread in different areas, (c) venues are in different zones/places etc. In this format some of the demerits of Knockout and League Tournaments can be eliminated. 1.3.2 Fixtures, Byes and Seeding We have learned about three types of tournaments, Now we will study how we can draw the fixtures. In sports, the term fixtures refers to the programme listing which team (Team A) will play whom (Team B), where (venue), and when (time). Definitions: A fixture is \"a sports event or its date.\" \"A sports match that has been arranged for a particular time and place\" 'Fixture is a process of arrangement of the teams in systematic order in various groups for competitive fights for physical activity'. Thus, tie or fixture or heat include multiple and progressive matches. In athletics and swimming the term Heats is used, in Tennis, badminton and other games we frequently use the terms Ties or Fixtures. For any tournament, unbiased draws of fixtures is a road towards the success. First, let us understand the words \"bye\" and \"seed\". Bye - means a team is not required to participate in the primary round due to allotment of draws. It should be given to any participating team through random lottery system. In a tournament, bye is generally assigned to teams by the organizing committee not to play a round due to one of the several reasons: h Uneven distribution of teams in tournament (In knock out tournament, number of teams equals to power of two [e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64, ....] and in League tournament, if there is an odd number of teams.12 Physical EDUCATION-XII h Separate pooling of previous winners in same group to create even competition, h to avoid one team from playing more matches on a single day than the other, so creating disadvantage for some. Definitions The position of a participant in a tournament who is not paired with an opponent, usually in the first round, and advanced to the next round without playing. Something aside from the main course or consideration. A sportsman in a tournament who is without an opponent. The right to proceed to the next round of a competition without contesting the present round, often through non-appearance of an opponent. Seeding - is a process in which teams will be placed in such a manner that good teams that have a ranking or previous year's position etc. do not meet another team at an early stage of the tournament. This procedure is generally implemented to reduce the chance of elimination of good teams at an early stage. Procedure of allotting seeding is the same as given for byes. Definitions The process or result of seeding players for competition. To arrange or schedule, as competitive teams or players, so that the most skilled are matched in the later rounds of play. To scatter or distribute (the names of players) so that the best players do not meet in the early part of a tournament. To rank a player according to the perceived likelihood of his or her winning a specific tournament 1.3.3 Procedure for Drawing Knock - Out Fixture Step 1 To determine the total number of teams that will participate in the Knockout tournament.13 Physical EDUCATION-XII If the number of teams is: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ..... (Number being a multiple of Two) then there is no need of byes. You may see the procedure in Illustration : 1 and 2. If the number of teams is other than the given numbers, then byes will be given as per draw of lot. Step 2 To determine the total number of matches to be played in the tournament, following formula will be used: Total Number of Matches= Number of teams - 1 In case of 8 teams then 8-1= 7 matches (not including third place match) If number of teams are 12 then 12-1= 11 matches (not including third place match) In case of 15 teams then 15-1=14 (not including third place match) Step 3 The total number of teams are to be divided into two halves, namely Upper Half and Lower Half. If the total number of participating teams are even in numbers the Formula will be: Number of teams 2= Teams in Upper Half or Lower Half If total number of teams is 12 then, 12 2 = 6, i.e., 6 teams will be placed in Upper Half and the remaining 6 will be placed in Lower Half. If total number of participating teams are odd in numbers then Formula will be Number of teams + 1 2= Teams in Upper Half Number of teams - 1 2= Teams in Lower Half If number of teams is 15 then 15 + 1 2= 8 Teams in Upper Half14 Physical EDUCATION-XII 15 - 1 2 = 7 Teams in Lower Half Thus, 8 teams will be placed in Upper Half and remaining 7 will be placed in Lower Half. Step 4 After determining Upper and Lower Half Teams, byes will be given. We can determine the byes by finding the difference between the number of teams participating in the Tournament and next power of 2 of participating Teams in the Tournament. For example, if total number of Teams is 12, then next power of 2 will be 16. 16-12= 4 Byes. For even numbers byes will be placed in Upper and Lower Half. 4 2= 2 If total number of Teams is 19, then next power will be 32. 32-19 = 13 byes For odd numbers byes will be placed in Upper Half = 13-1 1 = 6 and Lower Half = 13+1 2 =7 Step 5 Allotment of byes in the fixture should be given in following order. First bye will be given to last team of Lower Half, Second bye will be given to first team of Upper Half, Third bye will be given to last team of Upper Half, Fourth bye will be given to first team of Lower Half, Same pattern will be followed after fourth bye till the remaining byes have been given. OR First bye will be given to last team of Lower Half, Second by will be given to first team of Upper Half, Third bye will be given to first team of Lower Half, Fourth bye will be given to last team of Upper Half Same pattern will be followed after fourth bye till the remaining byes have been given.15 Physical EDUCATION-XII Step 6 Write the serial number (number of participants) in vertical order. Divide into two halves as per Step 3. Then place byes as per step 5. Now place remaining teams through random lottery system from top to bottom or same pattern used to allot byes. Teams having byes will not play their first-round matches. Put Date, Time, Venue in front of the matches in fixture. Illustration - 1 Total Number of Teams = 4 Total Number of Matches = 4-1 = 3 Total Number of Byes= since Number having power of Two, no need of bye Number of team in Upper Half = 4 2 = 2 Number of team in Lower Half = 42 = 2 Round I Matches First match between A Vs B and won by B Second Match between C Vs D won by D16 Physical EDUCATION-XII Round II match or Finals Third match Finals between B Vs D won by B Illustration - 2 Total Number of Teams = 8 Total Number of Matches = 8-1=7 Total Number of Byes= since Number having power of Two, no need of bye Number of team in Upper Half = 8 2 = 4 Number of team in Lower Half = 82 = 4 Round I Matches First match between A Vs B won by A Second match between C Vs D won by C Third match between E Vs F won by F Fourth match between G Vs H won by G Round II Matches Fifth match between A Vs C won by C Sixth match between F Vs G won by G17 Physical EDUCATION-XII Round III or Finals Seventh match Final between C Vs G won by G Illustration - 3 Total Number of Teams = 11 Total Number of Matches = 11-1=10 Total Number of Byes= 16-11= 5 Total Number of Byes in Upper half = 5-1 2 =2 Total Number of Byes in Lower half = 5+1 2 =3 Number of team in Upper half = 11+1 2 =6 Number of team in Lower half = 11-1 2 =5 18 Physical EDUCATION-XII Round I Matches First match between 2 Vs 3 won by 2 Second match between 4 Vs 5 won by 4 Third match between 8 Vs 9 won by 9 Round II Matches Fourth match between 1 Vs 2 won by 1 Fifth match between 4 Vs 6 won by 6 Sixth match between 7 Vs 9 won by 7 Seventh match between 10 Vs 11 won by 10 Round III Matches (semi-finals) Eighth match between 1Vs 6 won by 6 Ninth match between 7 Vs 10 won by 7 Round IV or Final Tenth match between 6 Vs 7 won by 7 1.3.4 Procedure to Draw League or Round Robin Fixture In League or Round Robin Tournament each team has to play once with all the remaining teams of the tournament. Step 1 Determine the number of matches by applying following formula: Number of teams = n Total number of matches = n (n-1) 2 If teams are 6 then 6 (6-1) 2 = 36-6 2 = 30 2 = 15 This means, 15 numbers of matches will be played in league tournament. If teams are 7 then 21 numbers of matches will be played in league tournament19 Physical EDUCATION-XII Step 2 Here, we will study two types of methods to fix the team in league tournament namely Cyclic Method and Stair Case Method: Cyclic Method In Cyclic Method, one team will be fixed in position and the other will be placed in rotation to complete the cycle. In this method, two situations may arise, first if teams are even numbered, second situation if teams are odd numbered. Let's see how to set fixtures in these two situations. Even number of teams in tournament does not require giving of any bye to any team and to find out number of rounds, formula will be number of teams - 1. Total number of teams= 6 Total number of rounds = 6-1 = 5 In order to draw fixture for odd number of teams one bye will be given to one team in one round and in next round another team will get a bye. Rounds in the tournament will remain the same. Total number of teams = 7 Total number of rounds = 7 Staircase Method In Staircase Method, one team will be fixed on the highest step, and that team will play with all the teams of the tournament and in next step down, the next team will be fixed to play with other remaining teams and so on.20 Physical EDUCATION-XII Total number of Teams= 7 A Vs B A Vs C B Vs C A Vs D B Vs D C Vs D A Vs E B Vs E C Vs E D Vs E A Vs F B Vs F C Vs F D Vs F E Vs F A Vs G B Vs G C Vs G D Vs G E Vs G F Vs G Details of Matches Match No Team A Vs Team B Date Time Venue Result Step 3 Determining the winner/merit in League Tournament. In League or Round Robin Tournament winner/merit will be decided on the basis of points awarded to the teams. Example Winner = 5, Draw =3, Loser = 0. Points tally may be as follows: S. No.Teams Match PlayedMatch Win Match LossMatch DrawTotal PointsRanking 1 A 5 4 0 1 23 I 2 B 5 3 1 1 18 II 3 C 5 1 2 2 11 IV 4 D 5 0 4 1 3 V 5 E 5 1 2 2 11 IV 6 F 5 0 0 5 15 III21 Physical EDUCATION-XII Tournament organisers frame the rules in regards to tie before the start of the tournament. 1.3.5 Procedure to Draw Combination Fixture These fixtures are the combination of Knockout and League Tournaments. Same steps will be followed as are followed in Knockout and League fixtures. To draw League-Knockout fixtures, the following process will be executed: League-Knockout Team = 8 Matches = 8 (8-1) 2 = 64-8 2 = 56 2 = 28 Rounds in league = 7 League Round 1 Round 2 Round 3 Round 4 Round 5 Round 6 Round 1 1 7 5 2 0 25 I(Q) 2 2 7 2 3 2 16 V 3 3 7 2 2 3 16 V 4 4 7 2 4 1 13 VI 5 5 7 3 2 2 21 II(Q) 6 6 7 4 2 1 23 III(Q) 7 7 7 1 4 2 11 VII 8 8 7 3 3 1 18 IV(Q) Winner = 5, Draw =3, Loser = 0 Top four teams namely 1, 5, 6 and 8 qualify for knockout rounds22 Physical EDUCATION-XII Tournament committee should form rules regarding placement of teams at semi- finals before the tournament. Here we placed teams as per their ranking.

Word What I Know What I Want to KnowWhat I LearnedCHILDREN AND WOMEN IN SPORTS34 Physical EDUCATION-XII Knock knees Flat foot Round shoulders Lordosis Kyphosis Scoliosis Bow legs Do You Know? A UNICEF South Asia blog \"How sports help girls overcome barriers and bias\" had a big message sent by our legendry player of Indian cricket Sachin Tendulkar, UNICEF Regional Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia \"Let every child, girl and boy, play a sport\". The legendary cricketer mentioned that every child must have the right to play, it is the best medium to help them channel their energy and teach them some of life's most valuable lessons\u2014on strength and determination, humility and mutual respect, on resilience and sportsmanship. Opportunity to play with an open mind encourages children to push their limits, and in the process, discover their own potential. Sports participation provides a common platform to perform and learn to win with dignity and accept defeat with humility. Sport does not differentiate between gender, it respects hard work and values of an athlete. Sport and play is not confined to children nor does it creates impact only on children, rather sports is a big wagon wheel for the upliftment of the status of women in our society. Sports field provides an opportunity for women to showcase their talent and help them grow as an individuals, living a life of dignity and self- respect. The Indian Women's Hockey team played brilliantly in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and produced many such examples. The captain, Rani Rampal's father could not afford to buy her a hockey stick when she was growing up, so she would play with a broken one; Salima Tete from Jharkhand would play with wooden sticks for the same reason. Deep Grace Ekka's family was criticized because she was 'allowed' to play the game despite being a girl. 2.1 Exercise Guidelines of WHO for Different Age Groups World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified lack of physical activity, or physical inactivity, as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality (6% of deaths globally). Regular participation in physical activities and sports provides ample opportunities to maintain physical, mental and social health. Participation in sports and physical 35 Physical EDUCATION-XII activity results in benefits like an increase in self-confidence and self-esteem, a better control over emotions, reduction in levels of stress, anxiety and depression, maintenance of healthy weight, social interaction and achieving high performance in academics. Regular physical activities help in not just physical, but also social, emotional and mental growth and development of infants, children, adolescents and adults. Physical activities should be encouraged among children to ensure strong muscles and bones. Children and young people should not be allowed to sit for long hours watching TV, playing computer games and travelling by car. WHO has developed certain guidelines - Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health - with the overall aim of providing national and regional level policy makers with guidance on the frequency, duration, intensity, type and total amount of physical activity needed for the prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases or Lifestyle Diseases. 2.1.1 Recommendations for Children Under 5 Years of Age \"Achieving health for all means doing what is best for health right from the beginning of people's lives,\" says WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Early childhood is a period of rapid development and a time when family lifestyle patterns can be adapted to boost health gains.\" If they are to grow up healthy, children under five must spend less time sitting watching screens, or restrained in prams and seats, so that they get better quality sleep and have more time for active play. ] The following guidelines are recommended for healthy children aged Under 5 years, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, cultural background, and the socio-economic status of the family. These are also relevant for children with different abilities. Children with a medical 36 Physical EDUCATION-XII condition or disability should consult with health professionals before undertaking these activities. The goals of these guidelines are to recommend time spent on physical activities, and on sleep and sedentary activities to get health benefits. The age group is further divided in to three groups namely Less than 1 year, 1 to 2 years, 3 to 4 years. Age Sedentary Behaviour Physical Activity Sleep Less than 1 yearNot be restrained for more than 1 hour at a time. Encourage reading and storytelling when sedentary. Screen time is not recommended.Physically active several times a day through interactive floor-based play including 30 minutes of tummy time.14-17 hours (0-3 months of age), 12-16h (4-11 months of age) of good quality sleep, including naps. 1-2 yearsNot restrained for more than 1 hour at a time or sit for extended periods of time. No screen time for 1-year-olds. For 2 years, sedentary screen time should be no more than 1 hour. Encourage reading and storytelling.At least 180 minutes in a variety of types of physical activities including moderate- to vigorous- intensity physical activity, spread throughout the day.11-14 hours of good quality sleep, including naps, with regular sleep and wake- up times. 3-4 yearsNot restrained for more than 1 hour at a time or sit for extended periods of time. Sedentary screen time should be no more than 1 hour; less is better. Encourage reading and storytelling.At least 180 minutes in a variety of types of physical activities at any intensity, of which at least 60 minutes is moderate- to vigorous intensity physical ctivity, spread throughout the day.10-13h of good quality sleep, which may include a nap, with regular sleep and wake-up times.37 Physical EDUCATION-XII Infants (Less than 1 year) Infants should be provided enough space and open environment to promote movement and minimize restrictive or sedentary behaviour so that they may explore their surroundings. Babies should be encouraged to be active throughout the day, every day. Before your baby begins to crawl, encourage her/him to be physically active by reaching and grasping, pulling and pushing, moving her/his head, body and limbs during daily routines, and during supervised floor play. This includes giving the baby 30 minutes in prone position (tummy time). Playing equipment should be carefully chosen and must not be so small that it can be swallowed or have sharp edges or be prepared with toxic material. Activities like crawling and rolling should be performed on mat or sheet that is at least 7 feet by 4 feet in size. Once babies can move around, encourage them to be as active as possible in a safe, supervised and nurturing play environment. During sedentary timing, the child must be engaged in reading and storytelling for encouragement. For 0-3 months of age 14-17 hours and for 4-11 months of age baby should have 12-16 hours of good quality sleep that includes naps. Toddlers (1-2 years of age) During this period, the child should not be involved in any sedentary activity which is more than one-hour long including being restrained in prams/strollers, high chairs, or strapped on a caregiver's back, or sitting for extended periods of time. Once they learn to sit and stand, toddlers should be encouraged to undertake fundamental physical activity like walking, running, jumping, catching, throwing, leaping etc. In this group sedentary screen time like involvement with computer games, watching TV or video is not recommended. Engagement in reading and storytelling should not be for more than one hour. It is recommended toddlers get 11-14 hours of good quality sleep, including naps, with regular sleep and wake-up times. Children 3-4 years Children should spend at least 180 minutes in a variety of types of physical activities at any intensity, of which at least one hour is spent in moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. This should be spread throughout the day, indoors or outside. In the 180 minutes of physical activity, we can include light activity such as standing up, moving around, rolling and playing, as well as more energetic activities like skipping, hopping, running and jumping. Active play, such as using a climbing frame, riding a bike, playing in water, chasing games and ball games, is the best way for 38 Physical EDUCATION-XII this age group to get moving. Sedentary time should not be more than one hour, and during this period engagement in reading and storytelling should be encouraged. Quality sleep between 10-13 hours is recommended which includes a nap, with regular sleep and wake-up times. All these recommendations are divided into three components Physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep. Lesser sedentary time and more moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity with sufficient sleep can provide additional health benefits. 2.1.2 Children and Youth 5-17 Years These recommendations are relevant to healthy children and youth between 5 to 17 of age irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity or socio-economic status. Children and youth with a specific medical condition or disability may follow these recommendations under advice of a medical official or with the help of the school special education teacher. Activities should be done in a progressive manner, for example starting the session with simple exercises to complex, gradually increasing the frequency, duration and intensity of the activities. There are various stages of growth in this age group, wherein at every stage the type of activities changes. The chief aim of activities during this age group is to improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, bone health, cardiovascular and metabolic health biomarkers and to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. 39 Physical EDUCATION-XII Intensity Moderate to Vigorous. Volume/ DurationAt least one hour in a day; more than 60 minutes will provide additional health benefits. Frequency One session of 1 hour or two sessions of 30 minutes each. Types of ActivitiesAerobic, basic exercises for strengthening of muscles, Fundamental activities (Jumping, running, throwing, turning twisting etc.) Benefits Regular exercise helps to develop Musculo-skeletal system (Bones, muscles and joints), cardiovascular system (heart and lunges), neuromuscular system (coordination, movement control, motor learning) and maintain healthy body composition. Physical activities also help to develop psychological (control over emotions, anxiety, depression, and manage stress) and sociological aspects (interaction, integration, leadership), result in healthy behaviour (avoidance of tobacco, alcohol, drugs) and promote academic performance. Activities Play, Games, Sports, recreation, physical education, unplanned to planned exercises with or within family, school and Community. 2.1.3 Adults 18-64 Years These recommendations are relevant to healthy adults aged between 18 to 64 irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity or socio-economic status. Adults/youth with disabilities may follow these recommendations with adjustment as per capacity or limitations. An adult having any medical condition should follow the advice of medical official. Activities should be done in a progressive manner, for example, start the session with simple exercises and move to complex, gradually increasing frequency, duration and intensity of the activities. 40 Physical EDUCATION-XII Intensity Moderate to Vigorous. Types of ActivitiesMuscular strengthening (strength) and Aerobic physical activities Aerobic activities150 to 300 minutes per week with moderate intensity or 75 to 150 minutes per week with vigorous intensity; One aerobic activity bout should be at least 10 minutes Muscle strengthening activitiesActivities involving major muscles two or more days in a week Benefits Regular physical activity helps to lower the risk of all causes of mortality, (For example heart diseases, blood pressure, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, colon and breast cancers and depression) hip or vertebral fractures, and to develop higher level of cardiorespiratory muscular fitness and maintain healthy weight with healthy body composition and bone health. It lowers the risk of Non-Communicable Diseases and depression. Activities Physical activities (walking jogging, swimming, weight training, dancing etc.), occupational work, household work (car wash, gardening, etc.) Games, Sports, recreation, transportation (walking, cycling), planned exercises with or within family and community. 2.1.4 Older Adults 65 Years and Above These recommendations are relevant to healthy older adults aged above 65 years, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity or socio-economic status. These recommendations are also relevant for individuals suffering from chronic NCD conditions. Adults, youth with disabilities may follow these recommendations with adjustment as per capacity or limitations. Individuals with specific health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, may need to take extra precautions and seek medical advice before trying to achieve the recommended levels of physical activity for older adults. Activities should be done in progressive manner, for example, starting the session with simple exercises and moving to complex, gradually increasing frequency, duration and intensity of the activities as per their ability and as conditions allow.41 Physical EDUCATION-XII Intensity Moderate to Vigorous. Types of ActivitiesMuscular strengthening (strength) and Aerobic physical activities and Balance-enhancing exercises. Aerobic activities150 to 300 minutes per week with moderate intensity or 75 to 150 minutes per week with vigorous intensity; One aerobic activity bout should be at least 10 minutes. Muscle strengthening activitiesActivities involving major muscles involved activity, two or more days in a week Balance- enhancing ActivitiesOlder adults, with poor mobility, should perform physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week. Benefits Regular physical activity helps to lower the risk of all causes of mortality, (For example, heart disease, blood pressure, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, colon and breast cancers and depression) hip or vertebral fractures, and to develop higher level of cardiorespiratory muscular fitness and maintain healthy weight with healthy body composition and bone health. It lowers the risk of Non-Communicable Diseases, depression and cognitive decline. Activities Physical activities (walking jogging, swimming, weight training, dancing etc.), occupational work, household work (car wash, gardening, etc.) Games, Sports, recreation, transportation (walking, cycling), planned exercises with or within family and community.42 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you Know? Type of physical activity: includes aerobic, strength, flexibility, balance. Duration: is the length of time in which an activity or exercise is performed. Duration is generally expressed in minutes. Frequency: is the number of times an exercise or activity is performed. Frequency is generally expressed in sessions, episodes, or bouts per week. Intensity: refers to the rate at which the activity is being performed or the magnitude of the effort required to perform an activity or exercise. Volume: Aerobic exercise exposures can be characterized by an interaction between bout intensity, frequency, duration, and longevity of the programme. The product of these characteristics can be thought of as volume. Moderate-intensity physical activity: On an absolute scale, moderate intensity refers to activity that is performed at 3.0-5.9 times the intensity of rest. On a scale relative to an individual's personal capacity, moderate-intensity physical activity is usually a 5 or 6 on a scale of 0-10. Vigorous-intensity physical activity: On an absolute scale, vigorous intensity refers to activity that is performed at 6.0 or more times the intensity of rest for adults and typically 7.0 or more times for children and youth. On a scale relative to an individual's personal capacity, vigorous intensity physical activity is usually a 7 or 8 on a scale of 0-10. Aerobic activity: also called endurance activity, improves cardiorespiratory fitness. Examples of aerobic activity include: brisk walking, running, bicycling, jumping rope, and swimming. Sedentary behaviour: is characterized by a very low energy expenditure, such as sitting, reclining or lying down Sleep behaviour: Duration and timing of sleep. For children under 5 years of age includes both at night and daytime naps. Toddler: Child aged 1 to under 3 years (12.0-35.9 months). Tummy time: Time an infant spends lying on her/his stomach (in prone position) while awake with unrestricted movement of limbs. Nap: Period of sleep, usually during the daytime in addition to usual night time sleep. Reference: www.who.int43 Physical EDUCATION-XII I. Tick the correct options 1.

Describe Physical activities/exercise guidelines for all groups. 2.2 Posture Posture is defined as the attitude assumed by the body either with support during the course of muscular activity, or as a result of the coordinated action performed by a group of muscles working to maintain the stability. Posture is classified into two categories. 1. Dynamic posture is how one holds oneself when moving, for example, walking, running, or bending over to pick up something. It is usually required to form an efficient basis for movement. Muscles and non-contractile structures have to work to adapt to changing circumstances. 2. Static posture is how one holds oneself when stationary or not moving, For example, sitting, standing, or sleeping. Body segments are aligned and maintained in fixed positions. This is usually achieved by co-ordination and 44 Physical EDUCATION-XII interaction of various muscle groups which are working statically to counteract gravity and other forces. Extension Activity Working in groups W Distinguish between poor posture and good posture. W Describe good posture while sitting, studying, writing, standing, walking. W Discuss the significance of having a good posture. Design a poster to be put up on the school Notice Board urging students to maintain good posture. Highlight the ill effects of poor posture. It is important to ensure maintaining of a good posture. This is possible where all body parts are aligned in such a way that least stress is put on joints and muscles and, thus, it helps to prevent fatigue. A good posture helps to give good productivity in work, and leads to a physically and mentally stress-free condition. Postural deformity may be caused by heredity, disease, injury, poor habits, improper clothing, unhygienic living conditions, improper diet, improper exercise, lack of exercise, obesity, socio- economic status, etc. 2.2.1 Common Postural Deformities There are a number of postural deformities, some of which are given below along with corrective measures. Corrective exercises should be done under advice and supervision of a physician or a physiotherapist. 45 Physical EDUCATION-XII 2.2.2 Knock Knees Knock Knees, also known as Genu valgum, is a knee misalignment that turns the knees inward. As a result, both knees touch or knock against each other in a normal standing posture but there is a gap of 3-4 inches between the ankles. It is generally first noticed in early childhood, but in most cases, it usually corrects itself naturally by the time children are 7-8 years old. However, in some cases it continues till adolescence. In some cases Genu valgum can also develop due to an injury or infection in the knee or leg, rickets, severe lack of vitamin D and calcium, obesity, or arthritis in the knee. It negatively effects walking and running and impedes other legs movement which hinder performance. In case Genu valgum persists beyond childhood, it may have other symptoms besides misaligned knees. They include stiff joints, knee pain and walking with a limp. Stressed ligaments and muscles can also cause pain in the hips, ankles, or feet. If only one knee is out of line, the stance may be unbalanced. Do you know? The man who discovered genes was an Austrian Gregor Mendel. Mendel was a scientist, Augustinian friar and abbot of St. Thomas' Abbey in Brno, Margraviate of Moravia. Though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel's pea plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of heredity, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance. 46 Physical EDUCATION-XII Corrective Measures Treatment for Genu valgum largely depends on the cause and severity of the problem. Exercises like horse-riding and keeping the pillow between the knees and standing erect for some time are the best. For most people with Genu valgum, Yoga and exercise can help realign and stabilize the knees. Performing padmasana and gomukhasana regularly can help strengthen muscles of the legs and realign the knees. Strengthening exercises can be simple, such as leg raises while seated or lying down. Using of walking callipers is also a big help at pre-puberty stage. Excessive body weight can be a contributing factor to Genu valgum as extra weight puts additional strain on the legs and knees, and this can cause knock-knees to worsen. A person who is overweight should lose weight through a combination of diet and exercise. 2.2.3 Flat Foot Flat foot is also known as pes planus or fallen arches. It is a condition that may be diagnosed by looking at the arch of the foot or by taking the water print test. As the name flat foot suggests, people suffering from this deformity have either no arch in their feet, or one that is very low, allowing the entire soles of the feet to touch the floor in standing position. This problem may be genetic or environmental. At times a foot or ankle injury, obesity, wearing improper shoes (tight shoes, high heels etc.), carrying heavy weight for long time, arthritis or rheumatoid may cause flat feet. It may be caused by a baby being forced to walk in an early stage, or it may be age related. Another condition that might cause flat feet is tarsal coalition. This condition causes the bones of the foot to fuse together unusually, resulting in stiff and flat feet. Tightness in calf muscles may lead to temporary flat feet.47 Physical EDUCATION-XII Arches provide a spring to the step and help to distribute body weight across the feet and legs. The structure of the arches determines how a person walks. Arches need to be both sturdy and flexible to adapt to stress and a variety of surfaces. When people have flat feet, it affects their posture while standing, their walking, running, and other related performances. Flat feet can sometimes contribute to problems in the ankles and knees. Majority of babies are born with flat feet but as they grow or get involved in physical activities the arch in the foot develops. Corrective Measures Exercises like walking, standing or jumping on toes and heels in all four directions, skipping rope, strengthens the muscles of foot which help to develop the arch in the foot. Activities like picking up marbles with toes, writing numbers in the sand with the toes will also help in developing the arch. Yoga asanas like Adhomukhsavasana performed in Surya Namaskar, Vajrasana and other therapeutic massages are also helpful in developing the arch. 2.2.4 Round Shoulders Round shoulders is a postural deformity in which shoulders are bent forward from the ideal alignment, thereby giving a narrow curve to upper back. It leads to postural deviations such as hyperkyphosis, or hunch back and anterior head carriage, or forward head posture. Over time, these postural conditions can progress and lead to other conditions such as chronic neck pain, thoracic outlet syndrome and lack of shoulder mobility. It may occur at any age due to poor posture habits, heredity, muscle imbalance, tight fitting clothes, injury, disease etc. Poor posture habits include using smartphone, tablet, computer, driving, carrying heavy weights and sitting for long periods. 48 Physical EDUCATION-XII Corrective Measures Most important measure to correct rounded shoulders is strengthening and stretching of muscles and trying to correct the imbalance of muscles by doing chest stretches, T stretch, wall stretch, Handclasp stretch and planks, pull ups, reverse shoulder stretch, etc. Developing the habit of keeping the spine straight is also helpful in correcting rounded shoulders. Yoga asanas like Chakrasana, Dhanurasana, can be useful in correcting rounded shoulders. 2.2.5 Kyphosis Kyphosis is also known as Hunch Back or round upper back. The word Kyphosis comes from the Greek term kyph and means bent or bowed. It is a condition of the spine where the curvature of the upper back gets exaggerated or increases. It is an exaggerated, forward rounding of the back. Kyphosis can occur due to heredity, aging, disease (arthritis, osteoporosis), malnutrition, pulling of heavy weight over a period, unstable furniture, poor postural habit, weakness in muscles etc. Though it can occur at any age, but kyphosis is most common in older women. Age-related kyphosis is often due to weakness in the spinal bones that causes them to compress or crack. Kyphosis can appear in infants or teens due to malformation of the spine or wedging of the spinal bones over time. While mild Kyphosis causes few problems, severe Kyphosis can cause pain and be disfiguring. This posture creates instability while walking, running etc. that may lead to fall or injury.49 Physical EDUCATION-XII Corrective Measures Exercises which help to strengthen back muscles, provide stability and make muscles more flexible should be performed. Physical therapy, swimming, exercise/ gym ball exercises, exercises with bands, and Yoga asanas like Dhanurasana, Chakrasana and Bhujangasana should be performed to get optimum benefits. Using a flat bed with a thin pillow while sleepingis also helpful . 2.2.6 Lordosis The term Lordosis comes from the Greek lordos which means bent backward. The spine curves a little in the neck, upper back, and lower back. These curves, which create the spine's S shape, are called the kyphotic (upper back) and lordotic (neck and lower back). Lordosis is a spinal deformity in which the angle of arc of the lower back is reduced. This leads to an increase and exaggeration of normal concavity of the lumber region of the spine. It is also known as sway back. Chronic Lordosis may lead to pain and discomfort and become more serious if left untreated. Lordosis is often caused by obesity, improper development of muscles, muscular or skeletal disease or accident, poor posture while standing, sitting and walking, malnutrition, etc. There are few cases where the cause was unknown. It is generally 50 Physical EDUCATION-XII found in children because of weakening or tightening of muscles of the hip area, but they easily recover as they grow and muscles get strengthened. Corrective Measures Most people with Lordosis don't require medical treatment unless it's a severe case. In severe cases of Lordosis in children and teens, the individual may require use of braces, or even surgery. Largely, weight loss to help posture, and daily physical therapy to strengthen muscles and range of motion prove quite helpful. Exercises to develop strength in the pelvic region like sit-ups, sitting against the wall and pushing the trunk backward and lying on the back and raising upper extremities and legs together will give significant benefits. Yoga asanas including Dhanurasana and Halasana will be helpful. Use of braces, weight reduction, maintaining a good posture and taking a balanced diet are helpful in reducing the problem. 2.2.7 Scoliosis The word Scoliosis comes from the Greek skolios which means bent. Scoliosis is a position in which the spine is tilted to either side of the body. It is a position of exaggerated lateral curvature or sideways curvature of the spine. In this disorder, the spine bends, twists or rotates in a way that it makes a C or an S shape. Scoliosis is found more commonly in girls than in boys and, though it can occur at any age, but it is more common during the growth spurt just before puberty. Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some spinal deformities continue to get more severe as children grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly. 51 Physical EDUCATION-XII Scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, or diseases like arthritis, paralysis, or rickets. It may result from lifting heavy weights, living in an unhealthy environment, and standing and sitting in a wrong posture. However, the cause of most scoliosis is unknown. Corrective Measures In cases of mild Scoliosis, no treatment is necessary. Some children may need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to keep the problem from worsening and to straighten the spine. Exercises like hanging on the horizontal bars and swinging should be done on opposite side of the C-shaped curve. Aerobic activities with slow pace and breaststroke in swimming are helpful and also give good results. In yoga Trikonasana and Adhomukhasana should be performed to straighten the spine. 2.2.8 Bow Legs Bow Legs, also known as Genu varum, is a position of knees in which legs look like a bow, when the legs curve outward at the knees while the feet and ankles touch. Infants and toddlers often have bow legs. It may be caused due to lack of Vitamin D, Phosphorus and Calcium and can be easily cured at an early stage. The condition doesn't cause pain or discomfort and is rarely serious. It does not affect running, standing, crawling etc. Bow legs is a condition that usually goes away without treatment, often by the time a child is 3-4 years old and does not affect a child's ability to crawl, walk, or run. However, parents might worry about the appearance of their child's legs, or an awkward walking pattern. 52 Physical EDUCATION-XII Sometimes, kids with bow legs may walk with the toes pointed inward, called pigeon- toes, or they may trip a lot and appear clumsy. Although in most cases the problem generally gets resolved on its own as the child grows, sometimes, it may lead to arthritis in the knees and hips. At times Bowlegs can be a sign of an underlying disease, such as Blount's disease, rickets, or arthritis. Corrective Measures Use of braces and modified shoes can be along with sufficient intake of balanced diet can prove to be of help. Walking on the inner edge of the feet may also help. I.

There is a rich record of participation of women in sports in India. In the days of Mahabharata, Shakuntala, Madhuri, Kunti all chose physical activities as recreation. As time passed, Indian women, despite having potential and talent, were deprived of participation in sports for a number of reasons. They were put in the back seat and were not allowed to participate in sports. However, female participation and popularity in sports increased dramatically in the last quarter of the 20th century, reflecting changes that emphasize gender parity. Although the level of participation and performance can still be improved, women's participation in sports is generally accepted and promoted today. Despite the fact that women have shown a dramatic rise in sports participation, there is still a large disparity in participation rates between women and men. But to deal with this disparity many countries like India run programmes such as Khelo India scheme and National Sports Talent Search Scheme (NSTSS) to mainstream women's participation in sports in India. While in the past there were certain psychological constraints like low self-confidence and self-esteem, higher levels of stress and anxiety, and social causes like lack of support or positive reinforcement from family and a male-dominated social structure that affect women's participation in sports, or even, certain economic factors that played a negative role that affected women's participation in sports, these are all a thing of the past. This trend of lower participation of women in sports exists not just in India but is a global phenomenon. Participation of women at all levels from regional to 54 Physical EDUCATION-XII international is limited. It affects all domains like participation in sports activities, administration of associations and federations, and participation in national and international level committees. Women who play sports continue to face many obstacles, such as lower pay, less media coverage, and different injuries compared to their male counterparts. Many female athletes have engaged in peaceful protests, such as playing strikes, social media campaigns, and even lawsuits to address these inequalities The International Olympic Committee (IOC) encourages participation not only in playing sports but in National Olympic Committees and International Federations and conducting regional seminars for female administrators, coaches, technical officials and journalists. In a recent announcement by IOC, 49% women will take part in next Olympic games. The Constitution of India also provides gender equality and ensures elimination of any type of gender bias or hindrance. Sports is a medium to get gender equity and empowerment. As more women athletes are participating in sports, there is more positive attitude that is being inculcated. Sports is an important tool for social empowerment and helps to develop skills like communication, teamwork, leadership, respect, social interaction, sportsmanship etc. and can significantly contribute to develop society and community. Sports participation not only provides health benefits but also promotes overall development. Sport does not discriminate based on colour, caste, creed, sex, race etc. 55 Physical EDUCATION-XII 2.3.1 Women participation in Sports - Physical, Psychological and Social benefits Women participation in sports helps them to stay fit and reduces chances of diseases. These are some physical benefits for women participating in sports. These benefits are as true for women as for their male couterparts. I. Phisical Benefits Lifestyle Diseases Sports participation helps women to stay active which, in turn, reduces chances of lifestyle diseases such as Diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity etc. and enables them to live a healthy life. Bone Density There is a higher chance of osteoporosis in female than males. Sports help them to increase their bone density and have stronger bones. Toned Muscles Regular exercise and participation in sports increases the muscle tone of women which helps them to stay strong. Cardiovascular System Regular exercise helps increase the number of capillaries, helping them in the intake of oxygen. This enables women to participate in sports for a longer period without getting fatigued. Obesity Obesity is one lifestyle disease which is found in every part of the world. Most of the India's population is also suffering from this disease. Women has more chances of being obese than men, regular participation in sports helps them to stay in shape and stay fit. II. Psychological Benefits Participation in sports has a great impact on women psychologically as it gives them confidence and enhances their self-esteem. It gives them that sense of achievement 56 Physical EDUCATION-XII which empowers them to achieve and overcome any obstacles that they may have faced. Some of the psychological benefits of participation in sports are: Stress Management Any physical activity releases lot of hormones in our body which helps us to stay happy and reduces stress levels. Sportspersons, men and women, who participate in sports can manage their stress better than those who don't participate in the sports. Control Emotions Women, like their male counterparts, who participate in sports are well equipped to manage their emotions as they face difficult situations in the game which take a toll on them, and regular participation makes them emotionally stronger . Confidence Every small win increases the confidence of the winner. Thus, when a woman participates in sports and wins, it gives not just her, but other women sportspersons a sense of achievement and really boosts their confidence. This renewed confidence in themselves they bring to all areas of their life. Self - Esteem Sports helps women to realise their self-worth and when they achieve or even participate in sports, they get a boost in their self-image and that helps them to realise their own worth, which is very important for an individual. Leadership one of the best quality about sports is that it inculcates or bring out the leadership skills or qualities of an individual. Those women, or men, who participate in sports better are able to lead people even outside the sports as well. III. Social Benefits Women participation in sports helps them to be more open towards society as it helps them to communicate with others and helps them to bond with their teammates and other officials. Some of the social benefits of sports are as follows:57 Physical EDUCATION-XII Coordination Sport helps in increasing and improving the coordination between team players and women who participate in sports learn the skill of working in coordination with others. Communication Communication is an integral part of sports as players must communicate with each other while playing. It helps women participants to be more vocal and expressive. Inter-relationships A sport is not played in isolation, it's a team effort, whether it is inside the team or as supporting staff, the player must maintain her relationship with everyone in the team. Women participants learn to maintain their relationships and respect each other whether it is on the field or off the field. Cooperation Women learn to cooperate with each other when they are playing on the field. This becomes a part of their life also as they learn to work and cooperate with others in total harmony and peace. Because of the above discussed benefits women should participate in sports. Women's participation in sports should be encouraged in schools, colleges and in universities. Awareness programmes for women's participation in sports should be conducted on a regular basis and they should be encouraged to participate in competitive sports. Families should also be encouraged to support their girls to participate in sports. Media coverage and sponsorship can enhance sports participation of women in India. Sports equipment must be developed focusing on physiological aspects of women. Appointment of women coaches, providing opportunities for competitions, eliminating cultural and social negativity and proper facilities can ensure larger participation. States where social or other factors are a constraint should come up with some incentives so that their women can also participate in sports and live a better and healthy life. Now times are changing, and society is accepting, and even encouraging, women's participation in sports at National and International levels. In recent years, it has been raining gold on Indian women athletes in the international arena proving women are no less of a powerhouse when it comes to winning medals and championships for the country. Women are coming out and participating in sports and physical activities in 58 Physical EDUCATION-XII large numbers. Karnam Malleswari was the first women who won a medal in Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000. In 2012, London Olympics, five times world champion Mary Kom won a medal in boxing and Saina Nehwal in Badminton. In 2016 Rio Olympics Sakshi Malik won medal in wrestling and P .V. Sindhu won the first ever women's silver medal in badminton. P .T Usha and Anju Bobby George were athletes who earned a name in Athletics at international level. Saina Nehwal has won 24 international titles, which includes ten Superseries titles. In 2015 that she was able to attain the world no. 1 ranking, thereby becoming the only female player from India to achieve this feat. Saikhom Mirabai Chanu, an Indian weightlifter, lifted a total of 201 kg to win the Gold Medal at the CWG 2022. Lovlina Borgohain is an Indian boxer who won a bronze medal at the 2020 Olympic Games in the women's welterweight event and the silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in Women's 49 kg category. Our Indian women cricket team, wrestling, badminton, boxing are bringing glory to the country as they achieve new heights. Do you know?

Explain the various benefits of Women participation in Sports? 2.4 Special Consideration (Menarche & Menstrual Disfunction) 2.4.1 Menarche The period of adolescence is marked by certain universal physical and biological changes in the body which lead to the attainment of sexual maturity. The time when sexual maturity is reached is called puberty. Menarche (first menstruation) is usually considered the point of sexual maturity for girls. It is the process in which female reproduction system matures and the body prepares itself for potential pregnancy. It is associated with the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Menarche 61 Physical EDUCATION-XII is one of the most significant milestones in a woman's life. The average age for a girl to get her first period ranges from 8 to 15 years old. Although the precise determinants of menarcheal age remain to be understood, genetic influences, socio- economic conditions, general health and well-being, nutritional status, certain types of exercise, seasonality, and family size possibly play a role. Over the past century the age at menarche has fallen due to reasons still unknown. Menstruation (also termed as period or bleeding) is the process in a woman of discharging (through the vagina) blood and other materials from the lining of the uterus at about a monthly interval from puberty until menopause, except during pregnancy. This discharging process lasts about 3-5 days. Women usually have periods until about ages 45 to 55 and have menopause usually around age of 50. Menopause means that a woman is no longer ovulating and can no longer get pregnant. Like menstruation, age of menopause can vary from woman to woman and these changes may occur over several years. 2.4.2 Menstrual Dysfunction Menstrual dysfunction is an abnormal condition in a woman's menstrual cycle. Normal range of the menstruation cycle is 21 to 35 days. If it happens earlier than 21 days or after more than 35 days, then it's a problem. Other menstrual problems include missing three or more periods, menstrual flow heavier or lighter in comparison with usual, cycle happening longer than seven days, any pain, cramping or vomiting during period, bleeding after menopause etc. 62 Physical EDUCATION-XII Causes of abnormal menstrual cycles or menstrual order are: overweight, stress, dietary disorder, disease, sudden change in exercise schedule, travel, other medical complications etc. There are different types of menstrual disorders which are given below: 1. Pre-menstrual Syndrome: Pre-menstrual Syndrome includes unpleasant or uncomfortable symptoms during the cycle. These may include depression, anxiety, irritation, headache, fainting, vertigo, infection etc. and may last from a few hours to few days. Such symptoms may be reduced through moderate exercise, taking a balanced diet, having a good sleep and rest. 2. Amenorrhea: Amenorrhea is known as missed periods or absence of a normal monthly period or menstrual cycle. There are two types of amenorrhea. (a) Primary amenorrhea: Menstruation cycle does not begin at puberty. (b) Secondary amenorrhea: It happens when menstruation is missed for three months or more. This is the most common type of amenorrhea. 3. Dysmenorrhea: When menstruation happens with severe pain or frequent menstrual cramps, the condition is called Dysmenorrhea. Symptoms associated with dysmenorrhea may be cramping in lower abdomen, low back pain, pain in legs, nausea, fatigue, weakness etc. 4. Menorrhagia: Menorrhagia is characterized by heavy and long term or continuous menstrual bleeding. 5. Polymenorrhea: Polymenorrhea is a term used to describe a menstrual cycle that is shorter than 21 days. 6. Oligomenorrhea: Oligomenorrhea is infrequent menstruation. More strictly, it is menstrual periods occurring at intervals of greater than 35 days. 7. Metrorrhagia: Metrorrhagia refers to missed, delayed or erratic periods or abnormal bleeding patterns. 8. Postmenopausal bleeding: Postmenopausal bleeding is bleeding that occurs after one year of menopause or after a woman has stopped having menstrual cycles due to menopause. The female hormones oestrogen and progesterone are important for overall body health. These hormones also regulate a woman's periods. Intense exercise and extreme thinness can reduce the levels of these hormones to prevent or stop monthly menstrual cycles.63 Physical EDUCATION-XII Extension Activity Visit a nearby stadium and talk to women athletes. Collect a data of 5 such athletes in their teens. Are they facing any problem related to their health, diet etc? Discuss about it in the class. I. Tick the correct options 1. Frequent menstruation is known as: a. Metrorrhagia b. Oligomenorrhea c. Polymenorrhea d. Menorrhagia 2. If the menstruation cycle does not begin at puberty, the condition is called a.

Explain the term Menarche. 3. Write short note on Amenorrhea. III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words 1. Explain menstrual dysfunction. 2.5 Female Athlete Triad Participation in sports and physical activities provides a lot of physical and social benefits like developing leadership qualities, competition, teamwork etc. Regular participation in such activities is associated with a longer and better quality of life, reduced risks of a variety of diseases and many psychological and emotional benefits. Evidence suggests a positive relationship between physical activity and a host of factors affecting girls' physical health, including diabetes, blood pressure 64 Physical EDUCATION-XII and the ability to use fat for energy, thus preventing obesity. Physical activity could reduce the risk of chronic diseases in later life. Conditions, such as cancer, diabetes and coronary heart disease, have their origins in childhood, and can be aided, in part, by regular physical activity in the early years. Also, regular activity beginning in childhood helps to improve bone health, thus preventing osteoporosis, which predominantly affects females. However, participation in sports is not without certain health risks. Sports like Judo, boxing, wrestling, taekwondo etc. exert a lot of pressure on athletes to maintain their shape and weight. For participation in sports like distance running, cycling, cross country etc. athletes have to take a balanced diet since these demand high levels of energy and a good quantity of dietary intake. Such pressures put the athlete's health at risk and leads to Female Athlete Triad. The term 'triad' was first described by American college of sports medicine in 1992, and the three components to describe the triad were (a) disordered eating, (b) amenorrhoea and (c) osteoporosis The illustration above depicts the female athlete triad spectrum. The black lines represent the spectrums of each of the 3 components and the red and green triangles show both of the extremes. The top green triangle represents a healthy athlete who has a good balance between energy intake and expenditure. Because of this, they have a normal menstruation cycle and a bone mineral density that is above average for the athlete's age. The bottom left, red triangle represents an athlete who does not have an appropriate balance between energy intake and expenditure, which may be the result of restrictive dieting and/or clinical eating disorders.65 Physical EDUCATION-XII The terms to describe Female Athlete Triad have now been revised. The new terms to indicate problems are (a) low energy availability with or without eating disorder, (b) dysfunction of menstruation and (c) low bone density. This change was relevant because all these three revised components can be easily resolved by proper energy intake and expenditure and same may be used as effective strategy. Thus, if an individual takes optimum calories as required by body, including energy required for physical activity and energy required for body functions, the result is promotion of healthy bones and normal menstrual function. All three components are very much interlinked. 2.5.1 Low Energy Availability with or Without Disordered Eating Disbalance of energy may occur due to eating disorder. The problem of female athlete triad originated from not balancing energy intake and energy expenditure. Consequently, an athlete must have knowledge of how to balance the energy intake. Eating disorder is known as gross disturbance in eating behaviour. Disordered eating has wide range of harmful and often ineffective eating behaviours in the process of weight reduction. These includes calorie restriction to clinical disorders of Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Sportspersons participating in activities in which leanness or specific weight is required for performance are at higher risk of developing eating disorders. Coaches, team physicians, parents, and other supporting staff should know the symptom so that the problem can be treated on time, other-wise it leads to long term physiological, psychological effects or, in extreme cases, fatal results. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder where an individual tries to reduce body 66 Physical EDUCATION-XII weight abnormally, having an intense fear of gaining weight or misconception over his/her weight. Individuals with anorexia place a high value on controlling their weight and shape, using extreme efforts that tend to significantly interfere with their lives. To prevent weight gain or to continue losing weight, people with anorexia usually severely restrict the amount of food they eat. They may control calorie- intake by vomiting after eating or by misusing laxatives, diet aids, or diuretics. They may also try to lose weight by exercising excessively. No matter how much weight is lost, the person continues to fear weight gain. Symptoms may include menstrual dysfunction, constipation, diarrhoea, bloating, unexpected weight loss, muscle weakness, stress fracture, bone weakness, overuse injuries, anxiety etc. Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder in which an individual eats large amount of food with loss of control over eating and then adopts unhealthy ways to cut down calories like vomiting, taking laxatives, weight loss supplements, diuretics, excessive exercises etc. Symptoms of bulimia are dehydration, dental problems, oedema, electrolyte abnormalities, extreme weight fluctuation, menstrual irregularity, weakness, cramps, depression etc. 2.6 Menstrual Dysfunction Menstrual irregularities is one of the components of Female Athlete Triad and it is a marker of quality health in female athletes. Menstrual dysfunction is common in sportswomen and is often ignored. It is important that young female athletes should be informed enough to understand the problem and must know the management of the menstruation disorder. If the problem is managed in time, then it may positively affect athletic performance. Ignored or untreated menstrual irregularities may have a prolonged effect on bone mineralization and the treatment may last months and years. Generally female sportspersons suffering from menstrual irregularities, self- select different sports in comparison with normal menstruating peers because in delayed puberty females develop strong bones and taller height than others. However, such dysfunction may affect sports performance in the long run and lead to complications. Recent research says weight training has lots of benefits including strengthening of the bones and may not affect adolescent menstrual irregularities. Studies show that more than 15% females participating in Olympics may be suffering from amenorrhea. Sometimes the skeletal health of a female athlete suffering from amenorrhea is much lower than that of a sedentary woman. 2.6.1 Low Bone Mineral Density Low bone mineral density, previously termed osteoporosis, may be defined as a disease 67 Physical EDUCATION-XII marked by increased bone fragility, disturbance in bone structure including low bone mineral density (BMD) that may result in fractures, pain, deformity, disability etc. Low BMD is generally caused by improper diet and amenorrhoea. Due to low level of oestrogen and progesterone in female athletes, their bones become weaker and lose minerals. Effects of low bone mineral density include increased occurrence of injury, stress fractures, and risk of early osteoporosis after menopause. Deposition of bone increases during childhood and adolescence and peaks during the 20s and 30s. A large genetic component to BMD also exists, with heritability of BMD suggested to be 50-85%. Knowledge of family history or other medical conditions linked with BMD will help keep female athletes safe from risk of injury and fractures. Intensity, volume, frequency, type of activity should be determined by knowledge of genetic characteristics. The female athlete triad is a result of energy imbalance; thus, adjusting the energy expenditure and energy availability is the main intervention. For this the main treatment is restoration of regular menstrual cycle for reestablishment of energy balance and enhancement of bone mineral density. The strongest predictor of recovery to normal menstrual function in young athletes is weight gain. Family- based therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy, also have been known to be effective interventions for disordered eating. A sports nutritionist can help the athlete and her family determine the quantity and quality of food consumption and dietary supplements required to meet her bodily functions, replace energy output due to athletic training, and enhance bone health. Additionally, weight gain may be necessary to increase BMD. I. Tick the correct options. 1. Weakening of bones due to loss of bone density and improper bone formation is a. Amenorrhea b.

Calling someone a 'disabled athlete' will no longer be considered one of those second best, embarrassing expressions: it will stand for status of a sort that will appeal to the public. Presenter: Surely, what the public want to see is first past the post, the world's fastest - that sort of thing... Green: Ah, that's precisely what traditionalists will say! But it isn't like that. These decisions have turned sport upside down because, from now on, we shall acknowledge what individuals can do. Take Natalie du Toit. Since losing her leg in a road accident, she's trained relentlessly. Now she's in Manchester representing South Africa as a swimmer. What an achievement against the odds! That's the sort of story readers want. They're tired of muscles and speed and running the same old races in the same old ways. They want real competitors, people who are doing their best under very trying circumstances, just like them. The traditionalists can't handle that. They fear change and want athletics competitions to be the same as always. Presenter: So you reckon spectators will like this? Green: Of course. They've seen it in marathon events. You see, they want more than excellence. To see a magnificent performance by someone in a sporting wheelchair is moving and uplifting. You identify strongly with them, which is emotional. You could say that these changes give us a new version of an old sport, something fresh and exciting to talk about. But the real importance is that it inspires the spectators. How many of us who are burdened by unhappiness and depression will see the Games and ask ourselves why we can't overcome our difficulties and go and do something positive ourselves? Presenter: I suppose you're also saying that these changes in the ways disabled athletes are treated mark a change in our attitudes towards them. Green: Absolutely. They're taking a real part. No one can patronise them with second-class events that 'someone let us have because we are cripples', tagged on for the sake of political correctness. No patronising, that's the point. They're there in their own right. You know, 'political correctness' is necessary because it protects people - but it's marvellous when you can throw it out of the window and 125 Physical EDUCATION-XII start again. Presenter: You feel very strongly about disability, don't you, Desmond? Green: I do. There are many forms, and you and I could easily find ourselves classified in some way. When we talk about a minority, we forget how many real people there are out there and the important part they play in society. These games will help people to turn disability into normality. I've seen blind people skiing, and we both know about the work done by societies for horse-riding for the disabled. We all want to be accepted as normal, and this will help. Presenter: Will the Games change disabled people's attitudes too? Green: Anything that gives them the confidence they deserve is important. They will hear interviews with athletes and they'll say, 'Why can't we do something like that?' Presenter: I can see why you mistrust traditionalists. Green: They live in ivory towers, in the past. They talk about the pursuit of excellence and how athletes must be ruthless. They deride the participation of the disabled because they say that athletics is not suitable for them. But no organisation can protect itself from change. If it does, it withers away. These changes are important because they show that athletics is alive and that will gain public support and interest. Presenter: Some disabled athletes argue that not enough has been done. Green: There's a long way to go, but what has been done is radical. It'll take some time to digest. Then we can all think what we should add. It's not beyond us to invent other ways of celebrating the excellence of personal achievement.

A person with disability is not able to participate in sports and physical education due to her/his impairment, attitudinal and environmental barriers. Sports events for athletes with an impairment have existed for more than 100 years, and the first sport clubs for the deaf were already in existence in 1888 in Berlin. However, competitive games for people with special needs were widely introduced only after World War II. The purpose was to assist the large number of war veterans and those soldiers who had been injured during wartime. In 1948, on the occasion of the opening ceremony of London Olympic Games, Guttmann conducted wheel chair competitions for the first time in history. He named these Games \"Stoke Mandeville Games\". These Games later became Paralympic Games which took place in 1960 at Rome. Sports for Intellectually disabled, which were later promoted as Special Olympics, began when Eunice Kennedy Shriver organised a summer Day Camp in the backyard of her Maryland home in 1960s. In July 1968, the world witnessed the first International Special Olympics Games at Soldier Field in Chicago. Sports for people with hearing impairment were also promoted through International Committee of Sports for the Deaf (ICSD) which is the governing body responsible for Deaflympics since 1924 with their first games known as International Silent Games at Paris in 1924. Since then, the Deaflympics are held every four years, except for a break during World War II. The Deaflympic Winter Games, were started in 1949. Paralympics, and Special Olympics are organisations recognized by International Olympics Committee. Today we have sports for athletes with special needs in the area of visual impairment, cerebral palsy and various other needs. In this chapter, we will read about promotion of sports by Paralympics, Special Olympics and Deaflymipcs. Extension Activity Find out the history of the following events: 1. Special Olympics Bharat 2. Special Olympics 3. Paralympics 4. Deaflympics127 Physical EDUCATION-XII 4.1.1 PARALYMPICS Paralympics is a mega sports event involving athletes with a range of disabilities, and is organized by the International Paralympic Committee. The range of disabilities includes impaired muscle power (eg., paraplegia and quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, post-polio syndrome, spina bifida), impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency (eg., amputation or dysmelia), leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment. These disabilities are further divided into classifications which vary from sport to sport. The word Paralympics is derived from the Greek word para which means beside or alongside and Olympic. Combined, Paralympics means an international Games competition that is parallel to the Olympics. Thus, the word Paralympics refers to \"a series of international contests for athletes with disabilities that are associated with and held following the summer and winter Olympic Games.\" There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). International Paralympic Committee (IPC) was formed on 22 September 1989 and is situated in Germany. IPC organizes Summer and Winter Paralympic Games and coordinates world championships and other competitions. The vision of IPC is 'To enable Para athletes to achieve sporting excellence and inspire and excite the world.' Do you know? List of summer Paralympic sports for Tokyo 2020 1. Archery (since 1960) 2.

Wheelchair Tennis (since 1992) Although sports clubs for the deaf were already in existence in Berlin since 1888, and some sports competitions for athletes with an impairment had been organised for more than 100 years, it was not until after World War II, however, that that they became widely accepted. The purpose at that time was to assist the large number of war veterans and civilians who had been injured during wartime. Dr Ludwig Guttmann opened a spinal injuries centre at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Great Britain in 1944, and in time, rehabilitation sport developed to recreational sport and then to competitive sport. On 29 July 1948, during the Opening Ceremony of the London 1948 Olympic Games, Dr Guttmann organised the first competition for wheelchair athletes which he named the Stoke Mandeville Games where 16 injured servicemen and women took part in archery. This was a milestone in Paralympics history. In 1952, Dutch ex-129 Physical EDUCATION-XII servicemen also joined the Movement and the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF) was founded which conducted its first Paralympic Games at Italy 1960 featuring athletes from 23 nations. These have now come to be recognised as the first Paralympic Games. There were various different organizations working for different disabilities and, therefore, there was a need to bring all impairments under one umbrella. A major effort in this direction was made in 1982. The ISMGF , along with International Sport Organisation for the Disabled (ISOD), which had been formed in 1964 for those who could not participate in Stoke Mandeville Games, created an international coordination committee along with two other organizations that focused on games for people with disabilities. These were the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CPISRA) founded in 1978 and International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) founded in1980. They joined together as the International Co-coordinating Committee Sports for the Disabled in the World\" (ICC) in 1982. Later in 1986, International Sports Federations for Persons with an Intellectual Disability (INAS-FID) also joined the Internal Coordination Committee (ICC). Thus, a combination of these organizations led to formation of International Paralympics Committee (IPC) on 22nd September 1989 at Dusseldorf, Germany as a global governing body of paralympic movement. The vision of the IPC is, \"To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world.\" The Paralympic anthem is \"Hymne de l'Avenir\" or \"Anthem of the Future\". It was composed by Thierry Darnis and adopted as the official anthem of the IPC in March 1996. Till 1988, Winter and Summer Paralympic Games were held as per a separate schedule. However, since the Summer Games of Seoul, Korea in 1988 and the Winter Games in Albertville, France in 1992 the Games have also been organised in the same cities and venues as the Olympics due to an agreement between the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). All Paralympic Games are governed by the IPC. Given the wide variety of disabilities that Paralympics athletes have, there are several categories in which the athletes compete. The allowable disabilities are broken down into ten eligible impairment types which vary from sport to sport. Categories A major challenge facing the organisers of para-sports is that the competition may become one sided and predictable, in which the least impaired athlete will always win. To prevent this, para-athletes are placed in categories for competition based on their impairment, these are called sport classes. Paralympic athletes have an 130 Physical EDUCATION-XII impairment in body structure and functions that leads to a competitive disadvantage in sports. Consequently, criteria are put in place to ensure that winning is determined by skill, fitness, power, endurance, tactical ability and mental focus. When an athlete starts competing, she/he is allocated a class that may be reviewed throughout the athlete's career. The purpose of the criteria h Defining the impairment group in which an athlete can compete in the various sports. h Grouping athletes in classes defined by the degree of activity-limitation related to the impairment and/or specific to the task in the sport. The IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment. Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics though not every sport can allow for every disability category. These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics. 1. Physical Impairment - There are eight different types of physical impairment: h Impaired muscle power - With impairments in this category, the force generated by muscles, such as the muscles of one limb, one side of the body or the lower half of the body is reduced. eg., spinal cord injury, spina bifida, post-polio syndrome. h Impaired passive range of movement - The range of movement in one or more joints is reduced in a systematic way. Acute conditions such as arthritis are not included in this category. h Loss of limb or limb deficiency - A total or partial absence of bones or joints from partial or total loss due to illness, trauma, or congenital limb deficiency. eg., amputation, dysmelia. h Leg-length difference - Significant bone shortening occurs in one leg due to congenital deficiency or trauma.131 Physical EDUCATION-XII h Short stature - Standing height is reduced due to shortened legs, arms and trunk, which are due to a Musculo-skeletal deficit of bone or cartilage structures. eg., achondroplasia, growth hormone deficiency, osteogenesis imperfecta. h Hypertonia - Hypertonia is marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to the central nervous system. eg., cerebral palsy. h Ataxia - Ataxia is an impairment that consists of a lack of coordination of muscle movements. eg., cerebral palsy, Friedreich's ataxia, multiple sclerosis. h Athetosis - Athetosis is generally characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture (eg., cerebral palsy, choreoathetosis). 2. Visual Impairment - Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. This includes impairment of one or more component of the visual system - eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex. The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides, along with sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football, became eligible to receive medals of their own. 3. Intellectual Disability - Athletes with a significant impairment in intellectual functioning and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour fall under the category of intellectual disability. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the Intellectual Disability group has been added to some Paralympic Games. This includes only athletes with exceptional athletic ability who have intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18. However, the IOC recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities.132 Physical EDUCATION-XII 4.1.2 SPECIAL OLYMPICS Special Olympics is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual and physical disabilities, providing year-round training and competitions to 5 million athletes and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries. The concept was the brainchild of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who in 1962 initiated a day camp called Camp Shriver for children with intellectual disabilities at her home in Potomac, Maryland. The camp sought to address the concern that children with special needs had very little opportunity to participate in organised athletic events. With Camp Shriver as an example, Kennedy Shriver, head of the Joseph P . Kennedy Jr. Foundation and a member of President John F . Kennedy's Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the concept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. The Logo of Special Olympics is based on the sculpture \"Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World\" by Zurab Tsereteli and was adopted in 1979. It reflects joy, happiness, confidence among children and adults with special needs who are learning coordination, mastering skills, participating in competitions and preparing themselves for richer, more productive lives. The mission of Special Olympics is to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in events like Athletics (Track and Field), Badminton, Basketball, Bocce, Bowling, Cricket, Cycling, Equestrian sports, Figure Skating, Floorball, Floor Hockey, Football (Soccer), Golf, Gymnastics - Artistic and Rhythmic, Handball, Judo, Kayaking, Netball, Powerlifting, Roller Skating, Sailing, Snowboarding, Snowshoe running, Skiing - Alpine and Cross- Country, Softball, Speed Skating - Short-track, Swimming - Pool and Open-Water, Table Tennis, Tennis, Triathlon and Volleyball.133 Physical EDUCATION-XII There are a large number of benefits for people with intellectual disabilities as a result of participating in activities organized by Special Olympics. Apart from physical and health benefits, it provides psychological benefits including higher self- confidence, self-esteem and social competence. The transformative power of sports in instilling confidence, improving health and inspiring a sense of competition lies at the core of Special Olympics. Extension Activity Working in groups, investigate the history of the Indian Paralympic and Special Olympics teams. Who have been the most successful athletes? Select one and find out more about him/her. Present your findings to the class in the form of a Power Point Presentation. One of the major events of Special Olympics is World Games, which was first held in July 1968 at Chicago with around 1000 participants from U.S. and Canada. Special Olympic Winter Games were initiated in 1977 at Colorado, US. Special Olympics also conducts Unified Sports Programme for inclusion. Sports Participants who have attained 8 years of age along with condition of intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays identified by the agency or a professional can participate in sports competitions. The Special Olympics was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1988. It provides year-round training and competitions to 5 million athletes and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries. Special Olympics competitions are held every day, all around the world\u2014including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year. Like the IPC, the Special Olympics organization is recognized by the IOC; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, Special Olympics World Games are not held in the same year or in conjunction with the Olympic Games. History of Special Olympics In June 1962, Eunice Kennedy Shriver started a day camp called Camp Shriver for children with intellectual and physical disabilities at her home in Potomac, Maryland. The camp sought to address the concern that children with special needs had very little opportunity to participate in organised athletic events. With Camp Shriver as an example, Kennedy Shriver, head of the Joseph P . Kennedy, Jr. Foundation and a member of President John F . Kennedy's Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the concept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with 134 Physical EDUCATION-XII intellectual disabilities. Camp Shriver became an annual event, and the Kennedy Foundation gave grants to universities, recreation departments, and community centres to hold similar camps. The first games were held on July 20, 1968 in Chicago, Illinois, with about 1000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada. International participation expanded in subsequent games. In 2003, the first Special Olympics Summer Games to be held outside the United States, were held in Dublin, Ireland with 7000 athletes from 150 countries. The first World Winter Games were held in 1977 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Austria hosted the first Winter Games outside the United States in 1993. The World Games alternate between Summer and Winter Games, in two-year cycles, recurring every fourth year. Recognition Like the International Paralympic Committee, the Special Olympics organization is recognized by the International Olympic Committee; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, the Special Olympics World Games is a major event put on by the Special Olympics. Logo and Oath The Special Olympics logo is based on the sculpture \"Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World\" by Zurab Tsereteli. The logo is a symbol of growth, confidence and joy among children and adults with disabilities who are learning coordination, mastering skills, participating in competitions and preparing themselves for richer, more productive lives. The Special Olympics athlete's oath, which was first introduced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver at the inaugural Special Olympics international games in Chicago in 1968, is \"Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.\" Programmes run by Special Olympics around the world Young Athlete Programme For young people with and without intellectual disabilities between the ages of 2-7, Special Olympics has a Young Athletes Programme \u2014 an inclusive sport and play programme with a focus on activities that are important to mental and physical growth. Children engage in games and activities that develop motor skills and hand- eye co-ordination. Unified Sports Programme In recent years, Special Olympics has pioneered the concept of Unified Sports, bringing together athletes with and without intellectual disabilities as teammates. The basic concept is that training together and playing together can create a path 135 Physical EDUCATION-XII to friendship and understanding. The programme has expanded beyond the U.S. and North America: more than 1.4 million people worldwide now take part in Special Olympics Unified Sports. The goal is to break down stereotypes about people with intellectual disabilities and promote unity. Healthy Athletes Programme- This Programme offers health screenings to athletes in need. In 1997, Special Olympics began an initiative called Healthy Athletes that currently offers health screenings in seven areas: Fit Feet (podiatry), FUN fitness (physical therapy), Health Promotion (better health and well-being), Healthy Hearing (audiology), MedFest (sports physical exam), Opening Eyes (vision) and Special Smiles (dentistry). Screenings educate athletes on health issues and also identify problems that may need additional follow-up. For example, the FUNfitness Programme that assesses flexibility, strength, balance, and aerobic fitness of the athlete. Following the screening, the physical therapist provides instructions on how to optimize their physical fitness in the area as screened. Special Olympic Sports Rules/Guidelines h Athletes shall be divided into competition division based upon their ability, age and sex. Competition divisions are structured so that an athlete competes against another athlete of similar ability h Special Olympics has more than 30 Olympic-type individual and team sports that provide meaningful training and competition opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. h At competitions, medals are awarded to the first, second and third-place winners in each event, and ribbons are awarded to athletes who finish in fourth through eighth place. To participate in Special Olympics, a person must be at least 8 years old and identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays as measured by formal assessment, or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that requires or has required specially designed instruction. 4.1.3 Deaflympics 136 Physical EDUCATION-XII Sports for hearing impaired were started long back, the first games, known as the International Silent Games, were held in 1924 in Paris with 148 athletes from nine (9) European nations participating. The Silent Games were the first ever for any group of people with disabilities and also the secondly created internally competed games after Olympics. Winter Games were instituted in 1949 at Seefeld, Austria. The event was organized by Le Comit\u00e9 International des Sports Silencieux (the International Committee of Silent Sports), commonly known as the CISS which was formed in 1924 at France. In 1955, the CISS was admitted into the International Olympic Committee, the IOC, as an International Federation with Olympic standing. The flag of the IOC has flown next to the flag representing CISS/ICSD at the Summer/ Winter Deaflympics since 1985. CISS was lately changed as Le Comit\u00e9 International des Sports des Sourds (The International Committee of Sports for the Deaf) or referred as ICSD. At present, the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf (ICSD) is the main governing body responsible for the organization of Deaflympics and other World Deaf Championships. ICSD is the organization behind the building, evolving and fortifying the tradition of inviting deaf/hard of hearing elite athletes from all of the world to come together not only to compete in their respective sports, but to also develop comradeship between their countries. The most recent name, the \"Deaflympics,\" was formally adopted in 2001. Deaflympics is being organised and managed by ICSD across the world with it national partners and associate members. The Deaflympics are distinguished from all other IOC-sanctioned games by the fact that they are organized and run exclusively by members of the community they serve. Only people with hearing impairment are eligible to serve on the ICSD board and executive bodies. Deaflymics are held every four years starting from 1924, Paris, with exceptions of 1943 and 1947 games which were cancelled due to world war-ii. 24th Summer Deaflympics 137 Physical EDUCATION-XII 4.1.3.1 Logo The logo of Deaflympics, designed in 2003 is a positive and powerful symbol of the international deaf sports community. It ties together strong elements: Sign language, deaf and international cultures, unity and continuity. The hand shapes, \"ok\", \"good\", and \"great\" that overlap each other in a circle, represent the original sign for \"deaflympics\". Together, the hand shapes represent the sign for \"united\". The centre of the logo represents the iris of the eye, which defines deaf people as visual people; they must use their eyes to communicate. The logo incorporates the four colours of the national flags of the world. The red, blue, yellow and green represent the four regional confederations - the Asia Pacific Deaf Sports Confederation, the European Deaf Sports Organization, the Pan American Deaf Sports Organization and the Confederation of African Deaf Sports.

The purpose is very much similar to grouping system used in mainstream sports according to their age-group, gender, weight etc. The general goal of any classification or divisioning in disability sports is to reduce or minimize the effect of sports performance due to any of the above-mentioned variables like age, gender, weight or even abilities. In this chapter we will understand the two terms -- 'classification' and 'divisioning', wherein 'classification' is a grouping process associated with Paralympics and para-athletes, and 'divisioning' is a process of grouping associated with Special Olympics. Classification process adopted by Paralympics assigns categories to athletes based on different types of disabilities, on the other hand divisioning process of Special Olympics is a performance based system of grouping athletes bases on their skill level. 4.2.1 Classification in Paralymics Paralympic Games, through the international paralympic committee (IPC), has developed classification process which can contribute \"to sporting excellence for all Athletes and sports in the Paralympic Movement, and providing equitable competition. Classification is undertaken to ensure that an Athlete's impairment is relevant to sport performance, and to ensure that the Athlete competes equitably with other Athletes\" with fair chance to all participant athletes engaging in competitive sports. According to the IPC, the classification process serves two roles. The first is to determine who is eligible and the second is to group sportspeople for the purpose of competition. The eligibility minimum is an impairment that limits the sportspersons ability to participate in an activity and the disability needs to be permanent in nature. Classification Process Classification for Paralympics sports generally has three or four steps. The first step is generally a medical assessment. The second is generally a functional assessment which involves two parts: first observing a sportsperson in training and then observing the sportsperson in competition. There are a number of people involved in this process beyond the sportsperson, including individual classifiers, medical classifiers, technical classifiers, a chief classifier, a head of classification, a classification panel and a classification committee.140 Physical EDUCATION-XII 4.2.2 10 Classifications in PARALYMPICS (eligible impairments) 1. Physical Impairment - There are eight different types of physical impairment: h Impaired muscle power - With impairments in this category, the force generated by muscles, such as the muscles of one limb, one side of the body or the lower half of the body is reduced.eg., spinal cord injury, spina bifida, post-polio syndrome. h Impaired passive range of movement - Range of movement in one or more joints is reduced in a systematic way. Acute conditions such as arthritis are not included in this category. h Loss of limb or limb deficiency - A total or partial absence of bones or joints from partial or total loss due to illness, trauma, or congenital limb deficiency.eg., amputation, dysmelia. h Leg-length difference - Significant bone shortening occurs in one leg due to congenital deficiency or trauma. h Short stature - Standing height is reduced due to shortened legs, arms and trunk, which are due to a musculoskeletal deficit of bone or cartilage structures. eg., achondroplasia, growth hormone deficiency, osteogenesis imperfecta. h Hypertonia - Hypertonia is marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to the central nervous system. eg., cerebral palsy. h Ataxia - Ataxia is an impairment that consists of a lack of coordination of muscle movements. eg., cerebral palsy, Friedreich's ataxia, multiple sclerosis. h Athetosis - Athetosis is generally characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture. eg., cerebral palsy, choreoathetosis. 4.2.3. Divisioning in Sports by Special Olympics Special Olympics uses a competitive-level matching or grouping referred to as 'divisioning', which is a fundamental rule at Special Olympics. Athletes in competitions are matched with others of the same gender, about the same age and most importantly, of about the same competitive ability.141 Physical EDUCATION-XII The fundamental difference between Special Olympics competitions and those of other sports organizations is that athletes of all ability levels are encouraged to participate, and every athlete is recognized for his/her performance. Competitions are structured so that athletes compete with other athletes of similar ability in equitable divisions 4.2.4 Implementation of Divisioning An athlete's ability is the primary factor in divisioning Special Olympics competitions. The ability of an athlete or team is determined by an entry score from a prior competition or the result of a seeding round or preliminary event at the competition itself. Other factors that are significant in establishing competitive divisions are age and sex. In the process of divisioning, athletes are firstly categorised as per their age group which is different for individual and team sports, followed by Gender and lastly by their ability. 4.2.5. Process of Divisioning : 1. Age Team Sports Individual Sports 15 & under 16-21 years 22 and above 8-11 years 12 - 15 years 16-21 years 22-29 years 30 and above 2. Gender: In the second step, athletes are grouped as per gender, in some circumstances gender can be combined too. 3. Ability : Finally athletes in Special Olympics are grouped according to their skill abilities scores which are recorded by committee through preliminary and on-site events. 142 Physical EDUCATION-XII This makes Divisioning in Special Olympics a process in which, before each competition, a time, score or skill assessment is submitted for each athlete or team. For events that are not timed or measured, such as football and badminton, there is a series of short games between athletes or teams or an assessment of each athlete or team's ability by a committee. The divisions are then set up based on the information on each athlete's skill level so that each set of competitors is closely matched. Towards fair divisioning, Athletes as well as coaches are expected to follow the Special Olympics Official Sport Rules and the Athlete's Code of Conduct. Maximum Effort Rule : To achieve the intentions of fairness, there is a 'maximum efforts rule', wherein athletes are expected to give their maximum effort during divisioning process and coaches are expected to motivate all athletes towards giving their best. Special Olympics Athletes who do not participate honestly and do not adhere to the maximum effort rule in all preliminary trials or final rounds violate the true spirit of competition and may even be disqualified from competition.

Explain the objective and need for classification and divisioning in disability sports? 4.3 Concept of Inclusion in Sports, its need and implementation With the introduction of the Right to Education, which makes education a fundamental right of every child between the ages of 6 and 14 all children - including those who are physically and mentally challenged, or afflicted with various types of disabilities and disorders - have the right to come to school to develop their abilities through the process of education. It is, therefore, the duty of all schools to provide them with such opportunities that they develop their learning. Do you know According to the WHO: Disability is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing tasks or actions. Problems experienced by an individual in life situations are called participation restrictions. In other words, disability is not just one health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person's body and features of the society in which he or she lives.144 Physical EDUCATION-XII Disability is more common among women, older people, children and adults who are poor. People with disabilities often have less education and have deprived living conditions\u2014including insufficient food, poor housing, lack of access to safe water and sanitation. This causes disabled individuals to have the highest risks for infectious and non-infectious diseases. People with disabilities often do not receive the needed health care and approximately half cannot afford it. Data from four countries in the Region found that only 26% to 55% of people received the medical rehabilitation they needed, while only 17% to 37% received the assistive devices they needed such as wheelchairs, prostheses and hearing aids. 4.3.1 Encouraging Inclusion through Physical Education and Sports 1. Role of Family - The role of family in encouraging a healthy, sports-oriented lifestyle for a child with a disability is crucial. At times the family may find it difficult to accept reality, and may give up on the child. It is essential to promote awareness and to treat a CWSN as equal in the family. A CWSN may require a structured life routine where participation in recreational games and sports plays a very important role in developing a healthy mind and body of the child. Parents should observe certain different abilities of the child and take professional help to enable her/him to excel in the area. 2. Role of School - School gives a structured programme to a child or a group where co- scholastic activities and sports are a part of the regular routine. All schools must have trained APE teachers to give a specially-abled child access to games where equipment and movements are adapted in a fun way for her/his holistic development. Here, a teacher or a coach helps a child to transit towards competitive sports under different organizations such as Special Olympics, Paralympics etc.. The school should take care to provide infrastructure that is compatible with the needs of CWSN e.g., a ramp along with stairs. Schools must run sensitization programmes so that CWSN are recognised for their efforts and organise intramural and extramural sports competitions or carnivals. 3. Role of Organisations - There are some organizations working at the grass root level to promote adapted sports. These organizations are responsible for training teachers and coaches for teaching, coaching and organizing sports events at Zonal, District, State, National and International levels.145 Physical EDUCATION-XII 4.3.2 INCLUSION - ITS NEEDS AND IMPLICATION Each individual is different in terms of his physical, social, emotional and cognitive characteristics. This diversity is a reality, and everyone should respect the differences in each other. Inclusion is a vast concept that implies including everyone in education without being judgmental about the abilities, appearance, economic condition etc. of the participants. Inclusion in education refers to a model wherein CWSN spend most or all of their time with students with non-special needs. It is based on the notion that Inclusive Education is more effective for students with special needs since they get a mixed experience. This social interaction leads to success in later life. Inclusion plays a big role in creating a safe, comfortable and emotionally secure environment in any educational institution. Inclusion is not a law to be forced on anyone. It is a process which enables a child smooth transition to understand, accept and implement the culture of inclusion in different situations. Physical education and sports play a very important role in promoting inclusion in any educational institute. Need for Inclusive Education Inclusive education provides a student training for real life situations as all students, with or without disabilities, learn to interact and work collectively . 1. Builds Self Esteem - Inclusive classrooms are filled with diverse learners. This lets kids observe and talk about diverse learning patterns and the manner in which everyone learns in their own way. CWSN may find that they have more in common with other students and this goes a long way in building self-esteem. It also helps reduce stigma faced by those who have learning and attention issues. Differently-abled individuals show marked improvement in self- confidence if they have studied in a regular school. It can also help students build and maintain friendships. 2. Improves Social and Communication Skills: Inclusive education provides ample opportunities for all students - students with disabilities and those without disabilities - to have better social relations amongst themselves. Since social skills are better learnt through observation and imitation, students with special needs get a better understanding of the world around them by being part of a regular classroom. This is especially true of students with intellectual impairment like autistic students.146 Physical EDUCATION-XII 3. Enhances Sensitivity - It has been noted that students without disabilities become more sensitive if they study in a classroom where they have students with special needs. They understand and appreciate their emotions and feelings and become more sensitive and caring towards them. They learn how to be more patient and to empathise with others. When children are involved in helping their peers, they not only derive immense satisfaction out of it, but often strike lifelong friendships with them. 4. Creates Better Understanding and Appreciation of others - In an inclusive classroom, students with or without special needs understand and appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their classmates. They learn to understand and appreciate these differences. 5. Creates a Sense of Belonging - All children are able to be part of a community and develop a sense of belonging. This makes them better prepared for life as they learn to value each other despite their differences. CWSN enjoy the acceptance and develop a feeling of belonging to the group of students with or without special needs. 6. Enhances Academic Performance - Inclusive education leads to better academic performance than in exclusive education. It provides better opportunities for learning as children with varying abilities are often better motivated when they learn in classes surrounded by other children. 7. Improves Performance - Since the expectations of all the children are higher in a mixed abilities classroom, inclusion attempts to develop an individual's strengths and gifts by stretching each individual to optimal performance. Implementation of Inclusive Education in India In India, the number of children/persons with disabilities or special needs is really large. As a result, they have a number of problems in getting education, especially inclusive education. It is important to implement inclusive education in India not only to provide benefits of inclusion to all individuals but also to ensure optimal utilisation of resources. India should emphasize on the following measures for effective implementation of inclusive education. 1. Ensuring effective implementation of the Right to Education in all states so that no child is left out of the ambit of education so that we are able to take care of the needs of CWSN.147 Physical EDUCATION-XII 2. Equipping teachers, especially in rural areas, through appropriate training and in-service workshops to teach CWSN in an inclusive classroom. 3. Developing a support team through regular analysis of schools, curriculum and amenities in order to give access to the regular curriculum methods to children with difficulties in learning. 4. Encouraging a flexible approach towards curriculum transaction whereby teachers and students are able to diagnose and resolve the problems that they face during the teaching learning process. 5. Involving parents as partners and as a resource in the decision-making process for enhancing their child's learning so that a collaborative effort results in effective inclusive education. 6. Looking at all children at what they can do rather than what they cannot do. It is important for the student's self-esteem that a child with special needs is not looked at with sympathy, but is recognised for her/his talents, capabilities and abilities. 7. Designing schools and classes in ways that help children learn and achieve to their fullest potential. Enrolling of CWSN in regular schools requires a lot of adjustments in terms of classrooms, transport facilities and educational materials and assistive devices such as audio textbooks or Braille text books, etc. 8. Developing education goals according to each child's abilities. Curriculum experts should carefully design programmes so that the curriculum is made parallel for all the children with or without special needs in inclusive education. This also means that children do not need to have the same education goals in order to learn together in regular classes and will require the designing of a suitable examination system and putting in place periodic evaluation of CWSN to meet the challenges and changing trends. 9. Making sincere efforts to develop good relations and understanding between families of students with disabilities and without disabilities. In this way, all students will also develop good relations among themselves and thereby create an appropriate environment for implementing inclusive education. 10. Providing students related materials like uniforms, books, stationery, transport allowance, stipend for girls, boarding and lodging facilities, therapeutic services, teaching and learning materials, assistive devices, etc., to CWSN from the school.148 Physical EDUCATION-XII 11. While Inclusive Education implies that all children are educated in regular classrooms, it does not, however, mean that individual children cannot leave the classroom for specific reasons. For example, a child may require one-on- one assistance in a particular subject. This may or may not happen during regular class time. Once schools are inclusive, serious thought is given to how often a child may be out of regular classroom and the reasons why this may be happening. It does not mean that children with certain characteristics (for example, those who have disabilities) are grouped together in separate classrooms for all or part of the school day. I. Tick the correct options 1. Inclusion is vast concept that implies a. including learners with differing abilities, appearance and economic conditions in education b. including learners with an emotional or intellectual impairment in mainstream education c. integrating all children with intellectual disabilities into main stream schooling d. integrating all children with physical disabilities into mainstream schooling 2.

Answer the following questions in 150-200words. 1. How does inclusion in Physical Education benefit CWSN? 2. How does inclusive education help integration of CWSN in society? 3. How can inclusive education be implemented in India? 4.4 Advantages of Physical Activities for CWSN It is no secret that physical activities are an important aspect of a healthy lifestyle and can provide significant benefits for children in all developmental stages. Children with special needs have less opportunities to be less physically active and, therefore, are at higher risk for complications associated with inactivity. Regular physical activity for children with special needs provides physical, emotional and social advantages. CWSN demonstrate strength gains, increased flexibility, improved bone health, better endurance and cardiovascular fitness as a result of regular physical activity. In case of children with movement disabilities, physical activity is important in maintenance of mobility during the aging process. With enhanced physical health, children are better able to fight problems such as obesity and the associated health complications that may follow. Physical activity can also improve general mood and wellness. Regular fitness can be linked to improved self-esteem, social awareness, and self- confidence, which aid in empowering the lives of children with special needs. 1. Physical benefits - Scientific studies of disability groups have demonstrated that participation in physical activity and sport leads to improved levels of well-being and physical health. Children with intellectual disabilities may have additional physical disabilities resulting in below age-level performance in typical motor skills. Regular involvement in physical education and sport can help them to develop their gross motor and fine motor skills which may 150 Physical EDUCATION-XII improve their overall performance. When encouraged to participate in a regular fitness routine, many CWSN show improvement in everything from their hand-eye coordination and flexibility, to their muscle strength, endurance, and even cardiovascular efficiency. These are all simply the natural benefits of exercise. This development of better motor skills and enhanced physical health helps individuals to fight back against problems such as obesity, and the health complications that follow. 2. Mode of Recreation and Fun - CWSN frequently miss out on social activities, recreation and fun. Participation in extracurricular and sports activities can help them overcome this obstacle, providing them with the ability to engage in social interactions, make friends and initiate social skills. 3. Improved Emotional Health - Including physical activity in a healthy lifestyle is proven to decrease rates of depression. CWSN often tend to have more emotional problems like depression. Participating in regular exercise can be a life-changing benefit by improving mental health and wellbeing. Physical activity can also improve general mood and wellness, which aids in empowering the lives of children with special needs. 4. Channelizing the Surplus Energy - Children with disabilities like ADHD display hyperactivity which, if appropriately directed, can bear positive results related to cognitive benefits and constructive behaviour. 5. Psychological benefits - Regular participation in sports and physical activities is not just beneficial for the body, it is beneficial for the mind, too. Physical activity improves general mood and wellness in CWSN by improving their self- esteem, social awareness, and self- confidence, all of which are factors essential for empowering their lives. On the one hand the physical outlet provided by sports and physical activity reduces anxiety, stress and depression, and on the other, interaction and involvement with other students gives children a sense of accomplishment and confidence. For CWSN, developing a sense of self- esteem is particularly important, as they may often feel isolated and removed from the group. 6. Healthy lifestyle - CWSN are about twice as likely as other children to be overweight or obese often due to the greater likelihood of being sedentary due to their disability. As a result of their disability, their levels of participation in sports and physical activity is much lower than that of their peers. It is imperative that these children, as much or more, than other students must learn about the steps to leading a healthy lifestyle, within the context of the abilities and limitations of their respective conditions.151 Physical EDUCATION-XII 7. Behavioural Benefits - The energetic nature of physical education leads to cognitive improvements in CWSN, allowing them to develop skills that they may not develop in a traditional classroom setting. Sports and Games are a structured activity with a set of rules and organisation. They help the child learn to practice self-regulation and enhance their decision- making skills. In addition, CWSN can learn to focus on specific goals, and work on their verbal communication by interacting with peers on the sports field. Sports and Physical education teach children a range of skills that include teamwork, problem solving abilities, increased attention span, and focus on task-based behaviour. Eventually, these skills can transfer into other classroom settings too, so that CWSN have a greater ability to learn and engage with their peers outside of physical education. 8. Increased Independence - Participation in Physical Education and Sports is a mode to transit towards greater independence due to improved daily life skills. For a person with a disability, an increase in physical activity can lead to more independence and freedom. Increased physical strength and energy that comes from regular exercise allows persons with disability to do more daily tasks without assistance. 4.5 Strategies to Make Physical Activities Accessible for CWSN Participation in physical activity is beneficial for all children, including those with disabilities. In fact, participation of children with disabilities in sports and recreational activities promotes inclusion, minimizes deconditioning, optimizes physical functioning, and enhances overall well- being. Despite these benefits, children with disabilities are more restricted in their participation, have lower levels of fitness, and have higher levels of obesity than their peers without disabilities. Well-informed decisions regarding each child's participation must consider certain well-devised strategies. Communication - Advance information about activity, space, resource person or any change in activity should be communicated clearly. A variety of different instructional strategies such as verbal, visual and peer teaching should be used for performing various types of physical activities so that children get opportunity to participate in physical activity. The teacher could use visuals or social story about the activity. Give positive, corrective or specific feedback. As per the ability of the child, specific instruction must be provided in simple words and sentences. The tone should be low and one instruction should be given at a time. If necessary, a communication 152 Physical EDUCATION-XII board or communication book could be used. Space - For CWSN, space should be approachable for people having physical disability. The area for the physical activity should be limited. Space for activities should be disturbance free (noise, heat, cold, texture of floor, audience etc.) It is always better to start with indoor space. Boundaries should be demarked clearly as starting point, finishing point, sitting area. In case of children who have autism, they must be provided specific area because they may need some time to relax. Once behaviours, discipline, understanding of instructions are clear then one can transit towards outdoor space also. It does not mean that one is not allowed to go to outdoor sports. Equipment - A lack of appropriate equipment, coupled with a lack of professionals trained to support physical activity among children and youth with different ability levels, discourages participation. There are a growing number of disabled people who are interested in recreation and sport activities. In recent years several modified devices are on offer for adapted sports. There are many examples of simple and sophisticated equipment, including computerized devices like wheelchairs for recreation and sport activities. There are sport competitions involving four groups of disabled sportspersons, namely 1) the deaf, 2) people with physical disability, 3) people with intellectual (mental) disability, 4) people supported by specially 153 Physical EDUCATION-XII designed high level engineering equipment. All of them can use many kinds of equipment and facilities. 154 Physical EDUCATION-XII Graded Activities- During initial stage activities should be simple and each activity should be based on a single action. There should be a gradual move from non- locomotor to locomotor to manipulated activities. For these activities, the level of assistance should be physical, verbal and independent. CWSN need help in learning a fundamental motor skill. It will need to be practised with the students so they are able to visualize it through the teacher's body action. In addition, one can use videos. As they watch the video, words or phrases that highlight the important part on which the demonstration is focusing must be used. They could also be asked to demonstrate the skill to ensure the instructions have been understood before commencing practise and they must start practice immediately after viewing a demonstration. The activity must be practised with progressive count, or even performed dramatically with rhymes or songs with voice modulation so they enjoy the activities. Do you know? Locomotor skills include running, jumping, hopping, galloping, rolling, leaping and dodging, horizontal jump, slide. Manipulative skills are throwing, catching, kicking, striking and trapping, dribble, overhand throw, and underhand roll Stability skills are balance, twisting, turning and bending Social strategies - A CWSN must be allowed to choose a sport she/he enjoys. It's easier for children to be motivated when they enjoy the activity. At first, the CWSN should be encouraged to watch others. Once the child sees people having fun as they play, she/he will be motivated to participate too. Then, the child could be started on individual training, and transferred to a small group with supervision and reminder. The Teacher must act as a mediator, helping the CWSN to interact 155 Physical EDUCATION-XII with other members of group. There should be individual check on each person who is participating and they should be motivated with reminders whenever they get distracted. Each person should be greeted before the session and each lesson should end with positive feedback. Psychological strategies - Because of previous exclusion or limited access, children with disabilities need a lot of motivation to participate in physical activity. It's all about the cycle of conditioning: active kids who stay active grow stronger and more physically literate as they age. The cycle of deconditioning works the same way: for children who don't participate, the less they do, the less they're able to do. In fact, \"Psychological barriers are the most influential. Changing attitudes is the key to increasing participation...\" These barriers include attitudes, opinions and perceptions preventing participation in sport. h Personal attitudes of persons with disability h Attitudes of non-disabled people All individuals benefit from regular physical activity and children with special needs especially gain from these physical, mental and social benefits of being active. Once children see improvements in muscle strength, coordination, and flexibility and experience better balance, motor skills and body awareness, they will have positive changes towards sports. It has been found that children with a disability choose to play sport for a number of reasons including h to improve and learn new skills, h to have fun, h stay fit h be physically challenged While children often choose easier tasks to obtain rewards, doing this decreases the child's enjoyment of and intrinsic motivation for the activity. So, the selection of a challenging activity may be a strong influence in children's participation in sport. However, it may be possible that if the challenge becomes too great, the intrinsic motivation to participate may decrease. Because the level of challenge frequently increases more quickly for the disabled it is likely that this is a strong factor in participation. Therefore, it is better to let the child initially participate with her/ his own disability group. Coaches are also often afraid to 'push' individuals with a disability too far and causing 'harm' to the individuals. In contrast to intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation involves motivators from the environment (e.g. friends, parents and coaches).156 Physical EDUCATION-XII Certainly, amongst children it can be expected that a huge part of their reasoning for participation in sport is to make friends. Children with strong peer relationships are more self-motivated in sport and, in addition, enjoy themselves more. It has also been found that a greater competence in sport coincides with stronger peer relationships. A PE teacher in UK revealed that her pupils \"actively encourage and support the pupils with disabilities\" in sport and that those pupils \"grow in confidence as a result of their involvement\". Disability in sport is, evidently, becoming more accepted than it ever has been. I. Tick the correct options 1. Development of Gross Motor and Fine Motor skills are benefits which are part of : a.

Vitamins Benefits of Vitamins Sources A Needed for healthy eyes, skin, nervous, respiratory, digestive systems B C D Needed for bones E Needed for restoration of cell membrane and body structure K160 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5.1 Balanced Diet Depending on the presence of nutrients in different food stuffs, foods have been divided into different food groups. These are: 1. Cereals and Millets: Cereals and millets include foods like wheat, rice, jowar, bajra, ragi etc. Majorly provide carbohydrates. Cereals also provide protein (protein quality can be improved by consuming it with pulses), B-vitamins, iron (bajra) and calcium (ragi). 2. Pulses: Pulses include all whole and washed dhals like red gram (lobia), Bengal gram (chana), lentils, green gram (moong) etc. Pulses provide protein (protein quality is improved by combining it with cereals). They are also a fair source of carbohydrates and B-vitamins especially thiamine and niacin. Whole pulses also provide iron and fibre; sprouts provide vitamin C. 3. Milk and Milk Products: This group includes foods like milk, curd, cheese, paneer, khoa etc. The major nutrient it gives is good quality protein, besides providing other nutrients like carbohydrates, fat (whole milk), calcium and riboflavin. Milk and milk products are generally sources of all nutrients except iron and vitamin C. 4. Meat and Meat Products: These include foods like meat, fish, chicken, egg and products made with these. This group is a major source of good quality protein. Other nutrients supplied by this group are B-vitamins, retinol (liver) and calcium (fish). Eggs particularly are good sources of most nutrients. 5. Nuts and Oil Seeds: Nuts and oil seeds eg., groundnuts, almonds, cashew nuts, til seeds, pistachio etc. are a good source of fat. They also provide protein, B-vitamins, calcium and other minerals. 6. Green Leafy Vegetables (GLVs): These include vegetables like mustard (sarson), bathua, fenugreek leaves (methi), spinach (palak). Green leafy vegetables are a good source of carotene (vitamin A, B-vitamins (especially riboflavin and folic acid), iron (especially sarson and bathua) and fibre. They are also a source of calcium, but presence of oxalates in GLVs bind calcium and make most of it unavailable for absorption and utilisation. Fresh GLVs provide vitamin C. 7. Root Vegetables: These include potato, colocasia, sweet potato, yam etc. Major nutrient supplied by root vegetables is carbohydrate. Carotene is provided only by yellow yam. 8. Other Vegetables: All other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger (okra), beans, cauliflower etc. provide fibre, vitamins, some amount of minerals.161 Physical EDUCATION-XII 9. Fruits: Wide variety of fruits is available in the market. Different fruits are sources of different nutrients; hence a combination of various fruits should be included in the balanced diet. Fruits like mangoes, apricots, oranges, papaya are rich in carotene, citrus fruits like orange, mausambi, amla and guavas are good sources of vitamin C, dried fruits like dates and raisins are rich in iron. Fibre is provided by most fruits. 10. Sugar and Jaggery: These are simply carbohydrates. Jaggery also has iron. 11. Fats and Oils: Include ghee, oil, butter etc. are a rich source of fat. Vitamin D also is provided by butter/fortified oils. Food groups can also be classified according to their functions: Group 1. Energy giving foods- This category includes foods rich in carbohydrate and fat 1. Cereals and roots and tubers 2. Sugar and jaggery 3. Fats and oils Group 2. Body building group - this category includes foods rich in protein 1. Milk and milk products 2. Meat and meat products, fish, egg or poultry 3. Pulses 4. Nuts and oilseeds Group 3. Protective or regulatory foods - This group include foods providing vitamins and minerals I. Fruits- (a) yellow and orange fruits (mango, papaya) (b) citrus fruits (lemon, orange, mausambi) (c) others (apple, banana etc.) II. Vegetables (a) Green leafy vegetables (spinach, mustard, fenugreek etc.) (b) Yellow and orange vegetables (carrot, pumpkin) (c) Others (beans, okra, cauliflower etc.) (d) Root vegetables- potatoes and yam (arvi) are rich in carbohydrates162 Physical EDUCATION-XII It is important to consume a balanced diet in order to get all the nutrients in right amounts and right proportions. This means that in any given meal, foods from all the food groups should be included in such a manner that all the nutrients are supplied in adequate quantities. One has to ensure that each and every meal includes foods from the energy- giving, body building and protective/regulatory groups. eg., For breakfast include one source from energy giving foods (bread- 2 slices; jam), one food from body building foods (egg for non-vegetarians or paneer or sprouts for vegetarians along with milk) and any one or two foods from protective group (fruit/ fruit juice). Similarly, for lunch and dinner different foods from these food groups can be chosen in a variety of combinations. This way, the diet would provide all essential nutrients and would become balanced. Thus, a balanced diet can be defined as one which contains different types of foods in such quantities and proportions that the need for calories, minerals, vitamins and other nutrients is adequately met and a small provision is made for extra nutrients to withstand the period of leanness ie., when adequate food or a particular nutrient is not consumed. Moreover, the action and interaction of the nutrients should be considered. Foods promoting absorption of certain nutrients or hindering absorption of nutrients should also be kept in mind. eg., consuming tea along with meals hampers the absorption of iron while taking sources of vitamin C with meals increases the absorption of iron. Imbalance of nutrients sometimes does not allow proper absorption and utilisation of another nutrient. eg., calcium is needed for building of bones and teeth and phosphorus is also needed for the same. Excess amount of phosphorus in the diet does not allow body to utilise calcium properly and affects bone and teeth formation. Therefore, these two nutrients should be supplied in correct proportions and adequate amounts. 5.1.1 NUTRITION It is well known that food is essential for survival. Food refers to any substance that nourishes our body or in other words, it is anything that we can digest, absorb and utilize, for various physiological functions of the body including growth and development. Since the time of conception in the mother's womb, providing energy for our sustenance, regulating activities of the body and repairing day to day wear and tear, the role of food is enormous. Food provides nutrition to the body. Nutrition is, thus, the science of food and a study of the process that includes everything that happens to food from the time it is eaten until it is used for various functions in the body. It is the scientific study of foods and the nutrients therein; their action 163 Physical EDUCATION-XII and interaction and balance, in health and diseases. It is the study of ingestion, digestion, absorption, utilization and assimilation of nutrients present in food. When we see any food product we recognize it as chapatti, rice, dhal, ladyfinger, apple etc. but as the food enters our mouth it starts breaking down and our body identifies it as different chemicals present therein. These chemical substances which are present in food are called nutrients. Nutrients of physiological importance are carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water and fibre (roughage). Different food stuffs contain these nutrients in different amounts and proportions and our body needs each nutrient in a certain specific amount for various physiological functions and overall growth and development. Nutrients, as mentioned earlier, are those chemical substances in foods that are required by the body for energy, growth and maintenance. I. Tick the correct option. 1. In which of the following food groups \"Sugar and jaggery\" come under? a. Protective or regulatory foods b. Energy giving foods c. Body building foods d. Immunity boosters foods 2. Nutrition is ________________Substance. a. Biological b. Chemical c. Energy d. Mechanical II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. Define Nutrition. 2. Write done the importance of Balance diet. III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. What do you understand by a balanced diet?164 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5.2 Macro and Micro Nutrients: Food sources and functions Nutrients can be broadly classified as macro- and micro-nutrients depending upon their daily requirements by the body. Some nutrients are needed in larger amounts, these are called macronutrients. Nutrients like Carbohydrates, proteins and fats along with water are macronutrients. Other nutrients like vitamins and minerals are required in small amounts and are called micronutrients. Although these are required in smaller amounts but they are all equally essential for our health. Each of these nutrients plays a significant role in the body. Macronutrients are required by the body in relatively large amounts. Carbohydrates, proteins and fats are macronutrients and are also called 'proximate principles' because they form the main bulk of the diet. In Indian meals, they contribute to the total energy intake in the following proportion: carbohydrates: 55-60%; protein: 10- 15% and fats: 20-30%. Water does not provide energy but is a vital nutrient required in large quantity for functioning of metabolic processes in the body and various regulatory functions. Therefore, it is also considered a macronutrient. 5.2.1 CARBOHYDRATES Carbohydrates are organic compounds made up of Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen. Carbohydrates are a major source of energy and provide 4kcal per gram. Carbohydrates are found in abundance in plant foods. There are three types of carbohydrates- monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. Monosaccharides are simple single units of sugars like glucose, fructose and galactose. Disaccharides are when two monosaccharides are combined together; these are maltose (glucose + glucose), lactose (glucose + galactose) and sucrose (glucose + fructose). Simple sugars (mono and disaccharides) are found in fruits (in the form of sucrose, glucose and fructose), milk (in the form of lactose) and sweets that are produced commercially and added to foods to sweeten, prevent spoilage, or improve structure and texture. Polysaccharides are more than two units of monosaccharides joined together. These are starches and fibre (cellulose). These are also called complex sugars and are found in whole grain cereals, rice, oats, potatoes, bread, legumes, corn and flour . All these carbohydrates have to be broken down to the smallest unit, ie., glucose to get absorbed and utilized in the body. However, cellulose and other large carbohydrate molecules cannot be digested in the human digestive tract, and are termed as fibre or non-available carbohydrates. Sugars and starches can be digested and utilized 165 Physical EDUCATION-XII for various bodily functions, hence are known as available carbohydrates. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates are healthier than low-fibre diets based on refined and processed food. Sources of carbohydrates are rice, cereal grains, breads, pasta, milk, fruit, root vegetables, sugar and products that are sweetened like jams, jellies etc., honey, and jaggery. Fibre is present in whole grain cereals (whole wheat atta), whole pulses, green leafy vegetables, peas, carrot, beans and other vegetables, fruits like guava, apple, orange, pineapple etc. Do you Know? Carbohydrates are essential in the diet to prevent ketosis Diets for weight-loss usually recommend avoiding carbohydrates. It is however, essential to have at least 50-100g of carbohydrate per day for complete oxidation of fat and avoidance of excessive production of ketone bodies. Therefore, according ICMR (2020) RDA/minimum requirement for carbohydrate is 130 g/day for adults and children, based on the amount of glucose used by carbohydrate-dependent tissues, such as the brain and erythrocytes. Inadequate supply of carbohydrates causes break down of body fat reserves for energy. This not only supplies energy but also produces ketone bodies. Some ketone bodies are used by muscle and other tissues for energy, but when produced in excess they accumulate in blood and cause ketosis (disturbance of normal acid- base balance). This condition is generally seen in Diabetics and is a life- threatening situation. Summary - Macronutrients, their functions and sources Nutrient Function Sources Carbohydrates Carbohydrates provide energy needed by the body (1g provides 4 Kcal); Carbohydrates are main source of energy for the nervous system, brain and red blood cells; These spare proteins for their important functions (if enough carbohydrates are not available, proteins are used for energy-giving); Carbohydrates enable proper utilization of fat by providing substrates for fat metabolism.Fruits, cereal grains, milk, sugar, rice, root vegetables, pasta, breads166 Physical EDUCATION-XII Roughage Dietary fibre or roughage provides feeling of fullness i.e., one does not feel hungry soon after having a meal: It provides bulk to the diet, helps in smooth elimination of stool or faeces; Helps prevents diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease, has cholesterol lowering effect; It is a negligible source of energy hence, can be eaten for weight control. Whole grain cereals (whole wheat flour, dalia, oats etc.), whole pulses, Green leafy vegetables (GLVs), peas, beans and other vegetables, fruits like guava, orange, pineapple etc Proteins Proteins build and repair body cells Proteins form part of various enzymes, hormones, and antibodies Also provide energy (4 Kcal/g)Milk and milk products, fish, eggs, poultry, meat, legumes and grains Fats Fats provide energy (9kcal/g); Fats help transporting fat-soluble vitamins; Fats are part of cell membranes, membranes around nerves, hormones, bile (for fat digestion)Visible Sources- vegetable oils, desi ghee, vanaspati ghee, butter, margarine, Invisible Sources- Cheese Meat, poultry, fish, milk and milk products, nuts and seeds 5.2.2 PROTEINS List of Essential and Non-Essential Amino Acids 167 Physical EDUCATION-XII Proteins are organic compounds containing nitrogen, besides, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Protein molecules have a complex structure, and are made up of nitrogen containing amino acids. Amino acids are linked together in chains to make different type of proteins in the body. From hair to nails, muscles to skin, organs to blood, hormones to enzymes, protein is a major structural and functional component of our body. There are around 20 amino acids joined together in varying sequences to form different kinds of proteins. There are nine amino acids which cannot be synthesized by the body; these are called Essential Amino Acids (EAA). These have to be supplied in the diet. Others are non- essential amino acids as these can be synthesized in the body. Depending on the availability of these essential amino acids in foods, they are classified as complete protein foods, partially complete protein foods and incomplete protein foods. Complete protein foods are those which contain all essential amino acids in adequate amounts. These food sources include foods from animal sources like eggs, milk and milk products, meat and meat products and a plant source, soybean, that contains all essential amino acids. Protein quality is determined by the presence of complete protein foods in the diet; it improves the absorption and utilization of protein in the body. Partially complete protein foods are those which are lacking in any one essential amino acid e.g., cereals and pulses. Cereals lack lysine and pulses lack methionine. To improve the protein quality, cereals and pulses can be taken together in a meal or can be combined with sources of complete protein foods. Incomplete proteins are those which are lacking in more than one EAA. An example of this protein is maize protein. Protein requirement for Indian adults is 0.83 g/kg body weight (according to RDA 2020; ICMR/NIN). Thus, for a man weighing 60 kg, the protein requirement would be 54 g/day and for a woman weighing 55kg the protein requirement will be 46 g/day. In terms of percentage of total energy intake, protein intake should be between 10-15% of total energy consumed. In no case, it should exceed 35% of total energy intake. Protein requirement, however, may increase to up to 2 g/ kg body weight during sports and exercise depending upon the type of sports and duration and intensity of training. Too little, or, excess intake of protein can have health implications, hence proteins should be consumed as required and recommended.168 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5.2.3 FATS (LIPIDS) Lipids or Dietary Fats is a broader term used for both oils and fats. Oils are basically liquid at room temperature and fats are solid at room temperature. It is the presence of different types of fatty acids which make them liquid or solid. Fatty acids are the building blocks of fats and oils. Fatty acids are classified as Saturated or Unsaturated Fats depending upon the presence of double bond in their chemical structure. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) contain no double bonds, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) contain one, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contain more than one double bond. When the percentage of saturated fatty acids is higher, the fat is solid at room temperature and when the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA or PUFA) is higher the lipid is liquid at room temperature and is called oil. Saturated fats which are also called as animal fats are associated with increased health risks. They can increase risk of heart disease by increasing total and LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol. It has been recommended that the intake of saturated fats be kept less than 7% of total calories. Desi ghee, butter, cheese, cream, red meats, baked products, and other full-fat dairy products are the main sources of saturated fats in most diets. Coconut and palm oils also contain saturated fats. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids are unsaturated fats. When they replace saturated fats in the diet, they help to reduce blood cholesterol levels and thus lower the risk of heart disease. Canola, olive, peanut, palmolein, rice bran and til (sesame) oils and other nuts like walnuts are rich in monounsaturated fats. Sources of PUFA include vegetable oils, mustard, soybean, corn, safflower and sunflower oils and flaxseed. Dietary fat can be attained from visible as well as invisible sources. Visible sources are ghee, butter, cooking oil etc. while invisible sources include nuts, cereals, pulses, milk, eggs, meat etc. Invisible fat contributes significantly to the total fat and essential fatty acid content of diet depending on the food stuffs present in the diet. The total fat (visible + invisible) should provide between 15-30% of total calories required and contribution of visible fat should be restricted to 20-30g per day depending upon the physical activity levels of the individual.169 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? It has been recommended that total fat intake should be 20-30% of calories for adults to meet daily energy and nutritional needs while minimizing risk of chronic diseases. The intake of saturated fats should be less than 7% of calories, cholesterol should be less than 300 mg/day, and trans fatty acid consumption should be as low as possible. Consumption of certain fatty acids (MUFA and PUFA) are encouraged because of their positive health effects, like oils from foods such as vegetable oils, nuts, rice bran and fish because of their healthy attributes. In view of this, an ideal quality fat for good health is one which maintains a balance between SFA, MUFA and PUFA. This can be maintained by combined use of various oils for example, mustard oil with sunflower oil, or safflower oil with palm oil etc. Cholesterol is a fat-like substance which is synthesized in the body. It is necessary in many physiological processes such as: it is a component of cell membranes, it is required in the production of bile acids (which aid in food digestion), and in the production of sex hormones. An excess of cholesterol in the blood, however, can lead to deposits in the walls of blood vessels and reduce blood flow to major arteries, which can lead to a heart attack. Dietary cholesterol is found only in animal foods such as egg yolks, butter, organ meats, beef and chicken. Vegetable oils are cholesterol-free. Excess intake of dietary cholesterol increases blood cholesterol levels, but not as much as saturated and trans-fats do. Trans-fatty acids are basically produced by the process called hydrogenation. It is the process of adding hydrogen molecules directly to unsaturated fatty acids such as those found in vegetable oil to make it saturated or solid. Hydrogenated oils contribute important textural and stability properties in food. Trans-fatty acids occur naturally in beef, lamb, and dairy products. However, the main sources of trans-fats are foods such as cookies, biscuits, mixtures, namkeens, pastries and other fried foods. Trans-fatty acids are similar to saturated fats and dietary cholesterol with regard to their effect on blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL - which is a \"harmful\" or \"bad\") cholesterol. Trans-fats may also lower high- density lipoprotein (HDL - which is a good) cholesterol. 5.2.4 WATER Water is essential for life. Water is an inorganic compound made up of hydrogen and oxygen. Water is a major component of our body and it makes up to 60% of the total weight of an individual. It is the medium of all body fluids including blood, saliva, digestive juices, urine, faeces, sweat and perspiration.170 Physical EDUCATION-XII Water plays an important role in the regulation of body temperature. It is also a universal solvent. Water bathes the body cells and keeps them moist. Hence, it acts as a lubricant. It is also an important lubricant for the joints. Our body gets water mainly by ingestion of water in the form of liquids; water taken as such or in the form of beverages like tea, coffee, fruit juices and aerated drinks. In other foods like vegetables, fruits, milk, cereals and pulses, water is present in invisible form. It is important that clean, safe and wholesome water is consumed in order to avoid water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery and cholera. Do you know? Each red blood cell contains haemoglobin which is the iron-containing protein that transports oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body. In haemoglobin, each subunit contains a heme group; each heme group contains an iron atom that is able to bind to one oxygen molecules. 5.2.5 VITAMIN Vitamins are the chemicals which our body needs in small amounts to function properly. They work in a variety of ways, mostly as 'helpers' eg., many of the B-vitamins help the body use protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Vitamins are divided into two categories: 1. Water-soluble vitamins include all the B vitamins and vitamin C. The amount of water- soluble vitamins that body doesn't use passes through the kidneys and leaves the body as urine or stool. The body needs water-soluble vitamins in frequent, small doses, and they are unlikely to reach toxic levels. 2. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body cells and are not passed out of the body as easily as water- soluble vitamins. They are more likely to reach toxic levels if a person takes in too much of these vitamins. The table-2.i and 2.ii lists the water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins; their functions and their sources in the foods we eat.171 Physical EDUCATION-XII Table 2.i - Water-soluble vitamins Nutrient Important (vitamin B1) Works as coenzyme- (Thiamine pyrophosphate- TPP) needed for energy metabolism; important for nerve function; needed for DNA and RNA synthesisWhole-grain cereals, pulses, peanuts and seeds, mushrooms, green peas, beans, egg yolk and meat Riboflavin (vitamin B2) Act mononucleotide Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) needed energy metabolism; important for normal vision and skin healthMilk and milk products; animal products like eggs, liver, broccoli; for energy metabolism; important for nervous system, digestive system, and skin whole-grain cereals, pulses, meat, poultry, fish, vegetables (especially mushrooms). Eggs and milk and milk products lack niacin but are rich sources of EAA- tryptophan which can be converted to niacin in the body when required. 60 mg of tryptophan can be converted to provide 1 mg niacin. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxal, pyridoxine and pyridoxamine) Part of coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate needed for protein and amino acid metabolism and also involved in activity of many enzymes required for carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. It also helps in making white blood cells and heme in haemoglobin.Meat, Poultry, fish, Nuts, sunflower seeds, pulses, whole grains, spinach, bananas, potatoes.172 Physical EDUCATION-XII Biotin Functions as coenzyme in metabolic reactions.Widespread in foods like organ meats, such as liver or kidney; egg yolk; nuts, such as almonds, peanuts, and and other legumes; whole grains; bananas; cauliflower, mushrooms; also produced in intestinal tract by bacteria Pantothenic acid Part of co-enzyme A (CoA) needed for energy metabolismWidespread in foods: milk, meat, peanuts, eggs Folic acid / Folate Part of an enzyme needed for making DNA and new cells, especially red blood cells, formation of neurotransmitters needed for maintenance of normal blood pressure and reducing risk of cancerGreen leafy vegetables particularly spinach, pulses, oranges and orange juice, and liver. Other vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli are also good sources Cobalamin (vitamin B12) Part two coenzymes methyl cobalamin and 5- deoxy adenosyl cobalamin, needed for making new cells; important to nerve functionMeat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, milk and milk products; not found in plant foods Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) Antioxidant, role in collagen formation hence in wound healing, part of an enzyme needed for protein metabolism; important for immune system, helps in iron absorptionFound in fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits, fresh vegetables in the cabbage family, sprouts, amla and guava Fat-soluble vitamins Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body's cells and are not excreted as easily as water- soluble vitamins. Intake of high amounts of fat-soluble vitamins could become toxic. A balanced diet usually provides enough fat-soluble vitamins.173 Physical EDUCATION-XII Table 2.ii - Fat-soluble vitamins Nutrient A (Retinol and its precursor*, beta- carotene) *A precursor is converted by the body to the vitamin. Needed for vision in dim light, healthy skin and mucous membranes, growth of skeletal and soft tissues, immune system healthVitamin A from animal sources (retinol): milk, cheese, cream, butter, egg yolk, liver, Beta- carotene (from plant sources):, dark green leafy vegetables; red and yellow fruits and vegetables (carrots, pumpkin, mangoes, papaya) Vitamin D Needed for proper absorption of calcium and phosphorus; deposition of calcium and phosphorus in bonesEgg yolks, liver, fatty fish, fortified foods. When exposed to sunlight, the skin can make vitamin D. Vitamin E Antioxidant; protects cell wallsPolyunsaturated plant oils (soybean, corn, cottonseed, germ; whole- grain products; liver; egg yolks; nuts and seeds Vitamin K Needed for proper blood clottinggreen leafy vegetables and cabbage; milk; also produced in intestinal tract by bacteria 5.2.6 MINERALS Minerals are inorganic elements which are required by the body needs for various physiological functions. There are minerals required in larger amounts called macro- minerals and those required in smaller amounts are called micro-minerals (trace minerals). Tables 3.i and 3.ii list important macro- and micro-minerals, their functions and their sources in the foods we eat.174 Physical EDUCATION-XII Table 3.i - Macro-minerals Mineral Important Functions Sources Sodium Needed for proper fluid balance, regulating alkalinity and acidity of body fluids, nerve transmission, and muscle contractionTable salt, soy sauce; large amounts in processed foods; small amounts in milk, breads, green leafy vegetables, and unprocessed meats Chloride Needed for proper fluid balance, stomach acidTable salt, soya sauce; large amounts in processed foods; small amounts in milk, meats, breads, and vegetables Potassium Needed for proper fluid balance, nerve transmission, and muscle contractionMeats, milk, fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, pulses Calcium Important for healthy bones and teeth; helps muscles relax and contract; important in nerve functioning, blood clotting, blood pressure regulation, immune system healthMilk and milk products; fish with bones for healthy bones and teeth; found in every cell; part of the system that maintains acid-base balanceMeat, fish, poultry, eggs, milk, processed foods Magnesium Found in bones; needed for making protein, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, immune system healthNuts and seeds; pulses; leafy, green vegetables; seafood; chocolate Sulphur Found in protein molecules Occurs in foods as part of protein in meats, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, pulses, nuts175 Physical EDUCATION-XII Trace minerals (micro-minerals) The body needs trace minerals in very small amounts. Although iron is considered to be a trace mineral, the amount needed is somewhat more than for other micro- minerals. Table 3.ii - Trace minerals Mineral Important Functions Sources Iron Iron is a mineral found in every cell of the body. Iron is considered an essential mineral because it is found in red blood cells as part of haemoglobin that carries oxygen to every cell in the body; part of myoglobin needed for muscle contraction, needed for energy metabolism, hence crucial in helping perform physical work Organ meats; red meats; fish; poultry; egg yolks; whole pulses and whole grain cereals; dried fruits; dark green leafy vegetables (mustard greens, bathua); iron- enriched breads and cereals; and fortified cereals Zinc Part of many enzymes needed for synthesizing protein and genetic material; has a function in taste perception, wound healing, normal foetal development, production of sperm, normal growth and sexual maturation, important for immune systemMeats, fish, poultry, whole grains, vegetables Iodine Found in thyroid hormone, which helps regulate growth, development, and metabolismSeafood, foods grown in iodine-rich soil, iodized salt, bread, dairy products Selenium Antioxidant Meats, seafood, grains Copper Part of many enzymes; needed for iron metabolismPulses, nuts and seeds, whole grains, organ meats, drinking water176 Physical EDUCATION-XII Manganese Part of many enzymes Widespread in foods, especially plant foods Fluoride Involved in formation of bones and teeth; helps prevent tooth decayDrinking water (either fluoridated or naturally containing fluoride), fish, and most teas Chromium Works closely with insulin to regulate blood sugar (glucose) levelsOrgan meats especially liver, whole grains, nuts, cheese Molybdenum Part of some enzymes Pulses, breads and grains; green leafy vegetables, milk; liver Other trace nutrients known to be essential in tiny amounts include nickel, silicon, vanadium, and cobalt.

List the essential nutrients, their sources and functions. 2. Critically explain the use of dietary supplements in heavy dose for longer duration. Justify your answer with suitable examples.178 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5.3 Nutritive and Non-Nutritive Components of Diet Food is the basic requirement of every individual as it helps develop our body. It provides sufficient energy for workout and helps in the growth and development of the individual. The food which we eat contains various nutrients which are essential for our body. There are large number of nutrients required in our balanced diet. Some of them are \"Nutritive components\" like Carbohydrates, Fats, and Proteins, whereas some other components of diet have no nutritive value. 5.3.1 NON-NUTRITIVE COMPONENTS OF DIET Foods we eat contain a wide range of organic chemical compounds some of which have nutritive value as discussed above, while some have no nutritional value. Chemical compounds in foods with no specific nutritional function are called non- nutritive components of foods. Some of these components act as anti-nutritional factors like phytate while some have various benefits like phytochemicals. Some materials with no nutritional value are added to food and beverage products to make the food smell better, taste better, last longer, and/or look better. Some of the non-nutritive components are discussed below. 5.3.2 NON-NUTRITIVE FACTORS THAT INTERFERE WITH NUTRIENT ABSORPTION Non-Nutritive Factors or Anti-Nutritional Factors (ANFs), that interfere with nutrient absorption, are those biological compounds present in human or animal foods that reduce nutrient utilization or food intake, thereby contributing to impaired gastrointestinal and metabolic performance. These include: 1. Phytates - These are abundantly found in unrefined cereals and millets. These phytates bind iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium and make these nutrients unavailable for digestion. On germination the phytate content is reduced. 2. Tannins- These are present in legumes, millets like bajra, ragi, spices, tamarind, tea, turmeric and in certain vegetables and fruits. Tannins interfere with absorption of iron and protein. 3. Trypsin Inhibitors- These inhibit the activity of trypsin in the gut and interfere with digestibility of dietary proteins and reduce their utilisation. These are present in soya bean, and white of duck egg. Heat treatment inactivates trypsin inhibitors. 179 Physical EDUCATION-XII 4. Oxalates- These are present in green leafy vegetables and some legumes. These interfere with calcium absorption. 5. Goitrogens- These are also known as anti-thyroid substances as these interfere with iodine uptake by thyroid gland and may contribute to development of iodine deficiency disorders when iodine intakes are marginal. These are present in cabbage, cauliflower, turnips, soybean, bajra, peanuts, lentils. 5.3.3 BENEFICIAL NON-NUTRITIVE FACTORS OF FOODS 1. Phytochemicals- Phytochemicals are chemical compounds produced by plants, generally to help them thrive or thwart competitors, predators, or pathogens. The name comes from Greek phyton, meaning 'plant'. They are found in fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, and other plants. Some of these phytochemicals are believed to act as antioxidants and protect cells from damage that could lead to cancer. Risk of cancer can be reduced by eating more colourful vegetables, fruits, and other plant foods that have certain phytochemicals in them. Some of these phytochemicals are Beta carotene and other carotenoids in yellow, red, green vegetables and fruits, flavonoids in green tea, isothiocyanates in cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, and cauliflower). 2. Anthocyanins: Anthocyanins give grapes, blueberries, cranberries, and raspberries their dark colour. They have been shown in the laboratory to have anti-inflammatory and anti- tumour properties. 3. Flavonoids or isoflavones: These are found in vegetables, fruits and grains like soybeans, chickpeas and may act a little bit like oestrogen. The oestrogen-like 180 Physical EDUCATION-XII compounds in these plants are called phytoestrogens. These help in lowering the risk of osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer and symptoms of menopause 4. Artificial Sweeteners: These are synthetic compounds that duplicate the taste of sugar, but contain less energy, and, therefore, are often added to diet foods and beverages. The reason is to maintain the desired taste, but reduce the caloric value. Because artificial sweeteners are considered additives, they are often regulated. Therefore, their identifications and concentrations must be determined. 5. Preservatives: These are compounds that have the ability to inhibit microbial growth and are often added to food and beverage products to prolong shelf life. Preservatives are considered additives, and are typically regulated. Therefore, their identification and concentration levels must be determined. 6. Spices: A spice is a dried seed, fruit, root, bark or vegetable substance primarily used for flavouring, colouring or preserving food. Sometimes a spice is used to hide other flavours. Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are parts of leafy green plants also used for flavouring or as garnish. A spice may have other uses, including medicinal, religious ritual, cosmetics or perfume production, or as a vegetable. For example, turmeric roots are also consumed as a vegetable and garlic as an antibiotic. 7. Coffee: Coffee is a brewed beverage prepared from the roasted or baked seeds of several species of Coffea. The two most common sources of coffee beans are Coffea arabica, and Coffea canephora. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed and dried to yield the seeds inside. The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavour, before being ground and brewed to create coffee. Coffee can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways. I. Tick the correct option. 1. Anthocyanins give colour to a. roots b. coffee c. wheat d. grapes181 Physical EDUCATION-XII 2. Oxalates are presents in a. green leafy vegetables b. bajara c. nuts d. spices II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. Define Non-Nutritive components of food. 2. Explain the beneficial factors of Non-Nutritive foods. III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Explain Non-Nutritive components of Diet 5.4 Healthy Weight There are numerous advantages of maintaining healthy weight. Overweight or obese people can gain these health benefits by losing some weight. For most obese or overweight people, health benefits can come with losing the first 5-10% of weight. Conditions such as Type 2 diabetes are less likely to develop if an obese person loses even 10% of their weight. With a healthy body weight there is less likelihood of having heart disease, stroke, or obesity related cancers all of which can be life- threatening and the chances of living a long and healthier life increase. Do you Know Body Mass Index (BMI) is used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. Overweight or Obesity can lead to a variety of health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular problems. On the other hand, a weight that is too low can increase the risk of malnutrition, osteoporosis, and anaemia. Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) - or the ratio between the circumference of the waist and the circumference of the hip indicates risk of obesity. Greater circumference of trunk is an indicator of high risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Girth Circumferences or circumferences of different segments of the body help to document body size and to estimate the percentage of body fat. Skinfolds determine body fat quite accurately. The skinfold technique can only be performed by a trained technician using skinfold callipers.182 Physical EDUCATION-XII Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis is a commonly used method for estimating body composition, in particular body fat and muscle mass. A weak electric current is allowed to flow through the body and the voltage is measured in order to calculate impedance (resistance) of the body. It is done using a portable machine, is easy to administer and gives reliable results of body composition. Hydrostatic Weighing or Underwater weighing is known as the gold standard method to measure mass per unit volume of a living person's body. There are various ways of assessing healthy body weight that include weight for height charts or Body Mass Index (BMI) or assessment of body fat percentage. Body Mass Index (BMI) Quetelet's Index is a key index for relating weight to height. BMI is derived by taking a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared. Now-a-days, BMI is used to define normal weight, overweight, and obesity rather than the traditional height/weight charts. BMI of 30 or more for either sex indicates obesity. BMI however, does not measure how much fat mass or muscle mass is there. A very muscular person might get a high BMI without health risks. It is, therefore, less accurate in people such as body builders and pregnant women. BMI Classification < 18.5 Underweight 18.5-24.9 Normal weight 25.0-29.9 Overweight 30.0-34.9 Grade I obesity 35.0-39.9 Grade II obesity 40.0 Grade III obesity Intra-abdominal or visceral fat has a particularly strong correlation with cardiovascular disease. Women with abdominal obesity have a cardiovascular risk similar to that of men. This can be evaluated by measuring waist circumference or by calculating waist to hip ratio. A waist circumference of >102 cm (>40 inches) in men and >88 cm (>35 inches) in women or the waist-hip ratio (the circumference of the waist divided by that of the hips of >1.0 for men and >0.85 for women) are used to define central obesity. In those with a BMI under 35, intra- abdominal body fat is related to negative health outcomes independent of total body fat. Body fat percentage is total body fat expressed as a percentage of total body weight that can be assessed by methods like skinfold measurements, bioelectrical impedance, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) etc. but to measure body fat percentage, special equipment and technical expertise is needed. There is no generally accepted definition of obesity based on total body fat. Most researchers have used >25% in men, and >32% in women, as cut-points to define obesity and higher health risks.183 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5.4.1 EATING FOR WEIGHT CONTROL Eating right is important to stay at a healthy weight. Maintaining body weight is a balancing act, meaning that the amount of energy we consume should be expended. If we eat more calories than we burn, we gain weight. And if we eat fewer calories than we burn, we lose weight. The balance between calorie intake and calories used or expended is essential to keep the weight maintained. The best way to have energy balance is to make better choices, thus, choosing foods that are lower in fat and have fewer calories and increasing physical activity are the best ways to reduce body weight. We can lose weight by making smart choices every day, we can develop new eating habits and preferences that will leave us feeling satisfied and winning the battle of weight loss. Remember, slow and steady wins the race. So, aim to lose one to two kilos a week to ensure healthy weight loss. Losing weight too fast can take a toll on the mind and body, making one feel sluggish, drained, and sick. Caloric restriction for weight reduction is essential to get results. Dietary modification must be accompanied by moderate amounts of exercise to get effective results in weight loss or weight maintenance. Aerobic exercise increases the daily energy expenditure and is particularly useful for long-term weight maintenance. Exercise also preserves lean body mass and partially prevents decrease in basal metabolic rate which comes when caloric intake is restricted. Additionally, most of the benefits of exercise come from improvements in body composition, overall fitness and metabolic health, not just weight loss. Risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other obesity related health problems also lower. Once stress is reduced, stress related intake of food is also curtailed. The person should be put in negative energy balance to upto 500- 1000 kcal to get ideal reduction in weight of 500g - 1 kg / week. To lose weight, we have to eat fewer calories than what we expend. But that doesn't necessarily mean we have to eat less food. We can fill up our stomach while on a diet, as long as we choose foods wisely. Modifications in the diet to be made 1. Diet should consist of foods from all food groups including, milk and milk products, meat and meat products, cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables. 2. High-fibre foods are higher in volume and take longer to digest, which makes them filling. High-fibre foods include: h Fruits and vegetables - Eat whole fruits, salads, and green leafy vegetables of all kinds. Soups and salads can be liberally eaten. The high water and fibre content in most fresh fruits and vegetables makes them hard to overeat. Eat vegetables raw or steamed, not fried or breaded.184 Physical EDUCATION-XII h Beans - Select beans of any kind. Add them to soups, salads, and meals. h Whole grains - High-fibre cereals, oatmeal, brown rice, whole-wheat pasta, whole-wheat or multigrain bread. 3. Add nuts to the daily diet but only in moderation. 4. Switch to fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products. Use low-fat milk in place of cream thereby reducing the overall caloric intake of the day. 5. Baking or grilling foods rather than frying them reduces the calorie count of foods 6. Limit intake of high sugar foods like jams, jellies, sweetened curd etc. 7. Cut on high cholesterol and saturated fat foods like mixtures, mathris, namkeens and bakery products. Instead choose on high fibre biscuits, or khakhra type snacks. 8. Eat low-fat proteins like egg whites, fish, lean meats, nuts, and poultry . 9. Serve smaller portions. One easy way to control portion size is by using small plates, bowls, and cups. This will make portions appear larger. Don't eat out of large bowls or directly from the food container or package, which makes it difficult to assess how much has been eaten. Using smaller utensils, like a teaspoon instead of tablespoon, can slow eating and help feel full sooner. 10. Cooking meals at home allows controlling both portion size and what goes in to the food. Restaurant and packaged foods generally contain a lot more sodium, sugar, fat and calories than food cooked at home\u2014plus the portion sizes tend to be larger. 11. Avoid consuming high salt foods like pickles, papad etc. as these foods induce water retention. 12. Be especially careful to avoid high-calorie snacks and convenience foods. 13. Soft drinks (including soda, energy drinks, and coffee drinks) are a huge source of calories in many people's diets. One can of soft drink contains between 10- 12 teaspoons of sugar and around 150 calories, so a few soft drinks can quickly add up to a good portion of your daily calorie intake. Instead homemade lemon water, coconut water, lassi or chachh are better replacements of commercially available juices and soft drinks. 14. Reduce daily calorie intake by replacing soda, alcohol, or coffee with water. Thirst can also be confused with hunger, so by drinking water, one can avoid consuming extra calories.185 Physical EDUCATION-XII 15. Eating frequently throughout the day (3 small meals and 2-3 snacks) will stimulate metabolism. Skipping meals (including breakfast) can decrease metabolism. Skipping meals usually turns into eating more at the end of the day. Reducing portion sizes, changing ways of cooking, right food selection would go long way in helping weight management. 5.4.2 THE PITFALLS OF DIETING Maintaining a calorie deficit always leads to weight loss. Without exercise, a calorie deficit must be created through a lower calorie intake. The main problem with dieting alone is the sacrifice needed to sustain a very low-calorie intake for a long period of time, which is too much for most people to handle. On a very low-calorie diet, most people tend to breakdown and go back to their old habits causing any weight loss to return quickly. The body's reaction to dieting is also different. In case of a sudden and drastic reduction in calorie intake, the body adjusts its metabolism accordingly. Eating very little calories for a long time would turn body into starvation mode means slowing down metabolic processes which is the body's way of protecting itself against long periods with little or no food. This starvation mode causes body to drastically cut its energy requirements and the person stops losing weight. Do you Know Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of weight. People with anorexia place a high value on controlling their weight and shape, using extreme efforts that tend to significantly interfere with their lives. To prevent weight gain or to continue losing weight, people with anorexia usually severely restrict the amount of food they eat. They may control calorie intake by vomiting after eating or by misusing laxatives, diet aids, diuretics or enemas. They may also try to lose weight by exercising excessively. No matter how much weight is lost, the person continues to fear weight gain. Diets, especially fad diets or \"quick-fix\" pills and plans, often lead to failure because diets that cut out entire groups of food, such as carbohydrates or fat, are simply impractical and unhealthy. The key is moderation. Diets that severely cut calories, restrict certain foods, or rely on ready-made meals might work in the short term but don't include a plan for maintaining weight, so the weight quickly comes back. 186 Physical EDUCATION-XII Severely restricted diet also lead to deficiency of various other nutrients. Once we start eating normally, we will gain weight until our metabolism bounces back. Special shakes, meals, and programmes are not only expensive, but they aren't practical for long-term weight loss. Hence, instead of dieting alone and looking for miraculous foods to reduce or maintain weight, regular exercise and good eating habits are crucial to health and well-being. 5.4.3 FOOD INTOLERANCE Food intolerance is the non-IgE mediated food hypersensitivity or non-allergic food hypersensitivity, which is characterized by difficulty in digesting certain foods. Food intolerance is different from food allergy. Food allergies trigger the immune system, while food intolerance does not. The symptoms of food intolerance generally take longer to emerge, compared to food allergies. In food intolerance, some people suffer digestive problems after eating certain foods. Foods most commonly associated with food intolerance include dairy products, grains that contain gluten, and foods that cause intestinal gas build-up, such as beans and cabbage. Gluten in wheat is one of the most common causes of food intolerance. Some people are intolerant to several groups of foods, making it harder to determine whether it might be a chronic illness or food intolerance. Identifying which foods are the reasons can take a long time. The symptoms to food intolerance are varied and can include stomach-ache, bloating, nausea, irritable bowel, hives, migraine, mild fever, cough etc. Some types of food intolerance are given below: Absence of an enzyme: Enzymes are needed to digest foods fully. If some of these enzymes are missing, or are insufficient for digesting a particular foodstuff, proper digestion may be affected. Some food intolerance is caused by the lack of a particular enzyme like lactose intolerance which is caused due to deficiency of lactase enzyme in the body. Hence, the person is unable to digest lactose from milk and gets intolerant to milk and all milk products. People who are lactose intolerant do not have enough lactase, an enzyme that breaks down milk sugar (lactose) into smaller molecules and absorb through the intestine. If lactose remains in the digestive tract, it can cause stomach-ache, spasms, bloating, gas and diarrhoea. Chemical causes of food intolerance: Certain chemicals in foods and drinks can cause intolerance, including amines in some cheeses, and caffeine in coffee, tea, and chocolates. Some people are more susceptible to these chemicals than others. Toxins due to Food poisoning: Some foods have naturally-occurring chemicals that can have a toxic effect on humans, causing diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. Peanuts or undercooked beans have aflatoxins that can cause extremely unpleasant digestive problems.187 Physical EDUCATION-XII Salicylates: Salicylates are derivatives of salicylic acid, which occurs naturally in plants as a defence mechanism against harmful bacteria, fungi, insects, and diseases. Salicylates are present in most plant-sourced foods, including the majority of fruits and vegetables, spices, herbs, tea, and flavour additives. Mint-flavouring, tomato sauce, berries, and citrus fruits have particularly high levels of salycilates. Salicylate intolerance, also known as salicylate sensitivity, occurs when somebody reacts to normal amounts of ingested salicylate. These chemicals are found in many foods and most people can consume salicylate-containing foods without any adverse effects. However, some people suffer symptoms after eating large amounts. Salicylate intolerant individuals should avoid foods that contain high levels. Processed foods with flavour additives are usually high in salicylates as well. Gluten intolerance: Gluten is a protein found primarily in wheat, barley and rye. If a person has a gluten intolerance, this protein can cause digestive problems such as gas, abdominal pain or diarrhoea. Gluten intolerance is sometimes confused with Celiac disease, or thought of as a food allergy. Anyone who suspects they may have a gluten intolerance should see a doctor before giving up gluten, as cereals can be an important source of various nutrients. Food additives and intolerance: Additives are used to enhance flavours, make foods look more appealing, and to increase their shelf life. Food additive intolerance has been a steadily- growing problem over the last many years because more and more foods contain additives. Nitrates are known to cause itching and skin rashes. Processed meats are generally high in nitrates and nitrites. MSG (monosodium glutamate) is used as a flavour enhancer known to cause headaches. Some colourings - especially carmine (red) and annatto (yellow) also cause food intolerance. It is very difficult to determine whether somebody has a food intolerance or allergy because the signs and symptoms often overlap. Patients are advised to keep a diary and write down which foods are eaten, what the symptoms were like, and when they appeared. The data in the diary can help a dietician or doctor identify which foods are causing adverse reactions, and what steps to take. Apart from lactose intolerance and celiac disease, there is no accurate, reliable, and validated test to identify food intolerance. The best diagnostic tool is an exclusion diet, also known as an elimination or diagnostic diet. Exclusion diets are extremely useful in isolating the causative foods. In a typical exclusion diet, the suspected food is removed from the diet for a period of 2 weeks to 2 months. If during this period the adverse reactions do not appear, it becomes more likely that the cause has been recognized. The best current treatment for food intolerance is to either avoid certain foods or eat them less often and in smaller amounts.188 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5.4.4 FOOD MYTHS The fewer the carbohydrates, healthier you are- Choosing the healthiest carbohydrates, especially whole grains, is important for health and well-being. Refined carbohydrates should be avoided however, choosing whole grains is associated with a decreased risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality. Oils/Margarine have fewer calories than Ghee/butter- Ghee/Butter and Oils/ Margarine have about the same amount of calories. Margarine, which is made from vegetable oils, was seen as a healthier alternative to butter (which contains cholesterol and saturated fat), but later it was found that some margarines are actually unhealthier because they contain trans-fats, which have even more adverse effects on cholesterol and heart health. Apples and brinjals are rich in iron because they turn brown when cut- One of the greatest myths about apples and brinjals is that they are good sources of iron. They are an excellent source of fibre but not of iron. This change in colour is an enzymatic reaction and has nothing to do with iron. Milk should be avoided after eating fish- A lot of Indians think that drinking milk right after consuming fish causes skin disease like leukoderma, or white patches on skin. This is not true. Drinking water in between meals affects digestion- Most people think that drinking water during meals will affect the capacity to digest food. The truth is that drinking water simply fills up stomach and as a result one tends to eat less which is especially good when someone is trying to lose weight. Similarly, you may come across many such beliefs, but for any belief try to learn the science behind to understand the fact. Art Integration Start an awareness campaign in your school regarding importance of nutrition in our life. You could include the following activities: h Poster making Competition on the benefits of W Healthy Eating W Healthy Lifestyle h Talk Show by inviting a Dietician. h Making and screening a video film on dietary imbalances. h Cooking competition for cooking healthy. h If possible, develop a school vegetable garden to increase awareness about various vegetables.189 Physical EDUCATION-XII I.

How you can modify your diet for weight control 3. Enumerate any five food myths and the related facts. 5.5. Importance Of Diet In Sports And Pre, During And Post Requirement Nutrition is an important aspect of training and performance. Athletes should make appropriate dietary manipulations for better performances and long-term health benefits by choosing right foods and a diet including variety of foods. The concepts of nutrition and basic principles of balanced diet are applicable to the field of sports as well. A sports person needs to increase or decrease his energy intake and proportions of macronutrients and micronutrients depending upon the nature of her/his sport or game. Diet of sportspersons should aim at maintaining body weight and body composition desired for their specific sport, maintaining adequate pool of nutrient levels in the body, adopting healthy nutritional practices during 190 Physical EDUCATION-XII training and competition and carrying on with healthy nutritional practices during off-season as well ie., when competitions are not taking place. Any imbalances in nutritional intake, both deficiency or excess of certain nutrients, can be detrimental to the performance of athletes and may reduce their ability to play up to maximum potential. A nutritious diet meeting nutritional demands of athletes not only helps in better performance but will also support good health. 5.5.1 IMPORTANCE OF DIET IN SPORTS 1. The body needs nutrition to repair and recover. Sports persons have greater demands on their body. If these are not met through proper diet, outcome will suffer and post training recovery process will be affected. 2. For different games, there are different body composition requirements which can be manipulated to certain extent by nutrient composition of diet besides training, thus helping in achieving body composition goals. 3. Right kind of nutritional composition in pre-competition meals, during competition and post competition meals can help improve performance, delay fatigue and speed up recovery. 4. Knowledge of nutrition is essential to make fitness, weight loss and weight gain programmes successful in athletes. Those sports persons who play in weight categories can achieve body weight goals with appropriate diets. During off- season or no practice period, the diet should be such that it does not alter too much of body composition and prevents excessive weight gain. 5. Certain nutrients are taken as ergogenic aids, their ergogenic potential and psychological and physiological effects can help sports persons in their performance. 6. Dehydration can impair athletic performance. Therefore, sufficient intake of fluids and electrolytes ensures maximum hydration before, during and after exercise 7. Adequate diet enhances physiological adaptations during training. 5.5.2 CARBOHYDRATES IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE As we all know that carbohydrates are the major source of energy for any activity. For athletes engaging in strength-sports (wrestling, boxing, judo etc.) 55% of total calories should be provided by carbohydrate sources. While in endurance sports like running, swimming, football, hockey and other similar type of sports 60-70% of calories should be derived from carbohydrates in the diet. Besides the total 191 Physical EDUCATION-XII amount of carbohydrates in the diet, the type and time of carbohydrate intake is also important. Appropriate type and time of carbohydrate intake prior to, during and post exercise can improve exercise performance. Before competition, complex carbohydrates should be taken and consuming simple sugars prior to exercise (<1 hour) should be discouraged as it may increase insulin levels which in turn increases carbohydrate metabolism resulting in low blood glucose levels during exercise. This induces early fatigue and light-headedness due to hypoglycaemia. Excessive intake of highly concentrated sugars, such as candy and soft drinks in a short period of time can also result in cramps and bloating. However, simple carbohydrate foods are the best sources of energy replacement after strenuous exercises; complex carbohydrate foods are preferred as pre-exercise carbohydrate sources. It takes about 4 hours for carbohydrates to be digested and begin to be stored as muscle and liver glycogen. Therefore, pre-exercise meals should be consumed about 4 to 6 hours before exercise. A light carbohydrate and protein snack 30 to 60 min prior to exercise (e.g., 50 g of carbohydrate and 5 to 10 g of protein) serves to increase carbohydrate availability toward the end of an intense exercise bout. This also serves to increase availability of amino acids and decrease exercise-induced breakdown of protein. 5.5.3 PROTEINS FOR EXERCISE AND TRAINING During exercise and training, muscle bulk is increased and also there is breakdown of muscle tissues. During prolonged exercises, protein is oxidised to provide energy. For these purposes, increased amount of protein is recommended in sports persons. ICMR (1985) has recommended protein intake of 12-14% of total caloric intake and range of protein intake as 1g/kg body weight to 2 g/kg body weight; lower limit for endurance sports and sports of light weight category and upper limit for strength sports. Eating sufficient calories from a well-balanced diet generally provides adequate proteins. However, sources of good quality protein should be included. Milk and milk products, meat and meat products should be incorporated. Low fat protein sources like skim milk, egg white, fish, and chicken are more helpful in enhancing performance as well as maintaining long term health. Cereal pulse combination or supplements with complete protein also improves the quality of protein. Protein and amino acid supplementation is becoming widely popular in athletes. Markets are flooded with protein and amino acid supplements. However, additional 192 Physical EDUCATION-XII supplementation of protein is not necessary as long as athletes maintain energy balance and take 15% of their total caloric intake in the form of proteins. The protein intake in excess of twice the recommended (i.e.>2g/kg BW) could increase the risk of renal degeneration and bone porosity. When protein intake is increased, urea production increases and more water is drawn in urine to eliminate metabolic products putting athlete into a dehydrated state. High protein intake also leads to urinary calcium loss, which in long term would affect calcium status particularly of women athletes. 5.5.4 FAT INTAKE IN SPORTS AND TRAINING Fat intake in athletes contributes to energy density and offers other protective roles, however, higher than recommended could pose health problems. Hence athletes, like other population, should restrict dietary fat intake within the suggested amounts i.e. 25-30% of total calories. Within this limit, dietary fat choices also make a difference. A diet that includes polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; vegetable oils, nuts and oil seeds) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA ground nut oil, fish oil etc) has definite advantages over a diet rich in saturated fatty acids (animal fat/ desi ghee; butter etc) in terms of improving total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglyceride levels. Thus, these healthy fats should account for the majority of fat in athlete's diet. Invisible fat sources should also be chosen wisely. Like inclusion of egg whites, fish and skimmed milk in place of high fat animal foods would be helpful in keeping the total cholesterol levels below 200mg/day. 5.5.5 VITAMINS AND MINERALS Vitamins and minerals perform functions for athletes and non-athletes alike. Athletes, however, have high energy needs and high production of free radicals. Therefore, they require higher amounts of B-vitamins and vitamins with anti-oxidant properties. The required amount can be obtained by eating a variety of foods especially fruits and vegetables. Taking more than required vitamins and minerals does not improve performance, if there are no deficiencies of any vitamin or mineral in the body. The key to obtain the adequate vitamins and minerals is to eat a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods in amounts that will maintain energy balance. Fruits and vegetables are particularly rich in vitamins and antioxidants as well. Supplements are not replacements for food. 193 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5.5.6 PRE-EXERCISE OR PRE-EVENT MEAL For pre-exercise or pre-event meal, fuelling up of glycogen stores to obtain energy and proper hydration are the primary goals. This would control hunger, fatigue, weakness, light-headedness which could interfere in the sports performance. Pre- exercise meal should also provide a comfortable gastrointestinal state for sports performance. During night, our blood glucose levels and storage levels of glycogen go down and therefore, eating carbohydrate-containing foods before exercise refills liver glycogen stores and can replenish muscle glycogen stores. In pre-exercise meal our main considerations should be as follows: h A meal comprising high-carbohydrate, moderate protein and low fibre and low-fat foods providing 500-1000 kcal should be consumed. Examples of good pre-event meal would be banana milk shake or pasta and fruits with curd or potato sandwich with fruit juice. h High sugar foods must be avoided to prevent insulin rush that results in early fatigue, cramping, dehydration, nausea and diarrhoea. h On regular training days, instead of large meals, small meals or a snack every 2-3 hours should be taken. h Meals should be taken about 2-4 hours before exercise. h If eating within two hours of exercise eat less and take semi-solid or liquid meals. h Dinner on the previous night of the competition is also important. The meal should be such that it ensures proper sleep and adequate fuelling up. h Familiar and easily digestible foods should be consumed. Any newer food or foods with known allergies or known to cause gastrointestinal upsets should be avoided. h Foods heavy on stomach like fried foods or high fibre foods should be avoided on the day prior to competition. h Too much of protein intake should also be avoided as it increases water excretion leading to a state of dehydration. Moreover, proteins are digested slower. h Take sufficient liquids or a small snack an hour (or less) before exercise. Maintaining optimal hydration status along with sufficient muscle glycogen stores delays the onset of fatigue and enables the athletes to exercise longer before getting exhausted. High intensity games lead to heavy sweat loss resulting in fluid and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) imbalance. Hence, sufficient 194 Physical EDUCATION-XII amounts of fluids to maintain water and electrolyte balance need to consumed at regular intervals. The best fluid for this purpose is always water. Water intake at a level of 150-250 ml every 15 minutes depending upon the exercise intensity and environmental conditions, would prevent dehydration. Commercially available sports drinks particularly having sugar levels up to 2% could be taken. Signs of dehydration include dark urine, decreased amount of urine, reduced frequency of urination, rapid heart rate, headache, irritability, and confusion. In sports of weight category, athletes dehydrate themselves for the purpose of reducing weight in order to get placed into lower weight categories, this practice may affect their performance, hence, it should be discouraged. 5.5.7 DURING EXERCISE Dealing with nutritional needs during training is crucial for optimal performance. The main aim during exercise and training should be to maintain water balance, control body temperature, sustain normal blood sugar levels and delay fatigue. In order to maintain fluid balance and normal body temperature during exercise, water that is lost through sweating during exercise needs to be replaced. Even slight dehydration brings in mental and physical fatigue and weakens the performance. During small breaks in the events like in tennis, boxing etc. the consumption of adequate carbohydrate and fluids may be taken care of. In shorter breaks, carbohydrate rich foods like banana, juices, carbohydrate-based drinks (less than 2% concentration) or simply water may be taken. Carbonated beverages, fizzy drinks and drinks that contain caffeine are not recommended. If exercising for more than 60 minutes, carbohydrate-electrolyte beverages like diluted fruit juices containing 5 percent to 8 percent carbohydrates can be ingested. As the duration of high intensity events continues, muscle glycogen levels diminish. Therefore, for endurance athletes, in events lasting longer than two hours, carbohydrate rich solids or liquid meals are recommended during exercise. 5.5.8 POST-TRAINING/COMPETITION Post training or sports competition, recovery of the best body state is required to play or to train the next day to the maximum potential and reduce the chances of injury. The main emphasis during recovery phase must be on the following: h To replace fluids lost during exercise. h To refill carbohydrate stores (muscle and liver glycogen) h To replace electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride) 195 Physical EDUCATION-XII First of all, the fluids lost during exercise must be replaced to restore fluid balance. Because restoration of normal fluid levels takes time, re-hydration needs to begin during exercise and continue after exercise ends. It is recommended that athlete should drink more fluid than is lost because some of the fluid that is taken during recovery is eliminated as urine. Achieving adequate re-hydration before the next training session is crucial for quality training. After exercise fluids should be taken until body returns to its pre-exercise weight or urine is clear or pale colour . Athletes benefit from consuming high carbohydrate foods immediately after ending repeated intervals of intense exercise or prolonged exercise. The body replaces the glycogen energy stores in the muscle within first few hours of exercising. Immediately after an event, refuelling body with some carbohydrates such as juice, fruit, sweet curd or cereal is required. Eating a balanced meal is recommended that includes carbohydrates and good quality protein within two hours after the event. I. Tick the correct option. 1.

Specific motor fitness components include agility, balance, coordination, power, reaction time, and speed. Motor fitness is sometimes referred to as skill-related fitness. 201 Physical EDUCATION-XII Please read the letter above and try to think about few of the questions asked below: I. Why do government and CBSE need to plan for a 'whole school approach to fitness'? II. What will be the fitness test items for Kehlo India Fitness Assessment for school children? 6.1 Fitness Test - SAI Khelo India Fitness Test in School Overview: Fitness defines the ability to perform physical activity, and encompasses a wide range of abilities. Each activity and sports requires a specific set of skills, and so being fit for an activity or a sport does not necessarily make you fit for another. Fitness is generally divided into specific fitness categories or components, and each can be tested and trained individually. The following pages will help you do the Fitness Test Administration in your school more effectively using Khelo India Fitness Assessment App and viewing the School Dashboard on School Interface. BATTERY OF TESTS AGE GROUP 5-8 YEARS | CLASS 1 to 3 At Primary class 1-3, Children should acquire Fundamental Movement Skills (FMS) leaving the learning of specific physical activities to later stages. FMS provide the building blocks for many physical activities, such as playing games, dance, and sport. Locomotor, Manipulative & Body Management abilities are key to success in most sports and physical activities. Abilities of children in class 1-3 which need to be measured and tracked are 1. Body Composition (BMI) 2. Coordination (Plate Tapping) 3. Balance (Flamingo Balance) Which are important for controlling the body in various situations. AGE GROUP: 9-18+ YEARS | CLASS 4 to 12 For Class 4 to 12, It is important for students to have an overall physical fitness. The following Components are to be considered in Physical Health and Fitness Profile: 1. Body Composition (BMI) 2. Strength a. Abdominal (Partial Curl-up) b. Muscular Endurance (Push Ups for Boys, Modified Push Ups for Girls) 202 Physical EDUCATION-XII 3. Flexibility (Sit and Reach Test) 4. Cardiovascular Endurance (600 Meter Run/Walk) 5. Speed (50 mt. Dash) 6.1.1 BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) Purpose: Body Composition refers primarily to the distribution of muscle and fat in the body. Body size such as height, lengths and girths are also grouped under this component. Infrastructure/Equipment Required: Flat and Clean surface, Weighing Machine, Stadiometer/Measuring Tape pasted on a wall Procedure: Measuring Height Accurately Remove the participant's shoes, bulky clothing, and hair ornaments, and unbraid hair that interferes with the measurement. Take the height measurement on flooring that is not carpeted and against a flat surface such as a wall with no moulding. Have the participant stand with feet flat, together, and back against the wall. Make sure legs are straight, arms are at sides, and shoulders are level. Make sure the participant is looking straight ahead and that the line of sight is parallel with the floor. Take the measurement while the participant stands with head, shoulders, buttocks, and heels touching the flat surface (wall). (See illustration.) Depending on the overall body shape of the participant, all points may not touch the wall. Use a flat headpiece to form a right angle with the wall and lower the headpiece until it firmly touches the crown of the head. Make sure the measurer's eyes are at the same level as the headpiece. Lightly mark where the bottom of the headpiece meets the wall. Then, use a metal tape to measure from the base on the floor to the marked measurement on the wall to get the height measurement. Accurately record the height to the nearest 0.1 centimeter. Measuring Weight Accurately Use a digital scale. Avoid using bathroom scales that are springloaded. Place the scale on firm flooring (such as tile or wood) rather than carpet. Have the participant remove shoes and heavy clothing, such as sweaters. Have the participant stand with both feet in the center of the scale. Record the weight to the nearest decimal fraction (for example, 25.1 kilograms).203 Physical EDUCATION-XII Scoring: The test performed is Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated from body Weight (W) and height(H). BMI = W / (H x H), where W = body weight in kilograms and H = height in meters. The higher the score usually indicating higher levels of body fat. Height recorded in cm and mm. Weight will be recorded in kilogram (kg) and grams (gms). Record the weight to the nearest decimal fraction (for example, 25.1 kilograms). Accurately record the height to the nearest 0.1 centimeter. 6.1.2 PLATE TAPPING TEST Purpose: Tests speed and coordination of limb movement Infrastructure/Equipment Required: Table (adjustable height), 2 yellow discs (20cm diameter), rectangle (30 x 20 cm), stopwatch Procedure: If possible, the table height should be adjusted so that the subject is standing comfortably in front of the discs. The two yellow discs are placed with their centers 60 cm apart on the table. The rectangle is placed equidistant between 204 Physical EDUCATION-XII both discs. The non-preferred hand is placed on the rectangle. The subject moves the preferred hand back and forth between the discs over the hand in the middle as quickly as possible. This action is repeated for 25 full cycles (50 taps). Scoring: The time taken to complete 25 cycles is recorded 6.1.3 FLAMINGO BALANCE TEST Purpose: Ability to balance successfully on a single leg. This single leg balance test assesses the strength of the leg, pelvic, and trunk muscles as well as Static balance. Infrastructure/Equipment Required: Non-slippery even surface, Stopwatch, can be done while standing on beam. Procedure: Stand on the beam. Keep balance by holding the instructor's hand (if required to start). While balancing on the preferred leg, the free leg is flexed at the knee and the foot of this leg held close to the buttocks. Start the watch as the instructor lets go of the participant/subject. Pause the stopwatch each time the subject loses balance (either by falling off the beam or letting go of the foot being held). Resume over, again timing until they lose balance. Count the number of falls in 60 seconds of balancing. If there are more than 15 falls in the first 30 seconds, the test is terminated. 205 Physical EDUCATION-XII Scoring: The total number of falls or loss of balance in 60 seconds of balancing is recorded. If there are more than 15 falls in the first 30 seconds, the test is terminated. 6.1.4 AGE GROUP: 9-18+ YEARS | CLASS 4 TO 12 For Class 4 to 12, it is important for students to have an overall physical fitness. The following Components are to be considered in Physical Health and Fitness Profile: 1. Body Composition (BMI) 2. Strength a. Abdominal (Partial Curl-up) b. Muscular Endurance (Push Ups for Boys, Modified Push Ups for Girls) 3. Flexibility (Sit and Reach Test) 4. Cardiovascular Endurance (600 Meter Run/Walk) 5. Speed (50 mt. Dash) 6.1.5 BODY COMPOSITION (BMI) See 6.1.1 6.1.6 ABDOMINAL (PARTIAL CURL-UP) Purpose: The curl up test measures abdominal muscular strength and endurance of the abdominals and hip flexors, important in back support and core stability . Infrastructure/Equipment Required: Flat clean cushioned surface with two parallel strips (6 inches apart), Stopwatch, Recording sheets, Pen Procedure: The subject lies on a cushioned, flat, clean surface with knees flexed, usually at 90 degrees, with hands straight on the sides (palms facing downwards) 206 Physical EDUCATION-XII closer to the ground, parallel to the body. The subject raises the trunk in a smooth motion, keeping the arms in position, curling up the desired amount (at least 6 inches above/along the ground towards the parallel strip). The trunk is lowered back to the floor so that the shoulder blades or upper back touch the floor . Scoring: Record the maximum number of Curl ups in a certain time period (30 seconds). 6.1.7 PUSH UPS (BOYS)/MODIFIED PUSH UPS (GIRLS) Purpose: Upper body strength endurance, and trunk stability. Infrastructure/Equipment Required: Flat clean cushioned surface/Gym mat Procedure: A standard push up begins with the hands and toes touching the floor, the body and legs in a straight line, feet slightly apart, the arms at shoulder width apart, extended and at a right angles to the body. Keeping the back and knees straight, the subject lowers the body to a predetermined point, to touch some other object, or until there is a 90-degree angle at the elbows, then returns back to the starting position with the arms extended. This action is repeated, and the test continues until exhaustion, or until they can do no more in rhythm or have reached the target number of push-ups. For Girls: push-up technique is with the knees resting on the ground.207 Physical EDUCATION-XII Scoring: Record the number of correctly completed pushups. 6.1.8 SIT AND REACH Purpose: Common measure of flexibility, and specifically measures the flexibility of the lower back and hamstring muscles. This test is important because tightness in this area is implicated in lumbar lordosis, forward pelvic tilt and lower back pain. Infrastructure/Equipment Required: Sit and Reach box with the following dimensions: 12\" x 12\" (sides) 12\" x 10\" (front and back) 12\" x 21\" (top). Inscribe the top panel with centimeter/mm gradations. It is crucial that the vertical plane against which the subject's feet will be placed is exactly at the 23 cm mark. Flat clean cushioned surface/Gym Mats Procedure: This test involves sitting on the floor with legs stretched out straight ahead. Shoes should be removed. The soles of the feet are placed flat against the Sit and Reach box. Both knees should be locked and pressed flat to the floor - the tester may assist by holding them down. With the palms facing downwards, and hands on top of each other, the subject reaches forward along the measuring line as far as possible. Ensure that the hands remain at the same level, not one reaching further forward than the other. After some practice reaches, the subject reaches out and holds that position for at one-two seconds while the distance is recorded. Make sure there are no jerky movements.208 Physical EDUCATION-XII Scoring: The score is recorded (difference between initial position and final position), in cm and mm, as the distance reached by the hand. 6.1.9 600 MTR RUN/WALK Purpose: Cardiovascular Fitness/Cardiovascular Endurance Infrastructure/Equipment Required: Stopwatch, whistle, marker cone, lime powder, measuring tape, 200 or 400 mts with 1.22 mt (minimum 1 mt) width preferably on a flat and even playground with a marking of starting and finish line.

The test was originally designed for young men of college age. In the original validation of the step test Brouha tested 2200 males. Purpose: To determine aerobic fitness. Objective: To perform step test continuously without break for 5 minutes or until 211 Physical EDUCATION-XII exhausted. Equipment: Bench or wooden block 20 inches in height; stopwatch; metronome. Procedure: Student will start test at the command \"Go\" and will step up and down, on and off the wooden block or bench at the rate of 30 steps per minutes for 5 minutes. Participant is given instructions that on the command 'up' or the first sound of the metronome, he/she should place one foot on the bench; on the second command 'up' or the second sound of the metronome, he/she should place both feet fully on the bench with the body erect straightening the legs and back. Exactly five minutes of steps, on the signal 'stop', the participant immediately sits down on the bench. If the student is unable to maintain the pace, then she/he is considered to be exhausted and the test is brought to an end before completion of 212 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5min. The tester will note the duration of the exercise in seconds and use short formula. Pulse Count After completion of the test, the student sits down and the tester takes the hearts beats between 1 to 1\u00bd minutes. Scoring: Fitness Index score will be determined by applying following equation: Duration of the Exercise in Seconds x 100 5.5 x Pulse count of 1 1.5 min after Exercise = Fitness Index score Norms for Harvard Step Test Upto 49 Poor 50-80 Average 81 or Above Good Norms Reference: Dr. D. K. Kansal (2008), Textbook of Applied Measurement, Evaluation and Sports Selection, Sports and Spiritual Science Publication, Delhi, ISBN No.8190228234 6.3 Computing Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories needed to maintain body function and resting condition. In another words BMR is the number of calories burnt by the body while performing basic life sustaining functions. That is, a person, who does not engage in any work, still requires energy for the functioning of their internal organs. This energy is called Basal Metabolic Rate. Unit of BMR is calculated in Kcal. There are factors that may affect BMR like Muscle Mass, age, state of mind, Gender, Genetics, Body composition etc. Environment changes like change in heat and cold may change the requirement of the body. Purpose: determine Basal Metabolic Rate Equipment: Stadiometer, Weight machine, Pen and paper Procedure: method to measure height and weight is given at BMI Formula used: The mifflin-St Jeor BMR Equation213 Physical EDUCATION-XII calculation = (10 * weight(kg.)) + (6.25 * height(cm)) - (5 * age) + 5 Female calculation = (10 * body weight(kg.)) + (6.25 * height(cm)) - (5 * age) - 161 Extension Activity Every student will prepare their own profile of fitness testing as per below format.

The test battery consist of four motor stunts are given below: I. Front Roll II. Back Roll III. Jumping Half-Turns IV. Jumping Full- Turns Four stunts are to be performed by the boys and three stunts for girls. Test Area: Mat area length is 15 feet and it is 2 feet wide. The 15 feet length divided in to ten sections for 18\" each. The width of transverse line is \u00be\" and 3\" alternatively. Centre of lines remains 18\" apart. Another \u00be\" wide line is marked lengthwise in the middle of the mat area. Procedure: 1. Front Roll: Ignoring the long middle dividing line, the subject is asked to start outside the marked area and perform two front rolls, one up to 7.5' i.e. 3\" wide centre line and the second in the other half of 7.5'. The subject is to perform the rolls without touching the limits or over reaching the zones mentioned above. Scoring: Each correct roll gets 5 points, hence maximum of 10 points. Two points are deducted for over-reaching side line, right or left for each roll; one point is deducted for over reaching the end limit on each roll and full five points are deducted when the subject fails to perform a true front roll 2. Back Roll: The test is similar to front roll both in performing and scoring. The subject is to start outside the marked chart area and is to 'perform two back rolls in the 2 feet lane area, one up to first half and the second back roll in the second half. 223 Physical EDUCATION-XII 3. Jumping Half Turns: The subject is asked to start with feet on first 3\" line, jump with both feet to second 3\" wide line, executing a half turn either right or left; jump to third 3\" line executing half turn in opposite direction to first half-turn and then to 4th and 5th 3\" wide lines executing half turns, right or left alternatively. Scoring: Perfect execution of four jumps is worth ten points. Only 2 points are deducted for each wrong jump when the subject either does not land with both feet on the 3\" line or turns the wrong way or both. 4. Jumping Full Turns: The subject is asked to start with the feet outside the marked area at about the centre of the lane. He/She is required to jump with feet together to second rectangular space, executing a full turn with the body either right or left; continue jumping to alternate rectangular spaces across the marked mat executing full turns, rotating body in the same direction, landing on both feet every time. Scoring: Perfect execution of five jumps is worth ten points. Two points are deducted, if the subject fails to keep balance on landing on both feet; turns too far or oversteps the squares. I.

In the human body we majorly study skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, digestive, urinary and reproductive systems which are somehow affected by exercises. During exercise, all systems of our body work jointly but responses of these systems are independent. Metabolic system produces energy and takes care of intake and output of energy. Cardiovascular system controls circulation, transports oxygen and energy to muscles and waste products from muscles to kidney. Respiratory system takes in air, diffuses oxygen to lungs and muscle tissue and removes carbon dioxide from body. Neuromuscular and skeletal system allows body movements through muscle contraction. Neuroendocrine and Immune system help to maintain homeostasis of the body. To develop fitness, each component has a different exercise, which is performed with different intensity, and volume, so the responses of systems are different. Here we will study on three major physiological factors that determine the various components of fitness. 7.1.1 SKELETAL MUSCLES FACTOR Skeletal muscles are made up of muscles fibres which are divided into two categories Slow twitch fibres or Type I fibres and Fast twitch fibres or Type II fibres. Mostly muscles contain a mix of both fast and slow twitch fibres and the proportion of theses fibres is dependent on genetics, hormones, and habits of exercises. Composition of fibres in muscles plays a dominant role in development of strength, endurance, and speed performance. Skeletal muscles have four properties contractility, excitability, extensibility, and elasticity. These characteristics present in muscles determine different components of fitness. Slow twitch fibres or Type I fibres or slow oxidative fibres contain large numbers of oxidative enzymes, have more capillaries, higher concentration of myoglobin and mitochondrial enzyme than fast twitch fibres which promote aerobic activity and resistance against fatigue. Due to higher concentration of capillaries the colour of fibres becomes red and has greater supply of blood. Such types of fibres contract at low rate and keep contracting for longer duration without fatigue; thus, producing large amounts of energy slowly. Slow twitch fibres help in long distance running, swimming, cycling etc.229 Physical EDUCATION-XII Fast twitch fibres or Type II fibres or Fast glycolytic fibres contain a good volume of glycolytic enzymes which promote anaerobic activity but due to a smaller number of mitochondria they have limited aerobic capacity and low fatigue resistance. Fast twitch fibres do not require blood supply to produce energy, so their colour is lighter as compared to slow twitch fibre. Such fibres have fast contraction rate, tire rapidly and Type consume lots of energy, and can produce small amount of energy quickly. Fast twitch muscle fibre helps in anaerobic activities like jumps, throws, sprint etc. Muscles fibres play a dominant role in sports performance. Regular training can change the proportion of slow and fast twitch fibres. There are variations of types of fibres among athletes participating in the same sports also Sprinters generally have a higher percentage of Type II fibres and a lower percentage of Type I fibres, while endurance athletes have a higher percentage of Type I fibres and a lower percentage of Type II fibres. The amount of force generated through muscle contraction depends on the number and types of motor units, length of muscles, nature of neural stimulation of the motor units and contractile history of muscle. Do you Know? Sports Slow Twitch Fibre Fast Twitch Fibre Long Distance Runners 70 to 80 % 20 to 30 % Sprinters 25 to 30 % 70 to 75 % Non-Athletes 48 to 52 % 48 to 52 % 7.1.2 ENERGY PRODUCTION FACTOR Cellular respiration is a process in which ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) is formed through food. Main source of energy in food is in form of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Each has different complex chemical process to form ATP energy. During exercise, the load on the metabolic system increases manifold because of increase in the demand of energy by different systems. In this process, carbohydrates give instant energy as compared to fats and proteins, but fats give a larger amount of energy as compared to carbohydrates and proteins. Higher intensity aerobic activity requires carbohydrates in the form of glucose and glycogen as fuel.230 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? Metabolism: is the process of overall energy transformations occurring in the body. Anabolism: is the process where the simple molecules combine to generate complex molecules: Catabolism: is the process of breakdown of food and stores to produce energy for work. Carbohydrates work as a fuel for short duration exercise, fats are utilized for long duration exercises and proteins contribute a small but important proportion of nourishment. Basically, three energy system works in our body ATP-CP (Creatine phosphate) system, anaerobic system, and aerobic system. ATP- CP system provides energy if the activity is less than 10 second. Such activities are dynamic in nature and of very short duration and very intensive. They include jumps, throws, sprints, weightlifting, powerlifting etc. Anaerobic system provides energy for less than two minutes, in activities like 200m, 400m races. Aerobic system provides energy for long duration activities like marathon, football, hockey etc. Aerobic and anaerobic systems work simultaneously, but which system is predominant depends upon type, duration, intensity of exercise, long and short-term nutritional status, proportions of types of muscle fibres etc. 7.1.3 CARDIORESPIRATORY FACTOR The Cardiorespiratory system is combination of respiratory and cardiovascular systems which jointly work to transport oxygen to the cells and support metabolism by delivering nutrients, which provide energy to neuromuscular system and neuroendocrine system. During exercise, the demand for energy increases and to meet the demand, oxygen is required in appropriate volume to achieve the same. Demand of energy depends on intensity, duration, and type of activity. To match the same, the respiratory system -- pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration work together. The cardiovascular response to exercise is directly proportional to the demands of the skeletal muscles for Oxygen. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 Max), Blood pressure, blood volume, oxygen diffusion and extraction, muscle and arterial blood flow etc. simultaneously increase as per activity.231 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? In games where ATP-CP system or anaerobic system works to produce energy for strength training. Stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart during each systolic cardiac contraction) is a vital parameter as far as cardiovascular system is concerned 7.1.4 PHYSICAL FITNESS COMPONENTS DETERMINED BY THE PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS Now we will understand how the above-mentioned physiological factors determine fitness. We have taken four components of physical fitness namely strength, endurance, speed and flexibility. Strength - Strength is the ability of the body to work against resistance and has varied sub-types such as Maximum Strength, Explosive Strength, Strength, Endurance etc. Each has different types of exercise, intensity and duration so physiological factors vary. Different sports require different amount of strength and according to that, mixture of the slow twitch fibre and fast twitch fibre is needed. Generally in all the strength related sports where sudden burst of energy is required, high percentage of fast twitch fibre is required. In games like weightlifting, jumps, sprint or power, agility and strength dominating sports where force production is high, fatigue is quick, and fast twitch fibre percentage must be high in muscles. 232 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? Nameirakpam Kunjarani Devi (born 1 March 1968) is the most decorated Indian sportswoman in weightlifting. She is a recipient of Arjuna Award, Padma Shri and Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna. Endurance: Endurance is the ability of the body to work for a longer period without getting fatigued. Endurance also varies from brisk walk to running to marathon. While in each activity intensity and duration varies, but one thing is common in all these activities: that is long duration and low fatigue activity. Activities like cycling, swimming or long duration activities come under endurance component. Slow twitch fibre percentage must be higher in comparison with fast twitch fibres to give better performance in endurance. Aerobic system provides energy in endurance training. Maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2), ventilation capacity plays dominating role in endurance training. Speed: Speed is the ability to cover maximum distance in shortest period. In speed training percentage of fast twitch fibres is very high in muscles, these activities include 100m race, roller skating, or any movements that require work to be done in minimum possible time. A vital physiological factor to give best speed performance is motor neuron stimulation. The brain sends a message to the muscles to act fast. To meet the demand of energy, the ATP CP system works. 233 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? In 100 m sprint event: The current men's world record is 9.58 seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women's world record of 10.49 seconds set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 remains unbroken. Flexibility: It is the ability of muscle and tendons to lengthen without getting damaged. Activities of stretching or yoga require a good deal of flexibility. Physiological factors like elasticity and extendibility of muscles, type of joint, homothermic temperature are key determinants of flexibility. Muscles, tendons, and ligaments are key components that affect flexibility. Muscles groups like agonists, antagonists, neutralizers, and stabilizers should be understood for training purpose. Agonists are the muscles which contract to perform a certain action. Antagonists are muscles which oppose the prime movers as they relax and lengthen progressively to allow agonists to move. Synergists are muscles that work together in a close cooperation as they either contract or relax to modify the action of the agonist. Synergists include Conjoint, Neutralizer and Stabilizer muscles. Do you know? Aerobic Exercise is any type of cardiovascular conditioning. It can include activities like brisk walking, swimming, running, or cycling. You probably know it as \"cardio.\" By definition, aerobic exercise means \"with oxygen.\" Your breathing and heart rate will increase during aerobic activities. Anaerobic Exercise is any activity that breaks down glucose for energy without using oxygen. Generally, these activities are of short length with high intensity. The idea is that a lot of energy is released within a small period of time, and your oxygen demand surpasses the oxygen supply. ATP The Full form of ATP is Adenosine Triphosphate. ATP is a complex organic chemical that provides energy to drive many processes in living cells, eg., nerve impulse propagation, muscle contraction, and chemical synthesis ATP-PCr Known also as immediate energy system, phosphagen system, and alactic anaerobic system, the ATP - PCr system is the main energy provider for a high intensity exercise of short duration up to 10 seconds, for example lifting a weight, swinging a golf club, doing a push - up, and throwing a hammer234 Physical EDUCATION-XII Myoglobin a red iron-containing protein pigment in muscles that is similar to haemoglobin Mitochondrion any of various round or long cellular organelles of most eukaryotes that are found outside the nucleus, produce energy for the cell through cellular respiration, and are rich in fats, proteins, and enzymes Extension Activity Think of an activity/exercise you would suggest for improving Muscular strength _________________________________ Power _________________________________ Speed _________________________________ Muscular endurance _________________________________ Agility _________________________________ Flexibility _________________________________ I.

Explain Physiological factors determining fitness. 7.2 Effect of Exercise on Muscular System Exercise involves a series of sustained muscle contractions, of either long or short duration, depending on the nature of the physical activity. Effects of exercise on muscles can be considered short-term or immediate, both during and shortly after exercise; as well as long-term, lasting effects.236 Physical EDUCATION-XII Effect of Exercises on Muscular System Short Term Increased blood supply Increased Muscle temperature Increased Muscle flexibility Accumulation of Lactate Micro tears in muscle fibersIncrease in glycogen storage Increase in oxidation/ metabolism Increase in lactate acid toleranceIncrease in myoglobin storagestrength of ligaments and tendons Increase in size and number of mitochondriaHypertrophy of Muscle Increases inLong term Short Term Effect of Exercises on Muscular system Increased blood supply: During exercise, in order to match demand of fuel to muscle, the supply or concentration of blood increases in the whole body or, in the particular muscle group where activity is largely impacted.237 Physical EDUCATION-XII Increased muscle temperature: During exercises muscles demand energy, which comes from contracting muscles. During the process, a lot of heat energy is generated which increases the temperature of muscles, and/ or the body. Increased muscle flexibility: Due to increase in blood flow and rise in temperature, elasticity of muscles increases. Stretching and mobility exercises also play a dominant role in increasing muscular flexibility. Accumulation of Lactate: Muscles requires oxygen. If blood supply does not provide appropriate volume of oxygen to muscles, it leads to accumulation of lactate acid in muscles which result in pain, and soreness in muscles. Micro-tears in Muscle Fibres: During exercises muscle tissue is placed under stress which results in micro-tears in muscle fibres. The body responds by repairing the muscle fibres and making them larger. When a muscle gets bigger, this process is called hypertrophy. 238 Physical EDUCATION-XII Long term effects of Exercise on Muscular system Hypertrophy of Muscle: Scientific and systematic exercise leads to increase in thickness of muscle fibres that results in increase in muscle size also known as muscle hypertrophy. Increase in Strength of Ligaments and Tendons: regular exercise helps to strengthen bones, ligaments, and tendons. This helps prevent injury and promotes performance. Increase in Size and Number of Mitochondria: Aerobic exercises leads to increase in size and numbers of mitochondria, and which take in more oxygen and produce more ATP and energy. Increase in Myoglobin Storage: Long term effect of aerobic exercise is to increase the storage of myoglobin which transports oxygen to mitochondria. Large amount of myoglobin means large amount of oxygen and large amount of energy . Increase in Glycogen Storage: Glycogen is generally stored in muscles and liver. Regular exercise helps the body to increase the storage of glycogen which may give continuous energy for 90 to 120 minutes. Increase in Oxidation/ Metabolism: Endurance exercise training increases the capacity of skeletal muscle fat oxidation by increasing mitochondrial density. Long term exercises demand a lot of energy, and to meet this demand, metabolism increases due to oxidation of fat. This leads to increase in provision of energy. Increase in Lactate Acid Tolerance: Regular exercises help to tolerate pain and sourness in muscles due to accumulation of lactate acid. I. Tick the correct answers: 1. Which is not a long term effects of exercise on muscular system? a. Hypertrophy of muscle b. Increased metabolism c. Increased Myoglobin d. Increased blood supply 2. Which is not a short term effects of exercise on muscular system? a. Accumulation of Lactate b. Micro-tears in muscle fibers239 Physical EDUCATION-XII c. Increase muscle temperature d. Increase in lactate acid tolerance 3. Physical activity helps to increase ________________________. a. size of muscle b. size of bone c. size of brain d. size of liver 4. Increase in glycogen stored in muscle is an effect of __________ a. Aerobic Training b. Anaerobic Training c. Cross Training d. Multi traning II. Answer the following questions briefly: 1. Explain long term effects of exercise on muscular system 2. Explain short term effects of exercise on muscular system III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words: 1. Describe the various effects of exercises on muscular system 7.3 Effect of Exercise on Cardiorespiratory System Cardiorespiratory system consists of two parts. They are Cardiovascular System Respiratory SystemCardiorespiratory Cardiovascular system - It consists of three parts: the heart, blood vessels and blood. Its major function is to deliver oxygen and nutrients, remove CO2 and other metabolic waste products, to transport hormones and other molecules, to support thermoregulation and control of body fluid balance and lastly to regulate immune function.240 Physical EDUCATION-XII Respiratory system - The important parts of the respiratory system are the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Air can also enter the respiratory system through the oral cavity. Its major functions include, transporting air to the lungs, exchanging gases (O2 and CO2) between the air and blood, and regulating blood pH. 7.3.1 EFFECT OF EXERCISE ON CARDIOVASCULAR Effects of Exercise on Cardiovascular System Short Term Increase in Heart rate Increased blood circulationBlood volume increases Blood flow increases Blood pressure increases Stroke volume increases Cardiac output increases Increase in capillaries networkNormal blood pressure Increase in stroke volume and cardiac outputResting Heart rate decreasesLow level of accumulation of Lactic acidSize and strength of Heart increasesLong Term241 Physical EDUCATION-XII Short Term Effects of Exercise on Cardiovascular System Increased Heart Rate: Exercise makes the body work harder and therefore muscles require more oxygen to continue to work effectively. This sudden increase in demand of oxygen is met by an increase in blood circulation which is achieved by the heart. In this process, the heart rate increases. Increased Blood Circulation: As the heart rate increases, blood circulation increases in the body to deliver the oxygen to muscles. As a result, the movement or flow of blood increases to tissues or organs. Increased: Endurance exercise leads to increase in systolic blood pressure which is in direct proportion to the increase in exercise intensity. The increased systolic blood pressure is because of the increased cardiac output that accompanies increasing rates of work. With most types of training there is minimal change in diastolic blood pressure. Increased Stroke Volume: The volume of blood pumped during one beat (contraction) is called stroke volume. During exercise, stroke volume increases as more oxygen is required. This is accomplished by delivering blood to muscles. After an endurance training programme capacity of heart to pump blood in one contraction increased by 20 to 50 percent. Increased Cardiac Output: Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in 1 minute. It is the product of the heart rate (HR) and the stroke volume (SV). Resting cardiac output is approximately 5.0 L/min but differs according to the size of the person. Maximal cardiac output varies between less than 20 L/min in sedentary individuals to 40 or more L/min in elite endurance athletes. Increase in heart rate and stroke volume results in increase in cardiac output. Long Term Effects of Exercise on Cardiovascular System Increased Size and Strength of Heart: Continuous aerobic exercises help to increase the strength and the size of heart which helps in better performance. It is also referred as cardiac hypertrophy. Low Level of Accumulation of Lactic Acid: Anaerobic respiration is the process of converting glucose into energy without oxygen. During the conversion from glucose to energy, lactic acid, a waste product, is created. Lactic acid makes muscles tired and painful. Regular exercises prepare muscles to adjust to working with lower levels of oxygen and the circulatory system develops itself to transport oxygen to 242 Physical EDUCATION-XII different parts of the body, thereby resulting in low levels of lactic acid. Extension Activity Discuss in your group The heart is an important part of the cardiovascular system. What can you do to keep your heart healthy? What should you avoid doing? What can happen if the cardiovascular system becomes unhealthy? Your heart is a muscle about the size of your fist. Compare it to other muscles. Can you control it like you do the muscles in your arms or legs? Can you exercise it like you do other muscles? Decrease in Resting Heart Rate: Due to improved efficiency of the heart, it is required to pump less blood to meet the needs of the body. As a result, the heart rate at rest decreases. It is also called as Bradycardia. Normal Blood Pressure: In response to endurance training, there can be substantial reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Regular exercise helps keep the blood pressure normal. Increase in Stroke Volume and Cardiac Output: Since the size and strength of the heart increases, heart pumps blood more efficiently with increase in stoke volume and cardiac output. Increase in Capillaries Network: To achieve the demand for oxygen, capillaries network increases. Due to the demands placed on different parts of the body during exercise, the capillary density at muscle sites improves. Increased capillary density allows for greater oxygen being transported to the muscles, improving their ability to perform intense exercise. Moreover, exercise helps in preventing the decline in capillary function that happens with age. 243 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are the pulmonary and umbilical veins, both of which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. 7.3.2 Effect of Exercise on Respiratory System Effects of exercise on Respiratory system Short Term Respiratory rate increases Tidal volume increases Rate of exchange of gas increasesPulmonary diffusion increases Residual volume increasesLung volume IncreasesEfficiency of respiratory muscles increasesLong Term244 Physical EDUCATION-XII Extension Activity W Working in groups, create a working model of lungs. W Research respiratory diseases and how they affect the function of the respiratory system. W Can you alter your model to show what happens to the lungs with these diseases? W Can you demonstrate on their models what has been done to help peo - ple with respiratory problems? Short Term Effects of Exercise in Respiratory System Respiratory Rate Increases: Our body requires more oxygen during exercise, and to meet this increased demand, the respiratory rate (breathing rate) increases. The normal respiration rate for an adult at rest is 12 to 20 breaths per minute, but during exercise it increases to 40 breaths per minutes. Tidal Volume Increases: The amount of air inhaled and exhaled in one breath is known as tidal volume. Tidal volume increases as a result of exercise to take in more oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from our body. Rate of Exchange of Gas Increases: Regular exercise increases the rate of exchange of gas in lungs. Long Term Effects of Exercise in Respiratory System Increased Efficiency of Respiratory Muscles: Due to regular exercise efficiency of respiratory muscles increases, inhalation and exhalation become fluent. This helps to meet the demand of oxygen. Increased Lung volume: Continuous exercises done for long duration help to increase the capacity and volume of lungs. Vital capacity increases almost 100 % as compared to that of a normal individual. Increased Pulmonary Diffusion: Pulmonary Diffusion refers to the capacity of the lungs to allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass in and out of the blood. Regular sub-maximal exercise training develops the scope of increasing the exchange of gases, and in this process the size of the alveoli also increases. Increased Residual Volume: Residual volume is the volume of air that remains in the lungs after forceful expiration. Regular exercise increases residual volume that helps to exchange the gases in normal limits.245 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? Universal donors are those with an O negative blood type. Why? O negative blood can be used in transfusions for any blood type. Types O negative and O positive are in high demand. Only 7% of the populations are O negative. However, the need for O negative blood is the highest because it is used most often during emergencies. The need for O+ is high because it is the most frequently occurring blood type (37% of the population). I. Tick the correct options 1.

Stroke volume 7.4 Physiological Changes Due to Ageing Ageing, an inevitable and extremely complex multifactorial process, is characterized by the progressive degeneration of organ systems and tissues. It is largely determined by genetics, and influenced by a wide range of environmental factors, such as diet, exercise, exposure to micro-organisms and pollutants. Neural FunctionMuscular Strength Body CompositionCardiovascular Function Bone Function Endocrine ChangesPhysiological Changes Due to Ageing247 Physical EDUCATION-XII Muscular Strength - It is defined as the maximal force that a muscle or muscle group can generate. Men and women usually attain their highest strength levels between ages 20 and 40, the time when muscle cross-sectional area is largest. Concentric strength of most muscle groups declines, slowly at first and then more rapidly after middle age. Decline in eccentric strength begins at a later age and progresses more slowly than those in concentric strength. Strength loss begins at a later age for women than for men. A 40% to 50% reduction in muscle mass from muscle fibre atrophy and actual loss of motor units between ages 25 and 80 is the primary cause of reduced strength, even among healthy, physically active men and women. Neural Function - A nearly 40% decline in the number of spinal cord axons and a 10% decline in nerve conduction velocity reflects the cumulative effects of ageing on central nervous system functioning. These changes are likely to contribute to the age-related reduction in neuromuscular performance assessed by simple and complex reaction and movement times. Ageing most adversely affects the time required to detect a stimulus and process the information to produce the response. Endocrine Changes with Ageing - The endocrine system consists of a host organ (gland), minute quantities of chemical messengers (hormones), and a target or receptor organ. Approximately 40% of individuals aged between 65 and 75 years and 50% of those older than age 80 have impaired glucose tolerance leading to Type 2 diabetes. Thyroid dysfunction, primarily from lowered pituitary gland release of the thyroid-stimulating hormone thyrotropin (and reduced output of thyroxine), is common among the elderly. This directly affects metabolic function, including decreased glucose metabolism and protein synthesis. Mean pulse amplitude, duration, and fraction of secreted growth hormone (GH) gradually decrease with ageing, a condition termed somatopause. Pulmonary Function - Mechanical constraints on the pulmonary system progress with age to cause deterioration in static and dynamic lung function measures. Also, pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange kinetics during the transition from rest to submaximal exercise slow substantially. Cardiovascular Function - Cardiovascular function and aerobic capacity do not escape age-related effects. Because of a lower maximum heart rate, maximum cardiac output typically decreases with age in trained and untrained men and women. Reduced peripheral blood flow capacity accompanies age-related decreases in muscle mass. Sedentary living produces losses in functional capacity at least as great as the effects of ageing.248 Physical EDUCATION-XII Body Composition - In physical fitness, body composition is used to describe the percentages of fat, bone, water, and muscle in human bodies. After age 60, total body mass decreases despite increasing body fat. Bone Mass- Bone Mass is a measure of the amount of minerals (mostly calcium and phosphorous) contained in a certain volume of bone. Osteoporosis poses a major problem with ageing, particularly among postmenopausal women. In this condition it produces loss of bone mass as the ageing skeleton demineralizes and becomes porous. Bone mass can decrease by 30% to 50% in persons older than age 60. Do you know? Oldest woman who lived on earth was Jeanne Calmenta from France (born on 21 February 1875, died on 4 August 1997, lived for 122 years, 164 days). Oldest man to have lived on earth was Jiroemon Kimura from Japan (born on 19 April 1897, died on 12 June 2013, lived for 116 years, 54 days). I. Tick the correct answers: 1.

Describe the changes in endocrine system due to ageing. 7.5 Sports Injuries Sports participation and exercise engagement have always witnessed an interruption among athletes towards active participation or lead to painful experience due to some or the other form of injuries. The injuries may be due to incorrect movement, hitting or colliding with equipment or aggressive sporting actions like diving and sliding, overtraining or lack of conditioning. All these injuries caused due to different reasons may not be of the same type, which means they may need different remedies and specific understanding towards each injury to avoid and prevent such injuries. The injury in sports and exercise refers to the physical damage caused to tissue, bone, or any other organ of the body while in action and further leading to withdrawal from participation or experience pain while performing movement actions. Definitions An athletic injury is defined as \"some physical damage or insult to the body that occurs during athletic practice or competition causing a resultant loss of capacity or impairing performance.\" Morris (1984)5 A sports injury may be defined as damage to the tissues of the body that occurs as a result of sport or exercise. IOC Manual of Sports Injuries (2012)6250 Physical EDUCATION-XII Sports injury may be defined as any stress or overstretch put on soft tissues or bone on or off the field resulting in pain and hindering performance. Cut, tear, overstretching of tissues, breakage of bone or dislocation of joints are common injuries in sports. The injuries that occur during sport, athletic activities or during certain exercises. 7.5.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SPORTS INJURIES Sports Injuries can be classified according to the cause of the injury: Direct Injuries: They are sustained from an external force causing injury at a point of contact. Indirect Injuries: It usually involves the athlete damaging the soft tissues such as ligaments tendons or muscles of the body through internal or external force. Soft Tissue Injuries: Any injuries to skin muscles or ligaments are soft tissue injuries. Hard Tissue Injuries: Injuries that occur in bones and cartilages. Overuse Injuries: They are sustained from continuous or repetitive stress, incorrect technique, or equipment or too much training. Extension Activity Working in groups discuss Have you ever had a sports injury? How did you get it? Are there any ways for fellow athletes to avoid similar injuries? Why is it important to take time to heal after a sports injury? Why is it not a good idea to ignore any pain that you feel while playing a sport? Why should you warm up before playing a sport? What can happen if you don't warm up?251 Physical EDUCATION-XII 7.5.2 TYPES OF SPORTS INJURIES Injuries Types Skin injuriesAbrasion - injury caused by falling on rough or firm surface. Laceration - tears in the skin. Incision - cut caused by a sharp edge of an object. Puncture wound - wound caused by piercing by a sharp and pointed object. Avulsion - tearing away of a part of the skin. Soft tissue injuries (eg., muscles, ligaments)Contusion - bruise caused by a direct blow to some part of the body. eg., knee of a player knocks against the thigh of another person. Sprain - injury of ligament of joints, caused by the violent overstretching of ligament in a joint or the movement of the joint in abnormal directions. It is characterised by pain, tenderness, swelling at the joint. Strain - injury of muscle or tendon, three types- mild, moderate, severe.252 Physical EDUCATION-XII Joint injuriesJoint injuries are very common in sports. They are known as joint dislocation. \"Dislocation is the displacement of contiguous surfaces of two or more bones which are in a joint.\" It is caused by an external force which forces the joint to move beyond the limits of a joint. If the joint is forced to move in an abnormal direction, this dislocation can be a complete or a partial displacement of the bones. Bone injuriesFractures (Fracture is a break in the continuity of the bone). The fractures can be open/compound fracture or a closed/ simple fracture. Severity of the fracture varies from a mild crack in the bone to the severe shattering of the bone into many pieces. 7.5.3 SOFT TISSUE INJURIES A soft tissue injury is the damage of muscles, ligaments and tendons throughout the body. Type of soft tissue injuries Abrasion Contusion Laceration Strain Sprain Incision Abrasion Abrasion injuries most commonly occur due to moving contact with a rough surface, causing a grinding, or rubbing away of the upper superficial layers of the epidermis. Cause - Abrasion injuries commonly occur when exposed skin encounters a rough surface, causing a grinding or rubbing away of the upper layers of epidermis. 253 Physical EDUCATION-XII Treatment - Clean the surface of the affected part. Stop bleeding at the earliest by compression bandages. Anti-tetanus injection should be provided. Contusion It is the type of hematoma, which refers to any collection of blood outside of a vessel. Cause - When a part of the body is struck by enough force to crush underlying muscle fibres and connective tissue without breaking the skin, a contusion may occur. It can be due to a blow from a collision with a player or a piece of equipment or because of a heavy fall. Prevention - All the safety gear to be worn upon while playing (Helmet, anal guards,) should be worn. Treatment - Non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen, or other medications for pain relief as prescribed by the doctor. Laceration The irregular tear-like wounds caused by some blunt trauma. Cause - Mostly, laceration is the result of the skin hitting an adjacent object, or an object hitting the skin with force. Prevention - Proper personal equipment, including eye protection can be helpful in preventing the same.254 Physical EDUCATION-XII Treatment - Clean the surface of the effected part. Stop bleeding at the earliest by compression bandages. Strain Strain is an injury to the muscles which are attached to a bone. A strain is an injury to either a muscle or a tendon generally caused by overuse, force, or stretching. Depending on the severity of the injury, a strain may be a simple overstretch of the muscle or tendon, or it can result in a partial or complete tear. A strain could be an acute or chronic soft tissue injury that is a twist, pull or tear of a muscle or the tendon. Cause - Strains occur suddenly (acute strain) or develop slowly over time (chronic strain). Causes include lifting of heavy objects, running, jumping, throwing etc. Prevention - Regular stretching and strengthening exercise for any kind of sport can be the preventive measure for strain. Treatment - It can be managed by applying ice packs and maintaining the strained muscle in a stretched position. (RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation). 255 Physical EDUCATION-XII Sprain Sprain is the stretching or tearing of ligaments, the fibrous tissue that connects bones in the joints. A sprain occurs when you overextend or tear a ligament while surely stressing a joint. The most common location for a sprain is in your ankle. Cause - A sprain occurs when one overextends or tears a ligament while severely straining a joint. Prevention - Regular stretching and strengthening exercises for any kind of sport can be the preventive measure for such kind of sports injury. Treatment - RICE (rest, ice, compression and elevation). Incision An incision is a cut made into the tissues of the body to expose the underlying tissue, bone or organ. Cause - Can be caused by a clean, sharp-edged object - such as a knife, razor or glass splinter. Prevention - The area should be free from the sharp edges. Treatment - Gently wash the affected area with soap and water to remove the dirt. Dry the incision with a clean, fresh towel before applying the dressing. 256 Physical EDUCATION-XII 7.5.4 HARD TISSUE INJURIES An injury to the skeletal system of the body is termed as the hard tissue injury. They are the injuries where the bone fractures, ie., the bone either cracks or breaks. Fractures: Stress fractures Greenstick Commutated Transverse Oblique ImpactedTypes of hard tissue injuries Dislocation Dislocation Dislocations are joint injuries that force the ends of bones out of position. The cause is often a fall or a blow, sometimes from playing a contact sport. A joint dislocation, also called luxation, occurs when there is an abnormal separation in the joint, where two or more bones meet. A partial dislocation is referred to as a subluxation. Dislocation can be caused by a trauma (accident or fall) or the weakening of muscles and tendons. A dislocated joint can be treated through medication, manipulation, rest or surgery. Causes - Trauma that forces a joint out of place causes a dislocation. Accidents, falls, and contact sports such as football are common causes of this injury. Dislocations also occur during regular activities when the muscles and tendons surrounding the joint are weak. These injuries happen more often in older people who have weaker muscles and balance issues. Symptoms - Symptoms of a dislocation vary depending on the severity and location of the injury. The symptoms of a dislocated joint include: h Pain h Swelling h Bruising h Instability of the joint257 Physical EDUCATION-XII h Loss of ability to move the joint h Visibly deformed joint (bone looks out of place) Treatment - Treatment can vary based on the severity of the injury, and the joint that is dislocated. Applying ice and keeping the joint elevated can help reduce pain while you wait to see a doctor. Treatment includes: Medication: Your doctor may recommend medication to reduce pain from a dislocation Manipulation: A doctor returns the bones to their proper places. Rest: Once the joint is back in place, you may need to protect it and keep it immobile. Using a sling or splint can help the area heal fully. Rehabilitation: Physical therapy exercises strengthen the muscles and ligaments around the joint to help support it. Surgery: Your doctor may recommend surgery if: manipulation does not work to put the bones back in place. the dislocation damaged blood vessels or nerves. the dislocation damaged bones, tore muscles or ligaments that need repair . Fractures A fracture is a break in a bone. Fractures are caused by a direct impact, such as a fall or a severe tackle. Stress fractures develop over time and are caused by overuse.258 Physical EDUCATION-XII Stress fracture Stress fractures may occur because of overuse injuries and the failure to have adequate equipment to protect the body. Causes - Stress fractures often result from increasing the amount or intensity of an activity too quickly. Prevention - Low impact activities added to exercise regimen to avoid repetitively stressing a particular part of the body. Treatment - Rest, cold therapy ice packs, cold compresses, apply ice to the injured area, anti- inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen, aspirin etc and a recovery time of 6 to 8 weeks is required for healing. Greenstick A fracture in a young, soft bone, in which the bone bends. Causes - These fractures most commonly occur with a fall. Prevention - Promotion of regular exercise, ensuring the child's safety by providing proper safety equipment and adequate calcium in the child's diet can also help to prevent this kind of fracture. Treatment - Removable splints result in better outcomes than casting in children with - Torus fractures of the distal radius. 259 Physical EDUCATION-XII Comminuted A fracture in which a bone is broken, splinted, or crushed into number of pieces. Causes - Direct and indirect trauma or violence can be causes for commutated fracture. Prevention - Maintaining strong bones by eating food that is rich in calcium and regular exercise can help in the prevention of this type of fracture. Treatment - An X-ray is important for diagnosing of the condition. An open reduction when the bone fragments are jammed-together using surgical nails, wire plates etc. is required for comminuted fracture. Transverse Transverse fracture is when there is a straight break right across a bone. Causes - When a large amount of force is transmitted directly i.e., perpendicularly to the bone. Prevention - Physical activity and weight bearing exercises will make the bones stronger and denser. Bones can also be strengthened by eating foods rich in calcium and taking regular exercise. Treatment - Can be treated at home along with rest and medicine. A back brace (called TSL) or abdominal binder may be prescribed to reduce the pain by limiting motion at the fracture site. 260 Physical EDUCATION-XII Oblique Oblique fracture is one in which the bone breaks diagonally. Causes - This fracture is usually caused by an injury to the bone as the result of a fall, accident, or other trauma. Prevention - Bones can be strengthened by eating food rich in calcium and exercising regularly to help prevent this type of fracture. Treatment - It depends upon the severity of the crack or break. Anti- inflammatory medication, reduction (Resetting the bone) can also help to some extent. Extension activity Write down the examples of dislocation and fracture on the various body parts and its treatment. Impacted This type of fracture occurs when the broken ends of the bones are jammed together by the force of the injury. Causes - It is caused mainly when someone falls from height with a great impact. Prevention - Increased physical activity, weight bearing exercises and maintaining good intake of calcium in food can help in preventing this type of fracture. Treatment - In an impacted fracture the bones get broken into fragments. Therefore, a sling or a splint may be required to keep the broken bones in place, so that movement of the sharp ends of the broken bone is prevented. This is essential to prevent further damage to the bone.261 Physical EDUCATION-XII I. Tick the correct answers: 1. A sprain is an injury to: a. Muscle b. Tendon c. Ligament d. Bone 2.

When the famous free-kick happened, physicists from all around the world were baffled by the images. That goal was the catalyst for many studies and analyses about aerodynamics and the ball's curve that day at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon. One of the most famous studies was conducted by four French scientists -- Guillaume Dupeux, Anne Le Goff, David Quere, and Christophe Clanet -- and published in the New Journal of Physics in September 2010. In this study, the physicists conduct a 266 Physical EDUCATION-XII series of experiments and analysis, resulting in an equation that explains the ball's trajectory and all the forces in action at that precise moment. This is what they wrote. \"The case of soccer, where is twice as small as L, is worth commenting on. The ball trajectory can deviate significantly from a circle, provided the shot is long enough. Then the trajectory becomes surprising and somehow unpredictable for a goalkeeper,\" \"This is the way we interpret a famous goal by the Brazilian player Roberto Carlos against France in 1997. This free kick was shot from a distance of approximately 35 metres, that is, comparable to the distance for which we expect this kind of unexpected trajectory. Provided that the shot is powerful enough, another characteristic of Roberto Carlos' abilities, the ball trajectory brutally bends towards the net, at a velocity still large enough to surprise the keeper.\" Dupeux, Le Goff, Quere, and Clanet conclude that if the correct calculations were made, and the distances and forces were repeated, the famous goal could be replicated by another player. This, however, is impossible, in the opinion of one of Brazil's most influential physicists. He describes Roberto Carlos' masterpiece as a \"football miracle.\" \"Although physics explains perfectly the ball's trajectory, the conditions at that moment, such as the power of the kick, the point of impact of Roberto Carlos' foot on the ball, and the distance to the goal, were so rare that we can call that a miracle,\" says professor Luis Fernando Fontanari of Sao Roberto Carlos Physics Institute, a branch of the University of Sao Paulo -- the most respected university in the country. 267 Physical EDUCATION-XII Fontanari is one of the editors of \"Physics of Life Reviews\" and \"Theory in Biosciences,\" two of the most important scientific journals in the world. He adds that if the ball hadn't stopped in the net, it would have continued in the air, drawing an incredible spiral trajectory, as the image above shows. \"I don't believe we will see something like that happening again,\" Fontanari said. Israeli scientist Erez Garty also theorized about Roberto Carlos' kick. In a YouTube video, he gave a lesson for \"physics dummies,\" which explains the magic. The transcript is as follows1: In 1997, in a game between France and Brazil, a young Brazilian player named 'Roberto Carlos set up a 35-meter free-kick. Carlos attempted the seemingly impossible with no direct line to the goal. His kick sent the ball flying wide of the players, but before going out of bounds, it hooked to the left and soared into the goal. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object will move in the same direction and velocity until a force is applied. When Carlos kicked the ball, he gave it direction and velocity, but what force made the ball swerve and score one of the most magnificent goals in its history? The trick was in the spin. Carlos placed his kick at the lower right corner of the ball, sending it high and to the right and rotating around its axis. The ball started its flight in a direct route, with air flowing on both sides and slowing it down. On one side, the air moved in the opposite direction to the ball's spin, causing increased pressure, while on the other, the air moved in the same direction as the spin, creating an area of lower pressure. That difference made the ball curve towards the lower pressure zone. This phenomenon is called the Magnus effect. This type of kick, often referred to as a banana kick, is attempted regularly, and it is one of the elements that makes the beautiful game beautiful. But curving the ball with the precision needed to bend around the wall and back into the goal is difficult. Too high, and it soars over the goal. Too low, and it hits the ground before curving. Too wide, and it never reaches the goal. Not wide enough, and the defenders intercept it. Too slow, and it hooks too early, or not at all. Too fast, and it hooks too late. The same physics make it possible to score another impossible goal, an unassisted corner kick. The Magnus effect was first documented by Sir Isaac Newton after noticing it while playing a game of tennis back in 1670. It also applies to golf balls, frisbees, and 268 Physical EDUCATION-XII baseballs. In every case, the same thing happens. The ball's spin creates a pressure differential in the surrounding airflow that curves it in the direction of the spin. And here's a question. Could you theoretically kick a ball hard enough to make it boomerang all the way around back to you? Sadly, no. Even if the ball didn't disintegrate on impact, or hit any obstacles, as the air slowed it, the angle of its deflection would increase, causing it to spiral into smaller and smaller circles until finally stopping. And to get that spiral, you'd have to make the ball spin over 15 times faster than Carlos's immortal kick. So, think again2 Introduction Biomechanics is the science of movement of a living body, including how muscles, bones, tendons, and ligaments work together to produce movement. Biomechanics is part of the larger field of kinesiology, explicitly focusing on movement mechanics. It is both a primary and applied science, encompassing research and practical use of its findings. Biomechanics includes the structure of bones and muscles and the movement they can produce, as well as the mechanics of blood circulation, renal function, and other body functions. The American Society of Biomechanics says biomechanics represents the broad interplay between mechanics and biological systems. Biomechanics studies not only the human body but also animals and even extends to plants and the mechanical workings of cells. For example, the biomechanics of the squat includes considering the position and/or movement of the feet, hips, knees, back, shoulders, and arms. The biomechanical principle of motion relates to linear motion, velocity, speed, acceleration, and momentum. Motion is a movement that results from a force. In any physical activity, there are multiple forces and motions occurring. This could include angular motion around a joint or the motion of the whole body in various directions. The motion or movements of the body are often caused by forces produced by our muscles, but this is not always the case. For example, if an opposition player pushes you to the ground, the force has come from them and not your muscles. Motion can be linear, angular, or general. The type of motion is determined by the direction of movement. The only type of motion you are asked to understand is linear motion. However, to properly apply velocity, speed, acceleration, and 269 Physical EDUCATION-XII momentum, the other types of motion should also be defined. Angular motion is motion in a circular movement around a central point. Essentially every movement of your body at a joint is angular. The general motion is a combination of linear and angular motion, such as completing the 400m sprint. It, therefore, becomes important to know about the laws of motion for a better understanding of motion and its application in physical education and Sports. 8.1 Newton's Laws of Motion and their Application in Sports Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was one of the greatest scientists and mathematicians that ever lived. Newton came up with three general rules about the movement of objects, which are now known as Newton's Three Laws of Motion. 8.1.1 NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION (LAW OF INERTIA) According to the first law, a body will remain at rest or continue to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external (resultant) force. Inertia is the resistance of any object to any change in its motion, including a change in direction\u2014 objectives to keep moving in a straight line at a constant speed. Application in Sports h If you slide a hockey puck on ice, eventually, it will stop because of friction on the ice. It will also stop if it meets something like a player's stick or a goalpost.3 A skater gliding on ice will continue gliding with the same speed and in the same direction unless an external force acts upon the skater.4270 Physical EDUCATION-XII That unbalanced force is the player's foot, head, friction, gravity, and the net during a soccer game. A soccer player uses the body's muscles to create a force to move the leg and kick the ball from rest to motion until another player or the net stops or changes the ball's motion. 5 When a ball is thrown and is in mid-air, the only force acting upon it is the force of gravity. If the force of gravity did not exist, the ball would keep traveling at a constant speed until it was affected by an object or another person touched it. If this ball were thrown upwards, it would end up traveling into space! 8.1.2 NEWTON'S SECOND LAW OF MOTION (LAW OF MOMENTUM) As per the law, the rate of change of momentum is proportional to the resultant force and takes place in the direction of the resultant force. When a net force acts on an object, the acceleration of the object it produces is directly proportional 271 Physical EDUCATION-XII to the magnitude of the net force, is in the same direction as the net force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. The more mass the thing has, the more net force has to be used to move it. In general, if you use the same force to push a truck and push a car, the car will have more acceleration than the truck because the car has less mass. Application in Sports As in Shot-put, a player who applies more force and tosses the shot-put at the correct angle has a greater displacement of shot-put, whereas a player who exerts less force has a lesser displacement of shot put.6 In a Discuss throw, if we want to determine the force acting on a discuss (2kg), if it is accelerated at 20 m/ second sq. F = m*a F = 2*20 F = 40 Newton7 When a ball is thrown, kicked, or struck with an implement, it tends to travel in the direction of the line of action of the applied force. The greater the amount of force applied, the greater the speed the ball has. If a player improves leg strength through training while maintaining the same body mass, they will have an increased ability to accelerate the body using the legs, resulting in better agility and speed.8272 Physical EDUCATION-XII h In soccer, a team will require more force to kick the ball high and faster. This law of motion is fundamental in soccer, so you can calculate the force needed to give a pass or kick the ball to the net without missing.9 8.1.3 NEWTON'S THIRD LAW (LAW OF REACTION) According to this law, there is an equal and opposite reaction for every action, and this reaction acts with the same Momentum and the opposite velocity for every action. It states that whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object. When you walk on a floor, the floor pushes you along. No force can act alone. Application in Sports h In Swimming, a diver needs to push down on the springboard when he/she dives off a diving board. The springboard pushes back the force on you for proper projecting into the air during the performance.10273 Physical EDUCATION-XII h When you jump off a small rowing boat into the water, you will push yourself forward towards the water. The same force used to go ahead will make the boat move backward.11 h During a soccer match, we need to kick the ball for passing, shooting, or clearing the ball. While kicking the soccer ball, we will feel the force of the kickback on our leg. we won't feel the force as much because our legs have more mass than the soccer ball.12 h During any type of motion, if we need to jump, our legs apply force to the ground, and the ground applies equal and opposite reaction force (ground reaction force) that propels us into the air.13274 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? When we take a vertical jump, thee knee experiences mean peak loadings of 2.4 - 4.6 \u00d7 body weight at the patellofemoral joint, 6.9 - 9.0 \u00d7 body weight at the tibiofemoral joint, 0.3 -1.4 \u00d7 body weight at anterior tibial shear and 1.0 - 3.1 \u00d7 body weight at posterior tibial shear. The hip experiences a mean peak loading of 5.5 - 8.4 \u00d7 body weight and the ankle 8.9 - 10.0 \u00d7 body weight.5 Extension Activity During your physical education period under the guidance of a physical education teacher, perform motor actions like running, jumping, and throwing.

It is the human body's mechanism for movement, and although it may be viewed as a part of the skeletal system, the role of the muscles in supplying the necessary force for lever action should be kept in mind. The bony levers will be less stationary until they are moved by the muscles, which are motionless until the nervous system stimulates them. All lever systems are made up of four components:276 Physical EDUCATION-XII h the load h the fulcrum h the effort h the lever. The load is the object requiring moving, the effort is the muscular force we use to move the object, the fulcrum is the joint around which the movement occurs, and the bones of the skeleton are the levers. If asked to sketch a diagram of a lever system, you would need to include all four parts. Lever systems have standard symbols that are used to represent each part. You will need to know these standard symbols. WLoad WFulcrum WEffort WLever Definition of a Lever A lever is \"a rigid bar used to overcome resistance when a force is applied. \"A rigid piece transmits and modifies force or motion when forces are applied at two points, and it turns about a third.\" The Fulcrum h It is the point at which the lever rotates or turns and identifies the lever class by its position in relation to the other two parts. In human movement, the fulcrum is the joint that dictates the kind of action. The Force/Effort Arm h It is the point at which the force is applied. The Load/Resistance Arm h It is the point where the load or resistance is located.277 Physical EDUCATION-XII 8.2.1 TYPES OF LEVERS There are three types/classes of levers: h First-Class Lever h Second Class Lever h Third Class Lever First-Class Lever: A first lever has the fulcrum between the force and the resistance. This class fulcrum may be moved about along the lever, thereby changing the relative lengths of the force arm and the resistance arm. If the fulcrum is placed close to the resistance, the force arm is length, and hand and less force need to be applied to move the resistance, but force must be applied through a long distance to lift the resistance a short distance. Conversely, a shortened force arm requires more excellent force application, but there is a gain in speed and range of motion at the resistance end. First-Class Lever Examples of 1st class lever278 Physical EDUCATION-XII Triceps causing Extension at the elbow Example: When throwing a ball: WFulcrum = Example: When doing V-sit-up - Fulcrum = Hip joint Effort = Abdomen Load = Leg/Lower body h Second Class Lever: A second class lever has the load resistance between the fulcrum and the force. In this class of levers, movement of the fulcrum will increase or decrease both the force arm and the resistance arm. The force arm is always the longer of the two, and therefore the force needed to lift resisting weight will always be less than the weight. Second Class Lever Examples of 2nd class lever279 Physical EDUCATION-XII The foot acting as a whole is a second- class lever when the fulcrum is the ball of the foot, and the body weight is lifted to the toes by force at the heel. Example: When throwing a ball: Fulcrum = Ankle joint Effort = Gastrocnemius Load = Ankle jointStraight Push-ups. Example: When doing V-sit-up - Fulcrum = Ball of the foot Effort = Arm Muscle contraction. Load = Body weight h Third Class Lever: A third-class lever has the force between the fulcrum and the resistance. In this class of lever, the force arm is always shorter than the resistance arm, and so a large amount of force must be applied, but the resistance is moved through a much longer range of motion than the force application. In the human body, the most common class of lever is the thread. His is particularly important in the movements of the limps because the desired results are often those of speed or range of motion, albeit at the expense of force. Third Class Lever280 Physical EDUCATION-XII Examples of 3rd class lever Bicep causing flexion at the elbow Example: When throwing a ball: Fulcrum = Elbow joint Effort = Biceps Load = Arm/WeightSit-ups Example: When doing Sit-ups Fulcrum = Hip joint Effort = Abdomen Load = Upper body 8.2.3 APPLICATION IN SPORTS The human leverage system is built for speed & range of movement at the expense of force. Short force arms & long resistance arms require great muscular strength to move like biceps & triceps attachments biceps force arm is 1 to 2 inches triceps force arm less than 1 inch. Human leverage for sports skills requires several levers; throwing a ball involves levers at the shoulder, elbow & wrist joints. The longer the lever, the more effective it is in imparting velocity. A tennis player can hit a tennis ball harder with a straight-arm drive than with a bent elbow because the lever is longer & moves at a faster speed. Long levers produce more linear force and thus better performance in some sports such as baseball, hockey, golf, field hockey, etc. For quickness, it is desirable to have a short lever arm baseball catcher brings his hand back to his ear to secure a quick throw sprinter shortens his knee lever through flexion that almost catches his spikes in his gluteal muscles. A few examples of lever application in sports are: 1. Cricket bat (2nd class) - The fulcrum is the top of the handle, the load is the bat's body, and the force is closer to the neck of the handle. 2. Kicking - Lower limb (3rd class) - The fulcrum at the knee joint, force at tibial tuberosity, (attachment of the quadriceps) load is the foot. 3. Jumping - Plantar flexion of the foot (2nd class) - The load is at the toes, the fulcrum is at the heel, and force is your weight which is anterior to your heel. 4. Looking up/down or side-to-side (1st class) - Your head is balanced on your atlantooccipital joint, which pivots, similarly to a see-saw.281 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? Levers can be found either internally in the form of extremity bones (limbs) or externally in the form of sports implements such as rackets, bats, hockey sticks, and so on. It should be clear that the bar referred to in the definition can be of any shape.

Explain with the help of diagrams. 8.3 Equilibrium (Stability/ Balance) When we say something is stable or balanced, we generally mean that it is not easily upset; that is to say, it takes some effort to topple it. By contrast, of course, an unstable object is easily upset. Equilibrium or stability is necessary for performing skills. Naturally, the centre of gravity (CG) shifts with each change in posture. In the standing posture, the centre of gravity, while somewhat different for males than females, is located near the centre of the upper pelvic region. It shifts with each new posture assumed by the body. A significant part of any skill is the continual adjustment of body segments to 283 Physical EDUCATION-XII counteract this change in position and control the centre of gravity. Equilibrium is defined as a state of balance or a stable situation, where opposite forces cancel each other out and where no changes are occurring. 8.3.1 TYPES OF EQUILIBRIUM With respect to the state of a body, equilibrium may be divided into two categories: 1. Static equilibrium. 2. Dynamic equilibrium. Static Equilibrium For a body or an object to be in static equilibrium it must not be moving or rotating. All the force and torques acting on the body or object must add up to zero. For an object or body to be in a static or static equilibrium, where it is completely motionless it must meet 3 conditions: 1. The sum of all the vertical forces acting on the body must be zero 2. The sum of all the horizontal forces acting on the body must be zero. 3. The sum of all torques must be zero. Static equilibrium can be defined as a state when a body is at rest or completely motionless. Static equilibrium is the balance of the body during rest or stationary position. 8.3.2 FACTORS INCREASING EQUILIBRIUM h The centre of gravity falls within the base of support W Decrease instability when the centre of gravity becomes near the edge of the base h Larger base h Greater weight h Lower centre of gravity h When anticipating an oncoming force W Place centre of gravity near the side of the base of support expected to receive force284 Physical EDUCATION-XII W Extending the base of support in direction of expected force h Greater friction between body and surfaces it contacts h Rotation about an axis W Moving cycle is easier to balance than a stationary cycle h Kinaesthetic physiological functions W Vestibular system, vision, touch, and kinaesthetic awareness Examples: Stance maintained by the batsmen in cricket, on the starting block by the sprinter, wide stance maintained by the wrestler, etc. 17 18 19 Dynamic equilibrium Dynamic Equilibrium can be defined as a state when all the applied and inertial forces applied to a moving body are in balance, resulting in movement with unchanging speed or direction. To control the equilibrium and achieve balance, stability needs to be maximized. When the body or an object is moving with a constant velocity - that is with no change in speed or direction it is said to be in dynamic equilibrium. Dynamic equilibrium or dynamic stability is a balance of the body during movement. Example: Body position maintained by a sprinter while running on the track, Cyclist while cycling, dribbling of the football by a soccer player etc. 20 21 22285 Physical EDUCATION-XII Guiding Principles to Determine the Degree of Stability 1. Broader the base, the greater the stability: Broadening the base of support helps an athlete to achieve greater stability. eg., while standing spreading the feet in the direction of movement provide stability. Where a stance is required, using both hands and feet creates the widest base. 2. Body weight is directly proportional to stability: The athlete or an object which weighs more will have greater stability. eg., it is difficult to move a heavier person than a lighter one, Combative sports like, judo, wrestling, taekwondo, and boxing are played according to the bodyweight principle. 3. Lower the Centre of gravity, higher the stability: When a player does an activity that needs stability, the player usually lowers their centre of gravity by bending. eg., when a player bends his knees while running, he can stop sooner and more efficiently. Similarly, a wrestler half sits to maintain his stability. Even a shot-put thrower bends his knees in the end so that he may avoid a foul. 4. The nearer the centre of gravity to the centre of the base of support the more will be the stability: If the centre of gravity extends beyond the base of support, balance is lost. Keeping the body's weight centred over the base will support and help maintain stability. eg., when a gymnast walks on a balance beam one requires a small base of support. During the performance, if the balance is lost the gymnast raises the arm or legs on the opposite sides to shift the centre of gravity back towards the base of support. 5. Direction of acting force: During a competition, if the direction of an acting/ applied force is known, stability can be increased by moving the line of gravity as close as possible to the edge of the base where the force is expected. eg., when in a judo match the judoka shifts his foot in the line of direction of the force applied by the opponent to use the force of the opponent as a counterforce to throw him down. 8.3.3 CENTRE OF GRAVITY The Centre of gravity is the point at which all the weight or mass of a body may be considered to be concentrated. The centre of gravity of an individual standing in the anatomic position marks the intersection of three primary planes and axes. The human body's flexibility and its fluidity creates problems in accurately locating 286 Physical EDUCATION-XII the centre of gravity because, while the mass centre can be determined for any given, momentarily fixed stance, any significant movement is accompanied by a shift in the location of the centre of gravity. It means that the mass centre is constantly moving in many sports skills. Locating the centre of mass of a rigid object is not difficult and is even easier if the object is of uniform density and asymmetrical shape; in this case, the centre of gravity is at the exact centre of the object. An object suspended from this point is in rotational equilibrium. The ability to balance, whether stationary or moving, is key to success in most sports and physical activities. The stability of an athlete depends on her/his COG. It is exactly in the middle of the body around which it can rotate freely in any direction and where the weight of the body is centred. Examples: (a) For wrestlers in snatch and jerk, the widening of legs and lowering of body to maintain the stability, makes COG come down. (b) During running, the runner's centre of gravity is in the lower region of the pelvis and in front of his body, because his upper body is leaning forwards. Having the centre of gravity lower and in front of his lower body is advantageous for acceleration. 23 Importance and Application of centre of gravity in Sports (a) Helps the athlete to move (b) Stops the moving object (c) Helps the athlete to accelerate (d) Helps the athlete in throwing objects. (e) Helps the athlete to lift the object. (f) Helps the athlete to pull the object287 Physical EDUCATION-XII Example of Centre of Gravity To get better results and to be strong, the position of the centre of gravity is quite important in many sports, few examples are given below: h In the game of basketball and volleyball, high defence players spread their legs to lower the centre of gravity towards the base to occupy a better position against the offensive player. h Starting in short sprints in track events is another example of the use the of centre of gravity. As we need to take an instant start in sprints, we take our body weight on our hands in the \"Set\" position. So, that we can start immediately while balancing our weight. (Initially, the centre of gravity of the body falls on the edge of the baseline of hands. If the centre of gravity falls behind the line, then there will be delay in starting because it will require a greater force to go ahead). h In combative sports like wrestling, a wrestler falls on the mat with arms, knees, and legs spread on the mat to get a proper balanced position, (This position, makes it difficult for the opposite player to move him. 24 25 Do you know? In our daily routine, we maintain different body positions and movements. Balance, equilibrium, and stability are the major factors that help us to do all these activities. Normally in an adult man the COG in a standing position will be at 56.18 % of the height from the ground, and it will be at 55.14 % in adult women.288 Physical EDUCATION-XII Extension Activity Try this simple sitting test for yourself: 1. Stand in comfortable clothes on your bare feet, with clear space around you. 2. Without using any type of support, lower yourself to a sitting position on the floor. This should be a controlled movement; you should not be concerned about the speed of the movement. 3. Now stand back up, without using your hands, knees, forearms, or the sides of your legs for support, and without loss of balance. Scoring 4. The two basic movements in the sitting-rising test - lowering to the floor and standing back up - are each scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with one point subtracted each time a hand or knee is used for support and 0.5 points subtracted for loss of balance. The maximum score achievable is 1. 26 I. Tick the correct options. 1.

Discuss the importance of the centre of gravity in sports with suitable examples. 8.4 Friction & Sports Friction is a force that opposes the motion between two surfaces that are in touch. Friction always works in the direction opposite from the direction the object is moving or trying to move. Friction also produces heat. For example, if you rub your hands together quickly, they get warmer. We can also say that frictional force is a contact force that acts in the opposite direction to the motion of an object. This force can cause objects in motion to come to rest, as they act in the opposite direction to their motion. For example, if you roll a ball on a surface, it would come to rest after a short while. 8.4.1 TYPES OF FRICTION Static friction: 290 Physical EDUCATION-XII It occurs when the force applied to an object does not cause the thing to move. Because of static friction, you must use extra force to start the motion of stationary objects. eg., if you try to push a heavy object with less force than the force of static friction between the object and the floor, the object will not move. To make the object move, you need to exert more force than the force of static friction. Once the object is moving, there is no longer any static friction. 27 Kinetic friction It occurs when force is applied to an object and the object moves. It includes three different types of friction: (a) Sliding friction: Pushing an object across a surface. This is when two bodies are in contact and one body moves on the surface of the other body by sliding on it or rubbing over the surface. Example - skating on ice, planting a pole in the pole vault event and skiing or sliding weight. 28 (b) Rolling friction: It occurs between wheels and a surface. When two bodies are in contact and one body rolls over the other, it is referred to as rolling friction. eg., when a hockey or cricket ball is hit it begins to move ahead and roll on the ground. After sometimes it stops rolling due to the friction force, this type of friction is often seen in sports. eg., Roller skates and skateboards 29291 Physical EDUCATION-XII Fluid friction It opposes the motion of objects traveling through the fluid (gas, air , and water). For example: h When you ride a bike, fluid friction occurs between you and the air . h Cyclist often wears streamlined helmets and specially designed clothing to reduce fluid friction. h Paragliding vs hang gliding when an athlete glides on air. 30 Things that affect friction h Applying a lubricant between two surfaces. (Motor oil, grease, and wax) h Friction can be reduced by rolling rather than pushing an object h Friction increases as surfaces are made rougher. h Friction increases when the force between two objects is increased h In general, smooth surfaces produce less friction than uneven surfaces. 8.4.2 METHODS OF REDUCING FRICTION h Polishing: If we polish and rub the surface to reduce its unevenness and make it smooth, the force of friction can be reduced. eg., shining a cricket ball increase the swing of the ball. h Lubricating: A common way to reduce the force of friction is by applying a lubricate such as Motor oil, grease, wax etc. eg., the most widely used lubricants in practical mechanical systems like bearings or gears. h Wheels and Ball bearing use: It is easier to roll an object than to slide it by using wheels and ball bearings as we convert sliding friction into rolling friction. This reduces friction between the two contact surfaces and helps us to save energy and time. eg., in roller skates, both wheels and balls contribute to reducing friction. 292 Physical EDUCATION-XII h Streamlining: Friction due to air is reduced by streamlining the shape of the body. eg., the Javelin, boats, ships, and vehicles, are made with a sharp point to reduce friction. 8.4.3 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF FRICTION IN THE FIELD OF SPORTS Advantages Friction is essential in the field of sports. Without appropriate friction, we will not be able to grip any sports equipment effectively. The advantages of friction in various sports can be explained as follows: h Athletics: In Athletics, the shoes (spikes) are designed to increase friction so that better speed can be generated. The shoes used for short-distance running events have spikes in the front potion only. Whereas the long- distance runner uses completely different shoes. h Badminton: The grip in badminton plays a major role in performing a shot perfectly during a match. That is why a good grip in rackets, will increase the friction with the hand, helping the shot to count and preventing the racket from slipping. h Basketball: Friction between the shoes and the court helps players to maintain control of movement. They wipe their shoes often to get more friction for better movement control. h Cricket: The cricket players, essentially the fielders wear shoes that have spikes. The helps them increase the friction with the ground and hence, helps the cricketer during the run-up for balling, running between the wickets, and preventing from slipping h Cycling: The friction between the tires and the surface prevents cyclists from slipping and skidding. The friction between the brakes and the wheel help cyclists slow down their bikes. h Football: In Football, a footballer kicks and catches the ball. Friction helps him/her to run, change and maintain his/her position on the ground. Better friction helps him/her to tackle the opponent correctly. h Gymnastics: It is due to friction that a gymnast is able to perform actions on the Horizontal bar. In fact, he uses lime powder on his hands to increase the friction between his palm and the bar 293 Physical EDUCATION-XII h Javelin: Friction between the hand and javelin allows the thrower to grip the javelin and friction between shoes and track helps them to generate a perfect ground reaction force for throwing the javelin in the right direction. Without friction, the javelin would just fall out of their hands. h Running: Friction between the shoes and the track enables an athlete to run fast, deaccelerate, stop and change direction. If friction is low, the athlete would slip and even fall. h Soccer: In soccer also number and size of spikes between a striker to a defensive player are different, this technical difference is based on the type of friction required by the players. h Weightlifting: In weightlifting, the weightlifters needs more friction between their feet and the floor to prevent slipping while lifting heavy weights, for which they use specially designed shoes. The friction force is also required for pulling and pushing which is common in all sports activities. Hence, we can say that friction is necessary to give the best performance all forms of games and sports. Disadvantages The disadvantages of friction are as follows: h Bicycling: During cycle racing the tires get heated up due to friction. Due to more heat, tires may burst and it may lead to serious accidents. h Weightlifting and Gymnastics: In weightlifting and gymnastics, the skin in the palm gets damaged due to friction and the athlete even may slip while performing the lift. Hence, gymnasts and weight lifters are advised to use powder on their palms and wear special shoes to maintain appropriate friction h Pole-Vault: During Pole-Vault, a vaulter may lose grip on the pole if less friction is there between palms and pole. Hence, pole vaunters are advised to use adhesive on the palm to increase friction and perform correctly. hFriction makes movements difficult: Any time you want to move an object, friction can make the job more difficult, as movement is directly affected by mass and force applied and also on the surface condition. h Excess friction means extra energy: in other words, more friction means more force to overcome it and more force means more energy. Thus, energy is wasted due to friction.294 Physical EDUCATION-XII h Friction can cause injuries: if a player slides/falls across the ground. In fact, friction can lead to critical injuries. h Wear and tear: sporting equipment occurs with time because of friction. If, there were no friction, they would last forever. Consequently, it can be said that it is friction can be is advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the use, time, and place of using it. To some extent, some force of friction is required in various sports. The requirement may differ or vary from sport to sport. Do you know? Do you know? Recently one more friction type has been recognized which is known as Limiting Friction. Limiting friction is the force that comes into play when one body is just on the verge of moving over the surface of another body. (Limiting friction occurs when the moving force and the force opposing the motion are equal; any addition to the moving force will cause slipping. The limiting frictional force is proportional to the normal reaction between the contacting surfaces and is independent of the area of contact.) 31 Extension Activity Below are images of four sports where you find friction is prominent.

A projectile would travel in a continuous straight line if gravity were not present. A projectile is any object which once projected or dropped continuously in motion by its inertia and is influenced only by the downward force of gravity. A projectile is an object upon which the only force acting is gravity. Projectiles travel with a parabolic trajectory due to the influence of gravity. 32297 Physical EDUCATION-XII Defining Projectiles A projectile is an object upon which the only force acting is gravity. There are a variety of examples of projectiles. An object dropped from rest is a projectile (provided that the influence of air resistance is negligible). An object that is thrown vertically upward is also a projectile (provided that the influence of air resistance is negligible). And an object which is thrown upward at an angle to the horizontal is also a projectile (provided that the influence of air resistance is negligible). A projectile is any object that once projected or dropped continues in motion by its own inertia and is influenced only by the downward force of gravity . In simple words, an object in flight after being thrown a project is called projectile motion. Examples from sports involve projectile motion: h Objects acting as projectiles: basketball, football, shot-put, hammer, discus, javelin, golf ball, volleyball, tennis ball, etc h The body acts as a projectile in high jump, long jump, gymnastics, diving, figure skating, ski jumping etc. 33 34 The motion of a projectile is due to two separates simultaneously occurring components of motion (a) One along the horizontal direction (b) Other along the vertical direction - With constant acceleration due to force of gravity 298 Physical EDUCATION-XII 35 8.5.1 FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECTILE TRAJECTORY/ FLIGHT PATH a. Gravity b. Air resistance c. Speed of release d. Angle of release e. Height of release f. Spin (a) Gravity- Gravity is the force exerted by the earth on any object towards the centre of the body, and it is directly proportional to the mass of the body. Without gravity, the body will travel in a straight line after being thrown. (b) Air Resistance- Several vital factors bring air resistance into play W Surface area: The larger the surface area, the more air resistance will affect the object. Example: Basketball compared to a golf ball. W Speed: As speed increases, so does air resistance. Example: The Space shuttle. W Surface of the object: If the surface is rough, then air resistance will be greater. 299 Physical EDUCATION-XII Example: Swinging ball in cricket. W Mass: The smaller the mass (lighter the object), the more air resistance will affect it. Example: Movement of the shuttle in badminton. (c) Speed of release: This refers to how fast the object is released (thrown or hit). The muscle force largely determines a projectile speed of release. Generally, the greater the release rate, the greater the distance gained. Example: Speed of release in throwing events like javelin, discus, etc. (d) Angle of release/ projection angle: This refers to the pitch at which the object is thrown or hit into the air. In sporting situations, the angle of release varies according to the activity. A basketball angle above 45 degrees is required in activities such as shooting. In activities such as tennis, a lower, around 3-to-15-degree grade is required. (e) Height of release: This refers to how high above the ground an object is released. Increasing the height of release improves the horizontal distance an object can be projected. For a given speed and angle of release, the greater the height of release, the greater the distance gained. Example: Height of release in throwing events like javelin, Hammer throw, etc. (f) Spin: Spin happens as a ball moving through the air will move in the direction of at least air pressure. This helps the projectile maintain its course and can cause it to change height or direction. When applying force to a projectile below, above, or the side of the centre of gravity, you will impart spin to the projectile. Example: principle of spin in basketball shooting. 8.5.2 APPLICATION OF PROJECTILE IN SPORTS There are many instances where projectile motion is applicable, whether it is in daily life, sports, or technological advancements. Here are some of the applications of projectile motion given below: Sports Projectile motion is very common in sports since most sports involve the motion of a projectile (usually a ball). By using physics, we are able to determine the optimal angle of a ball's flight in order to maximize speed or distance.300 Physical EDUCATION-XII Baseball Pitching analysis Projectile motion is applicable in both throwing and hitting. A thrown ball undergoes projectile motion when it is mid-air since the only force that affects the ball is the acceleration due to gravity. A variety of factors will go into the trajectory of a pitch, including a pitcher's height, arm angle, and the spin being applied to the ball. 36 Hitting analysis In terms of hitting, advanced analytics like to use \"launch angle\" as a good indicator of the optimal angle that a ball should be hit. Launch angle is the angle at which a ball exits the bat as soon as they connect with each other. The best launch angles, which allow for line drives and home runs, are calculated to be around 10-30 degrees North of East, relative to the bat. This allows for the most optimal ball flight, usually necessary to hit the ball over 325 to 400 feet over the fence. 37 Basketball Another example of projectile motion in sports is basketball. For a basketball shot to enter the hoop, the basketball must be shot at a certain angle with a certain amount of force. The optimal angle of a shot will vary depending on the height from which the ball is shot and the player's distance from the hoop. According to Professor John 301 Physical EDUCATION-XII Fontanella, the ideal angles from the free-throw line will vary from 48.7 degrees to 52.2 degrees, with shorter players. 38 Did you Know There are four main types of spin used in sports, Top Spin- is where you hit over the ball. Topspin creates a downward force on the ball, causing the ball to drop, Back Spin- this is where you hit under the ball, Backspin creates an upward force that lifts the ball, causing the ball to rise, Clockwise Spin-this is we are you hit the ball on the left side of the centre of gravity. It causes the ball to swing to the right and Anticlockwise- this is where you hit the ball on the right side to the centre of gravity. It causes the ball to swing to the left.

The greater the amount of force applied, the greater the speed the ball has. 2. A skater gliding on ice will continue gliding with the same speed and in the same direction unless an external force acts upon the skater. 3. The force applied to the ball is matched with an equal and opposite force applied to the racket. 4. When a white ball (the cue ball) hit a yellow or green ball in billiards. 5.

SPORTS INTEGRATED 39 Sports science is a fascinating topic on its own, and most physical sports require 304 Physical EDUCATION-XII having a basic understanding of scientific concepts. Consider the amount of physics involved with a sport like a golf - a golfer must understand the concept of a trajectory and how this can be affected by a multitude of factors (wind speed and direction, for instance). From tennis to basketball, angles, arches, mass, the center of gravity, angle of contact/release, etc, are all involved with these types of sports! Based on this students can make a project individually or in a group on different sports and games where these laws and principle is applied with practical example and presented in their classes.

Discussion Read an excerpt from a leading newspaper regarding news for requirement of sports psychology in Indian Sports. BCCI for hiring psychologists to arrest stress308 Physical EDUCATION-XII TNN | Mar 11 NEW DELHI: The Indian Cricket Board has discussed plans to ask its state units to hire good sports psychologists who can help young players handle pressure better and ensure lesser drop-outs from the game. With India losing several talented Under-14 and Under-16 level players every year due to family and academics pressures, BCCI also wants to make the hiring of psychologists compulsory at state academies for age group players. According to a board official, \"India is losing a lot of talent at the age-group levels, The stake-holders of the game are all concerned and they want a system in place to tackle this problem. It is common these days to see talented players leaving the game after one or two bad seasons. As you go higher, the talent pool is reduced. \"This shouldn't happen,\" thus the idea of hiring psychologist was discussed. adding that the cricket drop outs should stop at all levels. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/bcci-for-hiring- psychologists-to- arrest- stress/articleshowprint/57587522.cms 1/1 Discuss in your group W What causes a person to persist or to give up?

Present your ideas to the class 9.1 Personality: Concept and Definitions Reading the news clipping, did you wonder why a psychologist would be required to prevent athletes from dropping out, even though they have achieved success? Are we able to identify athletes who have the talent or skill to continue with sports participation but still lack the determination to continue in sports? If we were asked to analyse reasons why some sportspeople succeed despite all odds, surely, we will come up with adjectives like determined, persistent, courageous, dynamic, robust, etc. Is there something more which can be added to describe these athletes - eg., consistent or possessing a stable pattern of behaviour? Sports psychologists have tried to answer these by relating them with various theories of personality. Understanding personality has been an area of interest which is as old as our civilization. Even 309 Physical EDUCATION-XII before the present day scientific and systematic research to explain personality developed, philosophers across the globe tried to analyse characteristics which were unique to an individual and why people differed in various ways. However, the concept of personality is still evolving and covers such a large range of phenomenon, that it is very difficult to include all the aspects of personality in one definition. The word personality is derived from the Latin word persona, the mask used by actors in the Roman theatre for changing their appearance for performing in- front of their audience according to the given role. The actor performed as per the script or story wearing a particular mask. The audience also expected them to act in a particular manner on seeing the mask. However, it didn't mean that the actors possessed the desired qualities of the character in themselves. Therefore, the concept of personality came to refer to an individual's characteristic way of responding to other individuals and situations. When we observe people around us, we are able to describe their actions and responses to different situations based on the combination of their individual thoughts, characteristics, behaviour, attitude, ideas and habits. We may represent them as shy, happy, courageous, aggressive etc. These characteristics are a representation of different components of personalities. Therefore, we can view personality as the relatively stable and unique characteristics of an individual across different situations and varied period of time. Personality, thus, can be defined as the characteristic set of behaviours, cognitions and emotional patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors. It is the integration of those systems and habits that represent an individual's characteristic adjustment to his environment. According to Robert A Baron, \"Personality is an individual's unique and relatively stable pattern of behaviour, thoughts and feelings.\" Matt Jarvis (2006) in his book presented a general definition of personality offered by Pewin (1993) \"Personality represents those structural and dynamic properties of an individual or individuals as they reflect themselves in characteristic responses to situations\". It is the integration of those systems and habits that represent an individual's characteristic adjustment to his environment.\" Carl Jung (1933)1: Personality as an attitude refers to a predisposition to behave in a certain manner. William Herbert Sheldon (1942)2: offered a topology of personality based on three major morphologies or body types (Endomorph, Ectomorph, Mesomorph), each associated with a different temperament of an individual. Cattell (1950)3: Personality is \"that which permits a prediction of what a person will do in a given situation.\"310 Physical EDUCATION-XII Guildford (1959)4: Personality is an 'individual's unique pattern of traits.' Allport (1961)5: Personality is the dynamic organization within the individual of those psychological systems that determine his unique adjustment to his environment. Eysenck (1953)6: Personality is defined as more or less stable and enduring organization or a person's character, temperament, intellect and physique which determine his unique adjustment to the environment. Robert A Baron (2008)7: Personality is defined as individual's unique and relatively stable pattern of behaviour, thoughts and feelings. In sports also, it is important to understand athletes and their unique and relatively stable characteristics in different situations and conditions. It is essential to know how a particular athlete responds to the situational demands of the training as well as competitions. No two athletes behave in a similar manner; they may behave differently in a common situation. Some athletes may not like to take a command from a coach but may respond positively towards acceptable alternatives like cooperative learning from coaches. Sports psychologist may also be interested to learn which type of people opt for a particular type of sports or exercise program. To understand this, let us overview personality from various approaches and theories propounded by eminent psychologists from across the world. These theories represent various contrasting views and perspectives on the origin and nature of human uniqueness. Each theory may have vast differences but offers wide range of insight that can add towards effective understanding of personality of an individual. 9.1.1 PERSONALITY TYPES Over the years, with the progress of research and development of literature in the field of personality by various psychologists, it is essential to understand the various approaches for getting a better perspective and understanding of personality . Personality type refers to the psychological classification of different types of people. Personality types are distinguished from personality traits, which come in different degrees. There are many theories regarding personality types, and each theory contains several and sometimes many sub theories. For example, according to type theories, there are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. According to trait theories, introversion and extroversion are part of a continuous dimension with many people in the middle. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviourist, evolutionary, and social learning perspective. However, many researchers and psychologists 311 Physical EDUCATION-XII do not clearly subscribe to any one particular perspective, but instead take an heterogeneous approach. There is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of personality testing. In psychological education and training, the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite. Since no one particular theory or approach covers the complete aspects of personality, the approach for explaining 'personality' includes mainly, the 'Type' approach which consists of classification or comprehending of personality type based on a set of behaviour characteristics with similarities as done by Myers and Briggs type indicator, Friedman and Rosenman Type A personality behaviour etc., as well as on the basis of body type classification by Kretschmar, or somatotype by William Sheldon, and the fluid type classification as explained by Hypocrites. Trait approach, on the other hand, focusses on specific psychological attributes based on the concept of individuals differing in 'unique' and 'stable' characteristics. Trait refers to a characteristic that is unchanging and predictable. For example, shyness is a trait that is usually stable in an individual's personality. Some traits are innate - the infant possesses a basis for developing the trait at birth, while others are acquired through learning, such as the tendencies toward tidiness or untidiness. Some researchers like Eysenck, Cattel as well as Allport and others support inherent traits as \"cardinal\" and proposed a theory of personality based on biological factors, arguing that individuals inherit a type of nervous system that affects their ability to learn and adapt to the environment. Sigmund Freud and Neo-Freudians like Jung, who described the structure of personality in three part-id, ego, super ego, put forward the psycho-dynamic theory of personality that assumes there is an interaction between nature (innate instincts) and nurture (parental influences). In modern sports, inter-action perspective regarding personality is an extremely popular and widely adopted approach towards understanding of behaviour. It defines behaviour as function of personality and situational factors acting together. According to the interaction theory behaviour in any situation is a function of both personality and external factors. For example, an player with high hostility trait may not indulge in aggressive behaviour if he or his team is winning with a large margin, or an athlete with composed traits may reflect neurotic tendencies of anxiety if faced with the challenge of scoring the winning run of the last ball of a knockout round match. 9.1.2 JUNG'S CLASSIFICATION OF PERSONALITY TYPES Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and a disciple of Sigmund Freud, was once 312 Physical EDUCATION-XII a great admirer of Freud's view on psychoanalysis and worked with him for five years. However, he started developing contradictory views on some of the major assumptions or findings of Sigmund Freud and later followed a separate professional path. Therefore, many times, Carl Jung is referred to as a Neo-Freudian also. Characteristics of Introverts & Extroverts Introvert Extrovert Interested in their own self Reserved Self-aware and introspective Take pleasure in reading, writing Tend to shy away from public Think before actingHighly socialized Broad-minded Expressive and enjoy centre of attention Meet unknown people easily Bold, outgoing and optimistic person Action oriented Later he published a book Psychology Typen (Psychology Types) in 1921 and presented his own theory of personality by classifying personality based on two important aspects. First is personality attitude (introvert and extrovert) and second is personality functions (Sensing, Intuitive, Thinking, Feeling). He can be credited for being the first to introduce the concept of introversion and extroversion to the world of psychology. It was not a designed to label type of people, instead the purpose was to demonstrate the complexity of human typology and its consequences. Let us understand Jung's topology based on personality attitude and personality functions: 1. Personality Attitude: which is distinguished as Extrovert or Introvert. 2. Personality Functions: which can be classified as four distinct function namely; Feeling, Intuiting; Judging or Sensing. The four functions are divided into what Jung called rational (or judging) and irrational (or perceiving) functions. Thinking and sensations are rational, according to Jung, while intuition and feeling are irrational. Introvert: In Jung's theory, introverts are people who are predominantly interested in their own mental self. They are typically seen as more reserved or reflective and prefer to be withdrawn from external reality. They opt to live in their own inner 313 Physical EDUCATION-XII world of feelings and thoughts and often take pleasure in solitary activities such as reading, writing, or meditating. They prefer to create their own virtual and imagery world, due to which they tend to shy away from in public interactions and social connects and are less vocal with people around them, due to this, they like to be reserved and within themselves. They are more analytical before speaking. Extrovert: In Jung's theory people with an extrovert personality are the total opposite of those with an introvert personality. They prefer the outer world of things, hence are found to be more broad-minded, are highly socialized, hence can meet unknown people easily. They are very bold, outgoing and optimistic person. The Eight Preferences Where you prefer to focus your attention EXTRAVERSION People who prefer extraversion tend to focus their attention on the outer world of people and thin INTROVERSION People who prefer introversion tend to focus their attention on the inner world of ideas and impressions. The way you prefer to take in information. SENSING Peole who prfer sensing tend to take in information through the five senses and INTUITION People who prefer intuition tnnd to take in information from pattern and the big picture and focus on future possibilities. The way you prefer to make decisions THINKING People who prefer thinking tend to make decision based primarily on logic and on objective analysis of cause and effect. FEELING People who prefer feeling tend to make decision based primarily on values and on subjective evaluation of person- centered concern. How you prefer to deal with the outer world JUDGING People who prefer Judging tend to like a planning and organized approach to life and prefer to have things settled. PERCEIVING People who prefer perceiving tend to like a flexible and spontaneous approach to life and prefer to keep their options open E314 Physical EDUCATION-XII Extroverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. They take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. They also tend to work well in groups. Personality Functions: Whether a person is an introvert or extrovert, she/he has a preferred pattern to deal with the situations. There can be four basic way or function used by people: 1. Feeling: Feeling is a preference for making decisions based on values and effects on people rather than logic. People use their emotional aspects to understand the situation and deal according to it. 2. Thinking: The capacity to decide objectively based on the evidence and applicable principles is defined as thinking. People evaluate the information received with logic and rationale for dealing with outer world. 3. Sensing: Sensing refers to a preference for perceiving the world through facts, evidence, data and details. People use their senses to seek information. They are good at looking and listening to understand the world around them. 4. Intuitive: Intuition refers to a preference for perceiving the world through concepts, theories and abstractions. People use their perception and intuitions to understand the situation, people around them, sometime its referred as sixth sense of an individual. According to Jung, the two attitudes of extraversion and introversion cannot be demonstrated in isolation. It need to be associated with one of the four functions. When the two attitudes (Extrovert and Introvert) combine with four functions (Sensing, Intuition, Thinking, Feeling), they form eight mental functions-in-attitude or personality types. Let us briefly view each of the eight combinations of personality types. Extroverted ThinkingExtroverted thinking involves segmenting; organizing for efficiency; systematizing; applying logic; structuring; checking for consequences; monitoring for standards or specifications being met; setting boundaries, guidelines, and parameters; deciding if something is working or not. Sorting out different colours and styles; thinking about the consequences. Extroverts who are thinkers are able to see the world through complex and solid ideas but these complex ideas are often handed down or moved on by others. These people often work in fields related to Math and Science.315 Physical EDUCATION-XII Introverted ThinkingIntroverted thinking involves analysing; categorizing; evaluating according to principles and whether something fits the framework or model; figuring out the principles on which something works; checking for inconsistencies; clarifying definitions to get more precision; analysing options for using principles. Introverts who think see how the world works in a subjective and creative way. This analysis is based on internal knowledge. These people often work in science fields as well. Extroverted FeelingExtroverted feeling refers to connecting; considering others and the group- organizing to meet their needs and honor their values and feelings; maintaining societal, organizational, or group values; adjusting to and accommodating others; deciding if something is appropriate or acceptable to others. These people base their judgements on factual, known information. They form their assessments on social values and beliefs. These people often work in business fields and politics. Introverted FeelingIntroverted feeling means valuing; considering importance and worth; reviewing for incongruity; evaluating something based on the truths on which it is based; clarifying values to achieve accord; deciding if something is of significance and worth standing up for . They base their feelings on emotions, feelings and beliefs. These people often work in the art field. Extroverted SensingExtroverted Sensing refers to experiencing the immediate context; taking action in the physical world; noticing changes and opportunities for action; accumulating experiences; scanning for visible reactions and relevant data. These individuals look at the world and interpret reality. They see what is going and go with it. They are not influenced by other opinions. These people often work as taste-testers or proof-readers. Introverted SensingIntroverted Sensing involves reviewing past experiences; \"what is\" evoking \"what was\"; seeking detailed information and links to what is known; recalling stored impressions; accumulating data; recognizing the way things have always been. Introverts at times look for a hidden message or meaning to something. They do not just look at something and see it being there without a reason. These meanings are based on internal reflection. These people often work in the art field as well.316 Physical EDUCATION-XII Extroverted IntuitiveExtroverted Intuition refers to interpreting situations and relationships; picking up meanings and interconnections; being drawn to change \"what is\" for \"what could possibly be\"; noticing what is not said and threads of meaning emerging across multiple contexts. These people base their meanings of things on facts rather than feelings. They are usually inventors. Introverted IntuitiveIntroverted Intuition leads people to foreseeing implications and likely effects without external data; realizing \"what will be\"; conceptualizing new ways of seeing things; envisioning transformations; getting an image of profound meaning or far- reaching symbols. Introverted Intuitives usually base their decisions on their inner desires. They find warmth through subjective ideas. These people usually work as artists or religious figures. Ambivert While explaining personality through the term Introvert and Extrovert, there is reference of a third term called Ambivert which is a relatively new term. Jung did not use the word to explain that there is no such thing as a pure introvert or extrovert. This concept was supported by many other later psychologists. Ambiverts reflect a blend of traits from the introvert as well as the extrovert along with having some specific strengths. Thus, an ambivert can be defined as someone who falls in the middle of the introvert/extrovert continuum. 9.1.3 BIG FIVE THEORY OF PERSONALITY 317 Physical EDUCATION-XII Another important trait approach which can provide essential insights into the key elements of personality is of the Big Five Factor personality model offered by Paul Costa and Robert McCrae. The five personality traits also known as the Five Factor Model of Personality and sometimes referred as OCEAN. The five domains or traits represented by the acronym OCEAN, are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Let us try to understand the attributes of each of the five personality factors on a continuum leading from high reflected characteristics at one end to low reflected characteristics at the other . Openness to Experience (Imaginative vs Narrow Interest): Openness refers to dimension of personality which ranges from being imaginative, humorous, intellectual, creative, curious, having broad interests, open to ideas at one end to being closed to experience, suspicious and rigid at the other. In sports, athletes or Individuals scoring high on Openness are characterized by reflection of demonstrating new ideas and skill execution initiatives along with wide variety in ideas. EXTRAVERSION (Enthusiastic vs Reserved) Extraversion refers to dimension of personality which ranges from having enthusiasm, energy, positive emotions, talkativeness, assertiveness at one end to being reserved, sober and cautious at the other. An individual who scored high on extraversion is characterized by high sociability, is outgoing and has a tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others. Those who score low on extraversion prefer solitude or smaller groups, prefer activities alone, and avoid large social situations. Not surprisingly people who score high on both extraversion and openness are more likely to participate in adventure and risky sports due to their curious and excitement seeking nature.318 Physical EDUCATION-XII CONSCIENTIOUSNESS (Organized vs Easy-going) Conscientiousness refers to well-organised, careful, responsible, hardworking and dependable individuals at one end to being relaxed and easy going, spontaneous, disorganized and careless. Numerous studies have found to have a positive correlation between conscientiousness and cognition, individuals high on conscientiousness have been found to perform better in academics as well as in the sports arena wherever planning, organising skills and decision-making abilities are essential to the task. AGREABLENESS (Friendly vs Un-Cooperative) Agreeableness refers to compassionate behaviour of an individual. Dimensions of agreeableness range from being good-natured, cooperative, trusting at one end to being suspicious, irritable and uncooperative at the other. It is also a measure of a person's helpful and friendly behaviour nature and reflects whether that person is generally friendly and nurturing or not. People who score low on agreeableness tend to be antagonistic towards others and are described as rude and unkind. NEUROTICISM (Composed vs Nervous) Neuroticism focusses on the emotional stability on an individual. This trait refers to dimensions of personality which range from being poised, calm and composed at one end to nervous, anxious and excitable at the other. Individuals reflecting high neuroticism are characterized by the tendency to experience unpleasant emotions, and are often found to demonstrate impulsive and hostile behaviour. In contrast, people who score low in neuroticism tend to be calm and even-tempered. Athletes' sports performances are highly influenced by neurotic characteristics and modern findings supports exercise and physical activity as an alternate therapy to manage neurotic behaviours. BIG 5 Traits Behaviour for High Score Behavoiur for low score OPENNESS Curious,Imaginative, Intellectual, Creative, Open to trying new things, Focused on tackling new challenges, Thinks about abstract conceptsDislikes change, Does not enjoy new things, Resists new ideas Not very imaginative, Dislikes abstract or theoretical concepts CONSCIENTIOUSNESS Well-Organised, careful, responsible, self-disciplinedDisorganised, careless, relaxed, easy going319 Physical EXTRAVERSION Active, interactive , , cautious AGGREEABLENESS GoodNatured, friendly, helpful, trusting, cooperativeIrritable, suspicious, rude, uncooperative NEUROTICISM Insecure, nervous, anxious, excitableCalm, composed, poised, Hardy, Secure I.

What are the types of personality traits according to the Big Five Theory? Explain with their importance in physical education and sports. 9.2 Motivation Let us re-visit our initial discussion once again. Why did some athlete keep playing without worrying about pain, discomfort of training, injury or even academic pressure? On the other hand, why did many talented athletes stop participating after initial failures? Let us consider the two important questions. 1. What motivates a player to behave in a certain way? 2. How to motivate an athlete to perform better? To answer the questions above, let us start from understanding of the concept 'motivation'. The term 'Motivation' is derived from Latin word Movere meaning 'to move'. The basic reason for any human activity is nothing else but motivation. Motivation is the driving force that spurs a person to action It can be explained as a process to initiate, guide and maintain behaviour over time as defined by Robert Baron (2008). Motivation can also be defined simply as the direction and intensity of effort. Truly, motivation is a process of inspiring, guiding the organism to move in a particular direction. From the above definitions, we can understand motivation is influenced by two factors: Objective and Direction. The first factor 'objective' explains the 'why' of an action or behaviour, whereas the second factor 'Direction' explain 'what' of an action or behaviour. The 'why' or objective for a behaviour helps to find the reason for initiating a behaviour. The direction is about 'what' an individual wants to do, 'what' they plan to achieve. If either objective or direction is lacking for an action or behaviour, ultimately the quality of action or achievement suffers. It means, to achieve the desired goal you need to have a purpose or desire which activates you towards initiating a task in a particular direction and seeking behaviours to be persistent with enough fuel and energy till the goal is achieved. When one of the random activities leads to a goal, it reduces the drive, and the organism stops being active. What is it, then, that arouses the organism to action? How does one get this drive? The answer can be found in the two terms 'Intrinsic' and 'Extrinsic' motivation. Intrinsic motivation involves doing something because it's personally rewarding to you. It emerges from within and is directly linked with the natural instincts based 321 Physical EDUCATION-XII on feelings of joy and satisfaction. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, involves doing something because you want to earn a reward or avoid punishment. Thus, extrinsic motives involve outside forces. Let us find out more about the type of motivation and see how motivation is an important aspect in sports and exercise psychology. Do you know? A motivation A state of lacking any motivation to engage in an activity, characterized by a lack of perceived competence and/or a failure to value the activity or its outcomes. Intrinsic Motivation When you pursue an activity for the pure enjoyment of it, you are doing so because you are intrinsically motivated. Extrinsic Motivation refers to behaviour that is driven by external rewards such as money, fame, grades, and praise. 9.2.1 INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC MOTIVATION Intrinsic Motivation: The word intrinsic is derived from the French word 'intrinseque' which means inward. Intrinsic is also referred as internal motivation which drives an individual from within to naturally pursue actions that provide fun, pleasure, fulfilment or challenge. If an individual's behaviour reflects a desire to pursue an action for enjoyment, or the individual continues the activity in a consistent manner because it provides a feeling of satisfaction, these can be identified as intrinsic motivation factors towards the directed behaviour. Intrinsic motivation includes satisfaction of needs felt by the individual which comes from inside or within and is directly linked to the individual's instincts or urges. Extrinsic Motivation: The word extrinsic is derived from the Latin word 'entrinsecus' which means outward. Just as its meaning suggests, extrinsic motivation is that in which the source of satisfaction does not come from within and the behaviour is not due to natural urges or impulses. Instead, the behaviour or action is influenced by external forces or drives. The reasons for action are not part of an individual's character, but are due to urges from outside such as prize, money, praise, or even punishment. 322 Physical EDUCATION-XII Extension Activity Talk to a friend who is an athlete and try to find what motivated him to participate in sports Read the below mentioned responses and identify the statements which most closely suit your friend's reason to participate: 1. Doesn't know why he plays and that he doesn't see any particular benefit associated with it. 2. To learn new skill of the sports. 3. To gain skill mastery and perfection. 4. Find joy and happiness in participation. 5. Perform to obtain a reward or trophy in the championship. 6. To make the coach happy for getting the best athlete ward in school. 7. Participate to avoid pressure from the family. The response of your friend reflects the following about his motivation. If YES to: Item 1: Reflects Amotivation Item 2, 3, 4: he/ she is Intrinsically motivation Item 5,6,7: he/ she is Extrinsically motivation Difference between Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation Intrinsic Motivation Extrinsic Motivation Definition Driving force to pursue an action for fun, joy or any other inner satisfactionDriving force to pursue an action due to reward, trophy, money, promotions or praise Factors Internal factors like joy, enjoymentExternal factors like reward, promotion, praise Method Goal Setting strategies, Family and Community supportAssociating success with future benefits, awards, promotions and avenues. Benefits Long term benefit of maintaining a behaviourHelpful to initiate or create a drive towards a desired behaviour when internal factors are missing. 9.2.2 MOTIVATION TECHNIQUES Motivation is the process in which the learner's internal energies or needs are directed towards various goal objects in his environment. In other words, it is the driving 323 Physical EDUCATION-XII force which increases the desire to perform better. Every individual has certain basic motives or needs that she/he tries to satisfy. As long as one is satisfied with one's present behaviour and knowledge and finds it adequate to satisfy all her/his needs, she/he will not try to change his behaviour or acquire new knowledge. Let us try to understand some of the techniques used in sports to motivate athletes by helping them to maintain their inner urges to continue training as well by utilizing external factors to supplement their drive to prolong with the desired athlete behaviours essential for sports performance. The motivational techniques are based on the following mentioned approaches. Understanding of each approach will help in developing unique strategies to motivate athletes towards desired behaviours. 1. Cognitive Approach: The active processing and interpretation of information influences the persistent and purposive drive for action by an individual. It is based on the notion that desired motivation can be achieved by an individual through active processing and interpretation of information. Expectancy theory and Goal Setting theory is widely used as a cognitive approach for motivation. Expectancy theory explains that people are motivated for the task where the probability of success is higher in comparison to failure. Whereas the goal- setting concept maintains that a stronger drive for actions and behaviour is fuelled by quality of information on time set for task attainment along with task difficulty level and specificity of the task. (a) Time Bound: The task should be time bound (b) Set Complexity level of task: Task should be neither too difficult nor too easy (c) Make task Specific: Task instructions should be precise about what is to be done (d) Define Purpose of task: Outcome of the task should be clear and defined.324 Physical EDUCATION-XII 2. Pedagogical Approach: Teaching coaching pedagogies used in sports training for planned outcome is largely responsible in guiding and maintaining the desired behaviour of athletes. Adequate communication and maintenance of positive relationship during training is an essential component influencing the motivation of athletes towards a consistent action or behaviour. Making training enjoyable, engaging athletes in decision making and providing valuable feedback to athletes are essential components to motivation. Let us discuss few techniques of motivation using a pedagogical approach. (a) Guided Discovery Method: Athletes are highly motivated if allowed to find solutions to the problems by themselves rather than if they are just made to do things as per instruction. Lack of independence in decision making and non- promotion of cohesive training environment for athletes are major reasons affecting motivation. Cooperative learning with opportunities for athletes to engage in decision making is an effective strategy towards motivation. (b) Valuable Feedback System: To persuade athletes to push harder for a longer period of time, they must be provided with a strong support system. Assisting athletes with feedback which can provide them with specific direction to move in is an effective means towards effective motivation. (c) Fun-based Training: Training should be challenging and task-oriented for optimal performance. However, for providing athletes with enough drive and energy to sustain them, training methods should involve fun and enjoyment for athletes. Adding creativity and innovation to training and the teaching-learning system helps in adding motivation for athletes to persist with continuous demands of training load. (d) Individualized Training Program (ITP/IEP): All athletes are unique and respond differently to the vast variety of training demands. Each athlete is a unique individual and should have a training programme designed for their abilities and capabilities and which is within attainable limits of the athletes. Individualized training programmes or individualized education programmes are very essential in sports to help athletes to set their own targets, challenges and difficulty levels which will not only help them to avoid burnout, but also keep them motivated. 3. Social Support Strategy: Participation in sports and taking up exercise is greatly influenced by an understanding of the social networking and perception of people around them. Conducive exercise environment, creating drive among people to initiate and maintain sporting behaviour is deeply affected by the societal pressure or support provided to the individual. Positive social support 325 Physical EDUCATION-XII from peer group, family members, and friends helps in developing healthy habits and enough drive to maintain the act of exercising. Initiating group activities and engagement of family and peers in sports participation helps in increased participation in sports and exercise. 4. Facilitation Approach: (a) Incentives and Rewards: Drive towards an action to maintain it for a long term may sometimes need external support. Awards and rewards work effectively as a motivation force for athletes to pursue sports with consistency and continuity. (b) Valance of Reward: Many time prizes and awards are used extrinsic sources of motivation to maintain a desired action or behaviour. But, at times, even these may prove to be ineffective. It is essential to understand that external factors like prize money or medals do motivate athletes, but the most important aspect is to understand the need and expectation of the individual athlete, this is known as 'valance' of the reward or valuing the award. To be motivated, athletes must be awarded by considering what is desired or expected by an individual so that he or she can value that reward. An athlete may like to be rewarded by being made the captain of the team and may value it more than being rewarded with a pay hike. (c) Performance appraisals: Motivation or the driving force for any desired behaviour to last over a long period of time may need support of being recognised and praised for the current and past endeavours. It creates the drive for future action and pursuit of excellence with confidence among athletes. It encourages them to plan their directions and actions. Regular appraisal of performance should be provided to athletes and appropriate rewards given. (d) Quality Support and Facilitation: Motivation for an action is influenced by the amount of facilitation made available for athletes, but the impact is larger only if the quality of support is of a high standard. Factors influencing or impacting the desired behaviour of athletes need to studied, diagnosed and appropriate support needs to be provided to ensure maintenance of behaviour of highest standards. 9.2.3 MOTIVATION AND SPORTS Motivation as a guiding force to initiate, guide and maintain a behaviour desired for sports participation and performance is well understood but still motivation remains as a challenging task in sports.326 Physical EDUCATION-XII Researchers around the world have discussed the methods to maintain or increase motivation of athletes, but little has been done to understand the reasons about why we participate in an exercise or indulge in s activities. Summarizing the conclusions of different research, four motives towards sports and exercise behaviour can be identified. 1. Physical wellbeing; 2. Psychological wellbeing; 3. Performance achievement; 4. Status and Power (assertive achievements). All the motives mentioned above are intrinsic in nature and point towards the reason for sports participation and exercise as being largely intrinsic in nature. People participate in sports and exercise for various intrinsic motives but external motives can be added wherever or whenever intrinsic motive is reduced. I. Tick the correct answers. 1.

Define Motivation. 2. Differentiate between Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation. 3. Write a short note on any two techniques of motivation. III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. How can a coach strategize in motivating an athlete to keep performing? 2. How does motivating a sports person affect games and sports and how do games and sports influence a player's motivation? 9.3 Exercise Adherence \"If exercise could be packed into a pill, it would be the single most widely prescribed and beneficial medicine in the nation\" - Dr Rober Butler, Former Director, National Institute of Ageing. In the simplest term exercise adherence refers to the extent to which the individual maintains an active involvement in physical exercise and acts in accordance with the advised interval, exercise dose, and exercise dosing regimen despite opportunities and pressures to withdraw. Exercise adherence, therefore, refers not just initiation but also maintenance of physical activity and exercise behaviour according to individualized need and requirement. It is associated to the 'stickability' factor which is related with quality of any athlete or participants to continue with sports, exercise or any other physical activity without losing the motivation to pursue it further. So, exercise adherence can also be referred as a self- regulated, voluntary behaviour directed towards maintaining an exercise routine for a prolonged period of time after initial phase of adoption. It is important as well as interesting to understand the reasons why people adhere to exercise and the forces that push athletes towards initiating sports participation. 9.3.1 REASON TO EXERCISE Reason to exercise or exercise determinants point towards the importance of motives of an individual towards initiating and adopting exercise as a part of her/his lifestyle. We find many people around us with different behaviours towards exercise and physical activity and each behaviour can be associated with its own reason for adherence or non-adherence. We may find many people who have not initiated exercise or even thought of exercise and physical activity in near future, or those 328 Physical EDUCATION-XII who think of starting exercise in the near future but are not able to initiate the programme, and still others who started or initiated an exercise programme but were not able to continue or adhere to it for long and dropped out. Why people find a reason to exercise, participate in fitness and engage in recreation sports can be understood by the following aspects: 1. Overcoming Social Physique Anxiety: People in the society are influenced by how other perceive them in-term of their looks, fitness or body shape, weight and size. This leads to adoption of various means and methods to make them lean and fitter. Exercise combined with proper diet can help people attain their goal to be lean and fit thus helping overcoming social physique anxiety with the means of exercise, fitness and recreation sports program engagement. 2. Reduced risk of disease: Lifestyle factors does play an important role toward rise of various contemporary health issues. Hypertension, obesity are major health concerns in the modern day due to increase in facilities and urbanization leading to limited physical engagements, lack of physical activity and promotion of sedentary lifestyle. To overcome the sedentary lifestyle, adoption of exercise and fitness are considered to be essential and important. 3. Recreation : With change in lifestyle and devotion of more hours on table chair task, engagement in serious academics, focus on professional pathways, individuals are facing with the challenge of finding time and activity for recreation, fun and enjoyment. Recreation sports, fitness and exercise provide fun, enjoyment, recreation along with the physical benefits, thus recreation being considered as an essential reason to exercise. 4. Mental Relaxation: There are various means and methods adopted for stress reduction and mental relaxation by people of all segments, demography, age groups. Exercise is one of the most effective ways to cope with stress and depression more economically and with tremendous benefits to the society. Therefore, people participation in exercise for mental relaxation as a reason is relevant. 5. Socialization: Often people look for opportunities to engage with community and socialize with friends, peer groups, colleagues etc from their busy life. The engagement with society members are essential to overcome social isolation, tackle loneliness which can affect their mental health and prevent camaraderie spirit among peoples of the society. Especially in the modern lifestyle and with urbanization leading to less time available for social connect, the most effective way to connect socially is through participation in team sports, group exercises program and various other fitness programs. Thus socialization qualifies as a reason for people to engage and experience exercise and sports programs.329 Physical EDUCATION-XII 9.3.2 BENEFITS OF EXERCISE 1. Health Benefits: There has been evidence of humans working hard and putting in physical effort for their survival and better life since early times. Even today people across the world desire to lead a healthy life and consider health as the most essential aspect of life. With the change in living conditions and transformation in contemporary lifestyle, engaging in physical activity, exercise and sports has a prominence as a chosen activity or preferred behaviour among people to keep themselves healthy. Regular exercise can provide the following benefits: (a) Reduces risk of Cardiovascular Disease: Exercise and a regular cardio- fitness regime has a significant role in preventing various cardiovascular diseases like hypertension and coronary heart disease. Exercise strengthens the heart and improves circulation. The increased blood flow raises oxygen levels in the body. This helps lower risk of heart diseases such as high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, and heart attack. (b) Weight Management: Living in a society where physical appearance is important, individuals take to exercise from a desire to keep themselves in shape. Though they may experiment with other methods for losing weight like dieting and calorie control etc., but these methods alone not found to be effective for weight reduction unless regular exercise is not combined with diet control. (c) Strengthens Bones and Muscles: Regular exercise helps build strong bones. Later in life, it can also slow the loss of bone density that comes with age. Doing muscle- strengthening activities can help you increase or maintain your muscle mass and strength. (d) Reduces risk of some Cancers: Exercise reduces risk of cancers like cancers of the colon, breast, uterus, and lungs. (e) Reduces risk of Falls: For older adults, research shows that doing balance and muscle- strengthening activities in addition to moderate-intensity aerobic activity can help reduce your risk of falling. 2. Provides Stress Relief: Modern lifestyle with its work pressure and competitive lifestyle leads to a lot of stress. The physical effects of prolonged stress are numerous, including a greater susceptibility to illness, a lack of energy, problems with sleep, headaches, poor judgment, weight gain, depression, anxiety, and a host of other ills. 330 Physical EDUCATION-XII 3. Increases Happiness: It has been evident to find people engaged in physical activity for various extrinsic goals like weight loss, improving physical appearance etc. but there are people who prefer to exercise and engage in physical activities like recreation sports or adventure sports due to their innate nature to experience joy, happiness and satisfaction. During exercise, the body increases the production of endorphins which are known to help produce positive feelings and can improve the mood and make the individual feel relaxed and happy. 4. Promotes Self-Efficacy: Self-efficacy is the belief that one is capable of achieving a specific goal. Regular exercise and participation in sports is largely associated with an individual's belief in her/his abilities to complete physical tasks, achieve determined goals and produce challenging outcomes. 5. Promotes Social Cohesion: Human beings are social animals who prefer to engage in group activities because it given them opportunity to socialize and interact with other people. As a result, many people engage in exercise behaviour and sports participation. Sports and group exercise programmes also prevent boredom and social isolation by helping participants feel connected with the society and community around them as team mates, opponents or even as spectators. Group cohesion developed among participants of exercise group and sporting members acts as one of the important reasons for exercise. 6. Enhances Value Orientation: Knowledge and understanding about a healthy lifestyle and importance of regular physical activity creates a value orientation among individuals to initiate exercise and later continue with exercise behaviour. Value orientations represent philosophical beliefs. Values inculcated by physical activity and exercise include discipline, enhanced learning process, self-actualization, social responsibility and ecological integration. 7. Cognitive Benefits: Regular aerobic activities lead to a positive improvement in attention control and information processing speed. Exercise can improve brain function and protect memory and thinking skills. Exercise increases heart rate, promoting the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain. It can also stimulate the production of hormones that can enhance the growth of brain cells. This serves to increase the following mental function. (a) Attention Control: Regular physical activity and exercise help improve attention and concentration among people of all ages. Physical exercise at a moderate level also revealed positive effects and benefits among the participants.331 Physical EDUCATION-XII (b) Improves Memory: Physical activities have been known to enhance intelligence especially among children. Even among the elderly, even a small amount of physical activity delays memory loss. Exercise has been shown to reduce changes in the brain that can cause Alzheimer's disease. 8. Mental Health Benefits: A session of jogging or any physical activity has the possibility of mood enhancement and increasing the feel-good factor. Issues associated with depressions, anxiety etc. can be resolved with regular physical activity and exercise. (a) Exercise as therapy for emotional disorder: Physical activity is an effective intervention for various mental disorders like depression and anxiety. Exercise therapy has been able to produce improved mood, enhanced self-esteem and thereby, increase productivity. (a) Fitness as moderator of life stress: Regular physical activity helps in creating a positive attitude towards work by developing higher ability to cope with stress and tension. (a) Runners High: Participating in regular physical activity promotes a high sense of mental alertness, mood upliftment, a feeling of liberation, suppressed discomfort and heightened well-being. 9. Psychological Well-being: Participation in regular physical activity, sports and exercise brings positive changes in the mental and physical well-being of an individual. Exercise leads to changes in blood flow to brain, increase in oxygen consumption, reduction in muscular tension, improved metabolism, creating a feeling of wellbeing. 10. Personality Enhancement: Participation in physical activity and exercise has revealed significant influence on personality. Regular participation and long-term engagement in physical activities especially at young age (before maturity) reflects greater extraversion and stability among participants, which are very important characteristics or traits of personality. 11. Develops Leadership Qualities: Engagement in an exercise programme and participation in sports provides opportunity for individuals to experience adversities and opportunities to learn from compensating various deficiencies like lack of space, inadequate logistics, adverse conditions and still persist with prolonged activities, so developing qualities of leadership. 12. Special Population: (a) Clinical Population: People with intellectual disabilities of all age groups and have found to derive significant benefits from regular participation in 332 Physical EDUCATION-XII physical activity. Psychomotor activities help them in enhancement their skills in activities related to daily living too. (b) Elderly Population: Ageing is a process which is observed to be delayed among the people who are regular participants of physical activity even of an acute nature. Even low intensity bouts of exercise prove to be helpful in slowing down of the ageing process among the elderly. 9.4 Strategies for Enhancing Adherence to Exercise Psychologists and therapists around the world have widely professed the benefits of exercise. Although most people do understand the importance of physical activity and regular exercise, yet a large percentage of them have either not initiated exercise behaviour, or, if a few opted for exercise, they couldn't continue it and dropped out. Therefore, its essential to discuss the strategies for enhancing adherence to exercise. 1. Goal setting: A moderate bout of acute exercise (20-30 min) is considered to be beneficial for improving positive psychological effects of exercise. Exercise performed above lactate threshold (LT) is perceived as unpleasant and the participant may like to discontinue it due to overexertion and discomfort. Therefore, along with setting of SMART - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time based - goals. 2. Adding variety to exercise: Lack of new variety of exercise may lead to boredom and dropping out. Boredom can be tackled with the addition of a variety of exercises and moves that address the same body issues, without loss of therapeutic benefits. Adding variety to the exercise program through adoption of new strategies, changing methods, using new equipment, re- inventing logistics and adding new members can induce fresh energy to the exercising activity, thus enhance adherence to exercise. 3. Social support enhancement: Increasing social support refers to engagement of friends or other members who can contribute towards positive participation in physical activity, exercise and sports because social interaction may help fuel goal achievement and thus produce good results. Creating of a system of buddy partner, youth leader, mentor where members of family, a classmate or a friend or relative can be engaged as a motivator and flag bearer for exercise. 4. Contract: While acute bout of exercise has been associated with positive effects, chronic exercise habits or regular exercise behaviour are important for maintaining these benefits. Therefore, promoting participants for signing an 333 Physical EDUCATION-XII intent to comply through a written contract which has specified expectations, responsibilities and contingencies for behavioural changes have found to be more effective in exercise adherence among the participants. 5. Reinforcement Interventions: Positive as well as negative reinforcement approaches have found to be effective in exercise adherence. Use of incentives and rewards for appreciating attendance and participation or awarding with badges have been proved effective in maintaining exercise behaviour among participants as well as motivation from many to initiate and engage in physical activity. 6. Feedback: Providing feedback to the participants in physical activity provides much needed direction and energy for prolonging and continuing exercise behaviour. Individualized feedback to the participants on the quality of progress and other positive aspects about them can create higher levels of motivation and prove effective towards exercise adherence. 7. Process Orientation: Exercise programmes based on outcome goals or product goals like weight loss, physique and appearance etc. are found to be effective in the initial stages of exercise adoption, but it is difficult to maintain the drive with prolonged exercise behaviour. Helping people to shift from process goals to product goals which are more intrinsic in nature will be more helpful towards becoming lifelong exercisers. 8. Problem Solving: This intervention is based around identifying the obstacles and barriers that stand between the participant and her/his physical activity goals. It is important to generate and implement solutions, evaluate the outcomes and choose different solutions if needed. 9. Health Risk Appraisals: Health risk appraisals of participants provide them with relevant information about their current health, risk factors and level of fitness. This helps to enhance motivation and can be used to monitor changes over time. It can also help with regards to the goal setting process as areas they need to improve are identified. 10. Health Education: It is important that participants seek information from experts on the benefits of exercise, proper exercise techniques and the results that should be expected during exercise. This will ensure that they truly understand why and what they are doing and it will give them the confidence and motivation required to participate in long-term physical activity as well as to prevent injury or discouragement. Research has also expressed the importance of health-care provider's and influence they have over participant's physical activity and the implementation of the aforementioned interventions.334 Physical EDUCATION-XII I.

In this case, Sky Sports' excitable pundit Chris Kamara was Town, caught Town's Jim with his elbow, breaking Melrose's cheekbone in the process.A British heavyweight boxing match ended in chaos after a fighter bit his opponent and was disqualified on Saturday. The 10-round bout between David Price and Kash Ali at Liverpool's MandS Bank Arena came to its abrupt conclusion the 27-year- old Ali grabbed hold of his opponent before falling on top of him. He then bit Price near his rib cage. Do try to remember any sports match where players have been highlighted in media, newspapers or by commentators for hitting the opponents or abusing the officials, spectators or their own team members and being referred to as displaying unsporting and aggressive behaviour. Surely, we can recollect various occasions when athletes' behaviour on the field has been aggressive. Why do athletes become aggressive on or off the field? What are the different behaviour outcomes associated with aggressive behaviour? How can these be reduced? These are the few important questions which most of the teachers, coaches and even parents, who deal with athletes of different age groups are worried about. Let us try to understand the concept of aggression as accepted by the world of psychology and used by sports professionals in the past several years. Do you know? Aggression - Aggression is behaviour that is hostile and violates other people's rights. Reactive aggressive behaviour is unplanned and impulsive, and is usually a response to feelings of anger, fear, or a need to retaliate against someone. Proactive aggressive behaviour is calculated and planned action that has some motive other than harming someone. According to the American Psychological Association, aggression is a type of behaviour aimed at causing physical or psychological harm to another. Most psychologist refer to aggression as any behaviour intended to harm or injure any living being who is trying to avoid it. This definition includes three important features. First, aggression is a behaviour that can be seen. It is not an emotion that occurs inside a person, 336 Physical EDUCATION-XII such as anger. Second, aggression is intentional. Aggression is not accidental. It is a deliberate behaviour to harm or injure and can be either physical or psychological, ie., hitting, pushing or abusing someone purposely, with an intent to hurt. Third, the victim wants to avoid the harm. Sport psychologist Gill (2000) produced a four-part criterion which aimed to help us interpret whether an action is aggressive in sport. His criteria were: h There must be physical or verbal behaviour. h It must involve causing harm or injury whether it is physical or psychological. h It must be directed toward another living thing. h There must be the intention to cause harm or injury. Few more definitions of aggression: Behaviour that results in personal injury or destruction of property. (Bandura, 1973)8 Behaviour directed towards the goal of harming or injuring another living being who is motivated to avoid such treatment. (Baron and Richardson, 1994)9 The intentional infliction of some form of harm on others. (Baron and Byrne, 2000)10 During last many years much debate and deliberations have been made in the field of sports and exercise psychology as well as sports sciences towards an acceptable definition of aggression. An acceptable concept of aggression along with its two types of aggression has been cited by Husman and Silva in 1984 as 'hostile' and 'instrumental' aggression to differentiate between two types of aggression. 9.5.1 TYPES OF AGGRESSION 1. Hostile Aggression: The term 'hostile' refers to being 'opposed', therefore hostile aggression refers to violent and angry behaviour where the intent and primary goal is to harm the other. A boxer who punches the opponent below the belt with the primary aim of injuring him because he is losing or an athlete who uses abusive words to mentally harm another player who has angered him with better skills are examples of hostile aggression. Hostile aggression is a type of aggression that is committed in response to a perceived threat or insult. It is unplanned, reactionary, impulsive, and fuelled by intense emotion as opposed to desire to achieve a goal. Aggressors typically 337 Physical EDUCATION-XII have a sense of a loss of control during outbursts, and characteristically experience physiological hyperarousal. Thus, it is also sometimes known as reactive aggression. In the examples given above, the intent of action is to physically or mentally harm the other person due to dislike, enmity or due to the person being on the opposing team or side. Along with the intent, the goal is also to harm the other, therefore non-legitimate measures or illegal methods to physically or mentally harm the other person are employed. Prospect of Losing Makes Me Aggressive, says Viswanathan Anand India Today | 21 June 2012 Speaking at a function for young chess players, the world chess champion Vishanathan Anand said, \"The insecurity of loosing made me aggressive. I don't show it openly but the prospect of losing to some player is so horrifying your might want an extra bit.\" \"Against Topalov (in 2010 world championship) I was able to channel that feeling into a willingness to play long games. I was able to feel motivated.\" \"The hunger is still there to go for the next one,\" says Anand. \"I am often asked how I maintain my motivation even after five world titles. Frankly, I never took to chess because it was on some kind o f a checklist. I will keep playing till I enjoy it. The desire is still there,\" he said. (https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/other-sports/story/viswanathan-anand- chess- world-champion-niit-delhi-110525-2012-07-21) 2. Instrumental Aggression: The term 'instrumental' refers to 'serve as a means' ie., aggression is being used just as an instrument to gain advantage or win and not because of anger or enmity. Therefore, instrumental aggression refers to aggressive behaviour meant or used to attain some non-aggressive goals like winning, getting money, prestige or gaining any other advantage. Instrumental aggression is harmful behaviour engaged in without provocation to obtain an outcome or coerce others. An instrumental aggression does consist of an aggressive intent to harm an opponent physically or psychologically without necessarily being angry. Instrumental aggression is a behaviour directed at the target as a means to an end. For example, elbowing and injuring a player to gain a competitive advantage, or late tackling to stop an opponent from scoring a goal. 338 Physical EDUCATION-XII Development of Relational Aggression A science brief published in Psychological Science Agenda in August 2013 by APA deals with development of relational aggression associated with young children due to media exposure. The research work after examining different types of aggressive behaviour discussed the two types of aggression. Along with physical aggression like kicking, pushing, it mentions about second type of aggression known as Relational Aggression. According to the study, relational aggressive behaviour has an intent to hurt, harm and injure others using the relationship. It also uses threat of relationship against other individuals through social exclusion, friendship withdrawal, spreading rumours, false news etc. are used as goals for the intent of harming. https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2013/07-08/relational-aggression An important distinction between hostile and instrumental aggression is that instrumental aggression is learned behaviour, where hostile aggression is impulsive. In the majority of situations, neither is an ideal response or solution to your problem. From the above concept of aggression, we reach a consensus that from the perspective of a sports psychologist, there is no 'good' aggression or 'bad' aggression. Any behaviour with an intent to physically or mentally harm another individual is aggression and is not acceptable on the sports field. An important concept mentioned by the sports psychologists is assertive behaviour. Most athletic events involve interaction between people. There is some interchange of words, feelings and behaviours. While confrontation is often manifest through assertion and aggression, these two approaches have distinguishing factors and lead to very different outcomes. Assertive behaviour is generally seen as a positive form of expression, whereas aggression is a negative form of expression. Assertive behaviour has its roots in respect for the other individual, while aggression does not; for example, if you voice your opinion through aggressive acts, you are conveying that your feelings are more important. Aggression also is often counter-productive, while assertive behaviour leads to a more positive resolution. Finally, assertive behaviour is all about standing up for yourself and your values in an unthreatening manner, while aggression puts others down.339 Physical EDUCATION-XII Hostile Instrumental Assertive Intent Harm or Suffering Harm or Suffering No harm Primary Goal Harm or injure Win or advantage Win or Advantage Process Non-Legitimate Non-Legitimate Legitimate Emotion Anger No Anger Unusual effort and energy expenditure Explanation Self-justification instead of apologyOffer apologies Aggression Management : A Challenge in Sports Behaviour of aggression by players is an area of concern for coaches, parents across the society which need to be minimized if not stopped or curtailed completely. Few of the strategies which could be effective in managing aggression among athletes have been mentioned below: 1. Social acceptable discharge medium: Aggression is an inborn drive, according to the drive theory people have the innate instinct to be aggressive and it builds up till it is discharged (catharsis). There need to be opportunities and space for people to displace or express aggression through a socially acceptable means, for example bout of aerobics, swimming, martial arts kicking pads or punching bags. 2. Positive Reinforcement: Aggression has a circular effect, one act lead to another because the people especially athletes learn the way to release it. The circle need to be broken by positive reinforcement and not letting it continue. Providing space for players to speak and express their opinion is an effective example. 3. Negative Reinforcement: During competitions, any act of violence should not be tolerated or exempted and must have strict rules of punishment for offending players and the team, whereas fair play point can be awarded for players and teams showing restrains during aggressive situations. 4. Modelling: People emulate their heros and seniors, young players grow up watching them receive awards, prizes and recognitions, therefore try to copy their behaviour to a large extent. Hence aggressive behaviour should not be promoted or appreciated at the top level and by the seniors as it will help in reducing the trickle effect.340 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5. Training and role playing: Athletes can learn to control their hostile feeling along with anger through role play and training with experts. Training is effective in regulating the emotion of anger that leads to hostile behaviour . 6. External Cues: Stimulus which puts preference of winning over participation can lead to various hostile as well as instrumental aggression. Coaches, parents must focus and promote participation over performance, appreciate fare play than winning, discuss fun over results. I. Tick the correct answers 1.

Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Differentiate between Hostile aggression, Instrumental aggression and Assertiveness? 2. Describe various reactions of athletes which can be classified as aggression and assertive behaviours? Answers to Personality recode the reverse-scored items (i.e., recode a 7 with a 1, a 6 with a 2, a 5 with a 3, etc.). The reverse scored items are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. 3. Take the AVERAGE of the two items (the standard item and the recoded reverse- scored item) that make up each scale. 4. The maximal score can be 14 and minimum score 1. Example using the Agreeableness scale: A participant has scores of 5 on item 1 (Extraverted, enthusiastic) and and 2 on item 6 (Reserved, quiet). Start with recoding the reverse-score items (ie. Item 2 score was 5) replacing the 5 with 3. Second, take the average of the score for item 7 (eg.6) and the recoded score for item 2. So the Agreeableness score would be: (6 + 3)/2 = 4.5. 9.5 Psychological Attributes in Sports Sports scientist from around the world have researched about unique attributes of successful athletes and elite sportsmen to understand factors enabling athletes to perform successfully and reach optimal level of performance in their athletic career. In sport psychology, much attention has been given to exploring and understanding the psychological attributes of elite athletes with the aim of influencing athlete talent and development. It is widely acknowledged that psychological attributes have an important role in athletes' lives and can influence athletes' performance, behaviour, and psychological well-being. Attributes are perceived to be essential for performance effectiveness and athlete development , where athletes abilities to perform, understand and manage training and competition environment and other important factors have many positive effects. From several attributes which are considered to be essential, self-esteem, mental imagery, self talk and goal setting is being discussed in this chapter. 342 Physical EDUCATION-XII 9.5.1 SELF-ESTEEM The concept of self-esteem generally refers to a person's evaluation of, or attitude toward, him- or herself. Self-esteem is centered around a belief in the self, respect for the self, and confidence in the self. An equally important component of self- esteem is esteem from others. That is, the respect and admiration others bestow on a performer is equally motivational. Because pursuit of excellence is a comparative process, esteem by others is reflective of one's performance. Hence, it is critical that the performer seeks esteem from others. According to American Psychological Association (APA), Self-esteem refers to the degree to which the qualities and characteristics contained in one's self-concept are perceived to be positive. It reflects a person's physical self-image, view of his or her accomplishments and capabilities, and values and perceived success in living up to them, as well as the ways in which others view and respond to that person. The more positive the cumulative perception of these qualities and characteristics, the higher one's self-esteem. A reasonably high degree of self-esteem is considered an important ingredient of mental health, whereas low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness are common depressive symptoms. The coach needs to instill in the performers the desire for esteem from others. ''athletic participation is associated with increases in self-esteem and positive feelings about the body.'' William Russell's work suggests that this probably relates to one ''dimension'' or aspect of self-esteem\u2014the physical (that is, how we judge our own bodies compared with others' bodies). Other dimensions of self-esteem might be intellectual, competitive, congenial (whether others like you, for instance), all, in some way, rating how we value aspects of ourselves. Research revealed that the pursuit of self-esteem is a powerful motive behind marathon runners, cyclists, and other exercisers. A great many studies have documented self-esteem's positive association with EXERCISE BEHAVIOR, while others have noted the RELATIONSHIP between low self-esteem and EATING DISORDERS, SELF-ESTEEM, OBESITY , and several forms of DEPENDENCE. Self-esteem is popularly used interchangeably with self-evaluation and high self-esteem with, among other terms, self-respect, self-assurance, and dignity, though its closest neighbor conceptually is PHYSICAL SELF-WORTH; for many scholars. Regular exercise has been shown to be related to increased self-esteem. 343 Physical EDUCATION-XII 9.5.2 MENTAL IMAGERY Mental Imagery is a psychological skill used widely in sports for enhancing performance of wide variety of motor skills. Mental Imagery may be defined as using one's senses to create or recreate an experience or visual image in the mind that at times may seem to be as real as seeing the image with our physical eyes. An expansion of this brief definition clarifies that: (a) an image can be created in the mind in the absence of any external stimuli, (b) an image may involve one or more physical senses, and (c) an image is created from information stored in the sensory store, working memory, or long-term memory. The use of the 'mind's eye', or imagery, is considered important both in stress management and in focusing athletes on their task. Imagery, or the mental creation or re-creation of sensory experiences in the mind, is the most popular mental training technique used by athletes. Imagery can be used in various ways to aid relaxation and focusing. Sport psychologists distinguish between external imagery, in which athletes picture themselves from outside performing, and internal imagery, in which they view themselves performing from inside their own body. A good example of internal imagery is in the mental rehearsal of sporting techniques. When we imagine carrying out a sporting technique, the nervous system and muscles react in a similar manner to that expected if we were actually carrying out the technique. This means that imagery helps us to learn and practise techniques. Another reason mental imagery works is that it de-sensitises us to the anxiety of competitive situations. The more we are exposed to things that cause us anxiety - whether in real life or in our imagination - the less anxiety they cause. Coaches from around the world have also indicated that they use imagery more than any other mental training technique and felt that imagery was the most useful technique that they used with their athletes. All athletes have the potential to increase their imagery abilities through systematic practice, with increases in imagery ability enhancing the effectiveness of imagery training. How to practice Imagery: Mental imagery techniques have been implemented with various different models and strategies. On of the very popular model is PETTLEP framework. PETTLEP model for mental imagery intervention framework is an acronym representing a seven point 344 Physical EDUCATION-XII checklist of guidelines to be followed when devising an imagery intervention that can provide an effective execution of imagery interventions for athletes. These are Physical, Environment, Task, Timing, Learning, Emotion, and Perspective. Mental Imagery intervention and training can be effective in enhancing performance. Benefits of imagery Athletes use imagery for many different reasons, including skill learning and practice, strategy development and rehearsal, competition preparation, including familiarization with venues and mental warm-ups, mental skill development and refinement, and coping with various sport stressors or obstacles, such as injuries, heavy training, and distractions h Acquisition and improved performance of skills and strategies h Modification of attention focus and other cognitions. h Regulation of arousal and anxiety. h Effective in enhancing self-confidence, motivation and self-control 9.5.3 SELF TALK Self-talk is defined as overt or covert personal dialogue in which the athlete interprets feelings, perceptions, and convictions and gives himself instructions and reinforcement. Self-talk is an effective technique to control thoughts and to influence feelings. Thoughts and feelings can influence self-confidence as well as performance. Sports scientists support for the use of self-talk strategies to improve performance in exercise and sport tasks. Every athlete during any action or performance may have thoughts that come into their mind, especially during competition it can be either positive or negative, these thoughts are a form of self-talk. The athlete must learn to control his thoughts and to structure them to his advantage. This is effectively accomplished through self-talk, the athlete must carefully pre-select the actual words and phrases used during self-talk and consider them for maximum effectiveness. The coach or sport psychologist can assist the athlete in this regard. For self-talk to be effective, it is suggested that self-talk statements be : (a) brief and phonetically simple, (b) logically associated with the skill involved, and (c) compatible with the sequential timing of the task being performed. 345 Physical EDUCATION-XII Types of self talk Three primary categories of self-talk include task-specific statements, encouragement and effort, and mood words. These three categories are further clarified below: 1. Task-specific statements relating to technique category of self-talk refers to words or statements that reinforce technique. For example, in the tennis volley, the word \"turn\" might be used in association with preparation for stepping into the volley. 2. Encouragement and effort category of self-talk refers to words or statements that provide self-encouragement to persevere or to try harder. For example, the phrase \"You can do it\" might be used in preparation for an anticipated play at home plate in softball. 3. Mood words category of self-talk refers to words that precipitate an increase in mood or arousal. For example, the mood words \"hard\" or \"blast\" might be used in conjunction with a play in football or soccer. Benefits of Self -Talk 1. Building and developing self-efficacy : Self- talk is effective in stimulating thoughts and feelings that lead to the belief that a person is competent and able to perform a task efficiently and effectively. 2. Skill acquisition : Learning a new skill requires persistence, effort, and dedication. Self-talk can be effective in helping the athlete to continue to work hard in order to achieve a worthwhile goal. In becoming proficient in a new skill, the athlete changes bad habits and learns new good habits. 3. Creating and changing mood : Effective use of mood words can either create a desired mood or change an undesirable one. Words are powerful motivators because of the mean- ing that they convey. In an effort to increase power needed to get out of a sprinter's block quickly, the athlete might say the words \"go\" or \"explode\" as she powers forward. 4. Controlling effort : Athletes need to be able to sustain effort throughout long practices or competitions. Self-talk can suggest to the athlete the need to increase effort when it is needed or to sustain effort when it is deemed beneficial for performance learning or en- hancement. During long practices, boredom can be a challenge that must be overcome. Self-talk words and phrases such as \"pick it up,\" \"stay with it,\" or \"pace\" can be effective in controlling effort.346 Physical EDUCATION-XII 5. Focusing attention or concentration : As with maintaining effort, it is often necessary to remind yourself to stay focused or to concentrate on the task at hand. Athletes often get tired, and when this happens, their con- centration can easily wander. If the mind wanders when the coach is teaching an important concept relating to the athlete's role. 9.5.4 GOAL SETTING Goal setting is a mental training technique that can be used to increase an individual's commitment towards achieving a specific standard of proficiency on a task within a specified time. It is a process of establishing a level of performance proficiency which should be reached within a prescribed time period is known as goal setting. It has proven effectiveness in enhancing performance and productivity in several contexts, including employee exercise programs, competitive sport, and industrial organizations, and provides a basis for both increasing a person's SELF-EFFICACY and for instilling a task with intrinsic worth. An aspiring athlete may set goals intuitively at the outset of a career, for example, to execute a decent pass, sustain a rally, or just finish a race. As a career progresses, athletes typically define specific goals, sometimes establishing a long-term GOAL SETTING. GOAL that can be broken into less ambitious short-term goals, setting up a kind of hierarchy of goals to be achieved one by one. An office worker might enroll in a company FITNESS program, setting goals related to a broad class of health-related behaviors, so exercise goals are related to complementary dietary aims and objectives such as walking instead of driving to work four times a week and taking the stairs every morning. Goal setting works because it focuses attention on specific task demands, increases effort and intensity, encourages persistence when adversity is encountered, and promotes the development of strategies and problem solving to move toward goal achievement. When compared to 'no goals' or 'do-your-best goals', specific goal setting enhances athletes' performance. There are different types of goals and over-all effectiveness of goal setting depends on type of goal being selected by the athlete in different situation, and coaches can surely help them identify suitable goal types and peruse toward it. In sports, athletes focus majorly on three types of goals, Performance goal, Process goal and Outcome goals. The important distinction between outcome, performance, and process goals indicates that mental skills are enhanced when athletes focus on the right goals at the right time Let's try to understand these different types of goals: 347 Physical EDUCATION-XII 1. Outcome Goal: give priority and importance to the final outcome of a sporting event. Thy are uncontrollable, yet attractive and exciting, they are useful in enhancing motivation for the exhausting physical and mental preparation needed to achieve typical outcomes goals, such as winning championships or medals. Outcome goals are the successful implementations of process and performance goals. They keep us in perspective and help to stay focused on the bigger picture. Examples of outcome goals may include winning a sport, losing the desired amount of weight, or scoring a top rank in school. 2. Performance Goal: focus on achievements of athletes relatively independent of other competitors or teammates. Therefore, they are more flexible and controllable for athletes, which allows them to continually raise and lower goal difficulty levels to remain challenged and successful in their pursuit of exciting outcome goals. These goals help in tracking progress and give us a reason for continuing the hard work. For example, focus on striking a score of 100 in an innings or making 50 passes in a match rather giving importance on wining or loosing is an example of performance goal. Performance goals may help us in quantifying our efforts and measuring the progress and also achieve outcome goals in the process. 3. Process Goal: focus on specific behaviour or task throughout a competition, training or specific task demans in productive ways, such as occupying their minds with key verbal cues that lock in optimal performance images and plans. These behaviour reflects proper and effective techniques for executing a specific athletic task and plans. For example, to focus on the defender rather than ball or focus on position of arm toward target while shooting, or focusing on toe positing while jogging to avoid inward movement are process goals, when repeated for a period of time, it should help in attaining performance goal and outcome goals. Principles of Goal Setting 1. Make goals specific, measurable, and observable. 2. Clearly identify time constraints. 3. Use moderately difficult goals; they are superior to either easy or very difficult goals. 4. Write goals down and regularly monitor progress. 5. Use a mix of process, performance, and outcome goals. 6. Use short-range goals to achieve long-range goals.348 Physical EDUCATION-XII 7. Set team as well as individual performance goals. 8. Set practice as well as competition goals. 9. Make sure goals are internalized by the athlete. 10. Consider personality and individual differences in goal setting. Characteristic of effective goal: The acronym SMART has been used by sport psychologists to help athletes remember five important characteristics of well-stated goals Specific goal is one that focuses exactly on the goal to be achieved. For example, \"shooting 80 percent accuracy in free- throw shooting\" is specific, but \"becoming a better basketball player\" is not. Measurable goal is one that you can quantify, in the sense that you know exactly how close you are to achieving the goal. The general goal \"to become a better server in tennis\" is not measurable, because you don't know when you have achieved the goal. Action-Oriented Goals are there things that we can do to make this happen. Action- oriented goals have action steps and action plans with detailing of what, when and how to do. Making clear the key actions required to achieve a goal helps everyone see how their part of the work is connected to other parts of the work and to a larger purpose. This information through action-oriented goals helps athletes stay focused and energized rather than become fragmented and uncertain. Realistic goals focus on setting the target which are attainable and withing the capability and capacity of the athlete. The goal set should be able to stretch athlete toward improvement, but it should not be out of reach or it will be not motivating enough for an athlete to strive for. Setting of goals that are too high are discouraging while setting goals too low leaves the athlete dissatisfied with the task. Timely : A well-stated goal should be timely in the sense that it specifies time constraints associated with the goal, but also timely in the sense that it reflects an appropriate amount of time to accomplish the goal. We make the goals of athletes timely by creating deadline for the specific task and try to meet the deadline well on time. 349 Physical EDUCATION-XII Benefits of Goal Setting It is important for the athletes and the coaches to understand how Goal Setting can be beneficial for performance enhancement process.

Describe important of self-talk by athletes in sports ? 350 Physical EDUCATION-XII Case Study Read the following Case Study carefully. A state sports team was winning all the tournaments and was highly praised for its efforts. An interview with the team to find and explore the reasons for its continuous success highlighted the following reasons. As per the report, the team had many new players who were wellorganised, responsible, self-disciplined and precise in their task and contributed to the success of the team. The Captain had been selected by the team members themselves, and he was most interactive, sociable and optimistic on the field as well as off it. This made him a good leader . The best part of the team was that, all its senior players were helpful and cooperative with their juniors and were always willing to listen to them. The team's coach mentioned few essential elements that had contributed to the team's success. According to him, the ability to motivate people plays a crucial role in the team's success more often than the technical skills, and this is what separates a good coach from an average one. The coach also referred to occasions when players went through the phase of lack of intrinsic motivation. The coach realised that while there are some athletes have an innate drive to constantly strive for success and enjoy their task, there are others who seem to lack internal motivation and need extrinsic factors like rewards, prize, money etc. to create the required drive or required behaviour. The team's psychologist spoke about the aggressive behaviour among the team players against the opponents. It was interesting to listen to various instances where the players had instigated opponents or charged at them violently, in anger, but had later tried to justify their actions. Sometimes, players were found to be abusing opponents not in anger, but to get an advantage or for the sake of winning, though this behaviour is not acceptable and they were awarded punishments as per the code of conduct and rules of sport. Read the above story of a sports team and answer the following questions? 1. Which trait best reflected the personality of junior players? (a) Introvert (b) Conscientiousness (c) Neuroticism351 Physical EDUCATION-XII 2. Which member of the team reflected most of the Extrovert traits? (a) Coach (b) New Members (c) Captain 3. Which type of players were recommended for special training with Sports Psychologist? (a) Extrovert (a) Introvert (a) Mesomorph 4. The team sports psychologist is referring to which type of behaviour as non- threatening but confident. (a) Assertive (a) Hostile (a) Instrumental 5. Which are the two types of motivation discussed in the above story? Which, according to you, is the better form? Why? References 1. Sivarajan.

FLYING SIKH, HIS TOUGH FITNESS ROUTINE Milkha Singh was born in 1929 in Gobindpura village in the Muzaffargarh district of Pakistan. He spent most of his childhood in poverty. Singh lost his 14 siblings to poverty, poor health, and lack of medical attention. During the 1947 partition, he became an orphan and moved to India. He earned his living by working in a roadside restaurant before joining the army in 1951. During his military training, he realized his sprinting abilities. Hawaldar Gurudev Singh persuaded him to run a cross-country race as a part of military training. He practiced hard and came to the limelight during the National Games at Patiala in 1956. He broke the 200 m and 400 m records in the National Games at Cuttack in 1958.TRAINING IN SPORTS354 Physical EDUCATION-XII Milkha Singh, the Flying Sikh, remained passionate about his fitness routine throughout his life, including playing 18 holes of golf at the 7,202-yard-long Chandigarh Golf Course and running light sprints at Sukhna Lake; the legendary athlete would also offer his insights to budding and national athletes. 'No royal road goes till success. To reach the world level, I at least did not find any such road. Running is such a meditation that one must leave all the world's goods to achieve success and make your body ready to take on the challenge. Concentration, strategy, and effort are long processes. I used to run 365 days a year, whether on rainy or windy day; nothing could stop me from running. I did not find any work more important than my practice, and there was a time when I would see myself running even in my dreams,\" Singh writes in his memoir. From running three miles ranging from running the first mile slowly and then increasing pace each mile before his training in the off-season schedule, Singh would run three 400m races followed by one slow-paced 200m race followed by three 400m races fast followed by another 200m race slowly in the morning. During the season schedule, 10 sprints of 150m on Mondays, six 200m sprints on Tuesdays, four 300m sprints on Wednesdays, two 500m races on Thursdays, two 600m races on Friday, running 350m or 500m once on Saturdays followed by complete rest on Sundays. According to the memoir, Singh would alternate training days to adjust to various strategies during his Olympic training. He is the only athlete to win a gold medal in the 400 meters race at the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. Milkha Singh set a national record in the 1960 Olympics by winning fourth place in the 400m race in 45.73 seconds. This record remained for almost 40 years.1 During his sports career, Padma Shree Milkha Singh achieved many medals, including the gold medal in 200 meters in 1958 Asian Games, 400 meters in 1958 Asian Games, 440 yards in 1958 Asian Games, 400 meters in 1962 Asian Games, the 4\u00d7400-meter relay in 1962 Asian Games, and silver in 400 meters 1964 Calcutta National Games.2 Apart from these achievements, in 1960, he was persuaded by then Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to run against Abdul Khaliq in Pakistan, whom he defeated. He then received the title of \"the Flying Sikh\" by General Ayub.3355 Physical EDUCATION-XII Introduction Talent identification and development have become increasingly relevant in sports performance (Sarmento, Anguera, Pereira, Ara\u00fajo, 2018), especially in the last 20 years. A significant body of scientific research discusses longitudinal and nonlinear talent identification and development processes, the qualities that underpin elite sports performance, and how coaches could facilitate talented athletes' development through the sports system. Discussion Select anyone sports of your choice and identify four qualities required for optimum performance in those sports. Write down the advantages of the qualities in the table below. Discuss why talent identification is essential in sports and games S.No. Qualities Advantage Why this will improve your sports performance Concept of Talent Identification and Talent Development in Sports Talent can be defined as adequate aptitude or ability in one direction, above the normal average. Thus, someone who has talent can do something without trying hard. Talent identification can also be defined as \"the process by which children are encouraged to participate in the sport they are most likely to succeed, based on selected parameters. These parameters are designed to predict performance capacity, considering the child's current level of fitness and maturity.\" As talent identification is often confused with latent development, keeping the above definition clearly in mind is necessary. Identifying is the first step in progressing from beginner to a successful international athlete; talent development follows this as the next critical phase in achieving sporting success. The figure below illustrates the various stages comprising the long-term talent identification system in sports and games.356 Physical EDUCATION-XII Table 10.1: Talent Identification System Related to Talent Development and Recreational Sports The best way to ensure that a talent identification programme reaches the maximum possible number of children is to cooperate closely with schools. The first stage of the process could occur between the ages of 10 and 12, using essential fields tests that are easy to administer. These tests should be carried out in schools and administered by the teachers if the selection is made early. Those who seem talented could then be encouraged to participate in general training in schools and clubs. The second phase of the selection procedure could occur between 13 and 16. Again, the tests should be carried out in schools and be easy to administer. Those selected at this stage would then be invited to undergo more sophisticated tests, administered by specialists in the area or state centres, consisting of field tests and laboratory tests depending on the facilities available. The test battery should include background information, training history, competition results, anthropometric measurements, and psychological and physiological tests. Finally, those selected should be allocated to elite junior programmes on an event- group basis. Those who show promising results in the second-stage tests but are not ultimately selected should be encouraged to participate in club training programmes. There should always be the possibility of entering the selection to produce good competition performance. All the tested youths should be encouraged to participate in recreational sports. It is essential to promote the youth competition structure in developing countries. Tests in these countries should be adapted to take into account local conditions, but should be standardized across the whole country .357 Physical EDUCATION-XII Process of Talent Identification and Development is classified into five stages as follows: 1. Talent Detection: This is the discovery of potential performers who are not currently involved in the sport in question. 2. Talent Identification: Recognizing participants with the potential at an earlier age to become elite performers in the future. 3. Talent Development: Provides athletes with a suitable learning environment to accelerate or realize their potential 4. Talent Selection: The ongoing process of identifying individuals at various stages of development who demonstrate pre-requisite performance levels. 5. Talent Transfer: Focuses on transfer from one sport to another sport where there are more significant opportunities to succeed These five steps are common across sporting in Talent Identification and Development System and are often operationalized within the everyday practice (i.e., identification or selection for the next step of a programme is influenced by performance in the previous development environment). Importance of Talent identification h Discovery of the great talent h Recognition of the hidden talent h By recognizing the talent at the early stage, the children can show their skills at their extreme h Talent identification helps in finding a significant asset for the country Components of Talent Identification The main components of Talent Identification (TID) can be divided into the following categories: h Physiological attributes h Physical attributes h Psychological attributes h Technical/Tactical attributes h Results h Intangibles358 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you Know Steps for talent and its promotion include: Step I Aim: Screening of children for essential training stage Screening is done based on: - h Health and physique h General physical performance capacity h Motives interest in mental capabilities h Interests of parents etc. Step-II After 3-4 years of basic training Aim: selection for a group of sports (Advance training stage).

'Talent identification is the first step in the progression from beginner to successful international athlete' Elaborate. 3. Classify the Process of Talent Identification and Development in detail. Introduction to Sports Training Cycle - Micro, Meso, Macro Cycle Several planning systems are available in sports training; a sportsperson has to follow all the procedures to ensure high performance in a specific sport. When we look into the sports training planning format, we will be able to find plans like a long-term plan, Olympic plan, annual plan, sectional plan, and day's plan. All the projects form a unified training basis, and the pursuit of several years indicates the main line of development. Training content is more concrete and specific in a plan of shorter duration. All the short duration sports training plans are worked according to the requirements of more extended duration plans, called long-term plans. It is the largest unit in the system of planned training. The duration of this plan is approximately 8 to 15 years. This plan begins with the basic training of the sportsperson and continues until the attainment of optimum performance standards in a specific sport.360 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do you know? An Olympic plan is divided into small time units. Another set of planning most common in sports training is a sectional plan. Sectional plans are termed as plans of phases, periods, and weeks. Different periods of the training year, namely preparatory periods, competition periods, and transitional periods; various training cycles, i.e., microcycle, mesocycle, and macrocycle, are all sectional plans. They are prepared based on the needs and recommendations of the annual plan. These plans being shorter in duration, the details regarding the training of different performance components are more specific. The three cycles of training are: (a) Micro Cycle: The duration of this cycle is 3 to 10 days and is thus considered the shortest cycle of training. In the case of an intermediate and high- performance sportsperson, this cycle lasts 5 to 10 days. The last day of the micro cycle provides active recovery and relaxation to the sportsperson to prepare him for training in the next micro cycle. Even though 5 to 10 days is not adequate to achieve most training tasks, it forms an integral part of the entire training process. The following three proportions of high and medium or low load are adopted in the microcycle. W 1:1, i.e., every day of the high load is followed by a day of medium load. W 2:1, i.e., every two days of high load are followed by a day of medium load.361 Physical EDUCATION-XII W 3:1, i.e., every three days of high load are followed by a medium or low load day. (b) Meso Cycle: The duration of this training cycle is 3 to 6 weeks and is thus termed a cycle of medium duration. The purpose of this cycle is to tackle specific training tasks. These tasks are: W Learning and acquiring mastery of skills W Maintenance and stabilization of performance W Development of physical and motor fitness components W Preparation for a specific competition W Attainment of optimal level of performance W Preparation for the next mesocycle by providing recovery and relaxation. A mesocycle of 4 weeks is considered the best because this is the minimum period within which significant change is affected in the physiological and psychological factors. The last week of the training mesocycle is considered a transitional phase that ensures recovery and relaxation. (c) Macro Cycle: The duration of this cycle is 3 to 12 months and it is, thus, considered the most extended cycle of training. The purpose of the macrocycle is to enable the sportsperson to improve the performance capacity to put up an optimal performance, at a specific time, during the competition. A macrocycle comprises several mesocycles; the last mesocycle ensures recovery and realization for a smooth transition to the following macrocycle. Do you Know Anders Ericsson, a psychologist, writes that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. In other words, an athlete training for 5 hours a day, seven days a week over 365 days a year, would take about 5.5 years to acquire expertise in their chosen sport or game.362 Physical EDUCATION-XII Extension Activity Preparing for an Annual Zonal Competition is long-term planning, It consists of various stages Working in groups, interview ten sports persons from your school, or another nearby school, who have participated in CBSE's Zonal Competitions (or any equivalent Competition).

All players diligently follow the periodization process. Why do coaches and players follow periodization cycles during training to attain good results in a championship? 2. Identify the specific training tasks in Mesocycle? Strength, Endurance, and Speed Strength Strength is one of the most crucial motor components of fitness and plays a significant role in sporting events as it is a direct product of muscle contraction. It is a conditional ability that depends on the energy liberation process in the muscles. The amount of force muscles can produce to complete a task is known as strength. In simple words, strength is the ability of a group of muscles to overcome resistance. As all the movements in sports are caused by muscular contraction, it can be said that strength is part and parcel of all motor abilities, technical skills, and tactical actions. Definition h According to H. Singh, \"strength is the ability to overcome resistance or to act against resistance.\" h According to Barrow and McGee, \"strength is the capacity of the whole body or any of its parts to exert force.\" h According to Mathews, \"The force that a muscle or group of muscles can exert against a resistance in one maximum effort.\". Different sports need different types of strength, and the requirement and application of strength in sports differs according to sports-specific needs. Commonly, strength is classified and studied into two forms: static and dynamic stability .364 Physical EDUCATION-XII Static Strength Static strength is also called isometric strength. It is the ability of the muscles to act against resistance. Static strength can be measured with a dynamometer. This type of strength is not seen directly. Some static strength is not usually applied in sports, but it is used in phases in weightlifting. Example: plank or yoga asanas. Dynamic Strength Dynamic strength is also known as isotonic strength. In pull-ups and push-ups, we required dynamic strength. In performing such a workout, there is a diminishing tendency in dynamic strength, and as a result, muscles refuse to do work after some time. The man cannot do even one extra pull-up or push-up at this stage. Movements are visible when someone uses dynamic strength. It is recognized by rhythmic muscular contractions with changes in muscle length, using a relatively small force. Example: push up and full squats. Dynamic strength can be divided into three parts. 365 Physical EDUCATION-XII a. Maximum Strength The muscle can overcome maximum resistance in a single repetition or muscular contraction. Maximum strength means exerting force against resistance in the maximal effort. A muscle can overcome the resistance of maximum stimulus intensity in a single muscular contraction. Though maximum strength does not hold much importance in most sports but is undoubtedly required in sports like long jump, shot put, javelin throw, weightlifting, discus throw, etc. These sporting events require the tacking of heavy resistance.4 b. Explosive Strength. The muscles can overcome resistance as fast as possible. In other words, it can be said that it is a combination of strength and speed. Explosive strength is always used in motor movements and is a form of dynamic strength. Muscle can get over the resistance of sub-maximum intensity of stimulus as possible. Explosive strength is particular to the nature of movement and is greatly influenced by motor coordination, i.e., inter and intramuscular coordination. This strength is mainly used in volleyball spiking, jumps in basketball, sprint events, etc.5366 Physical EDUCATION-XII c. Strength Endurance The muscle can overcome resistance under fatigue or for as long as possible. Same as explosive strength, strength endurance is a product of two motor abilities: strength and endurance. A muscle can get over the resistance of a medium-intensity stimulus for as long as possible. Strength endurance can be a form of static or dynamic strength depending upon whether the movement is isometric (static) or isotonic (active). This strength is mainly used in long-distance races of athletics, swimming, distance cycling, etc.6 Do you Know To improve muscle strength, you should attempt to perform between 2 and 5 sets of approximately 2 to 6 repetitions at an intensity of at least 85 percent of your 1RM for that specific exercise. For individuals trying to improve muscle power, the ideal is to perform 3 to 6 sets of 3 to 6 repetitions at 30 to 60 percent of 1RM. A lighter percentage (30-45 percent of 1RM) should be used with power exercises that allow for the release of the mass being lifted (e.g., bench press throws). The proper rest period between each set for strength and power exercises is two and five minutes. 367 Physical EDUCATION-XII Improving muscular endurance requires approximately 2 or 3 sets of 15 to 25 repetitions. Muscular endurance exercises are performed at an intensity below 65 percent of 1RM, with short rest periods of one to two minutes for sets with higher repetitions and less than one minute for moderate repetitions. Finally, those looking to improve muscle mass (hypertrophy) should do 3 to 6 sets of 6 to 12 repetitions at 67 to 85 percent of 1RM, with rest periods of between 30 and 90 seconds. Table 6.1 provides a summary of these numbers. Methods to Develop Strength As strength is a highly trainable motor component, specific methods help an athlete develop or improve strength. These methods are discussed below: 1. Isometric Exercise: These are the exercises that are not visible as there are no direct movements. Therefore, isometric exercises cannot be observed. In these exercises, work performed cannot be seen directly, like pushing a wall. While pushing a wall, work is done, i.e., the force is being exerted, but the work done cannot be seen as the wall is still at the same place and doesn't move a bit. These exercises involve muscles carrying out tension against the other group of muscles. There is no change in the muscle length when such exercises are done, hence they are called \"iso\" metric. These exercises need less time and equipment and can be performed practically anywhere and everywhere. Moreover, isometric exercises can prove to be of great value for maintaining strength in case of an injury. These exercises, if performed regularly, may result in a change in muscle size and shape.7368 Physical EDUCATION-XII 2. Isotonic Exercise: These are exercises in which movements can be seen directly. Isotonic exercises result in toned muscles and increased muscle length. These exercises hold much importance when it comes to sports. This method is considered to be the best method to develop strength. Examples of isotonic exercises include running and jumping on the spot, weight training exercises, and calisthenics exercises.8 3. Isokinetic Exercise: this method was introduced by J.J. Perrine in 1968 and involves a particular type of muscle contraction called isokinetic contraction, generally used in sporting events like rowing and swimming. These exercises are performed on specially designed instruments. In isokinetic contraction, the muscles apply maximal force throughout the range of motion around the joint. Whereas in isotonic contraction, the pressure is applied at a particular angle. The use of isokinetic contraction is minimal. Hence, the contribution of isokinetic contraction in developing strength is yet to be scientifically proved.9 369 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do You Know? Preventive Measures in Strength Training While doing strength training, appropriate supervision is a must as there is always a high risk of injury accompanying it. Therefore, it is essential to know the means for preventing such incidents. These are: 1. Strength training must be done after proper warming up. 2. Strong and stable joints are a prerequisite for strength training. Therefore, the strength and stability of the musculoskeletal system must be ensured by doing general strength training with low intensity. 3. While exercising with heavyweights, a correct technique is required. Or else it will result in serious injuries. 4. A strength training program includes a variety of exercises. These exercises must be done correctly, preferably agonists and antagonists' muscles one after the other. 5. The load must be increased gradually as per the athlete's ability and requirement. 6. Recovery or rest plays a vital role in strength training. Proper and effective use of the recovery period helps in preventing injuries. 7. Improper breathing while exercising with heavy weights leads to serious disturbance in blood circulation. Hence, as a rule, a sportsperson must breathe continuously, and if he holds his breath, it should be for a minimum duration possible. 8. Safety equipment like belts, boots, wrist bands, etc., should be used when necessary. 9. In the case of children, the load should be low until the age of 16 years as the chances of injuries are very high. Extension Activity Under the supervision of your physical education teacher, form yourselves into two groups. Tell one group to do isometric and the other to do isotonic exercises for one hour a day for 3- 5 days a week. Test their strength after two months.

Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Explain the preventive measures to be kept in mind during strength training. 2. What is Strength? What are various methods for developing Strength? Write in detail Endurance Endurance is the ability of a person to maintain a certain level of energy production for a more extended period. It is the ability to sustain an activity. Like strength, endurance is also a conditional ability. Endurance has been studied thoroughly and deeply because it holds great importance in health, training, and competition. Endurance plays a vital role in almost every activity, directly or indirectly. It is either measured by the number of repetitions or the times an action is performed.372 Physical EDUCATION-XII Definition Harre defines endurance as \"the ability to resist fatigue.\" Barrow and McGee defined endurance as \"the result of a physiologic capacity of an individual to sustain movement over a period of time.\" H. Singh defines endurance as \"the ability to sustain an activity.\" Types of Endurance Different games and sports require different types of endurance, which majorly can be classified into the following categories: I. Classification according to the nature of the activity: This classification is based on the kind of activity required for endurance. It can be classified into the following types: h Basic Endurance: This is the ability of a person to resist fatigue in which the load is of medium intensity and involves aerobic muscular metabolism. Therefore, it can be said that it is the ability to do movements that involve a large number of muscles at a slow pace for a prolonged period. For example, jogging, cycling, and swimming for more than 30 minutes. Basic endurance forms the base for all other types of endurance.10373 Physical EDUCATION-XII h General Endurance: it is the ability to do such sporting movements for a prolonged duration that are general. This type is not specific to any sport and can be developed by performing general exercises. Unlike essential endurance, in which the intensity of the activity is medium, general endurance activities may incorporate high-intensity practices. But the duration for general endurance is much shorter than essential endurance.11 h Specific Endurance: this is the ability to perform movements of a particular sport to resist fatigue. Specific endurance varies from activity to activity as it depends on the nature of fatigue. For example, the specific endurance of a hockey player is different from that of a marathon runner or a cyclist as the need for the activity is different.12 II. Classification according to the Duration of the Activity:374 Physical EDUCATION-XII This classification considers only cyclic sports activities and is based on physiological factors. From the viewpoint of Harre (1986), this classification can be divided into the following sub-categories: h Speed Endurance: This is the ability to resist fatigue in cyclic activities that last up to 45 seconds. The classic example of this endurance type is a 400m sprint in track and field. This type of endurance is majorly dependent on the power and capacity to produce energy. h Short Term Endurance: This ability is needed for activities lasting 45 seconds to about 2 minutes. The most appropriate example for short- term endurance is an 800m run. This endurance depends majorly on speed endurance and strength endurance. h Medium Time Endurance: Medium time endurance is needed to resist fatigue in activities lasting from 2 minutes to about 11 minutes. The most common example of this type is 1500m and 3000m run and 100m rowing. As in short-time endurance, this type of endurance also depends on speed and strength endurance, but to a limited extent. h Long Time Endurance: This type of endurance is needed for activities that last for more than 11 minutes. This type of endurance is required in events like marathons, cross country, etc13 375 Physical EDUCATION-XII Methods to Develop Endurance The various methods to develop endurance are discussed below: 1. Continuous Method As the name suggests, this method is about continuity. In this method, an exercise is done for a longer time without any rest. Because the duration of the activity is long and continuous, the training intensity is low. This method has the following subcategories: (a) Slow Continuous Method: In this method, the activity is performed at a certain speed without any break for a long duration. The speed of exercise is usually determined according to heart rate. A trained athlete's heart rate should be between 140-160 beats per minute during activity. The duration of the training should not be less than 30 minutes. This method is used for walking, running, cycling, etc. Effect: due to relatively low intensity and long duration, the effect of this method is limited mainly to the muscles, but there are few psychic and positive effects on metabolism. Some of the most significant changes are: 376 Physical EDUCATION-XII W Increased muscle glycogen. W Increased liver glycogen. W Increased capillarization. W Increased number and size of mitochondria. W Improved thermal regulation. W Quality of oxidative enzymes improves. W Increased fat metabolism. W Positive effect on heart and lungs. W Psychological changes such as improved willpower, self-discipline, and self-conquest. (b) Fast Continuous Method: The activity is performed comparatively fast, but the speed remains uniform throughout the training. Heart rate during the training should be between 160-180 beats per minute. Because the intensity is high and is more strenuous and exhaustive than the slow continuous method, the duration of the activity should be at least 20 minutes. Effects: effects of the fast continuous method are: W Effective for improving VO2 max. W Improved capacity of muscles to consume oxygen W Significant increase in the size and number of mitochondria. W Improved anaerobic capacity (c) Variable Pace Method: In this method, activity is performed at a changing pace, but this change in speed is pre-planned. The heart rate usually 377 Physical EDUCATION-XII ranges between 140-180 beats per minute during this method. The duration of this method may range from 15 minutes to 1 hour. Due to the varied pace, this exercise is very strenuous and should be done by trained athletes. Effect of Variable Pace Method h Increases glycogen in the muscles h Increases the number and size of mitochondria h Increases efficiency of heart and lungs h Improves willpower and confidence h Improve VO2 Max (d) Fartlek Method: Fartlek is a Swedish word that means 'speed play.' In other words, it is another variation of the variable pace method. The difference between the two is in the Fartlek method the speed variation is not planned. The athlete changes the speed of his own accord during the activity due to changes in terrain, surroundings, and feelings. The heart rate and duration of the training are similar to the variable pace method. Major effects of this method: h Promotes weight loss h It's an excellent test for strength and endurance h It improves speed and race tactics h It improves the mind over matter game h It is excellent for getting into the racing mindset as a fartlek session mimics the surges of speed you may put on in a race. h Incorporating these speed surges helps runners measure and learn how much they can push their bodies over shorter segments. h Increases physical and mental energy h Improves flexibility h Improves Fast and Slow Twitch Muscle Response378 Physical EDUCATION-XII 2. Interval Method It is the most versatile method used for improving endurance. In this method, the activity is practiced at a comparatively high intensity with intervals or breaks of incomplete recovery. It is based on the principle that \"work should be done with sufficient speed and duration so that the heart rate goes up to 180 beats per minute. After this, there should be a short interval, and when the heart rate drops down to 120-130 beats per minute, the work should start again.\"14 The most important effects of this method: h Improved circulatory system h Improved aerobic capacity h Improved lactic acid tolerance h Improved VO2 max379 Physical EDUCATION-XII 3. Repetition Method The repetition method is characterized by a high intensity that ranges from 90-to 100% of work with an interval of complete recovery. It is the best method to develop speed endurance. The Essential effects of this method are: h Improved anaerobic capacity h Improved lactic acid tolerance h Improved phosphagen stores16 Do You Know? Volume: Training volume is simply the amount of training you do. The primary training component includes duration or time of training, distance covered volume load (sets in weight training), number of repetitions, or performed work in a given time. It is a quantitative component of work. Intensity: Training intensity refers to the effort by which a training session is completed. It is a qualitative component of work\u2014more work or efforts done by the athlete per time. Assessment of intensity varies from sport to sport. Speed is assessed by metres per second, resistance in kilogram, team games, or distance races may be evaluated by heart rate, etc. Density: Training density is simply the volume of training completed within a given time frame. As volume and intensity have an inverse relationship, density and intensity do. The less dense a session, the more intense it can be. Extension Activity With the help of physical education, teachers design medium-intensive exercise sessions to improve endurance.

Speed ability, in sports, signifies the ability to execute motor movements as quickly as possible. These movements can be cyclic or acyclic. Theiss and Schnabel defined speed as \"the prerequisite to do motor actions under given conditions (movement task, external force, individual prerequisite) in the minimum of time.\" Johnson and Nelson defined speed as \"the capacity of an individual to perform successive movement of the same pattern at a fast rate.\" Certain factors help in determining the speed of an individual, such as mobility of the nervous system, explosive strength of an individual, correct technique of performing a task, bio-chemical reserves and metabolic power of an individual, flexibility, and certain psychic factors like optimum arousal, attention, motivation, concentration, ability to relax, etc. Types of Speed From a general point of view, there are five different types of speed that are discussed briefly as follows: 1. Reaction Ability: Reaction ability is the ability to react quickly to a stimulus or signal. It depends entirely on the coordinative abilities of an individual. Different games and sports have other signs like visual, auditory and tactile, to name a few. And to respond to such signals accurately and as quickly as possible is known as reaction ability. It can be further classified into simple and complex reaction abilities. 2. Acceleration Ability: Acceleration ability is the ability to achieve a high locomotion speed from a stationary position. It depends significantly on the explosive strength, technique, and movement frequency. This ability is essential in almost every game and sport but greatly influences sprinting events. 3. Movement Speed: Movement speed can be defined as the ability to perform a single movement in the minimum possible time. It is highly related to acyclic sports, but its importance in cyclic sports is limited to the initial phase. It is dependent on the technique and explosive strength. 4. Locomotor Ability: Locomotor ability is the ability to maintain maximum speed when in motion for the maximum possible duration or distance. It is essential in sports like 100m and 200m sprints, speed skating, and short sprints in cycling. 382 Physical EDUCATION-XII Locomotor ability depends highly on the mobility of the nervous system. The chances of improving locomotor ability are relatively low. 5. Speed Endurance: Speed endurance is a combination of two words, speed and endurance. It is the ability to do the movement with high speed for a longer duration, i.e., under fatigue. It depends highly on anaerobic capacity, technique, and psychic factors. Methods Developing Speed Speed is a motor ability that depends on genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors, as we all know, cannot be manipulated. An individual having fast-twitch fibres in a comparatively higher percentage than slow-twitch fibres will have more speed. At the same time, the individual with a high rate of slow-twitch fibres will have better endurance. The ratio of these muscle fibres cannot be changed. Therefore, it can be said that the genetic make-up of an individual sets the limit on the speed of an individual, but the role of environmental factors on the speed cannot be denied as well. The following are the most commonly used method to develop the speed of an individual: 1. Acceleration Runs are generally used to develop speed while attaining maximum speed from a static position. In an acceleration run, a sportsperson must run a specific distance. After starting, the athlete tries to gain total momentum at the earliest and finishes the specified distance. These runs are repeated with sufficient rest between the runs. It usually takes 50-60 meters for a sprinter to attain maximum speed after the start. According to the research, it is observed that even well-trained athletes can maintain their top speed for 20 meters only.383 Physical EDUCATION-XII The number of acceleration runs can be set according to an athlete's age, capacity, and fitness level. It may vary from 6-12 repetitions with intervals for complete recovery. The acceleration runs must be done after proper warm- up.17 2. Pace Runs: unlike acceleration runs, pace runs incorporate the method of running the set distance at a uniform speed. It usually includes races of 800 meters and above. It is a fact that an athlete can run a distance of 300 meters at full speed, and in the case of longer races, he must conserve his energy by reducing speed. Therefore, keeping the pace in mind in middle and long-distance races is essential. At the beginning of such races, the speed should not be too high, and the pace should be maintained throughout the race. For this type of training, the athlete should run at a maximum steady speed for a distance 10-20% more than the actual racing distance. Repetition for pace run training can be fixed as per the athlete's fitness level with complete recovery in between repetitions.18 Do you Know? Skeletal muscles are made up of individual muscle fibres, and like muscles themselves, not all muscle fibres are the same. There are two types of skeletal muscle fibres, fast-twitch, and slow-twitch, and they each have different functions that are important to understand when it comes to movement and exercise programming.384 Physical EDUCATION-XII Slow-twitch muscle fibres: Slow-twitch muscle fibres are fatigue-resistant and focused on sustained, smaller movements and postural control. They contain more mitochondria and myoglobin and are aerobic in nature compared to fast-twitch fibres. Slow-twitch fibres are also sometimes called type I or red fibres because of their blood supply. They promote prolonged duration activity at a slow pace, also known as aerobic muscles. Examples are long-distance running, swimming, cycling, etc. Fast-twitch muscle fibres execute fast movement for short distances, also known as anaerobic muscles. It helps in short distance races, weight lifting, jumping, etc. I. Tick the correct option. 1. Which is not a type of Speed i. Reaction ii. Sprinting iii. Acceleration iv. Speed endurance 2.

Flexibility Flexibility is also known as the range of motion around a joint. It is the ability to execute a movement with greater amplitude or range. Flexibility is related to genetic factors as well as physical activity programmes. Flexibility is a motor component that is not a conditional or a coordinative ability. In general, usage flexibility often corresponds with stretchability, elasticity, litheness, mobility, pliancy, etc. Flexibility is affected by muscle strength, the structure of the joints, tendons, ligaments, and other factors. A person possessing good flexibility can perform daily tasks with greater ease and comparatively more efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, the personality and posture of such individuals is more attractive. Tight joints affect smooth and efficient movements, whereas flexibility ensures smooth and efficient workouts. Therefore, it can be said that flexibility is helpful in many ways, such as preventing injuries, improving posture, reducing back pain, maintaining healthy joints, improving balance during making movements, and learning various skills quickly, such as backstroke in swimming. Importance of Flexibility Flexibility has an important inter-relationship with other factors that improve performance. Hence, it is essential to determine different aspects to a lesser or greater extent. The importance of flexibility is briefly discussed below: 1. Greater range of motion ensures more force and speed developed by the muscles. 2. It is due to the flexibility to perform movements with minimum muscular tension and, therefore, facilitates a higher movement economy. 3. It reduces stiffness in joints. 4. It reduces the risk of injuries as muscles are more pliable. 5. It helps in maintaining appropriate posture while performing.386 Physical EDUCATION-XII Types of Flexibility Flexibility is of the following two types: (A.) Passive Flexibility: the ability to do movements with greater amplitude and with external help is known as passive flexibility. Example, stretching with the help of a partner. Passive flexibility is always more than active flexibility and is primarily determined by the joint structure and stretchability of the muscles and ligaments. Passive flexibility is the base of operational flexibility.19 (B.) Active Flexibility: the ability to perform a movement with greater amplitude without external help is called active flexibility. For example, you are performing a stretching exercise by a sportsperson himself. Active flexibility is always less than passive flexibility, and the difference between the two indicates a lack of muscular strength or coordination. Active flexibility is further classified into the following two categories:387 Physical EDUCATION-XII a. Static Flexibility: it is required for movements done while the individual is in a static position, i.e., standing, sitting, or lying. b. Dynamic Flexibility: it is required for executing movements when an individual is moving.20 In addition, the terms General and Specific Flexibility are also used often. General flexibility refers to the flexibility of all the critical joints of the body, such as the shoulder, hip, and trunk. It is not used for any sporting event or physical activity. However, specific flexibility should be understood to be the ability to perform specific movements or movements related to specific sports. Methods to Improve Flexibility The various methods that can help to improve flexibility are discussed below: 1. Slow Stretching: The first and foremost way to improve flexibility is slowly stretching the muscles around the joint. The critical point to note here is that stretching should be slow and without any jerky movements. 2. Slow Stretch and Hold: The next stage after stretching is to hold for about 6-8 seconds at the maximum stretching point. This method is considered to be the most commonly used method in the field of games and sports.388 Physical EDUCATION-XII Stretching can be done either statically or dynamically. Static stretching involves slowly easing into extension and holding the position. The period required for static stretch depends on the purpose. The stretch should be held for about 10 seconds if it is for a cool down. If it improves flexibility, the hold is recommended for about 30 seconds. Dynamic stretching requires controlled movements, usually of legs and hands, and where the event requires dynamic movement, it is suitable for dynamic stretching exercises. 3. Ballistic Method: This method performs the movement with a swing and rhythm. As the stretching is done rhythmically, it is called Ballistic Method. The ballistic method once experienced popularity but has come under the scanner by many physical therapists. This form of stretching uses the body's momentum to extend the range of motion. However, many experts believe that ballistic stretching can lead to injury. 21 4. Proprioceptive Neuro-Muscular Facilitation (PNF) Technique: It is also known as the post isometric stretch and is based on the principle of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation. This principle states that if a muscle is contracted maximally for a few seconds, the muscle gains maximum relaxation after the contraction. In this method, the muscle is first contracted for 5-7 seconds and then gradually stretched to its utmost limit and held for about 8-10 seconds. The process is repeated 4-8 times for each muscle group.22389 Physical EDUCATION-XII Do You Know? The essential tips for developing flexibility 1. The right age for flexibility development is considered before puberty, as it is hard to develop flexibility after puberty. 2. Flexibility tends to deteriorate once improved if the stretching routine is not continued. 3. Stretching exercise performed in fatigue affects flexibility negatively. Hence, a person should perform such exercises when fresh. The ideal time to perform stretching exercises is after warm-up. 4. Flexibility exercise tends to work best after a good warming up. If the warm- up is not performed correctly, it may lead to overstretching of the muscles. 5. Flexibility training should aim for optimum flexibility and not for maximum flexibility\u2014too much flexibility results in less joint stability and, therefore, chances of injury increase. 6. A muscle group must be stretched several times to improve flexibility effectively. Usually, 10-15 repetitions are recommended for a muscle group to gain flexibility. 7. A stretching exercise should be accompanied by a conscious effort to relax the antagonist's muscles. 8. It is essential to avoid jerky movements while performing stretching exercises. 9. Age has an inverse relationship with flexibility. Therefore, do not compete with others while working on one's level of flexibility. 10. For faster improvement in flexibility, the routine can be followed daily or twice a day, involving various exercises for each joint.390 Physical EDUCATION-XII Extension Activity Good flexibility can improve sports performance and reduce the risk of injury. Learn static and dynamic flexibility exercises in school with the help of your physical education teacher or coach and practice them. Teach the same to your friends in your neighbourhood and increase the number of exercises and repetitions with time.

Coordinative Abilities Coordinative abilities primarily depend on the central nervous system's motor control and regulation process. For a coordinative ability, the control regulation processes must function in a particular manner. The coordinative abilities are those abilities of an individual that enable the individual to do various activities correctly and efficiently.23 Zimmerman et al. stated that \"Coordinative abilities are understood as relatively stabilized and generalized patterns of motor control and regulation processes. These enable the sportsman to do a group of movements with better quality and effect.\" 392 Physical EDUCATION-XII Types of Coordinative Ability In sports, the following seven types of coordinative abilities are essential. The use of these abilities is, however, different in different games. 1. Orientation Ability: it is the ability to determine and change the position and movements of the body in the required time and available space in a definite field of action (such as a volleyball court, skating rink, a football ground) and a moving object (like a ball, opponent, partner). The use and demands on orientation ability are vast in sports. Example: body movement and position in gymnastics are essential for orientation. In team games, vision, especially peripheral vision, is decisive for orientation. 2. Differentiation Ability: It is the ability to attain a high fine-tuning of movement phases. It is the ability to achieve a high level of accuracy. The high level of differentiation depends on movement experience and mastery over motor action. High differentiating capacity is used in sports in sensing or implementing movement, such as movement sense. 3. Coupling Ability: it is the ability to coordinate body part movements with one another and about a definite goal-oriented body movement. Coupling ability is essential in sports where activities with a high degree of difficulty have to be done, such as gymnastics and team games. In a team game like football, foot movements for ball control or dribbling have to be coupled with the whole- body action of running and jumping. Coupling ability depends on the functional capacity of kinaesthetic and visual sense organs. 4. Rhythm Ability: Rhythm ability is the ability to perceive the rhythm of a movement and do the exercise with the required rhythm. It also denotes the ability to reproduce rhythm stored in motor memory, in motor action. In some sports like gymnastics and figure skating, the sportsperson has to perceive an external rhythm and music and express it in his movements. In sports where rhythm is not given outside, the sportsperson has to use the rhythm stored in his memory. 5. Reaction Ability: Reaction ability is the ability to react quickly and effectively to a stimulus. Different games and sports have different types of signals like visual, auditory, and tactile, to name a few. And to respond to such signals accurately and as quickly as possible is known as reaction ability. It can be further classified into simple and complex reaction abilities. 6. Adaptation Ability: Adaptation Ability is the ability to adjust or completely change the movement programme based on changes and anticipated changes. 393 Physical EDUCATION-XII The situational change may be expected or may take place suddenly. It depends considerably on the speed and accuracy of perception of changes in the situation. 7. Balance Ability: Balance Ability is the ability to maintain equilibrium or balance throughout the movement and regain balance quickly after disturbing balance movements. It is further classified into two types: (a) Ability to maintain balance during stationary position or slow movements. It depends on kinaesthetic, tactic, and to some extent on vestibular sense organs. (b) Ability to maintain or regain balance during rapidly changing positions. It depends primarily on the functional capacity of the vestibular sense organs. I. Tick the correct option. 1.
