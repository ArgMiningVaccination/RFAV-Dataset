The So Juicy Cleanse is designed to rest and recharge your digestive system. This nutritionally balanced cleanse will give your body healthy sustenance while you take a break from overly processed or unhealthy foods. Your So Juicy Cleanse package includes a daily schedule of 6 cold pressed juices. This guide will help you before, during and after you complete your cleanse. A cleanse (or juice fast) is a great way to reset your body's relationship with food. If your intention is to eat healthier, this diet of vegetable and fruit juice can recalibrate your taste buds and help you adapt to a more nutrient-rich way of eating. You'll be drinking fruits, vegetables, and apoptogenic herbs, eliminating any of the chemical additives found in processed foods. The benefit of a cleanse is as much about what you eliminate from your diet as what you consume while cleansing. Detoxing from the Standard American Diet can have a huge impact in how you feel both physically and psychologically. If you've wondered if your body is sensitive to gluten, sugar or dairy, the So Juicy Cleanse will wipe the slate clean. You can continue to follow a diet that eliminates any of these potential aggravators and see how you feel without them. A cleanse is not a crash diet and should not be considered as a quick fix, rather it's a giant step toward a long-term healthy lifestyle. You will find that your overall appetite is reduced, and after consuming small portions of highly concentrated vitamins and minerals, your cravings for carb-heavy and/or sugar-loaded foods will be much more manageable. COLD PRESSED JUICE Drinking cold pressed juice gives your body a megadose of whole food vitamins and minerals. We make our juice by slow grinding raw fruits and vegetables, then extract the juice using a powerful hydraulic press. Little to no oxygenation occurs using the cold press method so enzymes, vitamins and minerals stay fresh and potent, even up to 3 to 5 days after juice is made. Your body can easily absorb these nutrients without having to break down or digest any pulp or fiber. PREPARING FOR YOUR CLEANSE Transitioning toward eating only vegetables and fruits should start at least 3 days before you begin your cleanse. This will help your body ease in and reduce the intake of foods that impede digestion. Avoid any heavy or processed foods and take a break from alcohol, sugar and dairy. White flour, bread and pasta should also be eliminated. Drinking purified water is an important component to the cleanse itself and you can give your body a head start by drinking at least 64 ounces of water a day. Cut back on caffeinated drinks. Caffeine in itself is not harmful, but regular brewed coffee is too acidic to drink while you cleanse. YOUR DAILY CLEANSE SCHEDULE Start each morning with a room temperature or warm glass of water with a teaspoon of fresh squeezed lemon juice. You want to be finishing one drink approximately every two hours. It's your choice to sip slowly or drink quickly but do not gulp - the juices are more filling than you think. In between - DRINK WATER. You should be drinking at least 64 ounces a day. - 1st Drink BLACK NECTAR: water, lemon, agave nectar, activated charcoal - 2nd Drink AC SUN: carrot, apple, lemon, apple cider vinegar, ginger - 3rd Drink SWEETER GREENER: apple, pineapple, cucumber, celery, kale - 4th Drink FENNEL FUN: apple, celery, cucumber, fennel, lemon, ginger - 5th Drink BLACK APPLE: apple, ginger, lemon, activated charcoal - 6th Drink BLOOD MOON: apple, carrot, celery, beet, lemon - WELLNESS SHOT: TAKE IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP OR BEFORE BED DETOXIFIER: water, lemon, ginger, activated charcoal, bentonite clay AS YOU CLEANSE GET ON TRACK - 1 DAY CLEANSE DETOX AND RECHARGE - 3 DAY CLEANSE FULL BODY DETOX RESET - 7 DAY CLEANSE It might feel strange at first, but you can and should \"chew\" your juice. Your mouth releases digestive enzymes when you chew, these can help your body absorb nutrients more effectively. Shake your juice before drinking. The separation you see in the bottle is a natural function of gravity - heavier elements will settle to the bottom. Always keep your juice refrigerated. We recommend you use an ice pack to keep your juice cold if you are bringing it with you to work. Your energy level will rise and dip throughout the day for the first two days, rest when your body tells you to. It's often just the case that you are paying more attention to your body's cues and signals when you're not distracted by an eating routine. Light to moderate exercise is encouraged. If you have a more rigorous workout schedule, please talk to us and we can adjust your cleanse to increase the caloric intake. If you must eat, we suggest raw fruit: an apple, pear, banana, or avocado. Eating anything heavy or solid will need to be digested, this cleanse is intended to give your system a rest. Chewing gum will make you feel hungry, and we do not recommend it. Drink water instead. Our goal is for you to succeed. Please contact us if at any point you have questions or need guidance. We are here for you. Email us at info@sojuicyjuice.com and we will get back to you right away. POST CLEANSE TRANSITION You made it!! You have just given your system a clean break. And your body has absorbed a megadose of vitamins and minerals. Don't break your cleanse with a binge meal. Start slowly, eat only fruits and vegetables on the day after your cleanse. To maximize your results, follow the post-cleanse schedule below. Eat frequently, in small amounts - you will get full quickly. Avoid dairy and meat for the next few days. Hold off on heavy or fried foods for at least a week. Don't pour grease down your nice new pipes. Taking a probiotic supplement can strengthen your gut flora and keep your system moving. - Day 1: Steamed or saut\u00e9ed vegetables, salads with very light dressing. Vegetable and fruit smoothies made with nut milks. - Day 2: More steamed/saut\u00e9ed vegetables and salads, adding in nuts, seeds and eggs for protein. Pureed vegetable soups, without cream. - Day 3: Add a single grain like quinoa, brown rice, barley, or chia pudding if you are feeling ready to eat more substantially. - Day 4-7: All of the above and integrating fish or chicken. Some dairy foods, such as yogurt and raw cheese are okay to add now as well. Let us know if you find yourself craving cold pressed juice and we can keep you supplied with juices after your cleanse!
