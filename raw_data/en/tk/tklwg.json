(2008) 3(1), 1-5 1 part of A brief definition of regenerative medicine Chris Mason & Peter Dunnill Author for correspondence Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London, London WC1E 7JE, re already a lot of definitions, but all are lengthy and not the sort of thing scientists, start- ups or advo cates can say succ inctly pharma executiv governme nt minister or memb er of the publ ic asks for clarificat ion.' While it could be said th at regenerative medicine is what this journal publishes, that would be cycli-cal. It could also be claimed that most people interested in the field have a good grasp of what isentailed, and this is probably correct. But, as thefield grows and there is a need to carry govern-ments and public opinion along, it is probablyworth having a simple explanation of regenera-tive medicine. And, it is simplicity that is the nubof the matter. There are already a lot of defini-tions [1-3] but all are lengthy and not the sort of thing scientists, start-ups or advocates can say suc-cinctly when a pharma executive, governmentminister or member of the public asks for clarifi-cation. Here, we address this and the origins andrelationships that help to define the field. One of the complications is that regenerative medicine has grown out of a good deal of prioractivity. This includes su rgery, surgical implants, such as artificial hips, and increasingly sophisti-cated biomaterial scaffolds. It also draws on hos-pital procedures such as bone marrow and organtransplants and it relate s to tissue engineering. There is no absolute cut-off in the transformationof these into fully developed regenerative medi-cine but they each leave residues of their inputthat can mean the patient is not capable of beingtermed 'of natural health' with respect to thetreated condition. Organ transplants oftendemand immune-suppressing drugs and metalhips can become loose with time, engineered tis-sue scaffolds can provoke inflammation and bonemarrow sources are variable mixtures that alsocan be contaminated quite easily by the nature ofthe cell aspiration procedure. The central focus of regenerative medicine is human cells. These may be somatic, adult stem orembryo-derived cells and now there are versionsof the latter cells that have been reprogrammed from adult cells so that both can be conven-iently collected under the heading of 'pluri- potent cells' [4,5]. There appears to be a progression in interest through this sequence. It isdriven by the limitations in availability of mostspecialist somatic cells and the restriction in theexpansion of adult stem cells together with theirheterogeneity from sources such as bone marrow.Human embryos are not an ideal source from atechnical point of view, leaving aside the ethicaland moral issues. For this reason, obtainingpluripolent cells in anot her way is attractive. This progression entails the transfer of genes tohuman cells [6] and this could bring regenerative medicine and gene therapy closer. Though inevitably the pioneering phase lead- ing towards regenerative medicine has beenmarked by some failures, there are now soundcommercial products for skin ulcer and sportsinjury damage to the cartilage of the knee [7]. There are also exciting developments withrespect to treating patients with bladder dys-function [8]. These therapies use either autolo- gous or allogeneic somatic cells and, in the caseof skin and bladder, the products have a bioma-terials component. The outcome of therapy with adult stem cells is at present less clear because thestatus of these cells is being debated [9], but in the end it will be proof or otherwise of therapeuticoutcome that defines their importance. 'In the medium term, there are a number of major medical conditions, such as heart failure, insulin-dependant diabetes, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's and possibly Alzheimer's diseases, which appear to be addressable via cell-based therapies.' For the present, most of the developments with embryo-derived cells are as pure cell thera-pies, although treatment of age-related macular degeneration is likely to involve a scaffold [101]. It is probable that in time more therapiesinvolving embryonic stem cells and temporaryscaffolds will appear and certainly where struc-tural tissue is demanded it is hard to see cells EDITORIAL - Mason & Dunnill 2 Regen. Med. (2008) 3(1) future science group future science group alone succeeding. However, it is probably inevi- table that for the present there will be a distinc-tion in journals and interest groups between thebiomaterials community and that concernedprimarily with advanced cell approaches.Indeed, there is in some cases a philosophicaldifference. Where biomaterials scientists areaffected by the interest in nanotechnology, theymay be drawn towards those who envisagefuture medicine heavily reliant on man-madenanodevices [10]. By contrast, the vision of those focused on cells tends to be more towards emu-lating nature's capacity, with the minimum ofartificial material present. That said, medicineas a whole will not wish to pit cell-based regen-erative therapy against other options of molecu-lar medicine and new technologies such asnanomedicine, but rather to achieve the bestblend. The 'regen' industry as we have describedit [11] will integrate human cell therapy with gene-based methods, biomaterials and molecu-lar medicines. In the medium term, there are anumber of major medical conditions, such asheart failure, insulin-de pendant diabetes, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's and possibly Alzheimer'sdiseases, which appear to be addressable via cell-based therapies. There are many more that,although they affect fewer people, are terrible intheir consequences, have no present effectivetreatments and should be susceptible to humancell-based approaches. 'A successful regenerative medicine centered on human cells could be a 'disruptive technology' because it would potentially replace a number of major molecular pharmaceuticals and medical prostheses.' Clarity on the nature of regenerative medi- c i n e w i l l b e v i t a l i n a n i n d u s t r i a l c o n t e x t . W ehave noted the relationship of regen ventures tobiotech the more sophisti- cated products of regenerative medicineresearch, we concluded it is likely that moststart-ups will need the deep pockets of majorpharmaceutical, healthcare or device compa-nies. Human cells are a rather alien concept topharma people used to molecular medicines.However, those biopharmaceutical proteincompanies using mammalian cells are veryfamiliar with cell banking. They are also knowl-edgeable about culture advances to enhance performance in producing products andimproving their molecular properties. If thosepursuing regenerative medicine can use this relationship and be clear on what is involvedthere is at least a conceptual bridge. Pharma isalready much interested in using embryonicstem cell-derived material for drug discovery [12] and toxicology studies [13] and, while not regen- erative medicine, it is building bridges with regen start-ups. It is also the case that the excep-tionally high cost of some therapeutic proteinswill mean pharma will not be particularly sur-prised if the human cell therapeutic prepara-tions are also of high cost. The pharma sectorhas not as yet had good experience with biotechcompanies in gene-bas ed medicines and will move with caution where it appears to beinvolved. However, they do use gene transfec-tion to enhance cell properties in tightly regu-lated processes. They will struggle with abusiness concept in which cells may only berequired once for lasting benefit compared withthe majority of protein therapeutics, a situationfor cells more like the sa le of a medical device. Indeed, a few device co mpanies concerned with acellular repair are already active in collabora-tions with regen start-ups. In a future of rapidlygrowing demand for medicines to addressdegenerative diseases all this need not be a dis-incentive to pharma-regen linkage but it willhave to be clear that re generative medicine can justify high prices where appropriate and iscapable of routine production to high standardsof safety and efficacy. That means being able toconvey accurately what it entails. A successful regenerative medicine centered on human cells could be a 'disruptive technol-ogy' because it would potentially replace anumber of major molecular pharmaceuticalsand medical prostheses. For example, stem cell-derived -islet cells can potentially replace a patient's requirement for insulin injections [14]. For this reason, it would be valuable if humancells can be perceived as a logical extension ofthe progression from small to macromolecules.Like proteins, they could create new opportuni-ties and a safety net for pharma when chemicalpharmaceuticals are suffering many late-stageclinical failures and the expiry of their key pat-ents. Even biopharmaceutical proteins, andespecially antibodies, are becoming a crowdedcommercial area. Vaccine production usingattachment cells is particularly close in respectof some upstream aspects of cell culture scale-upand, in terms of commercial parallels, vaccinetherapy generally involves only one or a fewinjections in a lifetime. Similarly, regenerativeA brief definition of regenerative medicine - EDITORIAL 3 future science group future science group www.futuremedicine.commedicine that goes beyond cartilage regenera- tion to aid structural restoration can be seen as alogical development from prostheses. Again,this should help build up a bridge betweenregen and pharma. We have focused on human cell-based ther- apy but it is worth further emphasizing theimportant and growing linkage between genetherapy and regenerative medicine. Cell therapyrepresents a way of placing genes in cells, check-ing the outcome is safe and then implanting the cells into patients. The current interest in pro- gramming adult cells back to induced pluripo-tent stem cells is driving the gene-cell linkageand the work of ReNeuron [15] in using a genetic approach to immortalize a fetal neuro-nal cell line for the potential treatment of strokeis illustrative. Here too is an example of check-ing the safe outcome by selecting cells that havethe gene placed at a suitable point in thegenome. Although the regulatory challenges areincreased by genetic manipulations, this linkageof cells and genes could open up new optionsfor regenerative medicine. More difficult to place is the use of activator molecules, which applied, once or a few times,can influence the outcome to cause regenera-tion. The use of bone morphogenic protein-2growth-stimulating factor from the Stryer com-pany and erythropoietin from Amgen are exam-ples of highly successful commercial materials.A further illustration is provided by the prod-ucts of Renovo, which use macromolecules suchas recombinant transforming growth factor 3 and small molecules such as 17 estradiol to favorably enhance skin he aling without scar for- mation. In technology terms, these are all exam-ples of molecular pharmaceuticals but theireffect can be regenerative. They differ fromdoses of antibiotics, which are restorative ofhealth but not regenerative. Other molecularmedicines will often be an important comple-ment to human cell-based medicines, for exam-ple, drugs to control blood pressure couldprevent stem cell-regenerated heart tissue frombeing further damaged. 'Cell therapy represents a way of placing genes in cells, checking the outcome is safe and then implanting the cells into patients.' A final reason why regenerative medicine needs a clear position is th at, so far, it is hardly on the radar of the wo rking-level healthcarebureaucracy, although in the USA [102], as in the UK [103], governments are now aware of its importance. The medical community sees theclaims, some far fetched, but is preoccupied withdisease today and heavily pressed by the massivemarketing of the molecular pharmaceutical sec-tor. Even though those drugs can often only slowdisease and not infrequently have severe side-effects, they are available and meet a need. Gov-ernment statistics are weak on the costs of diseasethat occur beyond hospital treatment and it ishere that human cell-based medicine has greatpotential versus long-term use of molecular med-icines for chronic conditions. Thus, the explana-tion needs to focus on the value of theregenerative element. The regen industry will probably utilize small- and large-molecule activators of the kind men-tioned above and will em brace genetic modifica- tion of the cells. However, these aspects representdifferent technologies, some already well estab-lished. Regenerative medicine itself has as itsprincipal focus human cells either implanted into patients or present already and regenerated byagents from those different technologiesdescribed above. 'A final reason why regenerative medicine needs a clear position is that, so far, it is hardly on the radar of the working-level health care bureaucracy, although in the US A, as in the UK, governments are now aware of its importance.' Classically, 'regeneration' is used to describe 'the process in humans whereby lost specializedtissue is replaced by proliferation of undamagedspecialized cells. The process differs completelyfrom the axial regeneration of amphibians...'. Itis presently limited in humans to just a few tis-sues, such as liver, leaving aside normal replace-ment of individual cells in, for example,epidermis and intestinal mucosa [16]. In this regard, the aim of regenerative medicine is toregenerate more fundamentally by the provisionof cells, particularly stem cells that can stimulatewider regeneration. Equally in classical terms'repair is the replacement of lost tissue by granula-tion tissue which matures to form scar tissue' [16]. Yannas has expressed the in a particu-larly clear way: 'Organ regeneration is distinctfrom organ repair as an endpoint of a healingprocess following injury. Repair is an adapta-tion to loss of normal organ mass and leads toEDITORIAL - Mason & Dunnill 4 Regen. Med. (2008) 3(1) future science group future science group restoration of the interrupted continuity by syn- thesis of scar tissue without restoration of thenormal tissue. By contrast, regeneration restoresthe interrupted continuity by synthesis of themissing organ mass at the original anatomical site, yielding a regenerate. Regeneration restoresthe normal structure and function of the organ; repair does not' [17]. Since the ultimate aim of regenerative medicine is to return the patient tofull health with respect to the particular condi-tion, 'repair' falls, we feel, within earlier technol-ogies such as surgery. Repair is invaluable but theconsequences of repair can be unpleasant, forexample, internal and external scaring. In mostcases, the aim of regeneration will be to restore afunction that has been im paired but it could also address congenital abnormalities, such as thalas-saemia, absence of corneas or so called 'hole inthe heart' cases, where the normal functions wereinitially absent. 'Since the ultimate aim of regenerative medicine is to return the patient to full health with respect to the particular condition, 'repair' falls, we feel, within earlier technologies such as surgery.' And so we return to the way of explaining the field. Above all it must be simple. The explana-tion must avoid confusing the audience. If itincludes tissue engineer ing, genetic engineering and molecular activators and so on the danger isthat it will lose focus. The techniques used willalso change with time. If the enquirer asks formore, then, depending on their background,there are many different kinds of detail that canbe added. Equally, though it would be valuableto lay emphasis on the contrast with molecularmedicine and its need for 'repeat prescriptions'for chronic conditions, th is too can be left to elaboration. Of the lengthy definities we haveused, that of Greenwood et al., is probably most suitable as a starting point: 'Regenerative Medi-cine is an emerging interdisciplinary field ofresearch and clinical applications focused on therepair, replacement or regeneration of cells, tis- s u e s o r o r g a n s t o r e s t o r e i m p a i r e d f u n c t i o nresulting from any cause, including congenitaldefects, disease, trauma and aging. It uses a com- bination of several tech nological approaches that moves it beyond traditional transplantation andreplacement therapies. These approaches mayinclude, but are not limited to, the use of solublemolecules, gene therapy, stem cell transplanta-tion, tissue engineering and the reprogrammingof cell and tissue types' [3]. This provides a basis for a short explanatory sentence. For the reasonsgiven, we have deliberate ly not included 'repair' but have covered instances where normal func-tion has been 'established' for the first time. Wehave also added 'human' to qualify the 'cells, tis-sues or organs' because, although other optionsare possible, such as using porcine-derivedislets, they can be accounted for without directmention. So the explanation can simply be:'regenerative medicine replaces or regenerateshuman cells, tissue or organs, to restore or establish normal function'. 'Regenerative medicine replaces or regenerates human cells, tissue or organs, to restore or establish normal function.'
