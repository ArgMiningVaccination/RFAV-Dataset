My son is nine and had a grand mal and was put on 250 mg twice a day. Then about 5 months later he started having seizures again so the Dr. upped the pm dosage to 500 mg. he believed with him growing and gaining weight that it was not enough in his system. We did a withdrawl in December and 4 days after being totally off the Keppra he had 2 seizures within 24 hours so back on the Keppra. Another weaning is scheduled for this coming December. Good luck and keep me informed. curtis.wybourn@qbeamericas.com tslate, You might want to look for a new neurologist for your son. My son is nine and had a grand mal and was put on 250 mg twice a day.

He gained 6 lbs in 3 weeks so the nuerologist we were refered to put him on Keppra. 250 mg in the morning and 250 mg at night. He was seizure free for five months then started having them again. They had him take the 250 in the morning and then 500 at night. That seemed to do the trick for him. They figured with him growing and gaining weight the 500 a day was not enough. He showed no activity in the EEG's they have done while on the medication so they weaned him off this past Christmas. Four days after being totally off the meds he had two seizures within 24 hours so back on the meds. We will try again in Decemebr 2008. tslate, My son (9 years old) had one seizure and the pediatrician put him on dilantin until we were able to see the neurologist.

And he thanks you. Trust me he does. More then words can say, or even describe because i am that child speaking 16 yrs later. And i look at everything my mom has done for me and just thinking about it is enough to make me want to cry. I have JME and have gone through the lamictal horribleness with the fever and the sweats and the midnight runs to the ER. Scared as hell. And i have also been on keppra, several doses of it. Both of those drugs did a number on me. I tried them seperately, i tried them together, and nothing seemed to work. I have now finally just come off lamictal, completely, then i did keppra completely. A 12 week transition i couldn't wait to finish because i didn't even recognize myself on either one of these drugs. Speaking from personal experience, drugs work for different people in different ways. Keppra worked great for me for about 2 months, then stopped. I am now on topamax and slowly increasing my dose. I have been off keppra completely for only 4 days so i am experiencing a few of the withdrawl symptoms. Much the same ones as being on them. The depression, anxiety, the moodiness. The stuff that drives me crazy because i am nromally such a happy go lucky person. All the same stuff i heard would happen with Topamax but i had to try it anyways. You can't always go by what others say, or by others stories because there are so many different factors to consider. I was worries with Topamax after all of the stories, and so far we have been friends. So case in point you never know until you try. I wish you the best of luck with you son. Stay positive, you are such a supportive mom and he is so lucky to have you. Coming off the Keppra might be a bit rough at times but from experience i am sure you know that coming off is a gradual process, and even when we become a little monster-ish, just know it's a temporary thing, and it's not really us, it's the drug talking. He loves you though and everything has a way of working itself out in the end. You will find your solution. I wish you the best of luck. your friend Kym My heart really goes out to you in all that you have been through with your son. And he thanks you. Trust me he does.

What has happened since you posted this thread? Did anyone on this site help you out? I have been considering going off of Keppra but have not done so, so I cannot help you with first-person experience, but I want to know if you are okay and what has happened since your post. Maybe I can find a way to help. I am brand new to this site - are you okay? What has happened since you posted this thread? Did anyone on this site help you out?
