KEY FEATURES: |Durable Steel Grips| Fantastic quality Excellent quality and easy to assemble. Our 5 year old really gained significant confidence with riding thanks to the Swoop. Great value! My oldest is on the spectrum and always had difficulty with the combination of balance and motor-functions involved with learning to ride a bike. I recently heard of the balance method but he was already too big for the other brands. I'm so happy that I found Kazam because this Swoop balance bike was perfect. The price is also surprisingly reasonable given the niche status of such an item. The bike comes mostly ready to ride, only requiring minor adjustments, tightening of bolts (tools included) and air in the tires. After 5-10 mins of assembly, we went outside. My son took right to the bike and scooted around with ease! Only having to focus on balancing worked like a charm and is truly revolutionary when I consider how long MY dad ran behind while holding the seat to teach me. Thank you, Kazam. I will recommend your products to everyone! Balance Bike Birthday Gift We purchased the bike for our grandson's 5th birthday. Even though he's average height, he's not quite tall enough to use the bike even though the seat is at its lowest level. This was disappointing since he's too big for the smaller balance bike. Hopefully he'll be able to use the new one within the next six months or so. Absolutely amazing company and product I can't say enough good things about this company and it's products. Ordered a 30 inch balance bike and it is built to perfection. Nothing cheap about this bike. Delivery time was within a week and their customer service is top notch. I lost my receipt email and with a hour of telling them, they had sent me a new receipt. Love this company. Served its purpose! My daughter just wasn't ready to give up the training wheels on her high end bike. After ten days on the Kazam, she finally realized what it felt like to balance. Wish we had done it sooner! Oh and easy assembly and sharp looking too. |FOR AGES||5+| |FRAME||STEEL WITH FOLDING STEP-THRU FOLDING FRAME Our sturdy steel frame was created with a step-thru design to offer ease of use. It's incredibly accommodating for kids who are new to riding and balancing. The folding aspect makes the bike easier for transport and storage. ADJUSTABLE STEM / HANDLEBAR Our adjustable stem & handlebar allow parents to change the position of your child's arms while riding, so that they remain confident and comfortable. HEIGHT ADJUSTABLE SADDLE Your bike grows with your child! With the quick adjust saddle, you can change the seated height positioning of your child as they grow. REAL AIR TIRES WITH PEGS The Swoop features real air BMX tires. These provide a smoother ride and better traction over plastic or foam tires. Plus, your child can rest their feet on the front pegs as they ride. SOFT RUBBER GRIPS Soft rubber grips let your child hold onto the handlebar comfortably and focus on steering, worry-free. REAR SIDE PULL BRAKE A rear brake will help your child get accustomed to using a braking system effectively. The brake has more than enough stopping power to tackle any challenge your child throws at it. What Makes This Balance Bike Different? The Kazam Swoop is the best 20\" balance bike on the market. Developed initially for children with disabilities, we discovered that there are many of kids out there who are older and never learned how to ride a bike. Building the confidence needed to ride a pedal bicycle can take time. The Swoop balance bike is intended to be a bridge to learning how to ride a pedal bike, while also offering tons of fun along "}
