You will only need to disclose your vaccination status if COVID-19 vaccinations become mandatory in your state. If this happens, the College is obligated to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination status or a valid medical exemption. Currently, there are no vaccination requirements at any of our campuses however, the College will follow state government and compliance legislation regarding this and all students will be updated if any requirements change. Please note, vaccination status and any information contained on an Immunisation Certificate is considered sensitive health information and will be treated as such for the purposes of the Privacy Act. Any person's vaccination status will not be discussed broadly and will be limited to a 'needs know basis' in order to comply with the current health order. If vaccinations become mandatory in my state and I obtain a medical exemption, can I attend campus? Exemptions may apply for those with a valid reason for being unable to be vaccinated, including, for example, medical reasons or not yet being eligible to be vaccinated. Evidence of legitimate exemption will be required prior to attending campus. We will support individuals with a valid exemption to complete their study or undertake their work, in a manner that is reasonable and practical. Further information from the Australian Government about medical exemptions can be found here. Will I be informed of a Campus closure due to COVID-19? Yes, the College will inform all students via direct email. The College will align with the Department of Health and all State Government directives and recommendations.
