Clients 18 years and older with substance use disorders will be able to utilize the facility's treatment resources. The capacity of the new building will increase from 16 to 32 beds to meet the growing demand for substance use treatments in the region. Staff on hand will include Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselors, and Med. Technicians. This resource will help alleviate stress on law enforcement, homeless shelters, treatment providers, and other community service programs in the area. The facility will also help reduce the demand for healthcare systems, particularly the emergency response departments. Clay County offers the only licensed clinically managed care services in the region. Clay County has retained Klein McCarthy Architects and Gehrtz Construction Services to design and build the facility. It is expected to be completed by the fall of 2024. Funding will be provided by a Minnesota Department of Human Services grant, Clay County ARPA funds, and Clay County Opioid Settlement funds. "}
