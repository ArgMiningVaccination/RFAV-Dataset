It will also depend on how severe the condition is. The goal of treatment is to keep the roundness of the femoral head and to prevent deformity while the condition runs its course. Treatment depends on the amount of hip pain and stiffness. It is also based on X-ray changes over time and how much the femoral head has collapsed. The first step of treatment is usually to regain hip motion. It also tries to stop the pain that results from the tight muscles around the hip and the inflammation inside the joint. Treatment may include: - Rest. Your child may need to limit activity. They may need crutches or a wheelchair. In some cases, your child may need bed rest. - Medicines. Pain relievers such as ibuprofen may help ease pain in the hip joint. - Casting or bracing. This treatment can hold the femoral head in the hip socket. It also lets your child move the joint a bit and allows the femur to remold itself into a round shape. - Surgery. Your child may need surgery to hold the femoral head in the hip socket. - [Physical therapy](/departments/rehabilitation-medicine). This treatment can keep the hip muscles strong and promote hip movement. The more severe the case, the greater the likelihood that your child may have limited hip motion, differences in leg lengths and other hip problems in adulthood. "}
