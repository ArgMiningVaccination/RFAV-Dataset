Our aim is to uncover and shed light on health wisdom passed down through the ages combined with modern science for the attainment of optimum health. Our DNA is designed for us to swim like a fish, jump like a monkey, walk like our hunter and gatherer ancestors, and sleep restfully at the end of the day. We were not designed to sit for long periods of time at work, in cars and on couches at home. Additionally, without plentiful exercise and proper diet, adiponectin, the calorie burning hormones, fails to curb appetite and control fat tissue, thus resulting in weight control problems. The energetic exercises introduced here are excellent to get the qi and blood moving. They also enable you to accelerate the metabolism and thus increase the qi, or lifeforce. With a disciplined regular program of exercises, faith in the divine spirit and proper nutrition, your DNA responds as healthy as it is supposed to be. Regular exercise empowers your own healing essence within. Without adequate exercises you can fall victim sarcopenia which can lead to many other health issues such as metabolic syndrome. The educational series of Kaneko Healing Arts will focus on the importance of healthy meals, eating habits, and integrating the energetic system of body, mind and spirit. The activities presented by Kaneko Healing Arts can be categorized into two areas: exercises and mind, body and spirit. In the exercises section, there is the energetic system modalities, which focus on the cultivation of qi, or energy, circulation beyond the body and the non-energetic system exercises which in turn focus on improving the physical body of muscles, bones and cardiovascular system. I. Eastern Healing Modalities A. Daoyin / Standing stances The standing stances of Daoyin detoxifies the essential healing system and upgrades the body's defense mechanism. Daoyin is an excellent self-healing technique to activate the chi energy and blood flow (clarify blood). Daoyin utilizes pressure points and meridians through pressing, tapping, stretching, and twisting with abdominal breath control. It will help to cleanse the energy flow, release blockages, maximize unlimited chi, and unleash innate powers for healing. Daoyin / Self treatment According to TCM, all toxicities such as retention of blood including bruises and hormonal stagnation, retention of fluid like mucus, edema, retention of gas, fermented food and stagnant feces cause 10,000 kinds of diseases. You need to keep your G.I, urinary bladder, kidney, liver, gall bladder, prostate, uterus, ovaries and other sexual organs as clean as possible. This is a detox program focusing on abdominal manipulation. This includes abdominal pressure and massaging of organs, meridians and pressure points. Simpler but effective energy work are also included. B. Qigong / Baduanjin: The oriental elixir A modified version of Baduanjin, a practice originating from China, will be introduced to generate chi energy and pump blood flow to vital organs. Practitioners will experience the essence and elixir of vital force or chi, through this therapeutic and medical Qigong. This practice is also known as the 8 silken movements, which cultivates stamina, well-being and happiness in one's life. C. Qigong / Tree Qigong Gain the wisdom of divine order of the universe. The universal transformation movements of the tree's life is symbolic in this divine order for the peace and strength we need in everyday life! The universe is in constant change. The different stages in a tree's life is an excellent example of how the ever-changing cosmic energy manifests continual change. Life itself is in a continual recycling process. The unchanging law in these constant changes is one of the mysteries of the universe. D. Taichi-gong The combination of T'ai ChiCh'uan movements and Qigong stances increases the vital force with spiritual concentration. With this practice comes the realization of cosmic consciousness and unlimited cosmic power, with the commitment to disciplining one's life and staying resilient. E. Foot and calf pressure and massage therapy According to foot reflexology and energetic medicine, which connects internal organs to the lower extremities, the condition of every organ in the body is evaluated and treated in the feet. For example, bodily toxins are often developed then stored in the abdomen and spread to the legs and feet. Consequently, certain pressure points on the feet that are associated to the toxic organs in the abdomen become very tight. It is also reported that foot and calf massage is an excellent practice to empower the immune system and slow down aging. You can apply it on yourself as well as on others. II. Western Health Modalities A. Stretches and movements/floor work: Animal actions increase flexibility! These fish and five animals actions energize the limbic system by engaging the most primitive and fundamental function of fish animals. Practiced on the floor, these exercises will pump the muscles and tendons as well as improve the joint's flexibility. B. Aerobic modalities. Age gracefully! Other beneficial aerobic exercises such as, swimming, jogging (quick and slow pace), aerobics, fast walking, hiking (uphill and downhill) with plenty of deep breathing, aids to improve physical endurance. These types of movements increase the mitochondria that produce everyday stamina. Who doesn't need stamina - and it's free so long as one works for them! C. Anaerobic - Glycolytic modality: Get toned! Practicing quick, vigorous and momentum actions while holding the breath, is different from an aerobic energy system exercise. The movements need to use a faster energy cycle with less oxygen. These types of exercises which are classified under the Glycolytic system, include quick, short sprints of running, swimming, and weightlifting. Muscles will become more defined and stronger through these anaerobic exercises. III. Mind, Body & Spirit A. Laughter Wouldn't it be nice to laugh more and feel better instantly, to change a negative attitude to a positive one? Gain the wisdom of medicinal laughter! The Japanese saying \"Warau Kadoniwa Fuku Kitaru\" means that laughter in a happy family and society brings happiness to all. Laughter has the power to create happiness. Studies have already shown that laughter can relieve physical tension and stress, trigger the release of endorphins, and boost the immune system. Norman Cousins, author of Anatomy of an Illness, felt the powerful effects of laughter himself. He was given little chance of surviving after being diagnosed with a form of arthritis. Yet, Cousins developed a recovery program incorporating megadoses of vitamins, along with a positive attitude, love, faith, hope, and laughter induced by Marx Brothers films. He credits this laughter therapy for helping ease his pain and recovering from his illness. B. Breathing The truth is, there is no life without breath! Everyone breathes but do you practice a mindful or therapeutic breathing? The one key to opening the abundance of your body's own pharmacy is in your abdominal breath. Abdominal Dantien breathing is one of the most powerful forms of breathing. It can help a variety of physical, mental, and spiritual issues. Abdominal breathing promotes healing because the abdomen is like a second heart. By expanding and contracting the lower abdomen it's able to generate and send our chi and blood to the rest of the meridians, the cells, and the mitochondria, where our pharmacy resides. Other breathing methods will also be explored. C. Lotus Faith Healing Medicine: meditation, prayers and affirmation for faith healing Why do we suffer? Ultimately it is life itself, our birth into this world, that is the source and cause of our mundane sufferings. However, Daisaku Ikeda, the president of SGI stated that problems are not in themselves, the fundamental cause of unhappiness. According to Buddhist medicine, the real cause is not just that we have problems, but it is the lack of vital force and wisdom to solve them. Lotus Faith Healing Medicine teaches that all individuals innately possess infinite power and wisdom. Join our journey to cultivate a greater self for ultimate peace, health and prosperity. D. Medicinal foods, healthy eating habits We are what we eat. We are also how we eat and digest our food. There are many healthy traditional, eastern and western food and drink choices to achieve optimum health. These foods can not only help to prevent common disease but also help with anti-aging. The right food preparation with healthy eating habits can make you happier, healthier and live a longer life. There are many spices that are very beneficial to health. For example, garlic, ginger and tumeric all are anti-inflammatory. Garlic is a natural anti-biotic and anti-bacterial, with anti-cancer properties that promotes longevity. Ginger is effectively used in chinese herbs for indigestion and joint pain. Stopping to eat when you are 70-80% and chewing food properly by itself are two great ways to help aid your digestion. IV. Healing Others & Helping our Family, Friends and Communities A.

They get a chance to see their own innate healing abilities at work while showing their love and gratitude to their parents.

Transssage Transssage is designed to naturally tranquilize and balance your autonomic nervous system through a Shiatsu-pressure sequence combined with abdominal breath and a self-hypnotic mantra. It is a type of guided meditation and a way to experience Eastern and esoteric alchemy medicine. Transssage allows us to tap into our own pharmacy within that houses potencies such as natural melatonin for sleep, endorphins for pain, oxytocin for love, serotonin for hypertension, dopamine for loss of pleasure, GABA for a foggy brain, noradrenalin for loss of motivation and interest, and opium for a happy mood. There are many possibilities to condition the release of our hormones. Dr. Kaneko's formulas will bring you into a higher level of relaxation and meditation as you succeed in opening the three chakras and electromagnetic centers. You can apply these formulas for your own self-meditation then practice it with your family members for their stress management. Acupuncturists and massage therapists also enjoy combining transssage to their therapies to enhance its healing effects. D. Palm Healing/Te-no-hira therapy Te (hand) no (of) hira (even) therapy. Our hands have the most powerful healing abilities. It radiates magnetic power. Te-Ate, which means healing in general, includes, placing hands directly on the body. Te-Ate, is the most simple, traditional and universal healing modality. Tenohira, which is a form of Te-Ate, requires a lot of discipline and commitment for healing. But it is a rewarding practice that is safe and effective for the young and old. It is a compassionate healing modality perfect for family and friends. Reiki is the other type of Tenohira Therapy. Through both touching or hovering the hands over an ailing body area, we become a medium to guide divine light and power from the divine universe to people who need healing.
