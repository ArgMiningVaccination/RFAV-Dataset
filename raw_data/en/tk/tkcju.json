Chinese Angelica (dang gui, ), also known as [Angelica Root or Angelica Archangelica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica_archangelica), comes from a plant in the Angelica genus which can grow up to 3m and has globe-like clusters of green or yellow flowers that blossom into small, yellow fruits. This plant also has a strong, unique smell that is often described as musky, earthy or herbaceous. The plant's root is usually harvested in Early Spring, when the seedlings have just begun to sprout, or in Late Fall, after the stems and leaves have withered. Afterwards, the fibrous roots and dirt are removed before the root is dried. Angelica Root is also nicknamed as Dong Quai and Female Ginseng, the latter because it is frequently used in [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/traditional-chinese-medicine/) to treat female hormonal issues. In TCM, Angelica Root falls under the category of 'Tonic herbs for Blood Deficiency'. It is used for patterns of deficiency to replenish one's 'Four Treasures' (qi, blood, yin, yang). Warm in nature, this herb can help people who have too much 'Cold' in their body to restore their yin-yang balance, such as those who are experiencing Yin Excess or Yang Deficiency. Pungent and sweet, Angelica Root tends to promote the circulation of qi and body fluid in the body. Also, it helps to slow down acute reactions, detoxify the body, and it also has a tonic effect on the human body by replenishing qi and blood. In particular, Angelica Root targets the Heart, the Liver and the Spleen. Functions and Benefits of Chinese Angelica (Angelica Root) Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) shows that Angelica Root has the following benefits. Angelica Root helps to tonify the blood, and is thus used for all kinds of Blood Deficiency syndromes such as Blood Deficiency with Blood Stasis. It is frequently combined with other Blood-tonifying herbs to improve sallow complexion, vertigo and palpitation caused by Blood Deficiency. Angelica Root is used to relieve pain syndromes caused by Blood Deficiency, Blood Stasis and congealing Cold. As the herb can tonify blood, activate blood, dispel Cold and alleviate pain, it can be combined with different herbs to form different combinations to tackle different pain causes.
