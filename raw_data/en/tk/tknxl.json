Ayurveda's wisdom of preventive care derives from the concepts of daily regimens, seasonal detox, dietetics and yoga offering diet and lifestyle guidelines to remain healthy by strengthening the immune system. The concept of immunity is explained as Vyadhikshamatwa in Ayurveda. Preventing the disease from entering the body and halting its progress for an easy recovery. Fresh, nourishing food, mixed with specific herbs and a bit of ghee enhances immunity. Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle guidelines see detox and rejuvenation as pillars for a long, vital, and healthy life. With this in mind, we designed our online program to include yoga, healthy and recipes, as well as general guidelines for detox and post-detox to boost your immunity. 1. Guidelines for the detox week Make the detox dose test on the first day, as described under 'Your detox day' below.

Lifestyle tips for the detox week Follow a schedule to eat, exercise, sleep and work. Follow the yoga videos. As much as possible, avoid physical and mental strain. Avoid smoking, narcotic drug use and sex during this program. Try not to sleep in the daytime. Restrict travel or swimming as they can disturb the detox process in the body. 3. Detox T est (Day 1) To find out which dose works best, take a TEST DOSE on the first day: 5ml of castor oil with a pinch of rock salt mixed with half a cup of warm water 30 minutes after dinner. Next morning: If the bowels are slightly loose then your DETOX DOSE on the detox day is 15ml castor oil. This will most likely result in 4-5 bowel movements. If there is no change in the bowels, then you may need a higher DETOX DOSE of 20 ml castor oil. 4. Your Detox Day (Day 5) Wake up by 6 am, after the cleaning up, do a self oil massage for 10 minutes, and take a warm shower. Take the detox medicine (the DETOX DOSE that resulted from the first day) with 3g rock salt mixed in a half a glass of hot water. 30 minutes after taking the medicine, start drinking warm ginger water, a half-cup every 15 minutes. To make ginger water boil 10 g of peeled ginger in 2 liters of water for 10 minutes over medium heat. Drink half a glass of lukewarm water after each bowel evacuation to maintain hydration in the body. Try to avoid reading, using your mobile phone, laptop or other digital gadgets (except for emergencies), try not to sleep during the day as these can interrupt the detoxing procedure. No vigourous exercise after taking detox medicine. Walk a few steps inside after drinking the ginger water to improve your digestion and bowel movements. You may experience stomach cramps or feel nauseous at times\u2014don't worry, it means that the detox is working. You can put a hot water bag/bottle on the abdomen and/or the lower back to relieve the cramps. Licking or smelling lemon slices work great against nausea. Bowel movements can start 1-3 hours after you took the detox medicine. You will also be detoxing through urinating. In case if you do not have any bowel evacuation in the first three hours after taking the detox medicine, take another 5 or 10 ml of castor oil. Keep drinking half cups of ginger water every 10-15 minutes. Around 13:00-14:00, you might feel that purging is over and start getting hungry. Have your rice porridge or semolina porridge ready for lunch (recipe will be shared). Eat it until you are half full. If you have more than 10 bowel movements by 16:00 hours, drink electrolyte water. To make it, squeeze one lemon or lime in one liter of water, add 10 g or 2 teaspoons of palm sugar or glucose powder or honey with half teaspoon pink salt. Drink half a glass of this every half an hour. Practice simple restorative yoga or meditation in the evening. For dinner, you may eat the same rice porridge or semolina porridge you had for lunch. You may go to bed early after dinner. Some people pass 1 or 2 bowels after lunch and dinner, this is absolutely fine. The next day you might feel a bit weak or have a slight headache, so stay hydrated by drinking at least two liters of warm water or 6 glasses of electrolyte water.

Slowly introduce your eating habits considering the general diet and lifestyle guidelines. We recommend continuing the yoga and meditation practice. Ghee strengthens the body, improves immunity, brings clarity to the mind, and promotes longevity. Many good reasons to use ghee instead of vegetable oils for your cooking! 6.

Yoghurt is best when freshly homemade and still having a sweet taste.Animal products Milk is a good source of nutrients\u2014that's why it is advised as golden milk after the detoxday as a rejuvenator. There are not many restrictions with honey, moderate use is advisable. It is not recommended for those who have constipation or hard bowels. Eggs can be eaten after the detox week, the limit is seven per week.Switch to white or lean meats from red meats whenever possible. Lean meat is better for the body than red. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Oneworld Ayurveda All rights reserved.Fish should be boiled or grilled, not raw or fried. The same goes for the meat. Avoid animal products for dinner. Shellfish should be avoided completely as it can create inflammation in the body. Caffeine confusions Caffeine is not only found in coffee but also some teas, soda, and chocolates. Because caffeine is a stimulant, it increases your blood pressure and heart rate, both of which should be avoided. False energy created through caffeine is draining the body and can create an over-dependency. When you stop using caffeine, you can experience some withdrawal symptoms. To avoid this, eat energy giving fruits and vegetables. If you are low on energy without your daily coffee habit, take a look at your regular sleep cycles, water intake, vital fruits, routine meals, and exercise. Sometimes, the body is asking for needs to be met with rest and good diets, only not caffeine. Water or decaffeinated coffee can be used to dilute the normal quota of coffee. Best to tryalternatives like herbal teas, milk, fruit juices. If you have heartburn, acid reflux, hard bowels, dry skin and skin rashes, coffee may aggravate them. Mindful eating also means taking care of the body in more ways than just the nice taste sensations! 7. General diet and lifestyle advice to follow daily Food should be fresh, of good quality, appetizing, and warm. Eat only when you are hungry and when your last meal is completely digested. Eat the food you prepared no later than six hours after and find a way to keep it warm after cooking\u2014either by keeping it on a low burner or in a hotbox. Avoid cooked food that has been reheated or stored for more than six hours. Leftover food is lacking vitality and will weaken digestion and produce toxins. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Oneworld Ayurveda All rights reserved.Stay healthy and happy! Try to follow a regular schedule for your meal\u2014for example, 8-8:30 for breakfast, 12:30-13:30 for lunch and 18:30- 19:00 for dinner. Eat in a relaxed, peaceful atmosphere\u2014reading, working or watching television should be avoided. Always sit while eating. Do not rush while you eat and take time to chew your food well. Eat neither too quickly nor too slowly. Eat cooked main meals\u2014salads only as a side dish for lunch. Avoid raw foods after 18:00 as it cannot be well digested. Fresh fruits and vegetables are best at breakfast and as snacks. Honey should not be heated and it is, therefore, not recommended to cook or bake with honey and not to be added in boiling teas. Avoid eating between meals if you do not experience real hunger. Two pieces of fruits, four berries, 5 nuts, herbal teas, etc. are healthy snacks. Do not get up immediately after eating, sit for a few minutes. A short brisk walk of 100 steps after each meal aids digestion. Use herbs to add flavour to the food and support digestion. During meals, one glass of lukewarm water can be sipped. Avoid drinking the whole glass just before or right after the main meals. Warm drinks are preferable, ice-cold drinks should be avoided. Hydrate with a minimum of two liters of water\u2014including herbal teas\u2014daily. For dinner, it is best to avoid heavy food such as meat, fish, yogurt, cheese, milk, fresh fruits, and raw salads. 8. Lifestyle guidelines Try to have a routine in life, giving enough time to daily regiments of eating, resting, working, sleeping, and exercising. Try to follow a regular sleep pattern. A minimum of six hours of sleep is recommended. Try to be in bed by 22:00 and wake up around 6:00. Better to avoid sleeping in the daytime. Yoga, breathing exercises, and meditation keep body and mind healthy. Affirmations or mantras can boost energy and bring positivity. Have an attitude of gratitude for all the happiness in your life. Avoid overindulgence of sense organs, listening to loud noises, gazing at bright lights for a long time like mobile phones, laptops, etc., talking loud continuously, potential conflict situations and over-dependency on anything in life.
