College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba Submission 3 Introduction The Minister of Health, Seniors and Active Living gave direction to the Health Professions Advisory Council (\"the Council\") to undertake a review related to high neck manipulation1. Specifically, the Minister directed the Council to undertake : 1)A review of the status of the reserved act in other Canadian jurisdictions, 2)A literature review related to the benefits to patients and risks to patient safety associated with th e procedure, and 3)A jurisprudence review or a review into the legal issues that have arisen in Canada with respect to the performance of the procedure that touch upon the risk of harm to a patient. In addition, t he Minister requested the Council to seek wr itten input on the issue from: Manitoba Chiropractic Stroke Survivors Manitoba Chiropractic Association College of Physiotherapists of Manitoba Manitoba Naturopathic Association College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba other relevant interested part ies as determined by the Council The Council's Process Independent Review by the Council Consistent with the Minister's direction, the Council carried out a review of the status of the reserved act in other Canadian jurisdictions for chiropractors, physicians, physiotherapists and naturopaths through Internet searches. Research Literature Review The Council engaged an independent researcher through Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living to undertake a review and analysis of individual peer -revie wed articles found in the literature in order to identify relevant research or evaluations regarding the benefits to patients and the risks to patient safety associated with the performance of the reserved act and to summarize the findings. Jurisprudence Review At the request of Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living and for the purposes of the Health Professions Advisory Council, Manitoba Justice carried out a jurisprudence 1 Section 4 of The Regulated Health Professions Act lists 21 categories of actions or clinical procedures used when providing health care that pose significant risk of harm or potential harm health, safe ty or well -being of the public. \"High neck manipulation\" forms part of the reserved act under subsection 15. 4 review of the Canadian case law and commentary related to the use of upper spi nal/high neck manipulation. Cases and articles released before the year 2000 were excluded from the review. Submissions from Regulatory Bodies In letters to the regulatory bodies whose members perform the reserved act, the Council invited written submissi ons from : o Manitoba Chiropractic Association (\"MCA\") o College of Physiotherapists of Manitoba (\"CPM\") o Manitoba Naturopathic Association (\"MNA\") o College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba (\"CPSM\") The Council also invited the Manitoba Chiropractic Stroke Survivors (\"MCSS\") to make a written submission . Background Information Section 4 of t he RHPA regulates the performance of 21 categories of reserved acts \"done with respect to an individual in the course of providing healt h care\" that may present a demonstrable risk of harm to the public. Subsection 15 is the following reserved act (referred to as the \"Reserved Act\" in the balance of this review) : Administering a high velocity, low amplitude thrust to move a joint of the spine within its anatomical range of motion. The Council notes that t he Reserved Act is with reference to \"a joint of the spine\" , without noting a particular location on the spine. This review and report is with respect to \"high neck manipulation\" which forms part of the R eserved Act. The MCA rejects the use of the term \"high neck manipulation\" as it is not a phrase used by the chiropractic commun ity. The MCA believes the phraseology as described in subsection 4 (15) appropriately describes the treatment and that there is 'no rational distinction to delineate 'low neck', 'middle neck' or 'high neck'.\"2 The MCA points out that while chiropractors us e the term \"adjustment\" for this treatment modality, it can be used interchangeably with the term \"manipulation\" used by other professions.3 In its review, t he Council was advised that this form of spinal adjustment is routinely performed by chiropractors as well as , to a lesser extent, by other regulated health professions .4 The MCA 2 Manitoba Chiropractors Association, \"Submission to the Health Professions Advisory Council\" 17 November 2016 at 14. 3 Ibid, at 17. 4 For instanc e, members of the College of Physiotherapists of Manitoba, the Manitoba Naturopathic Association and the College of Physicians and Surgeons who hold a professional doctoral degree in osteopathic medicine. 5 stated in its submission to the Council that a 2009 survey of its members revealed that 99% performed the Reserved Act on a daily basis.5 The spine i s made up of 33 bone s (known as vertebrae). There are: 7 cervical vertebrae (neck) 12 thoracic vertebrae (mid back) 5 lumbar vertebrae (lower back) 5 sacral bones and 4 coccyx bones. The last two groups are fused (fixed) and do not provide any movements in the spine. The cervical, thoracic and lumbar areas have discs between each vertebra. The vertebrae have joints on either side. These joints allow a wide range of movement in all directions. The joints 'slide' on each other.6 At Appendix A is an illustration of the spine. In its submission, the MCA included a statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association which describes cervical spine biomechanics and that the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae are most susceptible to i njury : The cervical spine has a unique anatomy and complex biomechanics. Despite centuries of study, a complete understanding of this topic has remained elusive. . . . The cervical spine is made up of 7 vertebral bodies and is divided into 4 anatomic sections: the atlas, the axis, the root the transverse foramina of C1 through C6 and occasionally through C7. Four segments (of the vertebral arteries) are recognized . . . . The V3 segment takes a tortuous course between C2 to the suboccipital triangle between the atlas and the occiput, where it is covered by the atlanto -occipital membrane . The V3 segment, running horizontally in a groove on the superior aspect of the posterior arch of the atlas, adjacent to the atlanto -axial junction ( C1-C2) where most rotation occurs, is the most susceptible to injury . During high -velocity, low -amplitude manipulation, a controlled force is applied to a joint in a specified direction, causing movement of that joint and adjacent joints in the spine. The amount of force delivered during cervical spine manipulation with manu al high - velocity, low -amplitude techniques on living human subjects is 100 to 150 N*.7,8 5 Manitoba Chiropractors Association, \"Submission t o the Health Professions Advisory Council\" 17 November 2016 at 15. 6 Retrieved from http://www.icid.salisbury.nhs.uk/ClinicalManagement/Rehabilitation/Documents/34304b44fac54157bbbc1ed055 225e18spineanatomymay08PI0017.pdf 7 Biller, Jose et al on behalf of the American Heart Association Stroke Council. \"Cervical Arterial Dissections and Association with Cervical Manipulative Therapy: A Statement for Healthcare Professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.\" Stroke. Published online, 7 August 2014 at 3. 6 The MCSS also notes that the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae are vulnerable and describes the injury done by an HVLA thrust at that location of the neck : There are two main arterial systems, the carotid and the vertebral that serve as the arterial blood supply to the entire brain. The left and right run up the anterior of the neck and the left and right vertebral run up the posterior of the neck. The verteb ral arteries pass through the holes (foramen) in each side of the neck vertebrae and unite to form the basilar artery at the base of the brain. . . . The HVLA thrust of the nigh neck is an abrupt tilting (chin is raised), stretching and twisting of the v ertebrae in the high neck within the high neck' s anatomical range of motion. . . . With the abrupt tilting of the chin, stretching, and twisting of the high neck , the three delicate layers of the vertebral and carotid arterial walls are subject to complete separation and/or tearing, medically known as carotid artery dissection (CAD) or the more common, vertebral artery dissection (VAD) . At the 2nd cervical vertebrae, the vertebral arteries begin to make a slight horizontal turn. At the 1st cervical vertebrae the vertebral arteries make an abrupt 90 degree, horizontal turn and it is at this location, the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae that the vertebral arteries are extremely vulnerable to d issection from an HVLA thrust. Once some degree of dissection occurs, the arterial wall will bleed causing the walls of the arteries to balloon and/or clot formation to occur. . . . The clot or parts of the clot can be dislodged and/or the arterial wall will balloon sufficiently enough to block blood flow to the brain, resulting in a full blown stroke. Should a dissection extend through the outer connective tissue layer of the arterial wall, a massive haemorrhage would occur.9 The MCSS has taken the posi tion that a form of this spinal adjustment - \"high neck manipulation\" - creates a risk to patient safety, and chiropractors should not be permitted to perform it: An HVLA (high velocity, low amplitude) thrust of the high neck within its anatomical range o f motion poses a material risk. Adverse events as a result of HVLA thrust of the high neck can cause catastrophic, debilitating, lifelong, life altering consequences: arterial damage, brain deficits, paralysis, locked in syndrome, stroke and death, and 8 One newton (N) is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one metre per second squared in the direction of the applied force. At average gravity on earth, a kilogram mass exerts a force of about 9.8 newtons. An average -sized apple exerts about one newton of force, which is measured as the apple's weight. The weight of an average North American adult (80.7 kg) exerts a force of about 791 N.

( PEI passed the Regulated Health Professions Act in 2013 and to date , only pharmacists and pharmacy technicians have come under the legislation . Because the other professions in PEI have not yet come under the Act, direct comparisons of authorit ies for reserved acts with other jurisdicti ons with umbrella legislation is not always possible. The same can be said for Manitoba, wh ere only audiologists and speech language pathologists have come under the RHPA. ) The scope of practice statement briefly describes in a general way what the profess ion does and the methods it uses and provides a frame of reference for the performance of narrowly defined reserved acts (consistent also with the education and training and the standards of practice for the profession ). In those jurisdictions which have not adopted umbrella legislation and a reserved act model, regulated health professionals may provide services within the description set out in that profession's scope of practice statement in its profession -specific legi slation . This permits the profession, based on its expertise, to define the scope of professional activity . The Council prepared a table for each of the professions (at Appendix B) , indicating, by province, whether the members of the profession have the l egislative authority to perform the Reserved Act. For those jurisdictions where the reserved act model is not employed, the table s identify the legislated scope of practice for the profession . The Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the Yukon do not have legislation in place to regulate physiotherapists, osteopaths or naturopaths. Of the three territories, only the Yukon regulates chiropractors. Chiropractors In British Columbia, Alberta, Onta rio and Prince Edward Island, chiropractors are authorized to perform the Reserved Act , described variously as moving a joint of the spine within the anatomical range of motion using a high velocity, low amplitude thrust , without restriction or limitation . In all other provinces and the Yukon, joint or spinal 10 Manitoba Chiropractors Association, \"Submission to the Health Professions Advisory Council\" 17 November 2016 at 1. 8 manipulation, principally by hand or manual therapy , is part of the scope of chiropractic practice. Physiotherapists Physiotherapists in Manitoba and PEI are not yet under umbrella health profession legislation. In BC, physiotherapists are not authorized to perform the Reserved Act . In Alberta and Ontario, physiotherapists may perform the Reserved Act only with the specific authorization of their college. Osteopaths Osteopathic physicians are licensed medical doctors who have trained at an osteopathic medical school in the United States accredited by the American Osteopathic Association. Osteopathic physicians are regulated by the medical college in the province in wh ich they practise and have the legal rights and responsibilities of medical physicians, including using the title \"doctor\". Non-physician osteopathic manual therapists have trained at private osteopathic colleges in Canada or abroad. Their training is no t recognized by provincial medical colleges. Osteopathic physicians who are members of the medical college in the province in which they practise , as well as traditional medical physicians, may perform the Reserved Act, based on their education and compet ence. Legislation in BC, Alberta, and Ontario authorizes physicians, both osteopathic and traditional , to perform the Reserved Act. Naturopaths Naturopaths in BC have authority to perform the Reserved Act and naturopaths in Alberta must be on the appropria te College register to perform the act. The College of Naturopathic Physicians of BC provides its members with clinical guidelines for contraindications to high -velocity thrust procedures.11 Naturopathic medicine is a regulated health profession in Saska tchewan, governed by the Saskatchewan Association of Naturopathic Practitioners under The Naturopathy Act. The Association has policies setting standards for the safe practice of the profession, including a policy which states only registrants of the Association may perform \"moving of the joints of the spine beyond the individual's usual physiological range of motion using a fast, low amplitude thrust.\" 12 The Association also has a standard/guideline for manipulation \"to minimize the risk to the public from harm from high velocity thrust 11 College of Naturopathic Physicians of British Columbia, \"Clinical Guidelines for Spinal Manipulation in Naturopathic Practice\", April 19, 2005. Retrieved from http://www.cnpbc.bc.ca/wp -content/uploads/QAC - Manipulation.pdf 12 Saskatchewan Association of Grads.\" from http://www.sanp.ca/uploads/3/4/4/2/34420826/sanp_non -registered_grads_poli procedures.\"13 The document lists \"absolute contraindications\" for when it is inappropriate to perform the procedure and \"relative contraindications\" when naturopaths must use their professional judgement. The Manitoba Naturopathic Association , the organization in Manitoba which registers and licenses naturopaths, advised the C ouncil that \"high neck manipulation continues to be regulated and practiced by eligible practitioners\" in the province.14 In order to perform the Reserved Act in Ontario, naturopaths must conform to the standards of practice set out in legislation and may move the thoracic, lumbar and sacral joints of the spine and cervical joints of the spine. A naturopath may only move the cervical joints of the spine (the neck region) using three low amplitude thrust procedures specified in regulation. In all cases, natu ropaths in Ontario may not perform spinal manipulation if any contraindications listed in the regulation exist. The practice of naturopathy in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland is not regulated and legislation respecting naturopaths in Nova Scotia only provides title protection. The Research Literature Review The results of the literature review of individual peer -reviewed articles published between January 1990 and November 2016 indicate that cervical spine manipulation (\"CSM\") is frequently associated with minor, benign, and transient or self -limiting adverse events including : . . . transient neurological symptoms , increased neck pain or stiffness, headache, tiredness and fatigue, dizziness or imbalance, extremity weakness, r inging in the ears, depression or anxiety, nausea or vomiting, blurred or impaired vision, and confusion or disorientation. The majority of the evidence concerning minor adverse events in the literature pertains to spinal manipulation in general, and data on minor adverse events in reference to CSM in particular is limited.15 Evidence in the literature suggests that CSM is rarely associated with serious adverse events and relies mostly on case reports and case series which : . . . are placed at the botto m of the hierarchy of clinical evidence, as they can only provide only anecdotal evidence and contain intrinsic methodological limitations, namely a lack of statistical sampling and an inability to strictly determine causation. 16 13 Saskatchewan Association of Naturopathic Practitioners. \"Manipulation.\" Retrieved from http://www.sanp.ca/uploads/3/4/4/2/34420826/sanp_man ipulation_policy.pdf 25 January 2017. 14 November 21, 2016 letter from Manitoba Naturopathic Association to the Council. 15 Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living. \"Cervical Spine Manipulation: A Rapid Literature Review\", January 2017 at 8. 16 Ibid, at 7. 10 The strongest evidence in terms of clinical evidence concerns risk for vertebral artery dissection and ischemic stroke following CSM, \"though further research is still required to solidify this association.\"17 The literature review discusses serious adverse events following CSM involving the cerebrovascular system, such as cervical artery dissection, ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attacks; the neurological system such as damage to nerves or the spinal cord; and the musculoskeletal system, such as injury to cervical vertebr al discs, vertebrae fracture or dislocation, spinal edema, or issues with the paravertebral muscles .18 Benefits The number of studies in the literature reporting health -related benefits was comparatively smaller than the literature concerning the risk of adverse outcomes associated with CSM. The literature indicated that while CSM is used for a variety of indications, including neck, upper back and shoulder/arm pain, as well as headaches, the evidence in the literature seems to support CSM as a treatment of headache and neck pain only.19 The review indicated that further research is required to : strengthen evidence for the efficacy of CSM as a treatment for neck pain and headache, \"as well as for other indications where evidence currently does not exist (i.e., upper back and should/arm pain, high blood pressure, etc.) \"20 establish safety and efficacy of CSM in infants and children assess the risk versus benefit in consideration of u sing HVLA cervical spine manipulation, which also involve cost -benefit analyses that compare CSM to other standard treatments.21 The literature review describes the current debate around cervical spine manipulation as polarized - some authors argue it shoul d be abandoned due to the risk of adverse events and the lack of evidence around benefit and others advocate that until the evidence around risk is more clearly established, cervical spine manipulation should be considered safe. The literature review indi cates that \"the current state of the literature may not yet be robust enough to inform definitive prohibitory or permissive policies around the application\" of cervical spine manipulation , the li terature suggests what is described as a \"harm -reduction strategy\" to mitigate potential harm until more robust evidence is available.22 In the interim, as proposed by authors in the literature, providers of CSM treatment might be mandated to: inform patients of the risks of CSM treatments prior to consenting to treatment and 17 Ibid, a t 21. 18 Ibid, at 3. 19 Ibid, at 19. 20 Ibid, at 21. 21 Ibid, at 23. 22 Ibid, at 22. 11 provide patients with information to help in the early recognition of a serious adverse event to prevent further injury or harm. Authors also suggest that regulatory bodies could further research and mitigate risk to patients by: establishing consistent definitions of adverse events following CSM to facilitate effective reporting and surveillance, instituting rigorous protocol for identifying high -risk patients before CSM treatment and creating detailed guidelines for appropriate a pplication and contraindications for CSM. 23 The Jurisprudence Review The jurisprudence review surveyed the Canadian case law and commentary related to the use of upper spinal/high neck manipulation to (1) compile judicial and arbitral decisions that rela ted to the performance of upper spinal/high neck manipulation and (2) to compile a list of legal publications and commentary related to such manipulation. Cases and articles released before the year 2000 were excluded from the survey . Three legal databases were used to compile the relevant case law and commentary and after accounting for cas es which appeared in more than one database, there were a grand total of 18 cases where spinal manipulation was one of the issues (more than one issue may arise in a given case) . Of the 18 cases, 16 were decided by the courts and 2 were decided by tribunals. Of the 16 court cases, 2 did not concern spinal manipulation treatment in particular and 4 were appeals of earlier decisions. Where more than one court cas e deals with the same individual and issue, i.e., where one decision is an appeal of another, the Council counts only one case. As a res ult, the jurisprudence review found that the same individual and issue (spinal manipulation therapy ) arose 10 times in the search results of the jurisprudence review. The review included two legal journal articles; however , they did not concern spinal manipulation treatment in particular . In 7 of the 10 \"relevant\" results or narrowed list of cases, the patient received cervical spine manipulation only. In one case, the patient received cervical and thoracic spine manipulation and in 2 cases the patient re ceived lumbar spine manipulation . In six of the eight cases where the patient received cervical spine manipulation, th e claim was dismissed. In the two other cases involving cervical spine manipulation, the court found that (1) the patient sustained a muscle strain as a result of the manipulation and did not give informed consent to the treatment and (2) the chiropractor breached her duty to disclose the risks and caused the patient's injuries - permanent balance impairment, hearing loss and tinnitus. In both cases involving the lumbar spine manipulation , damages were awarded. The chiropractors involved breached the stand ard of care by failing to put forward alternative care, failing to obtain informed consent and failing to 23 Ibid, at 22 -23. 12 advise of risks. The Council notes that , irrespective of the findings of the court, disclosure of risk to the patient and informed consent were issues for resolution in 6 of the 10 relevant cases. Written Submissions Manitoba Chiropractic Stroke Survivors (Appendix E) The MCSS submission was b ased on the experience of its members, the organization's review of literature gathered from various sources and the opinion of its medical advisor, Dr. Murray Katz of Montreal, Quebec . The MCSS is of the opinion that \"HVLA thrust of the high neck presents a material risk\" to the patient and that \"authority to perform HVLA thrust should be denied (emphasis in the original) or, at the very least, subject to legislated conditions, restrictions and limitations.\" 24 The MCSS suggests that HVLA thrust should not be administer ed to or for the following: 1.Infants and children - to treat such conditions as ear infection s, tonsillitis, infantile colic, asthma or gastrointestinal disorders or as an alternative to immunizations. 2.Overall health and wellness . 3.Maintenance of proper alignment of the neck vertebrae . 4.Infections - to alter the immune system, or to prevent or treat bacterial, viral or fungal infections . 5.Bodily organs - as a health benefit to such organs as the heart, lungs, kidneys or liver, or as means of preventing the onset of genetic disorders or cancer. 6.Removal of v ertebral subluxations25 in the high neck area , to improve the function of the brain stem and to treat high blood pressure, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. As noted by the MCSS, in 2010, the General Chiropractic Council, the statutory body established to regulate chiropractors in the United Kingdom, issued a statement to chiropractors and to patients, stating that \"chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex is an historical concept but it remains a theoretical model. It is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow clai ms to be made that it is the cause of disease.\"26 24 Manitoba Chiropractic Stroke Survivors. \"High Velocity Low Amplitude Thrust of the High Neck\" November 2016 at 43. 25 WH O Guidelines on Basic Training and Safety in Ch iropractic (2005) defines subluxation as \"a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segmen t in which alignment, mov emen t integrity and/or physiologic al function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact . . . . It is hypothes ized that significant neurophysiologic al consequences may occur as a result of mechan ical spinal function al disturbances, described by chiropractors as subluxation and the vertebral subluxation complex.\" (pg. 4-6) This definition is differen t from the medical definition, in which subluxation means the incomplete o r partial dislocation or displacemen t of a bone from a joint. 26 Retrieved from http://www.gcc - uk.org/UserFiles/Docs/What%20Can%20I%20Expect/Vertebral%20Subluxation%20Complex.pdf 6 February 2017. 13 The MCSS also recommends legislative language27 which would prevent chiropractors from : 1)Making a diagnosis of an organic disease, the immune system, an infectious disease and cancers, based on the manual examination of the highest neck area of the spinal column. 2)Making a diagnosis by means of thermographs, heat reading machines, postural analysis and \"insight subluxation\" devices, as applied to the spinal column . 3)Advising any patient that HVLA spinal thrus t of the high neck/cervical area, from the base of the skull to the bottom of the second vertebrae, can be used to prevent, treat or influen ce the course of organic diseases of the body or the immune system, infectious diseases or cancers of the body. 4)Claiming that vertebral subluxations, as defined by the profession as vertebral bones that partly dislocated, can cau se organic diseases of the body or the immune system, infectious diseases or cancers of the body . 5)Claiming that the removal of the chiropr actic vertebral subluxation in the high neck/cervical spine can be used to treat, prevent or influence the course of organic diseases of the body, the immune system of a child or adul t, infectious diseases or cancer s of the body. While the literature revie w prepared at the Council's request systematically identifies peer - reviewed articles and evaluates and synthesizes the existing body of completed and recorded work produced by researchers, scholars, and practitioners to answer the given questions , the MCSS indicates that it has amassed \"sixty years of scientific studies, case reports and reviews (which) conclude that HVLA thrust of the cervical spine, in particular the high cervical spine can and does cause arterial damage and stroke.\"28 The Council reviewe d the extensive literature provided by the MCSS in support of its position and noted that in some cases the documents were dated. To determine whether the knowledge had advanced, the Council searched on -line and found it had. For instance, the MCSS pointe d to the \"Chiropractic Clinical Practice Guideline: Evidence -based Treatment of Adult Neck Pain not due to Whiplash\", published in 2005 in the Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association and the November 2005 summary of recommendations stemming from t he clinical practice guideline. In October 2016, the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics published \"The Treatment of Neck Pain - Associated Disorders and Whiplash -Associated Disorders: A Clinical Practic e Guideline\" which states that it su persedes the original (2005) neck pain guideline cited by the MCSS and the revised (2014 ) neck pain guideline as well as the 2010 whiplash -associated guidelines .29 The 2016 guideline also encourages evidence -based therapy and includes a disclaimer that the guideline is not a replacement for informed clinical decision -making: 27 Manitoba Chiropractic Stroke Survivors. \"High Velocity Low Amplitude Thrust of the High Neck\" November 2016 at 40- 42. 28 Ibid, at 26. 29 Bussieres, Andre E. et al. \"The Treatmen t of Neck Pain -Associated Disorders and Whiplash-Associated Disorders: A Clinical Practice Guideline\" , The Journal of Manipulative and Physiologic al Therapeutics, Octobe r 2016 at 558. 14 People should receive care based on evidence -based therapeutic options. Based on patient preference and resources available, a mixed multimodal approach including manual therapy and advi ce about self -management and exercise (supervised/unsupervised or at home) may be an effective treatment strategy for recent - onset and persistent NAD (neck pain -associated disorders) and WAD (whiplash pain - associated disorders) . . . . The evidence -based practice guidelines published by the CCGI (Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative) include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. Guidelines are intended to inform clinical decision making, are not prescriptive in nature, and do not replace professional chiropractic care or advice . . . . Furthermore, guidelines may not be complete or accurate because new studies that have been published too late in the process of guideline development . . . . Guideline users are urged to seek out newer information that might impact the diagnostic and/or treatment recommendations contained within a guideline.30 Similarly, the MCSS refere nces a patient handout distributed by the MCA and the Canadian Chiropractic Association (CCA) on neck adjustment. The patient handout references sources dated between 2001 and 2004, suggesting the handout is no longer current. A search of the MCA and CCA website s did not locate the handout. Instead, the MCA provides a link to the Canadian Chiropractic Association and the neck disorders and whiplash guidelines of the Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative. The MCSS, clearly compelled by the experiences of persons who have suffered a stroke and their loved ones, seeks publications studies and reports which corroborate those experiences and understandably seek s the prohibition of or severe constraints on the performance of HVLA . A closer examination of some of the studies cited by the MCSS does not, however, point to the need for such action as proposed by the MCSS. Norris et al (2000), on behalf of the Canadian Stroke Consortium, stated that most patients undergoing therapeutic neck manipulation will experience no ill effects but acknowledged that chiropractic neck manipulation can result in dissection of the carotid or vertebral arteries leading to stroke. The authors recommended that \"until a high -risk group can be identified, chiropractors should inform all patients of possible serious complications before neck manipulation.\"31 Paciaroni and Bogousslavsky (2009), after having reviewed synthesized available data on cerebrovascular adverse events associated with upper spinal manip ulation , concluded that e vidence sho ws an association between spinal manipulation and mild adverse events as well as with serious complications including dissection of cervical arteries most commonly involving the vertebral arteries and that specific risk factors for such adverse events and complications related to spinal manipulation have not been identified yet. The authors recommended that patients undergoing spinal manipulative therapy should be informed of the risk of stroke or vascular injury from th is procedure. 30 Ibid. 31 Norris , John W., Vadim Beletsky and Zurab G. Nadareishvili. \"Sudden Neck Movement and Cervical Artery Dissection\", Canadian Medical Association Journal. 163 (1) July 2000 at 40. 15 Manitoba Chiropractors Association (Appendix F) The MCA 's written submission states that the administration of the R eserved Act is a key component of chiropractic practice in Manitoba; in a 2009 survey of chiropractors in Manitoba , 99% responded that they performed the Reserved Act on a daily basis. The MCA also points out that the R eserved Act is within the scope of practice of chiropractors in every Canadian jurisdiction, without any limitation as to specific location along the s pine, i.e., cervical, thoracic or lumbar. The MCA 's position with respect to the R eserved Act as it is performed by chiropractors on the neck, or \"neck adjustment\" as the MCA describes it , is \"that the adjustment of the spine is an efficient and safe modality which facilitates the patient's body to experience optimum health \". The MCA provides four publications which \"outline the value of spinal adjustment, particularly with respect to neck adjustment targeting neck pain and headaches\". In reviewing the publications, the Council is not certain that these publications are demonstratively supportive of the MCA's position as comparisons are made only with exercise and massage and not other standard treatments such as over -the-counter pain medication . For e xample, Maiers et al concludes that spinal manipulative therapy combined with home exercise results in greater reduction of pain experienced by adults 65 years and over with a complaint of weekly mechanical neck pain, than home exercise alone.32 The study c onduct ed by Haavik -Taylor and Murphy examined the mechanism(s) responsible for the relief of pain and restoration of functional ability after spinal manipulation but did not compare the effectiveness of spinal manipulation to other forms of treatment .33 Haas et al compared the efficacy of two doses of spinal manipulation therapy and two doses of light massage for care of cervicogenic headache (such headache, according to the study, is associated with neck pain and dysfunction).34 The World Health Organiz ation Guidelines on Basic Training and Safety in Chiropractic stated \"it is beyond the scope of these guidelines to review the various indications for chiropractic care and the supportive research evidence.\"35 The MCA also asserted that a review of the lit erature included in its submission would show that chiropractic adjustment \"is more effective for acute and sub -acute neck pain, over both the short and long term, than management with non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs \"36 (ex., Advil ). However, the Cou ncil was not able to locate the study in the MCA submission which support s such a finding. The MCA states that the sum of the scientific studies and papers it included in its submission will lead to the conclusion \"that, at worst, there is a 'temporal' con nection between cervical and 32 Maiers, Michele et al. \"Spinal Manipulative Therapy and Exercise for Seniors with Chronic Neck Pain\", The Spine Journal 14 (2014) at 1887 -1888. 33 Haavik -Taylor, Heidi integration: A Study\", Clinical Neurophysiology 118 (2007) at 391. 34 Haas, Mitchell et al. \"Dose Response and Efficacy of Spinal Manipulation for Chronic Cervicogenic Headache: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial\", The Spine Journal 10 (2010) at 117. 35 World Health Organization, WHO Guidelines on Basic Training and Safety in Chiropractic (2005) at 19. 36 Manitoba Chiropractors Association, \"Submission to the Health Professions Advisory Council\" 17 November 2016 at 5. 16 dissection of the cervical arteries that may lead to strokes. It is the assertion of the MCA that it is highly unlikely that there is a cause and effect link between spinal adjustment and strokes.\"37 The studies the MCA relies on to support its position are not as emphatic in their conclusions as the MCA suggests. For instance, in the case of Cassidy et al, the MCA takes the study to say \"that it was not a chiropractic adjustment that caused the stroke to occur.\"38 Cassidy et al urged a cautious interpretation of its work , and treatment decisions based on effectiveness: Our results should be interpreted cautiously and placed into clinical perspective. We have not ruled out neck manipulation as a potential cause of some VBA strokes . On the other hand, it is unlikely to be a major cause of these rare events. Our results suggest that the association between chiropractic care and VBA stroke found in previous studies is likely explained by presenting symptoms attributable to vertebral a rtery dissection . . . . Unfortunately, there is no acceptable screening procedure to identify patients with neck pain at risk of VBA stroke. These events are so rare and difficult to diagnose . . . . Given our current state of knowledge, the decision of h ow to treat patients with neck pain and/or headache should be driven by effectiveness and patient preference.39 The MCA's submission describes the entry -to-practice requirements for chiropractors and the key competencies of a licensed chiropractor in Manito ba. According to the MCA, \"a typical doctor of chiropractic program includes an undergraduate university education as well as specific Doctor of Chiropractic training totally seven -eight years of intense study. This education includes classroom training, c linical skills development and evaluation. Doctor of Chiropractic programs involve an intensive four -year academic program in anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, pathology, orthopedics, neurology, radiology (x -ray), chiropractic technique, philosophy, publi c health, nutrition, disease prevention, rehabilitation and more. Chiropractic students undergo hundreds of hours of specialized training in spinal adjustments (emphasis in original) .\"40 Applicants for registration in Manitoba must be graduates of a Council of Chiropractic Education (CCE) -accredited Doctor of Chiropractic program and have completed the Canadian Chiropractic Examining Board (CCEB) entry -to-practice national competency exami nations . The MCA requires its members to provide care in a manner consistent with standards of practice and the MCA Patient Charter of Rights (the \"Charter\") . Standard of Practice S-05 requires the chiropractor to obtain written informed consent from the patient and to disclose and discuss \" potential risks (emphasis added) and benefits\" while the Charter promises patients that the chiropractor will provide them with information about \"any significant risks (emphasis added) associated with the proposed treatment\". The inconsistency in the language between the two documents may give rise to confusion about risks that need to be disclosed to chiropractic patients in Manitoba. 37 Ibid, at 8. 38 Ibid, at 10. 39 Cassidy, David J. et al \"Risk of Vertebrobasilar Stroke and Chiropractic Care\" .

( f r o m M C A Patient Charter of Rights ) College of Physiotherapists of Manitoba (Appendix G) In a letter to the Council, the CPM advised: Spinal manipulation treatment is taught in physiotherapy education prog rams at recognized universities in Canada. Postgraduate education in spinal manipulation technique s, including cervical manipulation, is available to practising physiotherapists. Manipulation of the spine, including \"high level cervical manipulation\" is within the scope of practice of physiotherapists in Manitoba and elsewhere in Canada. \"It is well documented and noted amongst phy siotherapists t hat there are certain high risks to applying cervical manipulation . . . . There are not good conclusive tests to indicate which client may suffer an untoward effect fr om a cervical manipulation. Consequently there are not many physiotherapists who pr actise high level ce rvical manipulation.\"18 Manitoba Na turopathic Association (Appendix H) The MNA registers and licenses naturopathic doctors in Manitoba. In their letter to the Council, the MNA advised as follows: Spinal adjustments and high neck manipulation are part of t he core curriculum in four-year naturopathic d egree programs taught at naturopathic medical colleges in North America. Applicants must have successfully passed the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing E xaminations (NPLEX) administered by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) prior to applying to the Manitoba Naturopathic Association. The use of spinal adjustments and high neck manipulation is part of the scope of practice for naturopathic doctors in North Americ a. \"Data regarding post procedure issues associated with high neck manip ulation . . . shows that adverse events associated with this procedure are statisti cally low risk. (Resea rch results) are generally inconclusive and may relate more to the predisposit ion or previously undiagnosed cardiovascular/cervical symp toms in a patient than the neck procedure itself .\" Colle ge of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba (Appendix I) In its letter to the Council, the CPSM indicated it sought input from physician leaders in Neurosurgery, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Neurology, and Orthopedic Surgery who each \"independently and unanimously expressed seri ous reservations about the use of high velocity, low amplitude thrust to move a joint of the spine within its anatomical range by chiropractors.\" The CPSM did not express an opinion about the performance of the Reserved Act by its own members. The phy sicians provided the CPSM with data in regard to the topic which the CPSM advised showed: Adverse events such as vertebral fracture, vertebral artery dissection and brain stem stroke, acute spinal cord injury, nerve root injury with motor and sens ory deficit, quad riplegia and death. Reports of vertebral artery dissection and carotid artery dissection causin g cerebral vascular accide nts. Lesser adverse effects such as tiredness, dizziness, nausea, ringing in the ears, etc. The spine surgeons noted the following risk factors: When a spinal nerve root, spinal cord and vertebral arteries are adjacent t o an arthritic fa cet joint. Quantification of force to the spine is difficult to co ntrol Age, gender and ethnicity of patient19 The position of physician leaders in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in regard to the Reserved Act is as follows: Chiropractic manipulation is not recommended in the absence of spinal p ain in an asympto matic individual. Chiropractic manipulation is not recommended for chronic spinal pain. Chiropractic manipulation is not recommended in the setting or radiculop athy (a set of condit ions in which one or more nerves are affected a nd do not work properly). If a chiropractor chooses to perform an adjustment of the cervical spine, it should only occur a fter obtaining written informed consent from the patient that includes mention of the association of cervical artery dissections an d stroke, po st manipulation, in patient s less than 45 years of age. [The Council notes that Rothwell et al found an association between recent chiropractic visits an d the risk of verte brobasilar accidents (a rare form of stroke) only in those age d less than 45 years. The study examined h ospital records of all persons admitt ed to an Ontario acute care fa cility with a diagnosis of vertebrobasilar dissectio n (a cause of str oke) or occlusion of the vertebral artery (a cause of stroke) ov er a six-year period.41] The CPSM i ndicated it had \"serious reservations\" about chiropractors having authority to perform the Reserved Act and did not limit its advice to \"high neck manipulation\" or cervical manipulation. The CPSM believes the MCA should be required to demonstrate scientifically the safety and efficacy of spinal manipulation therapy to ensure patient safety. Summary On the whole, the material provided to the C ouncil does not generate sufficiently definitive or conclusive evidence which would lead to a prohibition of the performance by regulated health professionals of \"high neck manipulation\" as part of the larger Reserved Act. The evidence does indicate, however, that the performance of \"high neck manipulation\" or cervical spine manipulation does present a risk of harm to patients. This risk of harm must be understood by both the patient and the practitioner. Both the jurisprudence review and the research literature review point to the need for the following actions to mitigate the risk of harm associated with the performance of cervical spine manipulation: Action One: Ensure that the patient provides written informed consent prior to initiating treatment which includes a discussion about the risk associated with cerv ical spine manipulation. 41 Rothwell, Deanna M., Susan J. Bondy and J. Ivan Williams. \"Chiropractic Manipulation and Stroke: A Population Based 32: 1054 1060. 20 Action Two: Provide patients with information to assist in the early recognition of a serious adv erse event.21 Appendix A.
