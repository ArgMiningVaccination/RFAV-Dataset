It might sound strange at first to think that sound alone could heal the body and emotions. But just think about any time you've put on a soothing soundtrack or your favorite song to lift your spirits.

In this interview in [Health & Wellbeing Magazine](https://www.wuweiwisdom.com/taoist-healing-sounds/), David James Lees explains that, \"Daoists use the Six Healing Sounds to help move internal Qi (chi) energy 'blockages' and rebalance wellbeing\". [Daoists](/articles/these-4-teachings-daoism-will-help-you-navigate-life) apply sound healing to their principles of qi (pronounced chee). Each person has qi energy in the body. Imbalances create blockages in the body that could result in disease or emotional distress. You can help [balance qi](/articles/5-healthy-habits-from-traditional-chinese-medicine) by stimulating the energy flow in different organs in the body with sound healing. Changing the sound creates a unique sensation, like helping to relieve stress, uplifting your mood, or releasing anger.
