My Ph.D. dissertation studied the theme of kenosis in the theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar and the resulting implications for human agency and flourishing. I am currently a co -investigator working with Katherine Pider man at Mayo Clinic on a research project entitled \"Hear My Voice: A Chaplain -Led Qualitative Intervention Pilot Study with Patients with Progressive Neurologic Conditions.\" I hope to develop a similar project to use with patients with chronic renal disease . E-mail; Yoder.Timothy@mayo.edu . Bailu Yu , B.S . I am a graduate student at Ningxia Medical University in China in the School of Public Health there. Professor Wang has been my tutor for the past three y ears. I have published three articles, and recently received a prize for my article on \"The predictors of non -alcoholic fatty liver disease in those of Hui ethnicity.\" Because Dr. Wang's research direction is the mental health area, I became interested i n mental health and social factors, as well as in co- morbidity between mental disorders and physical health. I am very eager to learn more about the study of mental health and social culture (religion is an important cultural phenomenon in China). E-mail: memory_ll@163.com .
