It appears that Mikovits is once again in the news. Here's a [story from Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxevj5/the-coronavirus-truthers-dont-believe-in-public-health) that provides some context: \"We don't need a vaccine,\" proclaimed Dr. Judy Mikovits, [a controversial former chronic fatigue researcher]who now frequently makes anti-vaccine claims, in an April 15 YouTube video [with more than 80,000 views.]\"All you have to do is have a healthy immune system.\" (Mikovits has also been involved in the \"Fire Fauci\" campaign, [claiming he sabotaged her research]into a purported mouse virus that she says is the true cause of cancer.) Mikovits first came to our attention in 2011, thanks to a paper \u2014 [eventually retracted](http://retractionwatch.com/2011/12/22/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-xmrv-paper-retracted-by-science-completely-this-time/) \u2014 in Science claiming a now-debunked link between a particular virus and chronic fatigue syndrome. She was [fired from her position](http://www.retractionwatch.com/2011/10/03/why-didnt-xmrv-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-researcher-mikovits-now-fired-share-data-with-science/) at the Whittemore Peterson Institute, and would soon spend several days in a California jail, with the [charges dropped](http://retractionwatch.com/2012/06/16/catching-up-charges-against-cfs-xmrv-researcher-mikovits-charges-dropped-gyres-author-andrulis-publishes-another-paper/) soon thereafter. Mikovits would eventually \u2014 and [unsuccessfully](http://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/16/court-dismisses-lawsuit-by-xmrv-chronic-fatigue-researcher/) \u2014 file a suit against her former employer and others, and [write a book](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/03/11/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-researcher-mikovits-who-championed-link-to-xmrv-to-publish-book/). From the book's teaser: On this journey Dr. Mikovits would face the scientific prejudices against CFS, wander into the minefield that is autism, and through it all struggle to maintain her faith in God, the American justice system and the profession to which she had dedicated her life. This is a story for anybody interested in the promise and peril of science at the very highest levels in our country. A hint of things to come also appeared in 2014, when Mikovits spoke at Autism One, an annual conference that typically features discussions of how vaccines cause autism and that was co-founded by her co-author Kent Heckenlively. Her talk: \"Environmental Causes of Autism: Investigate If You Dare,\" included a slide titled: \"The best scientist in jail story since Galileo.\" She and Heckenlively published \" [Plague of Corruption: Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science](https://www.amazon.com/Plague-Corruption-Restoring-Promise-Science/dp/1510752242)\" last month. She has taken to the airwaves to promote the book \u2014 and \" [Plandemic](https://plandemicmovie.com/),\" a video [since removed from YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICtsXNtf_GQ&feature=youtu.be) \u2014 and air her grievances against Fauci, which appear groundless but have found a sympathetic ear in at least one interviewer whose Twitter account has [since been suspended](https://twitter.com/TinaAguayotv).
