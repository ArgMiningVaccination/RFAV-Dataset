Is this, yet, one more man-made catastrophe like GMO's, bee-killing pesticides and Global Warming? The New York Post thinks so: \"[President] Xi didn't actually admit that the coronavirus...had escaped from one of the country's bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive titled: 'Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.'\" * Well, as they say, there's no use crying over spilt milk; the question is, what do we do about it now? Surgical Masks? Many people are buying up face masks (surgical masks) to the point that there are almost none left for the medical profession! These masks will not help you! They're not air-tight and they will not keep viruses out! Plus they encourage you to touch your face which you shouldn't be doing. People WITH the virus can wear them to keep droplets from flying everywhere when they cough. But if you're well, you don't need them unless you're caring for the sick. This virus is spread by droplets, so, distance yourself from people and, as we've been told 100 times... keep washing your hands and don't touch your face! [P.S. Since I wrote this, the CDC has changed its mind. Now we have to all to wear masks!] What Else Can We Do? Now the question becomes, isn't there anything else we can do? Crazily, the \"experts\" say no! We are now paying the price for the \"hold\" the pharmaceutical industry has over just about everyone and everything: the medical profession, the mainstream media, the politicians.... You will not hear any of them contradict the unspoken \"gospel\" that no opinion has any merit except that of Big Pharma and its many minions. Therefore, you will not hear from anyone in authority that you should stop eating junk food because sugar depresses the immune system. You will not hear about any of the immune-enhancers and natural antivirals that are out there and will help keep you safe. Imagine: if we knew about these things, we could have kept restaurants, bars, Disneyland, colleges and all the other things that are closed, open! But it would seem that Big Pharma would rather all of us died than risk losing even a dime of their over-bloated profits. Vitamin C You'd think people would know about Vitamin C by now. Nobel laureate, Linus Pauling wrote Vitamin C, The Common Cold and the Flu in 1976. Here's what page 66 of his book says: Dr. F. Morishige [I'm guessing this is pronounced Mori-shee-gee] chief surgeon in Fukuoka General Hospital in Japan, ... had made an experimental study of ascorbic acid [vitamin C] in relation to the healing of wounds while he was working for his MD degree, and had continued to be interested in this vitamin. He gave some of the surgical patients no vitamin C or only a little, whereas others received large amounts. Of the 150 patients who got little or no vitamin C (less than 1.5 grams a day) 11 developed serum hepatitis (incidence 7%), but not a single case occurred in the 1,095 patients who received 2 grams per day or more (Murata, 1975). Dr. Morishige now has his surgical patients and intensive-care patients take 10 grams of vitamin C each day while they are in the hospital, and 6 grams a day thereafter. He has also reported success with ascorbic acid [vitamin C] in controlling other viral diseases including (Murata, 1975). We may conclude from the observations reported by Klenner, Morishige and others that ascorbic acid has both a significant prophylactic effect and a significant therapeutic effect against all viral diseases, when it is taken in the proper amounts. (emphasis mine) _____ Health Impact News reported that China has conducted several clinical trials that involved the intravenous application of vitamin C to treat patients with coronavirus. An article in Global Research titled \"China Treating Coronavirus with Intravenous Vitamin C\" says the following: Report from China: Three Intravenous Vitamin C Research Studies Approved for Treating COVID-19 ... Dr. Cheng, who is a US board-certified specialist in anti-aging medicine, adds: \"Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the COVID-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard of large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.\" He adds that: \"Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death. \"We therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic.\" News of vitamin C research for COVID-19 is being actively suppressed. Anyone saying that vitamin therapy can stop coronavirus is already being labeled as \"promoting false information\" and promulgating \"fake news.\" Even the sharing of verifiable news, and direct quotes from credentialed medical professionals, is being restricted or blocked on social media. You can see sequential examples of this phenomenon at my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/themegavitaminman. Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has, literally, met with Google and Facebook and other media giants to stop the spread of what they declare to be wrong information. Physician-directed, hospital-based administration of intravenous vitamin C has been marginalized or discredited. Scientific debate over COVID-19 appears not to be allowed.** **** This news is utterly chilling but, unfortunately, not the least bit surprising! Sufficient-C I'm taking 6 grams (6,000 mg.) of \"Sufficient-C\" every day. It's powdered vitamin C; mixes with water; no pills to swallow, 1 tsp. in half a cup of water = 2,000 mg. Tastes good. I take it 3 times a day. Sufficient-C is non-GMO and there is no sugar added. You can order it from Amazon.com. Of course, I imagine that any brand of Vitamin C will do. Elderberry From ScienceDaily.com: Elderberry compounds could help minimize flu symptoms, study suggests Date: April 23, 2019 Source: University of Sydney Summary: Compounds from elderberries can directly inhibit the virus's entry and replication in human cells, and can help strengthen a person's immune response to the virus.*** ___ I went out and bought Elderberry Syrup, figuring it would taste great! I was wrong!!! So, as some of you might know, Sambucus is homeopathic Elderberry. I've been taking Sambucus 6C once a day, in water, with 10 succussions before each dose **** as a preventive. However, elderberry also comes in capsules, tinctures and so forth which you can also consider. Monolaurin If you're anything like me, you've never heard of it! But our own Dr. Deva Khalsa wrote the following in an email to our editor, Alan Schmukler, and Alan passed it on to me. Here's what Dr. Khalsa said: Lauric acid has powerful antiviral properties. For the last 20 years, I've been personally taking a product called Monolaurin, by Ecological Labs, whenever I fly. At my old practice in PA, teachers and folks who fly often for business would buy out my stock of Monolaurin - and thank me for carrying it - as they never got sick when their students all came down with the flu or came down with it after they were on a plane. I've sent it to my son and recommended it to everyone that I know as prevention for what's happening with this new coronavirus. As Benjamin Franklin said long ago, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" Right now, it's never been more true! How does lauric acid work to prevent viral infection? The medium chain fatty acids of coconut oil, and primarily lauric acid, destroy enveloped viruses. Dr. Fabian Dayrit, Ph.D. and Dr. Mary Newport, M.D. have just published a paper regarding its potential to also combat the new Coronavirus. Lauric acid (C12) and monolaurin, its derivative, have been known for many years to have significant antiviral activity. Lauric acid is a medium-chain fatty acid which makes up about 50% of coconut oil; monolaurin is a metabolite that is naturally produced by the body's own enzymes upon ingestion of coconut oil ( lauric acid) and is also available in pure form as a supplement (monolaurin). Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiviral activity of lauric acid and monolaurin: 1st -they cause disintegration of the virus envelope 2nd - they can inhibit late maturation stage in the virus replicative cycle 3rd - they can prevent the binding of viral proteins to the host cell membrane. Because of the antiviral and antibacterial protection that it provides to animals, coconut oil, as well as lauric acid and monolaurin, is used in farm animals and pets as veterinary feed supplements. *** Well, it looks like I'll be ordering that from Amazon too. Dr. Khalsa has written a special addendum to the above and I want to share it with you: Hi friends, I'm pretty sure I got the COVID 19 Virus. I had all the symptoms. Fever, fatigue, dry cough, sore throat and some body aches. I'd been traveling. From New Zealand, through LAX (what a terrible airport!) across the US and then drove up the East Coast back to PA. At first I attributed the dry cough to the heaters in hotel rooms and that extra warm feeling to the car heat being too high. Then the fatigue and sore throat hit and I knew I had it. I should tell you right away that I did not get tested. I would have loved to have been able to get a test. First of all, I didn't have a local doctor (as I just arrived after 14 years of being away) to write a note for the test. Additionally, the drive through testing places were not in my area - and any I could get to had reports of long lines and large crowds.... and I felt like S**T and so had no desire to go through this. That said, I had the keynote symptoms and I've never had anything like this before. But, because I had set up everything that I might need before the trip I had it all ready. And I was sick for less than 3 days. Maybe 5 days if you count my two days of denial. What did I do? Number 1. I had my MD in New Zealand give me 200,000 IU of Vitamin D intramuscular so my D levels would be very high. Number 2. I took 600 mg of Monolaurin by Ecological Formulas twice a day every day. When I was wondering if the cough was 'the virus' or the hotel heat, I upped that to 2 pills twice a day. Number 3. I took a teaspoon of Argentyn 23 Colloidal Silver three to four times a day during the drive and upped it to 6x a day when I realized I had the virus. Sovereign Silver is also good and I used some of that when the other ran low. Number 4. I took vitamin C all day. Most of the vitamin C you take orally is excreted so you have to drink it all day long. I use Perque buffered vitamin C as the doctor who makes the product was my client with his dog and he is obsessive about making the perfect supplement. This virus uses up a lot of your vitamin C stores so you have to sip C all day. Number 5. I put Oregano Oil and boiling water into a bowl and inhaled it through my nose and through my mouth. This kills the virus in your lungs, sinuses and throat. I also took a hot bath 4x a day with oregano oil in it and breathed it in. Number 6. I took Barlean's Olive Leaf Complex 16 ounces and would take a half ounce and gargle with it twice a day. This also kills the virus in your throat. Number 7. I had Boiron's Oscillococcinum on hand (you can get this at any health food store and you take this at the first start of any flu) I took just a few tiny pellets 4 -6 times a day. [Editor's note: People are catching on to Oscillococcinum. There's a note in Whole Foods limiting Oscillococcinum to 2 per customer due to high demand. By the way, Oscillococcinum is pronounced: Ah-sillo-cock-sigh-num. \"Oscillo\" for short. Pay attention to what Dr. Khalsa says about the dosage-\"a few tiny pellets\"; the directions on the box say to take the whole vial all at once; that is completely not necessary!] After arriving in PA on Wednesday...well... I knew by Friday that I was genuinely ill and had all the symptoms. I began with #4 and #5 and #6 in earnest. I wondered how I would fare on Saturday? Would I take a turn for the worse on Sunday? After sleeping for about 15 hours straight, having gone to bed at 4 p.m. on Saturday, I woke up feeling pretty good on Sunday. A little tired. Not ready to run that extra mile but comfortable that I'm on the mend. A few more days of not pushing myself and I will be better than new. I did consults all day and at 4 p.m., am certainly ready for a rest but I have not done my regime as I've been on the phone all day. I wanted to share this with all of you right now so that you have this on hand...... just in case. I'd learned from very reliable high level sources that this virus cannot survive colloidal silver. You all have my email explaining how the nano particle colloidal silver is totally different from any other. In my opinion, the colloidal silver is a keystone of the treatment. But all of the above works synergistically. Stay well and love you all, Dr. Khalsa P.S. You can put this on Facebook or send this to anyone you think would need it. Homeopathy I can tell you right now, there is not a single homeopath in the world worried about what they will do if they get Coronavirus, as homeopathy successfully treats viral infections every day of the week! In fact, at the first sign of a sore throat, I take a sip of Ferrum phos. 200C and that's the end of it! If I wake up in the middle of the night with a cough? I keep Phosphorus 200C by my bed. One dose of that and the cough is gone in short order, in roughly half an hour or less. Here is Dr. Gabrielle Traub talking about the current crop of homeopathic remedies being used for the Coronavirus: 1) This virus is particularly sensitive to heat. During illness or for prevention drink hot water and avoid ice cold drinks and popsicles. Go out in the sun. Your body produces a fever to kill the virus. Do not use medications to suppress fevers unless they get too high. 2) Conventional treatments: A study published in the Lancet showed that antivirals are not effective and corticosteroids do not improve death rates, in fact they delay clearance of the virus. Luckily homeopathic remedies have a long history of being extremely helpful during epidemics, including the 1918 Spanish flu. 3) Homeopathic remedies to keep on hand: I have been in communication with colleagues in China, Japan and Italy who have been treating COVID-19. They have found the following homeopathic remedies to be most helpful at this time. Gelsemium (Fatigue with heavy eyelids, chills, difficulty concentrating) Bryonia alba (Dry cough. Pain in head and chest worse for movement.) Eupatorium perfoliatum (Intense bone pains) Antimonium tartaricum (Rattling cough, difficult expectoration, too weak to expectorate, lungs feel as if drowning) Arsenicum album (restlessness, anxiety and fatigue is predominant) Oscillococcinum (general flu-like symptoms) 4) Quit smoking: Researchers are found that death rates and complications from this virus are higher in smokers, possibly due to the effect on smoking on an enzymatic pathway, the ACE-expressing cell ratio. 5) Washing hands: This virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, however you'd be surprised how many times people touch their face, eyes or nose in that time. Regular hand washing is still the best prevention. Wash with soap and water while singing the \"Happy Birthday\" song from beginning to end twice. Hand sanitizers containing 60% or more alcohol can be used when soap and water is not available. Foaming soaps are slightly less effective than regular ones as it's the slippery quality in the soap that washes off the virus. The virus can live on metal surfaces for at least 12 hours (think door knobs) and on fabric for 6-12 hours. An exception to this is copper metal which actually has antimicrobial properties. The virus is killed by regular laundry detergent or leaving clothes out in the sun. 6) At this time, face masks are only recommended for healthcare workers or those who are sick or taking care of the sick. Correct fitting, putting on, removal and disposal of masks is essential for them to be effective. The CDC recommends disposable N95 masks. However this virus is quite large in size with a 400-500nm diameter. Protective eye wear (without air vents) is needed as the virus can enter the body through the eyes. 7) Vitamins and herbs: Vitamins A, D and liposomal Vitamin C are the most important at the first signs of infection. Vitamin A and D can be toxic if you take too much. Critically ill patients infected with COVID-19 have been found to have high concentrations of cytokines, producing a cytokine \"storm\". Supplements like elderberry and echinacea which promote cytokine activity may be extremely helpful for prevention and during early stages of the illness but best avoided during critical stages. It's important to consider which supplements promote or inhibit cytokine activity, the stage of illness and each individual's immune response. Stay Healthy Naturally Gabrielle Traub and the San Diego Homeopathy Team. *** The team at Miccant homeopathic software sent out the following: Jeremy Sherr Sense of 'drowning' from the infection, possibly with white tongue - Antimonium tartaricum When the lungs are involved and the patient has extreme weakness consider Stannum metallicum When the patients feels 'very heavy and weighed down' consider Muriaticum acidum Rajan Sankaran: If the patient has suddenly collapsed, possibly with cold sweat, remember Camphora. (other symptoms of this Rx are delirium, confusion, agitation, high squeaky voice, blue face) Manish Bhatia Tightness of chest with short breath, gasping on movement - Lycopodium. In late stages a purple tongue has often been seen (consider Merc-sol, Arsenicum alb, Camphora, Carbo-veg, Hydrocyanic acid) Loss of taste and smell (Pulsatilla, Kali bichromicum - although there are quite a few remedies that cover this) ___________________ As you can see, there are MANY things you can do to protect yourself from catching this virus; but if I could leave you with just one take-away? Vitamin C! Vitamin C should be selling-out the world over, it should be flying off the shelves; it should be impossible to keep enough of it in stock because of the overwhelming demand! I have only one caveat; over-dosing on Vitamin C will cause loose stools or diarrhea. So, it's better to take a little bit often rather than a lot all at once. Tailor your dosage to your reaction to it. You're going to have to do your own research and save yourselves; the \"experts\", the \"authorities\", are not going to advise you of anything that offends Big Pharma, and because Vitamin C and other natural products cannot be patented? Big Pharma has no use for them; and by extension, anyone who takes money from Big Pharma will have no use for them, and that includes politicians, television networks and most of the people in the medical field. P.S. This just in from Dr. Asa Hershoff: CDP Choline (aka Citicoline) 2,000 mg. a day if you have the virus, is a phospholipase A-2 inhibitor, the enzyme that allows Coronavirus to overwhelm the system. Easy to research. Amazon has it. Here are Asa Hershoff's exact words from his facebook post, in which he had to abbreviate \"virus\" as \"V\" and \"corona\" as \"C\": DEAR CLUELESS GOVERNMENTS (and Super Clueless Medical Profession and Superduper Clueless Pharmaceutical Companies) Instead of $2 Trillion on a bailout, spend $1 Billion to give everyone CITICHOLINE (CDP Choline). PEOPLE Massive lung inflammation won't happen! Take 2000 mg/day if hit in the lungs by that bug (if I say the name this will be deleted by those who are too clueless to take Citicholine!) It is a phospholipase A2 inhibitor\u2014the enzyme that allows it to overwhelm the system. THIS stops it! Easy to research. Not for every V there is, but yes for the C type V. ************************* See you again next time! ___________ *https://nypost.com/2020/02/22/dont-buy-chinas-story-the-coronavirus-may-have-leaked-from-a-lab/ **https://www.globalresearch.ca/three-intravenous-vitamin-c-research-studies-approved-treating-covid-19/5705405 ***https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190423133644.htm ****What do I mean by \"succussions\"?
