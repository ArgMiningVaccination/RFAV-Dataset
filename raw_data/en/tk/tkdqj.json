Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 iv Contents Introduction ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ for Vaccine Safety Surveillance ................................ ................................ .................. 5 Age and Sex ................. 20 Notes 2018 ................................ ................................ .............................. 30 Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 1 Introduction Public health surveillance of adverse events following immunization (AEFI s) is essential to monitor the safety of vaccines in Ontario. When viewed collectively, reports of AEFIs provide vital information to help identify previously unrecognized or rare adverse events or an increase in frequency or severity of known adverse even ts, which then can be further evaluated. In addition, AEFI surveillance provides valuable information to support publicly -funded immunization program planning and communication about the safety of vaccines administered in the province. AEFI surveillance is a highly collaborative process requiring participation across multiple stakeholders within public health and the broader health care system, as well as individual vaccine recipients and their caregivers. In Ontario, public health units (PHUs) play a centr al role as the primary recipients of AEFI reports, which they investigate and document according to provincial surveillance requirements. Public Health Ontario (PHO) coordinates the provincial AEFI surveillance system, working closely with PHUs and the Min istry of Health ( MOH ). For detailed information about roles and responsibilities within Ontario's AEFI surveillance system, as well as the purpose and objectives of conducting AEFI surveillance, please see the Technical Annex of the Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario (subsequently referred to as the \"Technical Annex\"). Annual vaccine safety data for Ontario are now available through bo th the Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario and the interactive online Vaccine Safety Surveillance Tool. New in 2018 Further enhancements to the online tool were made to accompany the release of this report. PHU -specific comparisons are now available for each vaccine Adverse event types are also available by vaccine Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 2 Report Objectives and Scope The objective of this report is to summarize AEFIs reported in Ontario following vaccines administered in 2018. In addition, reporting trends are assessed by comparing AEFIs reported in Ontario following vaccines administered across seven years between 2012 and 2018 . Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 3 Methods An AEFI report refers to a report receiv ed by the PHU, which pertains to one individual vaccine recipient who experiences one or more adverse events that are temporally associated (i.e., the event occurs after administration of the vaccine) with receipt of one or more vaccines administered at th e same time (i.e., during the same day). The Annual R eport includes the most up -to-date data and includes delayed AEFI reports received that relate to immunizations administered in previous years. This means that annual numbers may differ slightly from pa st reports. Trends in reported AEFIs are influenced by many factors , including changes to the publicly -funded immunization program. Of note in 2018, the following changes were made in the publicly -funded immunization program: High -dose influenza vaccine wa s introduced for persons 65 years and older . Rot-5 replaced Rot -1, which resulted in an increase from a two to three dose -series for the routine infant rotavirus immunization program. In addition, in 2017 a new non -live recombinant virus vaccine for zoster (RZV) was authorized for use in individuals 50 years and older and available for private purchase. For a detailed description of Ontario's AEFI surveillance system , definitions, an in -depth explanation of analytic methods and notes on the limitations of AEFI surveillance data , please see the Technical Annex . For a complete list of vaccine acronyms used in this report and a description of im munization program changes in recent years, see Appendix 1 and Appendix 3, respectively, of the Technical Annex . Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 4 Results In Ontario, 742 AEFI reports were received following vaccines administered in 2018 , representing a population -based reporting rate of 5.1 per 100,000 population (Figure 1). The annual reporting rate between 2012 and 201 8 ranged from 4. 5 to 5.2 per 100,000 population with n o statistically significant change in trends observed over this seven -year period. Figure 1. Number of Reports and Reporting Rate of AEFIs per 100,000 Population by Year: Ontario, 2012 -18 AEFI reports: MOH, integrated Public Health Information System [2019/06/27 ]. Population: IntelliHEALTH Ontario1,2 Note: Only includes AEFI reports classified as confirmed , as per provincial AEFI reporting criteria. See the Technical Annex for more information about provincial AEFI surveillance case classifications . Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 5 Age and Sex Distribution In 2018 , persons with AEFI reports ranged in age from two month s to 99 years, with a median age of 30 years. Approximately half of all reports were among those younger than 18 years of age ( 44.2 % of tot al AEFI reports). The majority of all AEFI reports were among females ( 65.9 %). Among specific age categories, the highest AEFI reporting rate in 2018 was in infants under one year (30.1 per 100,000 population), followed by children aged one to three years (26.3 per 100,000 population) (Figure 2). Amon g adults 65 years and older, the AEFI reporting rate increased from 5.1 to 6.2 per 100,000 population between 2017 and 2018 (see Vaccine Safety Surveillance Tool). Global Indicator for Vaccine Safety Surveillance In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a new Global Vaccine Action Plan indicator for vaccine safety surveillance based on the number of AEFIs reported by country per 100,000 surviving infants.3 A target of 10 per 100,000 was initially set , as this level \"reflects if a country has a basic system in place fo r reporting of safety concerns .\"4 In 2016, there were approximately 80 countries with >=40/100,000 and over 40 of those had >=160/100,000.3 Applying the methodology to the Ontario AEFI surveillance data, the ratio among infants under one year was 32.7 per 100,000 surviving infants.

Population : IntelliHEALTH Ontario1,2 Reporting Source In 2018 , the majority of AEFIs were reported by physicians and other healthcare professionals ( 67.2 %; 431 of 641 reports with reporting source completed) - consistent with what was observed in previo us years (Figure 4). In particular, the proportion of reports from other healthcare professionals (e.g., nurses, pharmacists) has increased over time. Of note, pharmacists started administering influenza vaccines (to adults and children five years of age a nd older) as part of the universal influenza immunization program (UIIP) in Ontario in 2012. In 2016, pharmacists had an expanded scope of practice to administer other non -publicly funded vaccines .5 Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 7 Figure 3 . Percent Distribution of AEFIs by Reporting Source: Ontario, 2012 -18 AEFI reports: MOH , integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) database, extracted [2019/06/27 ]. Notes: Excludes 489 reports between 2012 and 2018 with unknown reporting source. Reporting source 'Other healthcare professi onal' includes the following iPHIS values: healthcare professionals, hospital, health area, lab and branch office. Reporting source 'Other' includes the following iPHIS values: Facility, insurance, other agency, workplace, personnel, friend, detention cent re and other (specify). Geographic Distribution There was a wide variation in overall AEFI reporting by PHU in 201 8, with PHU -specific reporting rates ranging from 0.0 to 19.5 per 100,000 population. Twenty -one PHUs ( 58.3 %) met or exceeded the overall prov incial AEFI reporting rate of 5.1 per 100,000 population in 2018 , while the remainder ( 15 PHUs) were below the provincial rate, including the three most populated PHUs (Figure 4). This represents a slightly lower proportion of PHUs exceeding the provincial rate compared to 2017 (61.1 %, 21/36 PHUs). One PHU did not report any AEFIs in 201 8.

Population: IntelliHEALTH Ontario2 Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 9 There was a wide variation in PHU -specific rates among selected age and vaccine categories (Figure 5). Among infants and children under four years of age, the rate of AEFI reporting for routine infant and early childhood vaccines ( typically delivered by a primary health care provider ) ranged between 9.6 to 110.0 per 100,000 population, excluding three PHUs with zero AEFIs . This was lower than the seven PHUs that did not report any AEFIs in this age group in 2017 . Among 11 - to 17 -year -olds, the PHU - specific reporti ng rate for AEFIs following the three vaccines that are administered to adolescents by PHUs in school -based programs ranged between 1.0 to 60.3 per 100,000 population, excluding 1 3 PHUs with zero AEFIs . This was similar to the 12 PHUs that did not report any AEFIs in 2017 . In 2018, 4,217,528 net doses of influenza vaccine were distributed throughout the province (refer to Technical Annex on derivation of doses distributed). Rates of influenza AEFI reports are calculated per 100,000 doses distributed and ranged between 1.0 to 22.7 per 100,000 doses distributed, excluding two PHUs with zero reports . This was lower than the six PHUs that did not report any AEFIs in 2017 . Please refer to the online Vaccine Safety Surveillance Tool for the to tal number of reports and reporting rates for each PHU.

PHUs with 0 AEFI reports are excluded from the range. 3, 13 and 2 PHUS reported 0 AEFIs among infant/early childhood, school -based and influenza vaccines , respectively . 2. Routine infant and early childhood Rot -1, Rot-5, Pneu -C-13, include HPV -9, Men -C-ACYW and HB). Vaccines In 2018, approximately 8. 6 milli on doses of vaccines were distributed in Ontario for the publicly -funded immunization programs. Using net doses distributed for each routine, publicly -funded vaccine as the denominator, the highest vaccine -specific AEFI reporting rates in 201 8 were observe d for HPV9 , Men -C- ACWY and Pneu -P-23 vaccines ( Table 1 A). Although influenza vaccine was associated with the highest number of AEFI reports, it had the third lowest AEFI reporting rate due to the high volume of doses distributed. The vaccine -specific serious AEFI reporting rates for vaccines for which dose distribution data were available ranged between zero and 3. 8 per 100,000 doses distributed. Men -C-C and MMR had the highest serious AEFI reporting rates (3.8 and 2. 7 per 100,00 0 doses distributed , respectively) . Refer to Serious AEFIs for further information (see Technical Annex for definition). The number of AEFI reports among other high -risk publicly -funded and non -publicly -funded vaccines i s provided in Table 1 B. The number of vaccine -specific AEFIs ranged between 1 and 98, with one serious AEFI observe d with Men -B. For annual vaccine -specific reporting rates prior to 2018, please refer to the online Vaccine Safety Surveillance Tool. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 11 Recombinant herpes zoster vaccin e (RZV) In vaccine (RZV , AEFIs comprised 13.2% (n=98) of all AEFIs in 2018. RZV AEFI reporting rate (31.7 per 100,000 doses distributed6) was higher than the live virus herpes zoster vaccine (LZV , Zostavax\u00ae II ) offered through the publicly -funded program (16.3 per 100,000 doses). The most commonly reported reactions among RZV AEFIs were pain, redness, swelling (57.1%), rash (21.4%), and fever (17.3%). Co -admin istration vaccine occurred in 11.2% of RZV AEFIs (n=11). There were no serious AEFI reports following immunization with RZV. Individuals with an RZV AEFI ranged in age from 34 to 93 years (median age 63 years), with a predominance among femal es (82.7%). The highest number of was among 55 -59 year olds (n=23, 23.5%, 2.2 per 100,000 population), while 65 -69 year olds were associated with the highest rate (n=18, 18.4%, 2.3 per 100,000 population).

Vaccine -specific reporting rates per 100,000 doses distributed are calculated for routine, publicly -funded vaccines only, due to unknown vaccine distribution for other vaccines within the private market. 3. An AEFI that meets the serious definition is typically associated with an in -patient hospitali zation or death (refer to Technical Annex ). Adverse Event Descriptions The most frequently reported specific adverse event -types (excluding fever in conjunction with another reportable event due to overlap with other reported event types) were pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, followed by rash and skin allergic reactions (Table 2A -2D). At least one i njection site reaction was recorded in 49.9 % (n=370) of all AEFI reports , three of which were classified as serious (0.8%) . Rashes were the se cond most frequently reported specific adverse event -type, present in 25.7 % of reports (n= 191); 96.9 % were classified as non -serious. Among those AEFI reports with rash, 41.9 % (n=80) were associated with administration of live virus vaccine s (i.e., MMR, MM RV, Var or LZV) and 52.5 % (n= 42) of these occurred within five to 42 days of vaccine administration (i.e., within the expected range of time to rash onset for live virus vaccines). Among those occurring within five to 42 days , five were confirmed as vaccin e-strain by genotyping, including four that were measles vaccine strain (all following MMR vaccine , including one classified as serious ) and one varicella vaccine strain (following LZV, which was classified as serious ). Allergic skin reactions comprised 13 .6% of all AEFI reports (n=101); only one event was classified as serious. Refer to Serious AEFIs for further information .

Tables 3A - 3C list the 10 most frequent routine , publicly -funded vaccines associated with the three most frequently reported adve rse events types described above, in descending order of AEFI reporting rate. Pneu -P-23 was the most commonly associated vaccine with pain, redness and swelling reactions (16.6 per 100,000 doses). Men -C-C was the most frequently associated vaccine for rash reactions (16.9 per 100,000 doses) and HPV -9 was the mos t frequently associated vaccine for allergic skin reactions (6.6 per 100,000 doses).

Notes : 1. Adverse event categories r epresent groupings of specific adverse events within a common category. An AEFI report may contain multiple adverse events from different adverse event categories, as well as more than one adverse event within the same adverse event category. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 17 Reports with more than one adverse event within the same category are counted only once in the category totals. Therefore, the sum of adverse event -specific counts within a category may not equal to the category total . 2. Includes only those adverse events where the count was at least one. For a complete list of possible values in iPHIS and corresponding definitions, please see Appendix 2 of the Technical Anne x. 3. Each AEFI report may contain one or more specific adverse events. Thus the sum will not equal to the total number of AEFIs reported in 2018. 4. Percentages will not sum to 100%. The denominator is the total number of confirmed AEFI reports with at least o ne adverse event reported (n= 742). 5. Classified as medically important events.

Notes : 1. Only the 10 vaccines with the hig hest rates within each adverse event type are shown. There were 14 AEFIs reported that were classified as medically important events in 201 8, representing 1.9% of all reports (please see the Technical Annex for a description of a medically important event ). Four of these 14 events also met the definition of a serious AEFI and are therefore described under Seriou s AEFIs . Of the remaining 10 medically important events, the majority (n=8) were reports of events managed as anaphylaxis among persons who ranged in age from one to 45 years and one report each of intussusception in a two -month old following receipt of R ot-1 and Guillian -Barr\u00e9 syndrome in an adult after receiving HAHB vaccine. There were two additional reports of anaphylaxis that were classified as serious (described below) for a total of 10 events managed as anaphylaxis reported in 2018. Among the 10 rep orts of anaphylaxis, the most frequently reported vaccines were Inf ( five reports) and Men -C-ACYW (three reports, two of which involved co -administration of HB and HPV9 ). All events managed as anaphylaxis were assessed using the Brighton Collaboration stan dard definition of anaphylaxis .8 Two met the Brighton definition at level II of diagnostic certainty. The remaining eight (80.0%) reports did not have sufficient documented evidence to meet levels I, II or III of diagnostic certainty. Serious AEFIs There w ere 21 AEFI reports in 201 8 that were classified as serious (please see the Technical Annex for a description of a serious AEFI) , representi ng 2.8% (21/742) of all reports and a serious AEFI reporting rate of 1.5 per 1,000,000 population. All serious AEFI reports were following administration of at leas t one publicly -funded vaccine ( 2.4 per 1,000,000 publicly -funded doses %; n= 17) occurred in individuals under 18 years of age, with most in children under four years (n=14). All 21 serious AEFIs in 2018 were admitted to hospital with a mean length of stay of 4.7 days (range 1 to 49 days) ; there wer e no reports of death . The proportion of AEFIs defined as serious remained relatively stable between 2012 and 2018 (2.8% to 5.0%) . Based on case -level review, the re were five reports of convulsions/seizure s - all of which occurred in children two years of age and under and four reports documented as being febrile. In addition, t here were three reports of vaccine strain illness, including two that were laboratory -confirmed and one that was presumed to be vaccine strain based on recent immunization and lack o f travel history or exposure Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 20 to a case. Of the two laboratory -confirmed vaccine strain illnesses, there was one report of measles virus and the other varicella -zoster virus; the latter was reported to have developed a systemic papulovesicular rash . There w ere two reports each of thrombocytopenia (Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura or ITP) , injection site reactions (both cellulitis with hospitalization related to treatment with intravenous antibiotics ) and anaphylaxis (both of which did not have sufficient docu mented evidence to meet levels I, II or III of diagnostic certainty of the Brighton anaphylaxis case definition). Of the remaining serious AEFI reports , there was one each of Kawasaki Disease (KD) , pneumonia, arthralgia, paralysis, transient weakness in th e injected arm, apnea and bronchiolitis, and an allergic skin reaction. For more information about specific serious AEFI reports, please refer to the Appendix . Healthcare Utilization , Outcome and Risk Factors Table s 4A-4C summarizes the healthcare utilization, outcomes and risk factors associated with AEFI reports in 2018. Among those reports with the corresponding healthcare utilization fields completed in iPHIS, 7 4.6% (547/733) sought out -patient medi cal consultation, 16.7 % (123/462) had an emergency room visit and 3.0% (22/736) indicated a hospitali zation had occurred . In terms of AEFI outcomes, the majority of individuals had recovered at the time of reporting (67.9% of all AEFI reports ), followed b y those who were not yet recovered, but likely to recover ( 23.1 %). In a small proportion of reports (2. 8%), the outcome was reported as \"residual effects,\" which is defined as residual disability or sequelae related to the reported event. None of the cases reported to have residual effects met the definition of a serious AEFI . Due to the relatively short follow -up time for AEFIs reported in iPHIS, it is uncertain whether these residual effects represent long -term residual disability or events which will res olve , but had not yet resolved at the time of reporting. An affirmative response to at least one of the three medical risk factors that are collected for provincial AEFI surveillance (i.e. required in iPHIS) , was observed in 19.9 % of all AEFI reports. Of these, most (89.8 %) reported having a chronic illness/underlying medical condition , followed by being immuno compromi sed and being associated with an immunization program error. Among immunization program errors, six reports included administration errors ( e.g., incorrect land -marking or needle selection, and wrong route /dose administe red), five included a report of non-adherence to vaccine indication s or recommendations for use and one included both a report of an administration error and non-adherence to va ccine indications and recommendations .

Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 22 Notes on I nterpretation We describe in this report adverse events that were temporally assoc iated and not necessarily causally linked to vaccines. Our assessment was based on data from iPHIS only and not comprehensive chart review. We provided reporting rate estimates for comparison to other passive surveillance systems and for monitoring reporti ng trends over time; they should not be interpreted as incidence rates. It is important to note that in the context of a passive AEFI surveillance system, a higher overall reporting rate of AEFIs (across all vaccines) does not necessarily suggest a vaccine safety concern; rather, it is an indicator of a robust passive vaccine safety surveillance system. The quantity of reports contributes to establishing a clear historical baseline that can be used to identify future vaccine safety signals. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 23 Discussion Overall, we found a low rate of AEFI reporting in Ontario following vaccines administered in 201 8 and no unexpected vaccine safety issues. The provincial AEFI reporting rate increased slightly in 201 8 (5.1 per 100,000 population) compared to previously publis hed 201 7 data (4. 9 per 100,000 population) ; however, this increase was likely due to the high proportion of RZV AEFIs, without which the overall rate would have declined this year. Ontario's AEFI reporting rate has been consistently lower relative to othe r jurisdictions. Some differences in rates are expected across different geographic areas due to variability in reporting requirements, case definitions, immunization programs and population demographic characteristics . As a comparison, the Canadian nation al AEFI reporting rate was 7.2 per 100,000 population in 201 89 and the Australian annual reporting rate was 12.3 per 100,000 population in 201 5.10 The causes of Ontario's low reporting rate are likely multifactorial , including under -reporting by healthcare providers; 11-13 which is discussed in further detail in previous reports .14-18 The World Health Organization has introduced an indicator of the functioning of a country's AEFI surveillance system ,19 with a value of 10 reports per 100,000 surviving infant s suggesting basic capacity for reporting rather than the quality of the surveillance system . Our analysis yielded a corresponding estimate of 32.7 per 100,000 surviving infants in Ontario in 2018 . This was substantially lower than the AEFI reporting ratio s for the Region of the Americas and Global ly (all WHO regions) that were 486 and 549 AEFI reports per 100,000 surviving infants , respectively, in 2015 .4 We observed an increase in the reporting rate among adults 65 years and older in 2018 compared to 2017 (6.2 versus 5.1 per 100,000 population). This may be related to uptake of RZV vaccine in this population that was available for private purchase starting in October 2017 and is supported by our analysis of RZV AEFIs within this report , where the highest reporting rate per doses distributed was among those 65 years and older. An increase in reporting following the introduction of new vaccines or expansion of vaccines in new populations has previously been observed in our data18,21 and has also been reporte d elsewhere.20 Other age - and sex -specific trends were similar in 2018 , as compared to previous years (see online tool for data) ; the factors associated with the higher rates observed among infants , young children and femal es have been previously describe d.14-18, 21 Similar to previous years, wide variation in population -based AEFI reporting by PHUs for both infant and early childhood vaccine programs, school -based programs and influenza vaccine was observed in 2018. The high geographic variability in AEFI reporting rates may in part be related to variability in the interpretation and promotion of AEFI reporting among local health care providers within jurisdictions and different reporting processes for AEFIs across PHUs, all of which drives provincial AEFI reporting. Overall, the number of PHUs with zero reports in 2018 was similar or lower compared to 2017 across all categories . Our analysis is based on reporting r ates derived using both population data and vaccine dose distribution data as denominator s, both of which have specific limitations which have previously been described .21 In general, the absence of a population -based provincial immunization registry , which Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 24 would allow for an accurate assessment of the number of doses administered to individuals residing in each area , doses distributed data , where available , serves as a proxy and enables a more accurate comparison of AEFI reporting rates across geographic areas by taking into account the differences in vaccine distribution relative to population -based reporting rates. Vaccine -specific reporting rates in 2018 among routine, publicly -funded vaccines were highest for HPV9, Men -C-ACYW and Pneu -P-23 (using doses distributed in the denominator ), although serious reporting rates for all three vaccines were lower than the overall serious AEFI rate . HPV9 and Men -C-ACYW are two vaccines primarily delivered by PHUs within school -based programs , where higher AEFI reporting is typically observed compared to prog ram delivery by other providers .14-18, 21 In additio n, it has been observed that local adverse events are more common following HPV9 compared to HPV4 (HPV9 replaced HPV4 in September 2017) .22 Pneu -P-23 is also known to be a reactogenic vaccine (i.e., injection site reactions), particularly when booster dose s are administered at intervals of less than two years .23 Of note , RZV had the highest number and rate of AEFIs in 2018 , despite being available for private purchase only. The RZV AEFI reporting rate was nearly twice as high as the LZV AEFI reporting rate ; however ; there were no serious RZV AEFIs - in comparison , there was one serious LZV AEFI. As in previous years, mild events ( e.g., injection site reactions and rash) were the most frequently reported reactions . This is expected based on the safety profile of many vaccines and is consistently observed in AEFI surveillance systems in other jurisdictions .24, 25 Pneu -P-23 was the routine, publicly - funded vaccine most frequently associated with pain, redness and swelling at the injection site , while rash and fever were both most commonly associated with Men -C-C, followed closely by MMR , which is typically co -administered with Men -C-C at 12 months of age. Of note, among reports of immunization errors, three involved RZV and all were related to administration erro rs where the vaccine was given subcutaneous ly instead of intramuscular ly; injection site reactions were reported for two of the three cases. This suggests that immunizers may be confusing the administration procedure for RZV with LZV, a finding also noted in data from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) .26 Serious AEFIs were very rarely reported in 201 8. Despite a slight increas e in the overall AEFI reporting rate, the rate of serious AEFIs was slightly lower than last year. Similar to pr evious years , the types of serious AEFIs reported were most often related to rare events that are known to be reported following vaccination , including one report of KD and two reports of ITP. Thrombocytopenia is known to have a causal relationship with me asles -containing vaccine (and to a lesser degree, other vaccines) and although KD is consistently reported in passive AEFI surveillance, a causal link to immunization has not been established27 Among serious AEFIs , there were two reports of muscle weaknes s and paralysis (one paralysis and one arthritis/arthralgia ) and both were reported during the winter of 2018. This timeline overlaps with a widely reported increase in cases of acute flaccid paralysis/myelitis ( AFP or AFM) observed in Canada and the Unite d States .28,29 It is possible that reporting of these AEFI events was stimulated by heightened awareness of reporting of AFP -type events during that time. There was also one serious AEFI of transient arm weakness; however, this was reported in early 2018, prior to the increase in AFP/AFM cases in late 2018. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 25 For a description of the limitations of the AEFI surveillance system, please see the Technical Annex . Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2018 26 Conclusions This report summarizes AEFIs reported in Ontario following vaccines administered in 201 8, as well as reporting trends since 2012. Overall, a low rate of AEFI reporting continued to be observed in the province, though a wide ran ge in reported AEFI rates was found among PHUs. N o unexpected vaccine safety issues were identified - the most commonly reported events were mild (e.g., injection site reactions) . Serious events were very rare and t he majority of individuals had recovered at the time of reporting. Ongoing surveillance of AEFIs in Ontario is needed to monitor vaccine safety and to assess and interpret trends within the context of changes to provincial immunization programs, with the goal of improving reporting within the sur veillance system .
