Mia is a health and fitness role model who believes in helping Canadians to unapologetically feel their best. After hitting her own personal rock bottom back in 2015, being diagnosed with thyroid cancer, starting over again financially, and learning how to manage her self-worth from within instead of through athletics, she founded the not-for-profit MoveCamp Canada, an organization dedicated to keeping Canadians healthy through movement. Now Mia spends her days facilitating free fitness events in major cities across Canada. Inspired through collaboration, she believes that feeling good starts from within and that health is accessible to everyone. On her YouTube Channel, \"More than Movement\" and on social media, Mia shares ways to throw out conventional movement sayings like \"no pain, no gain\" and start moving in ways that feels good for you. She also encourages her community to step dieting and approach health from a place of joy and self-love, rather than a place of shame. On this episode we talk about burn out as a professional trainer and athlete, being diagnosed at 28 with thyroid cancer. We also discuss holistic health practices and steps she took to getting herself back on track with her health journey, daily products and things we use in our household that can be toxic, and so much more!
