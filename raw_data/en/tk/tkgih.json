Ethnological research is presented to illustrate crosscultural patterns of shamans and other ritualists, providing an etic framework for empirical assessments of resemblances of Chinese ritualists to shamans. This etic framework is further validated with assessments of the relationship of the features with bio genetic bases of ritual, altered states of consciousness, innate intelligences and endogenous healing processes. Key characteristics of the various types of wuand other Chinese ritualists are reviewed and compared with ethnological models of the patterns of ritualists found crossculturally to illus trate their similarities and contrasts. These comparisons illustrate the resemblances of prehistoric and commoner wuto shamans but additionally illustrate the resemblances of most types of wuto other ritualist types, not shamans. Across Chinese history, wuunderwent transformative changes into different types of ritualists, including priests, healers, mediums and sorcerers/witches. A review of contemporary reports on alleged shamans in China also illustrates that only some correspond to the characteristics of shamans found in crosscultural research and foraging societies. The similar ities of most types of wuritualists to other types of ritualists found crossculturally illustrate the greater accuracy of religion 1. Introduction: What Is the Wu? The term wu() has been widely applied to ritualists of China's past and present Murray 2018 ;Fu2022 ). The spectrum of wuritualists ranges from presumed archaic practices that persisted as Chinese society transformed from matriarchy to patriarchy, then to tribal chiefs and ancient kings, and eventually a wide range of histor ical and contemporary ritualists, including mediums and ancestor worship priests. What ever the original manifestations and meanings of wuwere, by the Warring States period (fifth to third centuries BCE), wuwas widely applied to very different forms of ritualists and virtually all subsequent forms of Chinese religious activity ( Michael 2015 ;Williams 2020 ). Following Eliade's (1951/1964) seminal book Shamanism , the term shaman began to be applied to the translation of wuinto English ( Michael 2015 ). Even earlier, Hopkins (1945 ) and Schafer (1951 ) translated wuinto English as shaman, but they also used the terms wizard and witch for wu. The increasing practice of Chinese scholars translating wu as shaman following Eliade's (1951/1964) seminal book was without critical assessments of whether it was appropriate (see von Falkenhausen 1995 ;Keightley 1998 ;Boileau 2002 ; Williams 2020 for critiques). Boileau addresses the consequences of such problematic uses of the term shaman that lack clear references to established features of shamans and used vague definitions that fail to differentiate shamans from virtually any religious ritualist. This widespread practice of translation of wuas shaman is surprising considering Eliade's explicit rejection ( Eliade 1964 , 450-54). Eliade discussed Religions 2023 ,14, 852. https://doi.org/10.3390/rel14070852 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/religionsReligions 2023 ,14, 852 2 of 32 vestiges of China's archaic shamanism in male practitioners ( wu xiand physicians wu yi ) but rejected the association of shaman with wu, whom he characterized as mediums, noting their possession states as an aberrant form and reflective of shamanic decadence. Michael (2015 ) notes this disavowal by Eliade of any equivalence of shamanism and wu: \" Although Eliade discussed many examples of ecstatic flight, vestiges of China's archaic shamanism, he did not associate them with the wu . . .Bywu, he specifically referred p. 450). Shamanism was a heroic venture, and possession was a decisive manifestation of its decadence\" ( Michael 2015 , pp. 677-78). To Eliade, the loss of shamanism was evident in the features of possession characteristic of the wu. Nonetheless, scholars have ignored Eliade's perspective and tended to use shaman in a very loose way to refer to virtually all Chinese ritualists, a practice that undermines the usefulness of the term and points to the need for a different translation of wu.Williams (2020 , p. 154) points out that by the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), virtually all forms of su pernatural practitioners across China were called wu: \"wu . . .comprises almost everybody who has to do with supernatural phenomena.\" Mair (1990 ) also noted that the practice of translating wuas shaman has problems stemming from a lack of correspondence with the characteristics of the Siberian shamans, beginning with the centrality of the ecstatic flight and the shaman's ritual with the whole community where the healing rituals emphasized soul recovery. \"This is in contrast to the wuwho were closely associated with the courts of various rulers and who were primarily responsible for divination, astrology, prayer, and healing with medicines\" ( Mair 1990 , p. 35). Allan notes that many of the diverse ritual ists called wu\u2014also translated as diviners, conjurers and healers\u2014do not even engage in alterations of consciousness, a defining feature of shamanism. Translations of wuas spirit medium ( von pp. 35) and diviner (Boileau 2002 ) illustrate reasonable alternatives to the blanket use of shaman for all types ofwu. These descriptions illustrate that from the beginning of Chinese religion, there were several distinctive types of wuritualists. This wide range of wuritualists suggests that the term has a general meaning as [religious] ritualist rather than as shaman in particular and emphasizes the need to differentiate among types of wurather than translating all of them as shaman. The critical question involves the correspondence of any of the various types ofwuwith empirically established crosscultural features of shamans. Numerous scholars ofwuhave lamented the lack of objective criteria for determining what is a shaman and its features. This paper presents such objective criteria from ethnological research to illustrate the crosscultural features of shamans and their differences from other types of religious rit ualists. This research provides an objective etic framework for empirical assessments of resemblances of the various types of Chinese wuwith other religious ritualists, including a crosscultural foraging shaman. The usefulness of this approach is illustrated below by showing the correspondence of some types of historical wuand Chinese shamans with the etic features of shamans, as well as the correspondence of most wutypes with other types of religious ritualists found crossculturally. These comparisons are used to show that most ritualists called wuor Chinese shamans do not correspond to crosscultural features of shamans, but rather correspond to other types of religious practitioners. 2. CrossCultural Methods: A Derived Etic Model of Religious Practitioners Rather than using theoretical or ideological principles to arbitrarily define the types of religious practitioners, Winkelman 's (1986 ,1990 ,1992 ,2010a ,2022 ) crosscultural research project used a grounded method of deriving variables from descriptive ethnographic data and performing quantitative analysis of this information to identify crossculturally valid religious practitioner or ritualist types. This study is based on a subsample of the Stan dard CrossCultural Sample (SCCS) ( White examined 47 soci eties worldwide (see Winkelman 1992 for details). This subsample provided 115 culturallyReligions 2023 ,14, 852 3 of 32 recognized types of religious practitioners, professional occupations thought to have a spe cial capacity for interacting with supernatural beings or power. These practitioners were characterized by variables based on ethnographic descriptions of their practices (for data see footnote1). This descriptive data represented as variables (nominal, ordinal) was used to generate a matrix of similarities which was entered into cluster analysis to determine the different types of religious ritualists based on their empirically shared features (see Winkelman 1986 ,1990 ,1992 for details). These statistical groupings were used to derive an etic model of types of ritualists that are represented in the SCCS/CosSci2variables as Shaman3(879), Shaman/Healer4(880), Healer (881), Medium (882), Sorcerer/Witch (883) and Priest (884). These variables are re ferred to with initial capital letters in the text to distinguish these etic ritualist types from common concepts represented in the same words. The common and distinctive features of these etic religious practitioner types were determined by frequency analyses of the vari ables5used in determining the types of ritualists; these features are reported in Winkelman (1986 ,1990 ,1992 ,2010a ,2021a ,2022 ) and presented in Table 1and others below.

Social Predictors of Ritualist Types Winkelman 's (2022 ) analyses6of subsistence and social variables associated with each ritualist type illustrate the source of some of the significant differences among them and a model of sociocultural religious evolution. This involves transformation of primordial for aging ritualists (Shamans) found worldwide in the premodern foraging and horticultural societies through effects of intensive agriculture, warfare and political integration. These specific social effects on religious evolution are illustrated in the following distinctive eco logical, productive and social relations associated with each type of ritualist: Shamans (Foraging Shamans), the only ritualists in societies with a principal reliance on foraging and without intensive agriculture, supracommunity political integration or warfare; Shaman/Healers (Agricultural Shamans) found in societies with intensive agriculture but lacking supracommunity political integration, and generally with the presence of another ritualist, the Priests; Priests are found in intensive agricultural societies with supracommunity political integration and are always found in societies with the following types of ritualists: Healers, who are generally found in agricultural societies, but significantly predicted by supracommunity political integration and the practice of warfare for resources; Mediums, characteristic of complex societies and significantly predicted by supra community political integration and the presence of warfare for captives; and Sorcerer/Witches in societies with intensive agriculture and supracommunity politi cal integration, but lack community integration (see Winkelman 2022 for analyses).Religions 2023 ,14, 852 6 of 32 Since these ecological and social variables were not used to determine the practitioner types, the relationships provide an independent confirmation of the validity of the ritual ist types presented (see Winkelman 1986 ,1992 for confirmatory analyses). These ritualist types are found in specific configurations related to subsistence and political conditions, and as illustrated in Figure 1, present a model of sociocultural religious evolution (also see Winkelman 2022 ). Religions 2023 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 32 specic social e ects on religious evolution are illustrated in the following distinctive eco- logical, productive and social relations a ssociated with each type of ritualist: Shamans (Foraging Shamans), the only ritualists in societies with a principal reliance on foraging and without intensive agriculture, supra-community political integration or warfare; Shaman/Healers (Agricultural Shamans) foun d in societies with intensive agriculture but lacking supra-community political integr ation, and generally with the presence of another ritualist, the Priests; Priests are found in intensive agricultural societies with supra-community political integration and are always found in societies with the following types of ritualists: Healers, who are generally found in agricultural societies, but signi cantly predicted by supra-community political integration and the practice of warfare for resources; Mediums, characteristic of complex societies and signi cantly predicted by supra- community political integration and the presence of warfare for captives; and Sorcerer/Witches in societies with intensive agriculture and supra-community polit- ical integration, but lack community integration (see Winkelman 2022 for analyses). Since these ecological and social variables we re not used to determine the practitioner types, the relationships provide an independent con rmation of the validity of the ritualist types presented (see Winkelman 1986, 1992 for con rmatory analyses). These ritualist types are found in speci c con gurations related to subsistence and political conditions, and as illustrated in Figure 1, present a model of sociocultural religious evolution (also see Winkelman 2022). Figure 1. Ritualist Types, Con gurations and Cross-Cultural Fora ging Shamans (SCCS Variable 879) The ritualists in the group (cluster) labeled as (Foraging) Shamans shared the follow- ing characteristics, constituting an empirically derived and cross-culturally valid set of features of Shamans: Pre-eminent group leader who performs a dramatic night-time communal ritual in- volving enactments, drumming, dancing and singing; Principal ritual functions of spirit communication for healing, divination, hunting and sorcery; Selection for the role through spirit encounters interpreted as an illness and experi- enced in visions and dreams; Training with vision quests in the wilderne ss with fasting, austerities and often psy- choactive plants; An initiatory experience of death by animals which killed and dismembered the ini- tiate, followed by a rebirth and a reconstruction by animals incorporated as a princi- pal power; Figure 1. Ritualist Types, Configurations and Sociocultural Evolution. 2.2. CrossCultural Features of Foraging Shamans (SCCS Variable 879) The ritualists in the group (cluster) labeled as (Foraging) Shamans shared the follow ing characteristics, constituting an empirically derived and crossculturally valid set of fea tures of Shamans: Preeminent group leader who performs a dramatic nighttime communal ritual in volving enactments, drumming, dancing and singing; Principal ritual functions of spirit communication for healing, divination, hunting and sorcery; Selection for the role through spirit encounters interpreted as an illness and experi enced in visions and dreams; Training with vision quests in the wilderness with fasting, austerities and often psy choactive plants; An initiatory experience of death by animals which killed and dismembered the initi ate, followed by a rebirth and a reconstruction by animals incorporated as a principal power; Ritual preparations of fasting and sexual abstinence; Altered states of consciousness (ASC) conceptualized as magical or soul flight (out ofbody experience) and an experience of personal transformation into an animal, but notably the absence of possession in the ASCs; Healing practices focused on recovery of patient's lost soul, combating evil spirits and the extraction of magical darts causing illness; Causing illness and death through darts, sorcery and soul theft; and Directing hunters and calling animals. 2.3. Biogenetic Bases of Shamanism Support for using this empirically derived crosscultural pattern to determine what is a shaman is further supported by the correspondences of these features with biologically based functions that produce these common features. These correspondences have bio logical bases in the phylogenetic origins and evolution of hominin ritual as a community integration process; mimetic and other ritual effects producing the physiological dynam ics of ASC and healing; and central features of spirits and animal powers as personal and social identity, features directly related to innate operators (modules) of the evolved psy chology These biologicalReligions 2023 ,14, 852 7 of 32 bases producing worldwide uniformities in foraging ritualists (Shamans) derive from the following biogenetic structures: A collective nighttime/overnight conspicuous display with community drumming, danc ing and singing which have deep evolutionary antecedents illustrated in the homolo gous socialityenhancing maximal displays of chimpanzees ( Winkelman 2009 ,2021b ); Selection for the shamanic role based on spontaneous visions, dreams and sickness involving natural tendencies for ASC that enhance access to and integration of uncon scious processes ( Winkelman 2010a ,2011 ,2021c ); Training in the alteration of consciousness (i.e., ASC) induced by practices of isolation in the wilderness, fasting, abstinence and austerities that stimulate the neuromodula tory neurotransmitter systems ( Winkelman 2017 ); ASC induced by engaging the mimetic operator (dancing, singing, drumming) which produce an activation of the endogenous opioid system ( Winkelman 2017 ,2021a ); Ritual activities leading to exhaustion and collapse, producing experiences of commu nication with spirits and outofbody experiences reflecting innate modules Winkel man 2015 ,2021c ); Initiatory experiences of death/dismemberment from attacks by animals and a rebirth that produces experiences of personal transformation and of incorporating animal powers into identity and basic structures of selfconsciousness ( Winkelman 2010a ); Spiritual experiences produced by stimulation, integration and dissociation of innate modular cognitive structures operators ( Winkelman 2021d ); and Healing by recovery of lost soul, extraction of objects and removal of sorcery by ritual elicitation of endogenous healing mechanisms ( Winkelman 2010a ) The congruences of these shamanic features with features and functions of humans' evolved psychology illustrate they are not arbitrary cultural features but have biogenetic bases; consequently, they show these variables are the most objective criteria for determin ing an etic transcultural characterization of shamans in comparative perspective. These provide five major biogenetic aspects for the bases of shamans: Mimetic community ritual: mimetic enactments in dramatic performances, collective drumming, dancing and singing; Traumatic selection: a psychological dynamic manifested in spontaneous visions, spe cial dreams and psychosislike sickness; ASC: outofbody (soul flight) experiences and initiatory experiences of death and dismemberment by animals followed by rebirth; Animal powers: Central roles of animals in formation of personal powers and experi ences of personal transformation into animals; Healing: involving recovery of soul loss or theft, extraction of sorcery objects and removal of effects of attacking spirits These biogenetic bases indicate the presence of a shaman is a justified assumption for ancient foraging and simple agricultural societies worldwide. But agricultural inten sification produces global changes in the dynamics of societies and religion, with a new form of ritualists in the role of the Priest who predominates with the emergence of supra community political integration. Nonetheless, the core features of Foraging Shamans are initially maintained in Agricultural Shamans such as healing rituals with drumming and singing; selection by spirits in visions, dreams and illness; training and practices with ASC and experiences of soul flight, animal transformation and death and rebirth; powers de rived from animals; and healing practices related to soul loss and spirit aggression. But intensive agriculture subsistence produces new patterns of ritual behavior mani fested in Priests who now lead communitywide rituals, relegating the Agricultural Shamans to private rituals with clients and their families. Agricultural Shamans also typically have professional organizations that provide training and recognition, features reflecting the social complexity and population concentrations enabled by large sedentary communi ties. Greater complexity of society also supported a role specialization among AgriculReligions 2023 ,14, 852 8 of 32 tural Shamans (i.e., just diagnosis, treating specific kinds of illness or agricultural rites) that would reduce intragroup competition among the practitioners. Eventually, other ritualists\u2014Healers, Mediums and Sorcerers/Witches\u2014also emerge in societies with intensive agriculture and hierarchical political integration and are associ ated with war for resources and war for slaves and captives. These represent dynamics that may have led to the transformation and eventual demise of an ancient Chinese Foraging Shaman and the emergence of new types of ritualists illustrated in the distinctive features of various historical wu. 3. Comparative Analyses: Different Types of Wuin CrossCultural Perspective From the earliest recorded periods, literary sources identify distinctly different types ofwurather than a homogenous profile for all practitioners called wu.Tong (2002 ) reviews the evidence for both prehistoric (Neolithic) and historic wuand references anthropolog ical theories of religious evolution describing three subsequent types of ancient Chinese wuritualists: magicians (including shamans); priests; and sorcerers and witches. Literary sources from the Shang period reveal a further early differentiation between female reli gious practitioners called wuand male ones called xi(wu wu yi ) (see Cai2014 ; Lin2009 ). This followed a division of labor between men's involvement in government, exemplified in the King's ( w\u00e1ng) role; and women's role in religion as diviners on the King's behalf, a function that was partially usurped by the male ritualists who controlled them. Lin further distinguished wu yi from other ancient wucalled \"commoner shamans\" ( Min wu (Lin2016 )), a distinction paralleled in Michael 's (2015 ) contrast of two differ ent forms of early wu, noting \"two separate traditions of early Chinese shamanism that I later call bureaucratic shamanism and independent shamanism . . .[the latter a] folk shamanism only tangentially relates the wuto official positions of rulership and bureaucratic institution\" [pp. 652-53]). While independent shamanism resisted or even re jected central authority and operated independently of the priests and rulers, the bureau cratic shaman was subordinated to centralized authority and \"all other functionaries of the bureaucratic structures of state religion, including priests, temple officers, sacrificers, diviners, and scribes\" (p. 671). But eventually, wubecame depreciated and even criminal ized, as their practices came to be characterized as sorcery and practitioners were subjected to execution, exemplified in the w g ( ) described by Lin(2009 ) and Cai(2014 ). These overlapping distinctions illustrate a broad consensus that from the beginning of Chinese religion, there were several distinctive types of wuritualists. My analysis fo cuses on these distinctive types of wuritualists across the eras of ancient China, oriented by information from Lin(2009 );Tong (2002 );Cai(2014 ) and Sukhu (2012 ) who provide similar distinctions about these types of early wu: (1) Prehistoric Neolithic wurevealed in archaeological ( Tong 2002 ) and linguistic (Hopkins 1945 ) evidence; (2) Ancient wu(focused on the men wy xi , rather than women wu) from the Shang and Zhou periods; (3) Commoner wu(Lin2009 ), called community wubyTong (2002 ), is a professional class recorded in the late Zhou period, particularly in the south, and strongly contrasting with the bureaucratic practices of the state wu; and (4) State religious officials, the official wu(siwu ( ),nanwu ( ),n\u00fcwu ( ) and (1046-256 BC) described by Lin(2009 );Michael (2015 ) and Tong (2002 ), who labels them as priests. There are also other forms of wudescribed for the Han and Qin periods: (5) Female wu( Wu Wang [Du and Kong (2000 )] and Wu Yu [Takigawa (2015 )]) of the Warring States period (from Cai(2014 ) and Sukhu (2012 )); and (6) W ) (Lin2009 ;Cai2014 ) of the Han period.Religions 2023 ,14, 852 9 of 32 Two contemporary examples of ritualists alleged to be Chinese shamans are also re viewed to illustrate the continued use of the shaman concepts for Chinese ritualists and their variable correspondences with the etic model: (7) the Chinese ReindeerEvenki, whose indigenous ritualists, the aman , are described byHeyne (1999 ); and (8) theboof the Tu ethnic group of Qinghai Province in Northwest China, who is called a shaman by Xing and Murray (2018 ). The characters representing prehistorical wu(Figure 2), healing wu(Tables 2and 3) and official wu(Table 4) illustrate a range of representations. The features of these different types of wuare presented in Tables 3and 5and in the following material, where they are compared with the etic ritualist types identified by Winkelman (1986 ,1990 ,1992 ,2010a ; also see Table 1). In the Tables *##, the initial letter of the etic ritualist types (i.e., S, AS, H, M, P, S/W) is assigned to those characteristics of Chinese ritualists who exhibit characteristics unique to an etic type (i.e., S for Shamans' animal powers, soul journey; M for Mediums' possession; and H, P for Healers' and Priests' formal political and judicial powers). 3.1. PreHistorical Wu There is linguistic, archaeological and mythic evidence of the presence of an ancient Chinese wu(Tong 2002 ) that has central characteristics of Shamans. These ancient wu practices, referenced in representations of wucharacters in Shang and Early Chu dynasty records, are interpreted by Hopkins (1945 ) as depicting \"the unmistakable shape of the dancing Shaman\" (p. 3; see Figure 2). Hopkins (p. 4) asserts the religious centrality of these actions of a shaman dancer represented in the ku w \u00e9ncharacter ( Religions 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 32 These overlapping distinctions illustrate a broad consensus that from the beginning of Chinese religion, there were several distinctive types of wu ritualists.

Pre-historic Neolithic wu revealed in archaeological (Tong 2002) and linguistic (Hop- kins 1945) evidence; (2). Ancient wu (focused on the men wy xi, rather than women wu) from the Shang and Zhou periods; (3).

Female wu ( Wu Wang [Du and Kong (2000)] and Wu Yu [Takigawa (2015)]) of the Warring States period (from Cai (2014) and Sukhu (2012)); and (6). W gu ( ) (Lin 200 9; Cai 2014) of the Han period.

The characters representing prehist orical wu (Figure 2), healing wu (Tables 2 and 3) and ocial wu (Table 4) illustrate a range of repr esentations. The features of these di erent types of wu are presented in Tables 3 and 5 and in the following material, where they are compared with the etic ritualist types identi ed by Winkelman (1986, 1990, 1 992, 2010a; also see Table 1).

Furthermore, they resemble represen tations depicted in \"early Bronzes and the inscribed Bones of the Honan Find\". Hopkins suggests these Lesser Seal sources present a recognizable portrait of a dancing or postur ing figure, a direct mimetic representation using straight and curving lines to symbolically represent an unmistakable dancing figure (see Figure 2). These dancing activities have a direct affinity to the core biogenetic mimetic bases of the practices of shamans. Religions 2023 , 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 32 Figure 2.

Tong (2002 , p. 52) notably emphasizes a feature core to shamanism: \"In all these ceremonies, the drum was the most significant instrument.\" These analyses of linguistic and archaeological data provide evidence of ancient Chi nese traditions representative of a Foraging Shaman, practices which existed before the differentiation of the functions of the tribal wu, before written records and the develop ment of \"shamanking\" and a state wu. The principal biogenetic aspects of Shamans out lined above are present in the limited evidence about their central societal role in collective rituals; the mimetic complex of dancing, drumming and singing; and the significance of animals, including animal transformation. The available data does not provide a full pro file of the etic Shaman but provides confirmatory evidence of the presence of features of the Shamans found in the ethnological research, confirming that wushamans existed in Chinese prehistoric antiquity.Religions 2023 ,14, 852 11 of 32 Table 2.

Ancient Wu Xi A variety of forms of healing wuare reported (see Tables 2and 3for characteristics). Literary sources from the Shang period reveal an early distinction of male religious practi tioners called wu xi (Cai2014 ;Lin2009 ). Lin characterizes the male wu xi of the preQin and Han periods as \"ancient shamans.\" These ancient wu xi (paraphrased from Lin(2009 )) had central functions of healing and divining, as well as performing sacrifices to the gods and spirits and rites of ancestor worship, assisting the sovereign in mourning rites. Xiwere peo ple of high status and superior intelligence who held knowledge, respect and high regard. They were hereditary aristocrats who exhibited correct demeanor, loyalty and trustwor thiness and brought glory to the Kings. Their societal power was illustrated in overseeing the religious affairs of the ruling class and the entire society (state) and they enjoyed rela tively great influence. Their rituals involved special sacrificial vessels, vestments and the use of statues, animal figures and representations of gods and ghosts, using sacrifices, in cantations and prayers to gods to obtain blessings. The ancient xilikely engaged in ASC as suggested by their use of visions to illuminate matters and their knowledge of how to \"ascend and descend,\" suggesting the shamans' flights to lower and upper worlds. Their rituals involved preparation with special baths and fasting and ceremonies involving beat ing the drum, striking the bell and hollering to excite the heart, with vigorous steps and dance to stir up the energies. The healing functions of the Wu xi were considered their most important role, involving the use of drugs and plants to drive away pestilence, incantations for the removal of illness and exorcisms and blessings to avert misfortune.

Comparisons of Ancient Wu Xi and Shamans (SCCS Variable 879) Table 3provides the characteristics of the Wu xi and other healing wu. The xidid have healing as a principal function, including the removal of illness characteristic of Shamans, but their healing practices of exorcisms and blessings reflect Healers. The ancient wuac quired their power through formally learned prayers and rituals rather than selection by the spirits and spontaneous and deliberate ASC characteristic of Shamans. The activities of ancient wu xi were based in ritual sacrifices and manipulation of ritual objects dedicated to the ancestors and gods of rain rather than the animal powers of Shamans. Xinotably lack central qualities of Shamans such as malevolent acts and hunting rituals; selection through illness and training alone in the wilderness; the focus on patient's needs rather than state functions; extensive ASC experiences involving soul flight/journey, deathand rebirth and animal transformation; and healing of sorcery and soul loss through a soul journey. The xidid maintain some of the Shaman's core ASC activities in their engagement with practices of fasting, rituals involving beating the drum, striking bells and hollering, as well as activities that excite the heart and exercise the body, such as dancing. But de spite statements about flight into the heavens and the mingling of divine and human en tities suggested in some texts about wu, these accounts do not have contexts where they attest to experiences of ecstatic flights or outofbody experiences characteristic of shamans (Keightley 1998 ). Keightley proposes instead that the spirits did not descend into or enter thewu(xi), but that instead they were descending to receive the sacrifices that were offered. In an analysis of ancient texts on the xi,Liu(2022 , P 10 of 14) notes that \"If we emphasize that ecstasy is a judgment criterion for a shaman, Wuand Xicannot be categorised as shamans because this chapter did not mention ecstasy at all.\" AsBoileau (2002 ) noted, while ancient (archaic) wuand Siberian hunting shamans shared concerns with the wellbeing of the community, the xi's involvement in the religious functions of sacrifices for the state and ancestors sharply contrast with Shamans' primaryReligions 2023 ,14, 852 14 of 32 role in communal healing. Similarly, the xi's use of sacrifices, praying to gods for bless ings and uses of statues and representations resemble Healers and Priests, not Shamans (See Table 3). While xishared Shamans' healing features with the use of plant drugs for the treatment of illness, they differed in an emphasis on exorcism and praying to gods for bless ings to avert misfortune. While some Shaman healing features related to soul loss that are typical of Siberia and the etic model are attributed to xi, closer examinations reveal that it is only a superficial resemblance. Williams (2020 , p. 191) reviews a poem called \"Summons to the Soul\" from the Elegies of Chu reflecting activities involving shamanic concepts of soul recovery. The poem describes the ritual activity of summoning a soul back to save the patient's life, with chants designed to impede the soul's travel to heaven, the underworld or four directions. Williams notes, however, that this concept of a soul that can leave the body and the practices of soul loss recovery expressed do not involve the personal soul jour ney recovery involving ecstatic flight to the spirit world which is characteristic of Siberian practices and Shamans' soul recovery. Michael Puett (2002 , cited in Michael 2015 ) illus trates central features of shamanism were absent even in early China, which was lacking the beliefs in three spiritual realms and the connecting axis mundi which were central to Eliade's characterizations of the central features of Siberian shamanism. Notably lacking in the ancient wuare Shamans' trauma and illnessrelated selection procedures and train ing involving ASCs (i.e., soul flight, death and rebirth and animal transformation). Xialso lack special relations with power animals, healing of soul loss and sorcery. 3.2.2. Comparisons of the Ancient Xi Wu with the Healer (SCCS Variable 881) Healers provide healing and divination as principal functions, offering individual healing services rather than collective healing ceremonies. The Healers also participate in activities involving collaboration with Priests in collective agricultural rites and rituals of propitiation of gods. Healers also have an important function in officiating lifecycle rit uals (i.e., naming, marriage and funerals). Healers acquire their roles through payments for training by other Healers, and when completed, a professional group certifies their status with a ceremony recognizing their professional status. Their activities as fulltime specialists earn them a lucrative income. Healers are normally only males of high social and economic status and participate in political, legislative and judicial processes. Healers' supernatural power comes from ritual knowledge, particularly the creation of charms and knowledge of spells and ritual techniques such as incantations and sacri fices used to propitiate the spirits. Their rituals do not seem intended to produce ASCs in patients. Nonetheless, clients may experience minor ASCs because of placebo and other consciousnessaltering effects of the elaborate rituals, recited spells and incantations. In the divination of information, the Healers do not rely on ASC experiences but instead ma nipulate material systems (i.e., like I Ching or Tarot cards) that they randomize to produce patterns that they interpret for diagnoses. Exorcism, removing spirits that afflict or pos sess the patient, is the central healing ideology of Healers and Mediums. Healing rituals involved the repeated recitation of spells that appear to have hypnotic effects and powerful encouragements apparently intended to have suggestive and placebo effects. Although the Healers did not emphasize obvious ritual ASC, these are nonetheless suggested by their training and preritual periods of social isolation and fasting and limited singing, chanting and percussion. Xifeatures also characteristics of Shamans involving ASC induction (beating the drum and vocalizations) and healing through plant medicines and expelling bad influences\u2014 these are not unique to Shamans but are shared by Healers as well. Ximore closely resem ble the Healers of Winkelman's etic model, sharing characteristics such as the following: religious functions such as propitiation of deities (King's ancestors); social qualities such as high socioeconomic status and governmental powers; being only males who engage in functions with priests for collective rituals; providing sacrifices to appease superior gods; seeking blessings/propitiation; and healing through exorcism and the prevention of misfor tune. The Ancient xiuse of oracle bones, a material system for divinatory purposes, reflectsReligions 2023 ,14, 852 15 of 32 typical divinatory practices of Healers (use of mechanical systems rather than intuition), not Shamans. 3.3. Commoner Wu Commoner wu(Min wu Lin2016 ) were members of a professional class of the late Zhou period. Tong (2002 , pp. 62-65) summarizes the characteristics and functions of what he referred to as \"community\" practices corresponding to the commoner wu.The primary functions of these Commoner wuwere providing healing services and prayers, blessings and invocations to protect from disasters. Commoner wuwere also skilled in divination to determine causes of illness and other misfortune but notably lacked the formal ancestral worship system characteristic of state rituals. Instead, these \"community\" practices pro vided ceremonies for individuals and families with rituals involving the worship of ghosts, animals and natural phenomena and provided spiritual support, particularly to determine the client's fortune or misfortune. Commoner wualso performed rituals to harm people and gain advantage; consequently, the commoner wuwere also seen as potentially danger ous figures that needed to be controlled, or even banned. The Commoner wufrequently practiced an inherited family trade but were selected on the basis of innate abilities or as a consequence of disease, or were even bodily handi capped. They could be male or female and acted on a parttime basis in providing services at low expense to clients. Their functions were based on their abilities to communicate with the gods and other spirits whom they queried with divinatory rituals and addressed with sacrifices to obtain their favor. They used charms and spells, as well as prayers, exorcisms and sacrifices. While their role included services as tribal functionaries, they were without politi cal powers, formal organization or political privileges; nonetheless, they had prestige and influenced communal decisions regarding agricultural activities, as well as warfare and hunting. Their performances were conducted without written scriptures but with singing, drumming and dancing performed by the practitioners themselves. A significant service was exorcism rituals performed with incantations and sacrifices. Beyond singing, drum ming and dancing, there is evidence of their ASC in purgative drugs used and reported ecstatic states of \"imaginary travel around heaven and earth in chariots drawn by dragons and phoenixes\" ( Tong 2002 , p. 64). Tong concludes that, in contrast to the state wureligious officials of the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, the southern areas persisted with the ancient traditions and that these \"practitioners of southern folk religion still can be called wu\" (p. 65). Tong also proposed other translations for these earlier ritualists as magicians, sorcerers and even physicians. Comparing the Commoner Wu and Shamans (SCCS Variable 879) A comparison of the characteristics of Commoner wuwith Foraging and Agricultural Shamans (referred to here as Shamans) shows both similarities as well as some divergences. Sufficient detailed historical information is lacking for all relevant features of the Com moner wu,but they reflect Shamans in their principal functions such as healing services, divination and engaging in practices of sorcery. Commoner wualso exhibit Shamans' fea tures in selection on the basis of innate abilities or as consequences of disease, as well as family tradition. The tribal and familial focus of Commoner wuis consistent with the Forag ing Shamans' communal activities, as is their role as familial or tribal functionaries without political power, formal organization or special privileges but instead having prestige and influence in communal decisions. But communitywide rituals are not reported for Commoner wu; instead, clientbased practices characteristic of Agricultural Shamans are reported, as illustrated in their em phasis on economic gain from their clients. Commoner wualso perform agricultural ritu als characteristic of Agricultural Shamans, as well as the worship of ghosts, animals and natural phenomena, rituals more typical of Priests, Healers and Mediums. Both Forag ing Shamans and Agricultural Shamans' features are also present in the commoner wu'sReligions 2023 ,14, 852 16 of 32 parttime profession and reported involvement with activities of warfare and hunting and malevolent rituals. But it is Agricultural Shamans that attempt to harm through their use of curses, witchcraft (black magic) and charms, as do Commoner wu. Commoner wuper formances conducted without written scriptures or temples but with drumming and mu sic performed by practitioners themselves are consistent with, but not exclusive to, For aging and Agricultural Shamans. The Commoner wu's engagement with mimetic activi ties (singing, drumming and dancing performed by practitioners) are features which are widely shared by other etic types (Healers, Mediums). But there is a suggestion of uniquely Shamans' ASC in ecstatic states of imaginary travel around heaven and earth and even an imal relations in the ecstatic travel via dragons and phoenixes and the worship of animals. Like Foraging and Agricultural Shamans, commoner wuprovided healing services; but while the healing functions of Commoner wuinvolves Shamanic concepts in expelling baleful influences and presumably countering sorcerers and witches, the Commoner wu also focus on exorcism, prayers, blessings and invocations to protect from disasters and sacrifices; these are not like Shamans' healing features, but instead reflect activities typical of Healers and Mediums. Notably lacking in Commoner wuare the Shamans' practices of the healing of soul loss. Furthermore, commoner wu's healing functions differ from Foraging and Agricultural Shamans' healing in the focus on spiritual support of the client's fortune or misfortune and their emphasis on economic gain from their clients. While some aspects of Shamans' ASC are present, the typical experiences are not di rectly reported for Commoner wu, and notably absent are the deathandrebirth experi ences and the central role of animals as powers, identities and a form of personal transfor mation, characteristic of Foraging and Agricultural Shamans. Features more characteristic of Agricultural Shamans and Healers are seen in the Commoner wu'sinvolvement with agricultural rituals and charging for services to clients. Features of the Commoner wu such as agricultural rituals resulted from the effects of intensive agriculture, features also found in Agricultural Shamans and Healers who also assist the Priests in agricultural ritu als. Similarly, the Commoner wu's lower status likely reflects the higher status wupriests, a feature also exhibited by Agricultural Shamans. Techniques reported for Commoner wu\u2014incantations, blessings, praying, curses and charms\u2014appear to reflect the increasing commodification of healing practices manifested in the Commoner wu's focus on earning from clients. These more resemble features of Agricultural Shamans and Healers\u2014ritual techniques involving spells and charms with exuvial and imitative rituals. The Commoner wufar more closely resemble Foraging Shamans than did the Ancient wu. These similarities include the evidence of trauma and illness in selection; the presence of ecstatic ASC reflective of soul flight; the relationships to animals; and healing involving extraction of illness and addressing sorcerers. But notably, the Commoner wulack a com munal audience and instead perform agricultural rites, use ritual techniques of charms and spells, have lower social status and perform clientfocused rituals, as do the Agricultural Shamans with which they most directly correspond. Lin(2009 ) characterizes the appearance of commoner or domestic professional shamans in the literature as representing a major change. Lin attributes the appearance in the litera ture of information about Commoner wuas a result of the effects of the collapse of the Zhou feudal system (7th-6th centuries BC). But commoner wupractices are unlikely to have been a consequence of the decline of the feudal system, although it may have elevated their rel ative societal importance in the ensuing vacuum. If the Commoner wudid not exist in the broader society during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, from where did it originate? It was not a devolution of the bureaucratic wuor ancient wu yi , who had already long departed from the Foraging Shaman pattern. Rather, this appearance of the Commoner wuin the literature must reflect the emergence of recordkeeping related to these ongoing activities that undoubtedly had continuities with the prehistoric wu.Religions 2023 ,14, 852 17 of 32 3.4. Bureaucratic Wu Priests While archaeological evidence and texts lack sufficient detail to infer all of the social functions and characteristics of the wubefore the emergence of writing and the state system, evidence indicates an ancient differentiation of functions of the tribal wuin the develop ment of \"shamanking\" and a state wu(Tong 2002 ). Tong points out ancient changes in the functions of the wuin the emergence of a new polity formed through their symbiosis with the tribal elite, leading to a \"religious elite of wu[who] reconstituted themselves and became priests\" (p. 53). Tong (2002 ) reviews ancient texts on the consequences of these religious and political transformations during the emergence of chiefdoms (\"Period of the Five Legendary Emperors\", third millennium BCE) when functions of the new elite ritual ist's centralized religious activity by organizing the worship of the ancestors of the ruling clan as gods of the whole polity. These bureaucratic functionaries of the government dur ing the Xia, Shang and Zhou periods nonetheless had wuin their titles, along with other formal designations that revealed their distinctive roles as officials of the state (see Table 4 for characters).

Michael (p. 685) characterizes the primary functions of these ritualists as involv ing the performance of rituals for the ancestors. And rather than seances or facetoface communication with these spirits, the ritual performances involved sacrifices and other offerings, devotional prayers and songs and liturgical performances. Their religious func tions are assisted by temple officers who manage ritual objects such as vessels and jade and administer the sacrificial offerings of animals and fruits of the harvest. Michael notes that with the institutionalization of these roles in activities of the ancient Chinese state re ligion within the spirit temples and ancestral halls that \"the wuare no longer recognized: shamanic authority has given way to centralized authority\" ( Michael 2015 , p. 685). Tong characterizes the activities of these wustate religious officials as involving pri mary responsibilities for state affairs and the needs of the royal family. These fulltime re ligious practitioners were formally appointed as government officials to exercise political powers and direct economic activities. Their positions depended on skills and knowledge from study and longterm training, not supernatural gifts. They held high prestige from their positions and were affiliated with important political groups. The state wuengaged in political and economic activity for the state, with each ritualist type holding specific and de limited responsibilities. Some controlled groups of mediums (also called wu) accompanied religious officials in dancing during the rainmaking rituals and addressed great calamities in rituals of crying, praying and singing. Their rituals followed clearly established prac tices dictated in written texts and performed in special temples on scheduled days. Their rituals emphasized sacrifices, with some divination (dream interpretation) and exorcisms.Religions 2023 ,14, 852 18 of 32 Table 5.

There are di rect correspondences of the features of the Priests discovered in Winkelman's crosscultural research with the characteristics of these wustate functionaries and bureaucratic ritualists central to Chinese religion and the clan institutions of ancestor worship. The Priests hold dual political-religious roles, with supreme secular and religious power generally invested in the group's highestlevel Priest. The central societal roles of Priests give them high social status. The principal activities of Priests involve collective agriculture (or pastoral) rituals that propitiate group deities with public sacrifices and feasts. This worship of the gods is to secure wellbeing in agricultural or other economic activity through the performance of the most significant calendrical rituals at the crucial annual planting and harvesting cy cles. The rituals associated with the agricultural cycle are intended to aid the fertility of animals and crops, and the harvest rituals focus on offering thanks to the deities for the abundance provided. The supreme leader of the Priests is typically selected by patrilineal succession, al though political action and armed conflict with competing relatives may be necessary to secure the top position. Priests are normally limited to males, with females generally serv ing only as assistants or servants unless it is the empress or queen who assumes the position of high Priest by virtue of her royal position or widowhood. The head Priest is assisted by diverse Priests who may have specialized training, often of a technical nature. ASCs typi cally were not considered significant in the training of Priests, but the training did involve periods of social isolation, sexual abstinence and prolonged wakefulness. Priests are typified by ancestor cults led by the senior lineage member who assumes the role of the Priest for the group. Lower priests are senior lineage members and typ ically have power over extensive economic resources and often hold important political positions and exercise judiciary functions. Priesthoods are hierarchically organized in a system of administrative control over society. Priests may exercise legislative functions establishing the moral order of society. Priests obtain significant economic resources from their functions and their fulltime profession. Priests' power comes from their close ancestral relations with spirits of collective im portance, especially ancestor spirits, village spirits and high gods. Priests are ritual inter mediaries with the spiritual world, petitioning deities on behalf of the community, but do not normally enter into the spirit realms nor claim to control the gods. Priests' high pres tige and personal power related to their divine descent may also give impersonal power such as mana (spiritual lifeforce energy). The Priest's ritual knowledge guides the timing of official public ceremonies and typically includes the sacrifice of domestic animals (cows, pigs, chickens, etc.) to the gods, which are consumed by participants in communitywide festivals. The collective rituals often involved collective alcohol consumption and feasting in prominent public places in collective ceremonies. Healing is not a focal activity of Priests except in so far as to secure protection through purification and wellbeing from the worship of the gods through sacrifices. Although indi vidual healing services were not Priestly functions, healing effects were provided through the psychological effects of purification and removing contaminated conditions such as offending spirits or taboo violations. Propitiating and worshiping the gods was also fo cused on wellbeing in seeking protection for the whole group, assuring abundance and preventing future illness. The close correspondences of these bureaucratic functionaries and the Priests described in Winkelman's crosscultural research illustrate furthermore that they do not remotely re semble Foraging Shamans. Michael asserts that the bureaucratic ritualists have \"direct contact or facetoface communication between humans and nonbodily beings in s \u00e9ance events\" ( Michael 2015 , p. 671), suggesting ASC. This interpretation of the direct communi cation of these wuwith spirits is questioned by Keightley, who notes that the spirits silently enter (descend) and leave the ritual after partaking in the sacrifices they have been offered.Religions 2023 ,14, 852 21 of 32 \"There is nothing particularly shamanistic about the quality of the religious experience described\" ( Keightley 1998 , p. 10). The Priests and bureaucratic wushare virtually every characteristic: primary religious activities (ancestor worship, agricultural wellbeing); selection (for the highest level, social succession/inheritance and political action); sociopolitical power (highest political, economic and judicial power); professional characteristics (male, fulltime, specialized hierarchy, high status); motive and context of ritual (social functions, public calendrical rituals); supernatural power (ancestors, superior gods, ritual knowledge); ASC (very limited); and Healing (sacrifices). On the other hand, the bureaucratic wuand Shamans differ on virtually all features be sides high status. There is no empirical or rational justification to refer to the bureaucratic wuas Shamans. As Tong (2002 , pp. 53, 60) notes \"From then on, it is no longer proper to use the term wuto cover all the religious practitioners indiscriminately. Henceforth, part time folk magicians may still be referred to as wu, but the religious elite of the community had become something closer to priests . . .. In their social status, activities, functions, and beliefs, they were in fact priests.\" 3.5. Female Wu Literary sources from the Shang period emphasized the ancient distinctions of female wufrom male practitioners, but there was little description of their activities in compar ison to the male wu xi and wu yi . They were represented with a variety of characters (i.e., Wu Wang and Wu Yu ; also see Table 2). But by the fifth to third centuries BCE, only accounts of wuwho were females were well documented in literary sources and government records because they held positions in the royal courts as advisors to supreme rulers ( Sukhu 2012 ) and performed rituals for the state religion, including funeral rites ( Michael 2015 ). The female wuwere members of a coven who served the royal court through the ministry of ritual and accompanied rituals in the temples where they appealed to the ancestors and gods through sacrifices. These wuwere appointed to positions in the royal courts as advisors to supreme rulers and engaged in rituals involving dances and spirit communication to assure the wellbeing of the king and state, especially through rituals for rain which were seen as important for agricultural abundance. Cai(2014 , p. 145) characterizes the various functions of these wubased on their abilities to communicate with the gods and other spirits whom they queried with divinatory rituals and petitioned with sacrifices and spells to obtain their favor. Female wuplayed important roles in political decisions with divination practices based on dream interpretation. But despite their employment by the king during the Qin and Han dynasties to make sacrifices to numerous spirits, especially ancestors, the social status of the female wuwas generally low, a petty position comparable to court musicians and entertainers ( Cai2014 , p. 145). The ASC of female wuinvolved possession, a spirit communication in which a spirit descends from heaven upon the person who is possessed, with the personality of the wu entirely merged with that of the possessing male spirit. These experiences were also vi tal for receiving divinatory revelations by the wuwhich were important in political deci sions, particularly decisions regarding war. Sukhu emphasizes their healing role as well, with interconnected skills of communicating with spirits for divination to determine the spirit responsible for a disease and treatments with exorcisms, sacrifices and herbal heal ing. Their healing rituals involved exorcisms carried out with incantations and sacrifices for appeasing the ancestors.Religions 2023 ,14, 852 22 of 32 Comparing Female Wu with Mediums (SCCS Variable 882) and Shamans (SCCS Variable 879) The principal functions of Mediums involving healing, divination and spirit commu nication are the same as Shamans, but their features are generally different. While Medi ums are similar to Shamans in dramatic experiences of ASC and an engagement with spir its, their ASC are distinct in experiences of possession by a powerful spirit or god, rather than the soul flight, deathandrebirth and animal transformation of Shamans. This selec tion through possession experience characteristic of Mediums presents psychobiological factors involving dissociation and trauma responses, including convulsions, tremors and amnesia ( Winkelman 2018 ). Mediums' initial episode of spontaneous possession typically occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood and is manifested with tremors, convulsions, seizures, compulsive behavior and postASC amnesia. This episode is considered an ill ness caused by an affliction of a possessing spirit, and the required treatment initiates their training as a Medium. This training involves the ritual induction of ASCs through singing, drumming and dancing during which the patient learns how to control the possessing spir its and vocalize their demands. Once they achieve this control they are cured and begin to serve in the capacity of a healer for the community. These features of possession are not typical of Shamans. Mediums lack the hunting ritual and sorcery features of Shamans. Instead, Mediums are involved in agricultural rituals and the propitiation of spirits and deities, especially in rituals to worship and propitiate their possessing spirits and make sacrifices to them to assure personal and collective wellbeing. Mediums are generally of low social and eco nomic status but have respect among women and beyond since they express the personas of dominant male spirits. Mediums are subordinate to Healers and Priests but may exert social influence in the community because they manifest powerful spirits and convey their messages. Mediums have supernatural power by virtue of their possession; their bodies and voices are taken over by powerful spirits who communicate divine orders for others to follow. Mediums are not thought to control these entities, but to express their will. The Mediums' primary ritual involves entry into a possession state to allow the gods to work their influence. Mediums also attempt to influence these superior spirits through sacrifices. Mediums' diagnosis of illness and healing involves exorcism to remove the influences of possessing spirits and protection from malevolent spirits and witches. Mediums pro duce their healing first through control of their own possession episodes, as well as through the general effects of ritual and ASC in eliciting endogenous healing responses (i.e., relax ation response, dissociation, placebo effects, hypnotic responses). These possession experi ences produce personal transformations by allowing women to assume roles and express socially prohibited emotions. The widespread manifestations of similar possession phe nomena illustrate it is not to be understood in cultural particulars, but instead as a mani festation of an evolved mechanism. This adaptation involves the compartmentalization of consciousness to accommodate to accepting longlasting relationships and situations that are oppressive or even abusive ( Winkelman 2018 ). The features of female wuthat are also typical of Mediums (but not Shamans) include the following: agricultural rituals, their control by possessing spirits, lower social status, predominantly female, a professional group, propitiation and sacrifices and healing in volving exorcism. Lacking in these female wuare the central features of Foraging Shamans, such as powers derived from animals and a belief in their transformation into an animal; death and rebirth experiences during formation and an ASC of soul flight or journey; and healing practices involving the recovery of soul loss and the extraction of illnesscausing sorcery objects. Furthermore, in those cases where the spirits descended into the wuand spoke \"through the mouths and bodies of the wu\" (Michael 2015 , p. 684), we see evidence of possession rather than the shaman's ecstatic or outofbody experience. Instead of the Shaman's control over spirits, the spirits have control over the possessed Mediums. Medi ums are not typically associated primarily with animal spirits, but are instead importantReligions 2023 ,14, 852 23 of 32 to the gods, reinforcing Mediums' reputation as exclusively moral agents in contrast to the Shamans, who have moral duality balancing a reputation for both healing and sorcery. In spite of some literary mentions of the female wus' flights to heaven ( Williams 2020 ), characteristics typical of shamanism of the traditions of north Asia, this soul flight feature of Shamans' ASCs is notably lacking in female wu. Rather than supporting Michael's argu ment for shamanism, the presence of possession is a clear indication of the female wubeing Mediums rather than Shamans. Michael reviews evidence in Chinese commentarial prece dents for this interpretation of possession in the classic texts in the word jiang zhi which means 'to descend and arrive', with the spirit descending into the person to possess the wu(also see Lin(2009 , pp. 397-99), who argues that the meaning was clearly possession). Their identity as Mediums is further reinforced by the distinguishing ecological and social features of societies typified by Shamans (foraging) versus Mediums (agricultural, with warfare and political integration) exemplified by these female wuin a statelevel agricul tural society with rampant warfare between states (Warring States Period). Other principal characteristics of these wuduring the Warring States era (paraphrased from Sukhu 2012 ) that correspond to features of Mediums but not Shamans included being only women, their focus on the ancestors and gods, and their experience of possession in training and professional practice, which they addressed with exorcisms. 3.6. Wugu as Malevolent Wu Both earlier independent and bureaucratic wuunderwent a further change at the end of the Han dynasty, a \"radical transformation, in which they were systematically identified with the popular religion of the masses and became the targets of the active suppression by the functionaries both of the Confucians and Daoists and, a bit later, the Buddhists\" (Michael 2015 , p. 673). While Lin(2009 ) considers the criticism and doubts of social lead ers to have damaged the social image of the wu, it was the political interdictions and attacks that led to their loss of political and social status. Although complete repression and inter diction did not occur in the preQin periods, it was welldeveloped by the Warring States Period. After the transition from the feudal states to a unified imperial empire, this ten dency to forbid practices of the wuaccelerated, leading to a dramatic reduction in their status by the Han Period. Schafer also notes these dramatic changes in the wu, astutely observing that \" After the Chou dynasty, the female shaman . . .was forced into sub rosa channels for the practicing of her magic arts, analogously to the witch of medieval Europe\" (Schafer 1951 , p. 134). Once the imperial system was in force, the wufell into the lower classes and were not able to recover their former glory (Lin). Although wuwere generally considered to be benevolent, performing white magic, some texts indicate they also might engage in witchcraft. While this may have been a confusion with practitioners referred to in some texts as wugu , some texts have attributed malevolent practices to wuas well, who were employed by the powerful to cast evil spells on the victim ( Sukhu 2012 , p. 75). In contrast to the generally benevolent wu, \"Wugu was the art of directing malevolent spirits to harm people\" ( Cai2014 , p. 146). The wugu per formed malevolent rituals with the use of poisons and the invocation of evil spirits for personal reasons or to assist others to obtain power and wealth or take revenge against enemies ( Cai2014 , p. 146). Inscriptions of oracle bones indicate practices of manipulating various insects and poisonous snakes to produce gupoison and the performance of night time rituals involving the manipulation of wooden dolls used to represent the intended victims ( Cai2014 , p. 146). Accounts of these practices of wugu attest to ritual incantations to cause an evil spirit to invade a victim to cause illness and even death. Such practices were prohibited, and people accused were publicly executed. The importance of witchcraft and the execution of witches came to the forefront when the aged and infirmed Emperor Wuaccused a royal family of using a (foreign) wuto per form a curse and manipulation of sorcery dolls to kill him. They were arrested and tried and the entire family was executed. The notion that these practices came from outside of the culture was indicated by the prosecutor Jiang who likewise hired wufrom central AsiaReligions 2023 ,14, 852 24 of 32 to find the sorcery items and exorcise the ghosts, leading to the arrest of suspects who were tortured and put to death ( Cai2014 , p. 145). Wugu as a Sorcerer/Witch (SCCS Variable 883) The features of the wugu correspond to the type of ritualist Winkelman labeled as Sor cerer/Witch. The Sorcerer/Witch is devalued: an immoral aspect of the supernatural. These ritualists generally deny the accusations of being a Sorcerer/Witch. They are thought to be exclusively evil, to violate the moral order and even engage in acts of incest and canni balism. The Sorcerer/Witch is found in complex agricultural societies and is significantly predicted by political integration and warfare. Sorcerers/Witches are considered to be ex clusively malevolent, even causing illness and death to their own kin. A Sorcerer/Witch is often tortured and may be publicly executed. They are denounced for the destruction of economic resources, especially agriculture and livestock. The Sorcerer/Witch may per form their evil for clients but are generally thought to act out of revenge and for their own personal benefit or being motivated by negative emotions (anger, jealousy, envy, greed). Because of these emotions, the effects of the Sorcerer/Witch may operate unconsciously. They may, however, have learned techniques or acquired their power directly from their parents. Sorcerers/Witches exercise control over spirits and use techniques generally in volving curses and spells; contagious, exuvial or imitative rituals; and discharges of power or darts that enter the victim. The Sorcerer/Witch engages in nighttime rituals and is be lieved to be able to fly or transform into an animal. The wugu do exhibit many of these features\u2014devalued, immoral, being publicly ex ecuted, acting out of envy and greed and using curses, spells and imitative magic. And like the Priests and Healers who hold government positions, governmental officials were central in designating who is this antithesis of morality and accusing, judging and exe cuting those whom they considered to be guilty. In Winkelman 's (1992 ) research, Sorcer ers/Witches appear to generally be innocent victims, or local shamanistic healing traditions, rather than evil ritualists primarily engaged in malevolence. These competing ritualists are persecuted in a conflict between local culture and hierarchical power, reflected in the significant correlations of the Sorcerer/Witch with political integration beyond the local community\u2014such as a kingdom or empire. Winkelman's model of the formation of the Sorcerer/Witch is therefore consistent with the actual nature of the ambiguous wupractices, being used for good (healing, worship) as well as for evil (curses, spells). Chinese history in the Han period provides clear evidence of this malevolent activity by certain parties, as well as the persecution of the guilty and innocent alike by government authorities. 3.7. The Chinese ReindeerEvenki Shaman If there is and was a \"Chinese\" shaman within the contemporary era, it clearly would include the ritualist of the Chinese ReindeerEvenki, who appropriately use the indigenous term aman to refer to their practitioners. Heyne (1999 ) integrated his own and others' research on their characteristics and activities; this is paraphrased and summarized below. The principal religious activity of the aman was the treatment of illnesses, divination and predicting the future and the performance of various sacrifices to ward off misfortune. The aman also served as guides for the departed to the land of the dead and led seasonal and social rituals (e.g., annual celebrations, weddings and memorials for deceased per sons). While the aman was expected to act in an altruistic manner, they were also regarded with feelings of fear for their ability to perform malevolent rituals. Rival shamans engaged in magical battles that might end in the death of one of them. The call to be a aman came in mysterious illnesses, dreams and visions received from the tutelary spirit of deceased ancestors, reflecting the inheritance of the ability to become a shaman. Once they fell victim to the call, the initiate often became depressed, distracted and unresponsive and suffered attacks of hysteria accompanied by convulsions and peri ods of insensibility. When the clan system was still intact, the neophyte received orienta tion from an experienced shaman of another clan, but now the shamanic initiation alwaysReligions 2023 ,14, 852 25 of 32 occurred as selfinitiation, as a purely individual endeavor. The aman sought long peri ods of solitude and fasting in the wilderness where the person fell into a state of ecstasy and lost consciousness. In this state, they received the call and teachings of the spirit pow ers that gave the aman the strength to conduct a new life through conversing with the spirits. During their long meditation, the candidate was killed and cut into pieces by the spirits who consumed the flesh of the initiate and afterwards reassembled the bones and brought the initiate back to life. When the initiate returned to the community the person was already a shaman. The aman was a person of great significance for the community but was never the head of the clan or a political leader. The aman could be male or female and their parttime service did not generate any material advantage. The aman had greater mental abilities and courage than other clan members: a capable and inspired person. But despite their altruistic service, the aman had an ambiguous moral status based on the possibility that he or she might abuse their power someday. Nonetheless, their rituals were performed for the benefit of the whole community when the normal life of a group member was dis turbed, or the group as a whole was falling into disorder. The community's feelings of confidence obliged the shaman, who could not avoid this duty once the call was received. The shaman's task required an entirely altruistic behavior and did not generate any mate rial advantage. The supernatural power of the aman was derived from relations with animals, es pecially the red deer, whose natural and supernatural qualities were transferred to the costumed amans as they rapidly danced around the fire. The aman were thought to be capable of changing themselves into animals, i.e., into the animalshaped bearers of their souls, such as bear, elk or reindeer. The aman was a master of the spirits who were sub servient and pliable to the needs of their shaman master. The aman had command of techniques of ecstasy. Singing and drumming were the most important techniques for in ducing the aman to fall into a trance. The beat of the drum carried the Evenki shaman to mount the magic elk or deer to travel to the otherworld. The soul of the aman traveled into the spirit world, changing into their alter ego in an animal shape world while lying unconscious on the floor. amans might also use alcohol to facilitate their spirit journey and increase their powers over spirits. The healing concepts of the aman involved belief in the malevolent influences of spir its which could cause many forms of misfortune. The aman had to overcome and chase out the spirits. Soul recovery was used to recover the lost soul of a patient on its way to the realm of the dead and bring it back safely. The shamanic ritual, particularly the singing and drumming, had a hypnotic influence on the patient. The aman provided protection for all members of the group with spiritual safeguards erected to help prevent abnormal states of mind and misfortunes, illness, accidents and suicide. The aman also knew how to apply medicinal herbs and plants. Comparisons of aman with Foraging Shamans (SCCS Variable 879) Virtually all the exclusive features of Foraging Shamans are exhibited by the aman . The healing and divination, as well as malevolent acts, are shared, as is the selection based on illness, dreams and visions from spirits. The formative period alone in the wilderness, with fasting and visions leading to deathandrebirth experiences are shared features; as are the high status, lack of economic gain, both male and female parttime functionar ies and the altruistic action on behalf of the community they were obliged to serve. a mans controlled the spirits and their powers came from animals into which they were be lieved to transform for journeys to the spirit world. These and other classic features of shamanism and Shamans such as healing through soul recovery, removal of malignant spirits and use of medicinal plants all illustrate features of the aman which correspond to Foraging Shamans. The fact that the Chinese ReindeerEvenki were hunters and pastoralists who immi grated to China around 200 years ago and constitute an ethnic group outside of mainstreamReligions 2023 ,14, 852 26 of 32 Chinese culture is instructive. It is only outside of the core of Chinese culture, in the tribal groups at the margins and periphery, that the Shaman is found in recent history. 3.8. Is the Contemporary Chinese Tu Bo a Shaman? The information that Xing and Murray (2018 ) present on the religious system of the Tu ethnic group of Qinghai Province in Northwest China focuses on the bo, whom they translate as shaman, but the actual descriptions they provide make it clear that it has noth ing to do with Foraging Shamans or Agricultural Shamans. Xing and Murray (2018 ) note the ambiguous meaning of shaman and the problems of being \"exported somewhat willy nilly to other religious specialists around the world . . .[but] nonetheless use the term shaman\" (p. 7 of 22). \"What remains ambiguous, however, are the features that define shamans as a group, that justify a special label, and that distinguish them from other reli gious specialists\" (p. 6 of 22), but they arbitrarily characterize the shaman as simply involv ing principally diagnosing and healing illness (also weather control and contacting spirits). But in discussing the Chinese ethnic Tu and their ritualist bo, whom they label a shaman, they note the contrary, \"that among the Tu there has been a radically diminished involvement by shamans in the diagnosis and healing of illness\" (p. 14 of 22), and instead document the importance of the boin agricultural (rainmaking) rituals. The only addi tional features they attributed to justify the label of shaman is that the boare parttime spe cialists who let spirits enter the community and are possessed by spirits to find solutions to individual, familial and collective problems through rituals of public drumming and special chants and dances. All the core features of Foraging Shamans are notably lacking. While Xing and Murray suggest that the bo\"fits neatly into the category of shaman,\" there is nothing about the bothat resembles the characteristics of the Foraging and Agri cultural Shamans, as seen in the characteristics of the bodiscussed below (also see Table 5). The authors explicitly recognize the inappropriate application of the term shaman to the boin stating \"This public climatological function of shamanic performance is compatible with, but differs in ritual emphasis from, the crossculturally more common role of the shaman as a healer in private diagnostic and therapeutic sessions.\" So why call the boa shaman? The features of boenumerated in Table 5illustrate no resemblance to Shamans but rather closely resemble Priests. Xing and Murray are paraphrased below to characterize the principal religious activ ity of the bo. The boofficiates a festival to help ensure good weather, making agriculture possible by sending rain and protecting against excessive rain. The boalso performs ritu als for life cycle events, such as weddings and for female fertility and childbearing. The authors emphasize that the bono longer provides a principal source of help in illness. The bo'spolitical power is illustrated in their role in providing solutions to collective, familial and individual problems, and their leadership in collective rituals. Only males may become a bo, but while not a fulltime specialist, it is a hereditary position passed down from one generation to the next within the same family (patrilineal succession). Bofunction principally in an annual festival coordinated with the planting season and perform a public village festival in the temple where the entire community participates in rituals to protect from natural disasters and to secure blessings for the community. The rituals solicit the protective spirits longwang (dragon kings) and the niangniang (queen mothers), benevolent figures associated with water and rainfall, as well as tutelary and ancestor spirits for the care of the village and agrarian plots. The ancestors are wor shiped with rituals at ancestral altar gravesites with gifts. Notably, while the bois ascribed special knowledge and skills that bring the spirits to the community, he does not control these spirits who may even refuse to keep their part of the ritual bargain. The bois ascribed an ASC, being possessed by spirits during ritual dancing in which he becomes the various spirits who provide information through the mouth of the bo. The ASC is induced by a drum and special chants and dances but is only notable from shivering which indicates the presence of a spirit. While boprovided healing as a principal activity in the past, they are no longer a principal source of help in illness.Religions 2023 ,14, 852 27 of 32 The authors note that in the past, females typically functioned as bo. \"Tradition has it that in the past, not only could females function as bo, but that the bo were typically fe males. That is now emphatically no longer the case. The contemporary absence of females among the bomay be the result of a transition that came as an adaptation to Han Daoist in fluence\" (p. 12 of 22). This suggests that the mediumistic functions of the bowere usurped by men, who brought more of a priestly role to the position, reflecting \"syncretic incorpo ration of Han Daoist practices into the inventory and repertoire of the bo.\" (p. 12 of 22). The role of boas Priests is illustrated in the most important contemporary role of the bo involving performance in a public festival whose principal objective is the recruitment of spirits to help in controlling the weather for assuring the success of agriculture. 4. Results: A Summary of Shared Features and Divergences The analyses above have provided direct comparisons of the wuritualists with Shamans and other etic types of ritualists. This section provides a summary assessment of the simi larities of wu7based on the characteristics they share with Shamans or the other ritualists they most closely resemble. The comparisons focus on differentiating features, those char acteristics which distinguish Shamans (i.e., soul flight and soul loss), as opposed to general characteristics shared by many types of ritualists (i.e., spirit interactions or healing). Thus, the comparisons are based on the following 19 unique or diagnostic features of Shamans: Ritual: (two variables) Communitywide ritual held overnight Distinctive Functions: (two variables) Malevolence/Sorcery, warfare Selection & training: (four variables) Dreams and illness as signs of spirit's request, vision quest alone in the wilderness, deathandrebirth experience, self/spirit taught Social Characteristics: (three variables) Charismatic leader, informal power, male and female ASC: (two variables) Unconscious period, outofbody (soul flight), Animal powers: (three variables) Animals as a personal and supernatural power, ex periences of animal transformation, hunting magic Healing: (three variables) Soul loss and recovery, sucking/object extraction, the expul sion of attacking spirits (vs exorcism of possession). Ancient wu(focused on the men = xiorwu yi , rather than women wu) have at most 2 of the 19 contrastive distinctive features of Shaman (perhaps outofbody [soul flight] and animal powers). On the other hand, the Ancient wuexhibit 11 distinctive features charac teristic of Healers and/or Priests. These include Priest\u2014ancestor worship and hereditary aristocrat status; Healer and Priest\u2014agricultural and livestock rituals, members of the rul ing class, attendance of religious affairs of state, only males, the performance of sacrifices and prayer to gods for blessings to avert misfortune; Healer\u2014use of statues and icons, mechanical system of divination i.e., bone oracles and healing through exorcism. Commoner wuof the late Zhou period had 9 of the 19 contrastive characteristics of Shaman (Foraging and Agricultural), including malevolence/sorcery, warfare, dreams and illness as signs of spirit's request, charismatic leader, informal power, both male and fe male, outofbody experience (soul flight), animals as personal and supernatural power and hunting magic (as well as many other Shaman features which were not unique to Shamans, i.e., parttime, ASC, communicate with spirits, no formal group, etc.). On the other hand, the Commoner wuhad only four contrastive features characteristic of Healers or Priests. State religious officials did not have any features unique to Shamans, but instead had virtually all of their features diagnostic of both Priests and Healers (12) or just Priests (six) or Healers (two). Female wuof the Warring States period had none of the unique contrastive features of Shamans. Instead, the female wuhad six8variable areas exclusive to Mediums (group training, male spirit or god descends on person, possessing spirit, gods merged with the personality of wu, low social status, principally or exclusively female); three that Medi ums share with Priests or Healers (control rains for agriculture, perform exorcisms andReligions 2023 ,14, 852 28 of 32 appeal to deities with sacrifices and prayers) and three characteristics typical of Priests (as sure wellbeing of state, rituals held at regular times throughout year and contributed to bureaucratic and political decisions with divination). Guwu of the Han period had only four characteristics shared by Shamans and the Sorcerer/Witch type (nighttime rituals, males and females, imitative magic [AS] and cause illness and death) and seven which were uniquely characteristic of the Sorcerer/Witch type. The Chinese ReindeerEvenki aman had 15 of the 19 contrastive features characteristic of Shamans (communitywide ritual, malevolence/sorcery, dreams and illness as signs of spirit's request, vision quest alone in the wilderness, death and rebirth experience, self/spirit taught, charismatic leader, informal power, both male and female, outofbody (soul flight) experiences, animals as a personal and supernatural power, experiences of animal trans formation, healing of soul loss and recovery and expulsion of attacking spirits (vs exorcism of possession). The boof the Tu ethnic group of Qinghai Province Northwest China only has one feature diagnostic of Shamans (communitywide ritual activity), but eight characteristic features of Priests, three shared by Priest and Healers and three possibly indicative of Medi ums. I say possibly because the assertion of possession for the bo, while a characteristic of Mediums, does not have the features of Mediums crossculturally (convulsions, amnesia, erratic behaviors, etc.; see Winkelman 2018 ). These assessments indicate that the etic categories for the Chinese ritualists are as follows: xi orwu yi: State wu:Priest Female wuof the Warring States period: Medium Guwu Sorcerer/Witch Chinese ReindeerEvenki aman: Foraging Shaman Boof the Tu ethnic group of Qinghai Province: Priest 5. Discussion: Critical Assessment of Translating Wuas Shaman? Determining whether a wuis a shaman or other type of ritualist should depend on their correspondence to crosscultural patterns of shamanism and other religious ritualists described above (Tables 1,3and 5).Keightley (1998 ) made astute criticisms of the hypothe ses that early Chinese ritualists were shamans in any way related to Eliade's conceptual framework. Williams (2020 ) further reviews studies (von Falkenhausen 1995 ;Keightley 1998 ; Boileau 2002 ) that have illustrated the error in labeling as shamans the various early Chi nese religious practitioners referred to as wu. Yet many publications have promoted con fusion by asserting a false equivalence of wuand shamans. Michael (2015 ) notes \"Confusion in using the category of shamanism arises in part because of a lack of consensus on which features to include in it, and that consensus can only be informed by adherence to culturespecific representations that then can be utilized in wider, crosscultural studies\" (p. 664). But it is the culturally specific allegations (defi nitions) of what is a shaman independent of some objective criterion that undermines ef forts after consensus. We need crossculturally valid concepts of shamanism such as those discovered in Winkelman's research, not some concept that loses comparative utility by changing from culture to culture. But Michael seems to absolutely reject a crosscultural definition of shamanism in as serting shamanism \"does not exist as a natural piece of human behavior demonstrating essential qualities to be discovered and cataloged\" (p. 665). The crosscultural research of Winkelman and the biogenetic features shows that Michael is wrong. Crosscultural stud ies can create a consensus about just what the concept of shaman represents, and whether it can be appropriately applied to culturespecific phenomena. A problem with Michael's approach is that he defines a shaman in a manner inconsistent with his own criteria. He alleges that \"The presence of shamanism in any society is recognized by their representaReligions 2023 ,14, 852 29 of 32 tions of a s \u00e9ance event of direct contact (possession) or facetoface communication (spirit journey) between human beings and bodiless beings for the benefit of the community\" (p. 665). But such characterizations are so broad that it frustrates other aspects he empha sizes in his effort after a definition, which \"also has to differentiate the shaman from all other religious and political functionaries; any definition that does not attend to this will inevitably be so openended that it will lose all tractability\" (p. 659). The resolution of this problem of excessive openendedness demands an ethnological perspective such as presented above, but which has not previously been applied to uses of the term wu. Such crosscultural characteristics of the empirically derived etic typology of ritualists determined by Winkelman's research provide an empirical framework to assess what is a shaman in a crosscultural perspective and across Chinese history. The comparisons of this framework with Chinese ritualists presented above show that most types of Chinese ritu alists called wudo not correspond to Foraging or Agricultural Shamans, but rather to other types of ritualists. This illustrates the necessity to distinguish the diverse types of ritualists called wuand relate them to crosscultural patterns of ritualists besides shamans. Since the contrastive features of wuritualists clearly map onto the ethnological crosscultural model, it shows that such perspectives help articulate Chinese ritualists in comparative perspec tive and remove the erroneous perception that all wuare shamans. As illustrated above, while principal aspects of the features of the prehistoric and Commoner wudo correspond to the features of Foraging Shamans, the other types of wu(Ancient, State, Female and Wugu) do not correspond to the features of the Foraging & Agricultural Shamans, but rather other types of ritualists (Healers, Priests, Mediums and Sorcerers/Witches, respectively). Boileau (2002 , pp. 354-55) illustrates these diverse meanings of the wucharacter in its reference to many different types of ritualists and supernatural roles, including diviner, a possessed medium, a ritual scapegoat, a sorcerer, healer, priest and even ancestor worship practices and eventually activities suppressed by government officials who prosecuted and even killed wuduring the imperial period for their practices, which were called sor cery and witchcraft. What these associations of wuwith such diverse functionaries reflect is change, a socioeconomic transformation of ancient shamanic ritual practices into other kinds of ritualists. Michael (2015 , p. 685) proposes the experiences at the basis of Chinese state religion and centralized authority were \"instituted, not by ancient, alltoo human shamans or sages, but by the will of the spirits (speaking through the possessed wu) at a time before there were institutionalized priests and temple officers.\" This suggests that by the time of the early Chinese civilization with its state religion of ancestor worship, whatever may have been the early remnants of an aboriginal Chinese shamanism had already been transformed into Healers and Mediums and the Priests who controlled them. Since the Shang dynasty is considered the origins of Chinese civilization and was characterized by diverse forms of wuritualists (male wu yi , female wuand official wu), Shamans were absent from the core of society at the beginning of Chinese civilization and only persisted at the peripheries of culture and power. This is exemplified in the two clearest cases of Chinese shamans pre sented here: (1) the Commoner wu, an Agricultural Shaman and (2) the Chinese Reindeer Evenki aman, who reflects the classic features of Foraging Shamans. Winkelman 's (2022 ) crosscultural analyses show that these processes involved agri cultural intensification, supracommunity political organization and eventually warfare. These processes lead to the elimination of Shamans and the assumption of religious and ritual functions by new types of ritualists that are not Shamans but rather Priests, Medi ums and Healers. This was the dynamic present at the beginning of the Shang Dynasty\u2014 male xiHealers, the poorly documented female wuof that epoch and the bureaucratic wu Priests. This dynamic expanded in the Warring years with the development of the Fe male wuMediums and the Wugu Sorcerer/Witch who was persecuted by the Chinese state. These dynamics of evolutionary change in Chinese ritualists are clearly reflected in the sociocultural evolutionary mode of religion presented in Figure 1.Religions 2023 ,14, 852 30 of 32 What all the wushare is being a ritualist, not sharing the features of a Foraging or Agricultural Shaman. The use of the root wuin denominating diverse types of Chinese practitioners indicates that the best translation of wuis a religious ritualist. So What Is a Shaman? While cultural relativism might suggest that it makes sense to let each society define shamanism, there exists a problem that becomes clearer when asked in reference to other concepts. By analogy, should each culture or society decide what a democracy is? Does Putin's claim to run a democratic country receive obligatory acceptance by scholars of polit ical systems? Or alternatively, should there be objective academic and scientific standards of what a democracy is? By analogy, if we are to have crossculturally relevant characterizations of the defi nition of a shaman, it must be based on empirical comparative data rather than arbitrary or culturally specific definitions. Determination of whether a ritualist is a shaman is not an issue of where the term originated or the culture where a particular ritualist is found, but whether the ritualist resembles a welldelineated crosscultural phenomenon which justifies the etic use of a word as a transculturally relevant concept. Concepts such as bands, tribes and chiefdoms are commonly used in comparative political assessments of the political complexity of societies. While each category shows variation, the differences among them are clear and useful. No informed anthropologist would confuse a band for a chiefdom. And even if people in chiefdoms band together for some reason, they are still a chiefdom, not a band. By analogy, the differences between Shamans and Priests are clear, not arbitrary. Winkelman 's (1990 ,1992 ,2022 ) crosscultural research found a consistent pattern of characteristics associated with the ritualists in for aging societies, and these features correspond closely to the core concepts identified by diverse scholars researching the nature of shamanism. This crosscultural pattern of For aging and Agricultural Shamans is the most objective criteria to use as a framework for characterizing and evaluating what a shaman was. And even if a priest heals, divines, talks to spirits, exorcises a patient and takes care of animals, his core features are that of a Priest, not a Shaman. 6. Conclusions: The WuIs a Religious Ritualist, Not a Shaman As illustrated in the ethnological studies presented above, there are consistent ob jective criteria about what the concept of shaman represents in foraging societies cross culturally, and the consistent beliefs and behaviors associated with these ritualists are the criteria that should be used to determine whether the label shaman can be appropriately applied to culturespecific phenomena. But despite decades of publications documenting the inappropriateness of the term shaman as a translation for wu, the use persists even among those who note that it is an in appropriate term. Fu's (2022 ) book has \"shamanic\" in the title, and in a chapter (6) on \"The northern shaman\", he writes about the wellpreserved shamanic culture in myths and leg ends, and in spite of appearing to claim otherwise, clearly rejects the notion of any north ern Chinese shamans: \"on the basis of years of field surveys on the peoples of northern China, studies of shamans' biographies and historical documents, and interviews with the elderly and with old and new shamans, we can safely say that no northern Chinese shaman really performs practices that accord with Eliade's theories . . .While performing sacrifi cial rites for clan ancestors and nature deities, northern shamans remain conscious and soberminded . . .. northern shamans do not actually lose consciousness, and their spirit certainly does not leave their body. Rather, they remain in control of the emotional vortex of the rite. In a largescale ritual, their seeming trance state is actually a welldesigned per formance. In entering that state, their own human subjective activity, not divine power, is what is mainly at work\" ( Fu2022 , p. 158). To appreciate the nature of Chinese wuritualists in a crosscultural perspective, par ticularly with respect to the concept of the shaman, we need what Feng Qu(2018 ) callsReligions 2023 ,14, 852 31 of 32 for in assessing Chinese Mongolian ritualists, a twoway dialogue to resolve the problem atic aspects of both Western and Chinese perspectives on what has been called shamanism. What is important is not just any Western perspective, but one informed by ethnology rather than the romantic traditions Qu criticizes. Clarity in academic discourse requires the unambiguous meaning of technical words. Translating wuas shaman obfuscates, con fuses and misleads. A wuis a ritualist and may be a Shaman, but more likely is a Medium, Healer, Priest or even Sorcerer/Witch. Consequently, wushould be translated into English as \"ritualist, or as \"religious ritualist\" if a distinction from other bureaucratic functionaries is needed.

In the case of Shamans, all cases of variables of less than 100% were correlated with data quality sources, with the consistently positive correlations indicating missing data (under reporting) rather than true absence. 6Analyses were performed in the CosSci program housed at the University of California, Irvine at http://socscicompute.ss.uci.edu/ . This system is no longer publicly available. 7I have not provided a comparison with the Prehistoric Neolithic wubecause of the lack of adequate data for a meaningful assessment. 8Table 5shows more than six matches with Mediums, but they are overlapping features.
