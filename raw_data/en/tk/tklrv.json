Enforcement and procedure on complaint (a) Any person believing himself to be aggrieved by an unlawful practice as defined in Section 4603 may file with the Commission a complaint in writing. Such complaint shall be filed within 20 days after the date of the alleged unlawful prac- tice, or, if the occurrence thereof was not immediately known to the aggrieved person, then within 20 days after actually /earning thereof, but in no case more than six months after the alleged unlawful practice. Such complaint shall state : the name and address of the complainant; the name and address, if known, of the person or per- sons who allegedly committed the unlawful practice; the location of the dwelling involved ; the date when the alleged unlawful practice occurred ; a statement of the facts upon which the complainant bases his contention that the respondent violated the provisions of this act; such other information as may be required by the Commission. (b) The complaint shall be signed under oath by the com- plainant and sworn to before a person authorized to adminis- ter oaths. (c) Upon receipt of a complaint, the Commission shall send a copy of the complaint to the respondent by registered or certified mail. (d) As soon as practicable, the Chairman of the Commis- sion shall appoint a panel of three Members of the Commission 52 Chapter 32 who shall promptly conduct such investigations and hold such hearings, public or private, as they deem necessary and proper. The panel they so appoint shall, as a part of their investigation, endeavor to eliminate any unlawful practice and the conse- quences thereof by inducing compliance through informal meth- ods of conference, persuasion and conciliation. (e) Within 45 days after the filing of a complaint, the panel of Commissioners, or a majority of them, shall submit a written report of their findings to the Chairman. If a majority of the Commissioners determine that the respondent did not commit an unlawful practice, the Chairman shall issue an order of the Commission dismissing the complaint. If a majority of the Commissioners determine that the respondent committed an unlawful practice, the Chairman shall execute with the respondent an agreement which shall provide that the respond- ent shall refrain from any unlawful practice and contain such other terms as are reasonable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter, including provisions to provide relief from the conse- quences of the unlawful practice and provisions to insure future compliance with the law by the respondent. In the event that the respondent shall refuse to execute such an agreement, the Chairman shall issue an order of the Commission specifying the unlawful practice committed by respondent, stating the findings of the panel of Commissioners who investigated the complaint, and directing the respondent to discontinue such unlawful prac- tice and to comply with such other stated terms as are rea- sonable to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, except, how- ever, that no such order shall issue unless a hearing, private or public, has been held. (f) If a majority of the Commissioners appointed find that probable cause exists for believing that the allegations of the complaint are true and constitute an unlawful practice as defined in Section 4603 and that the complaint was not filed for harassment or frivolous purposes, said Commissioners, in the name of the Commission and represented by the Attorney Gen- eral, may petition the Court of Chancery for appropriate in- junctive relief against the respondent, including orders and de- crees restraining the respondent from selling, renting or other- wise making unavailable to the complainant the dwelling spe- cified in the complaint pending final determination of proceed- Chapter 32 53 ings under this chapter. No such injunctive relief shall be granted except after hearing, notice of which shall be given to the respondent at least three days prior thereto by the Com- mission by registered mail. The Court shall have power to grant such relief as it deems just and proper except as otherwise pro- vided herein. The respondent may file an answer to the com- plaint and appear at such hearing in person or otherwise, and submit testimony and evidence. The Court shall not issue any order or decree restraining the respondent from selling, rent- ing or otherwise making the dwelling specified in the complaint unavailable to the complainant for a period either exceeding 30 days from the day such order or decree was issued, or until a final order has been issued by the Chairman of the Commission as provided in this section, whichever event shall occur first. \u00a7 4606. Power to determine compliance The Commission shall have the power independently to de- termine compliance with the provisions of this chapter. In pur- suance thereof, the Commission, or any panel of three Com- missioners appointed by the Chairman, may conduct such in- vestigations and hold such hearings, public or private, as are deemed necessary and proper. Upon finding that an unlawful practice has been committed by any person the Chairman shall give notice thereof to the person involved and shall endeavor to execute an agreement with such person as provided in Section 4605. If the person refuses to sign such an agreement, an order may be issued as provided in Section 4605, except that no such order shall issue unless (i) a hearing, public or private, is first held in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and (ii) the date of the issuance of the order is within one year of the commission of the unlawful practice. The order shall be served forthwith on the respondent personally or by registered or cer- tified mail. The Chairman may relax the terms or conditions of any order or agreement under this section if performance would cause an undue hardship on the respondent or any other person and if not otherwise inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter. \u00a7 4607. Regulations The Commission shall have the power to make and revise 54 Chapter 32 or rescind such regulations as it may deem necessary or appro- priate to administer the provisions of this chapter, and such regulations shall, except as may be otherwise provided by the Commission, take effect upon publication. \u00a7 4608. Investigations and hearings Investigations shall be conducted and hearings, public or private, shall be held under this chapter in accordance with the regulations of the Commission ; provided, however, that in the holding of hearings, public or private: (i) at least 3 days' notice shall be given to all parties, (ii) testimony shall be given under oath, (iii) all parties shall be entitled to be heard in person or by attorney and to present evidence, and (iv) the right of cross-examination shall be preserved. \u00a7 4609.

Refusal to obey subpoena, answer questions or pro- duce documents; contempt If a person is subpoenaed and fails to obey the command of such subpoena without reasonable cause, or if a person in attendance refuses without lawful cause to be examined or to answer any proper question, or to produce papers, books, ac- counts or other documents when ordered to do so by a Member of the Commission, the Commission may apply to the Superior Court in and for the county where such hearing is being held for an order returnable in not less than two or more than ten Chapter 32 55 days directing such person to show 'cause before the Court why he should not comply with the subpoena or. order. Upon the return of such order the judge before whom the matter comes on for hearing shall examine under oath the person whose tes- timony may be relevant to be heard and if the judge determines that the person refused without legal excuse to obey the com- mand of such subpoena or to be examined, or to answer a legal or pertinent question, or to produce a book or paper which he was ordered to produce, the judge may order such person to comply forthwith with the subpoena or order and any failure to obey such order of the court or judge may be punished by the court or judge as a contempt of the Superior Court. \u00a7 4611. Right of appeal; procedure; scope of review Any complainant or respondent aggrieved by an order under this chapter shall have a right of appeal by serving upon the Commission and all adverse parties and filing, within 15 days of the date of the issuance of the order, a notice of appeal in the Superior Court in the county in which the un- lawful practice is alleged to have been committed. The grounds of the appeal shall be specifically set forth in the Notice of Appeal. Service of the Notice of Appeal upon any Member of the Commission shall be deemed service upon the Commission. The Commission shall be represented by the Attorney General. The Commission shall cause to be filed forthwith a certified copy of its record in the proceedings. Un- less otherwise ordered by the court, the filing of the appeal shall act as a stay of the order appealed from until disposition of the appeal. The cause of appeal shall be tried de novo and pro- ceedings shall be held as in other civil actions. \u00a7 4612.

In making such levy the Levy Court shall take into account the estimates of revenues as set forth in the estimate so prepared at a time to be fixed by it and the amount of any assessments levied on behalf of said County as hereafter provided and due and payable in the fiscal year for which the estimates are prepared. The Levy Court shall, after a public hearing, establish an annual assessment roll for the County sewer district or exten- sion thereof which shall be known as the \"Sewer District As- sessment Roll\". The annual assessments may be apportioned by the Levy Court against the several lots and parcels of land in the district or extension thereof by one or more of the following methods : An assessment on the lots and parcels of land in the district or extension thereof in proportion as nearly as may be to the benefit which each parcel would derive from the improve- ment. If zones of assessment have been established and an allocation of the total estimated cost of the facilities have been 184 Chapter 108 made to such zones, the amount of the cost of the facilities so allocated to any such zone of assessment may be apportioned by an ad valorem assessment levied on all the lots and parcels of land within such zone. (3) If zones of assessment have been established as pro- vided above, by assessment on the lots and parcels of land within such zone in proportion as nearly as may be to the bene- fit which each parcel will derive from the improvement. Notice of such public hearing shall state that the assess- ment roll has been completed and filed and the time and place fixed for the public hearing. Notice of such public hearing shall be published in a newspaper published within Kent County and and having a general circulation therein at least once, not less than seven days immediately preceding the date of the public hearing. At the time and place specified, the Levy Court shall meet and hear and consider any objects to the assessment roll, and may change or amend the same as it deems necessary or just, may affirm and adopt the same as originally proposed or as amended or changed, or the Levy Court may prepare a new roll. No such amended, changed or new roll shall be adopted unless the Levy Court shall hold another hearing thereon in the manner and upon the notice prescribed for the original hear- ing. The annual assessment shall be levied and collected at the same time as taxes levied for general County purposes. The County Treasurer shall keep a separate account of such moneys and they shall be used only for the purpose of the district or ex- tension thereof for which collected. The properties against which such assessments are levied, shall be liable for the pay- ment of the assessments in the same manner as they are liable for other County taxes. Section 3. Title 9, Delaware Code, Section 4632, is hereby amended to read as follows : \u00a7 4632. Payment of bonds The bonds may be payable at such time or times as may be determined in the bond resolution, or by resolution adopted subsequent to the adoption of the bond resolution, within the limitations provided in this Chapter.

Title 8, Delaware Code, is hereby amended by adding thereto a new chapter to be known as \"Chapter 6\" as follows : CHAPTER 6. PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CORPORATIONS Legislative intent It is the legislative intent to provide for the incorporation of an individual or group of individuals to render the same professional service to the public for which such individuals are required by law to be licensed or to obtain other legal au- thorization. Short title This chapter may be cited as \"The Professional Service Corporation Act.\" Definitions As used in this chapter the following words shall have the meaning indicated : (1) The term \"professional service\" shall mean any type of personal service to the public which requires az a condition precedent to the rendering of such service the obtaining of a license or other legal authorization and which prior to the ef- Chapter 127 211 fective date of this chapter and by reason of law could not be performed by a corporation. In addition, and by way of example and without limiting the generality thereof, the personal serv- ices which come within the provisions of this chapter are the personal services rendered by architects, certified or other public accountants, chiropodists, chiropractors, doctors of dentistry, doctors of medicine, optometrists, osteopaths, professional engi- neers, veterinarians and, subject to the Rules of the Supreme Court, attorneys-at-law. (2) The term \"professional corporation\" means a corpora- tion which is organized under this chapter for the sole and spe- cific purpose of rendering professional service and which has as its shareholders only individuals who themselves are duly licensed or otherwise legally authorized within this State to render the same professional service as the corporation. Exemptions This chapter shall not apply to any individual or groups of individuals within this State who prior to the effective date of this chapter were permitted to organize a corporation and per- form personal services to the public by the means of a corpora- tion, and this chapter shall not apply to any corporations organ- ized by such individual or group of individuals prior to the effective date of this chapter ; unless, any such individual or group of individuals or any such corporation bring themselves and such corporation within the provisions of this chapter by amending the certificate of incorporation in such a manner so as to be consistent with all the provisions of this chapter and by affirmatively stating in the amended certificate of incorpora- tion that the shareholders have elected to bring the corporation within the provisions of this chapter, or be incorporating ini- tially under the provisions of this chapter. Authority to organize; law governing One or more persons, each of whom is duly licensed or otherwise legally authorized to render the same professional services within this State, may organize and become a share- holder or shareholders of a professional corporation for pecuni- ary profit under the provisions of the General Corporation Law 212 Chapter 127 of Delaware for the sole and specific purpose of rendering the same professional services. Number of directors; officers A professional corporation which has only one shareholder need have only one director, who shall be such shareholder. Such one shareholder shall also serve as the president of the corporation. The other officers of the corporation in such a case need not be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to render the same professional service within this State, as such one shareholder. A professional corporation which has only two shareholders need have only two directors who shall be such shareholders. The two shareholders shall, between them, fill all the offices of the professional corporation. Rendition of professional services through licensed of- ficers, employees and agents No corporation organized and incorporated under this chap- ter may render professional services except through its officers, employees and agents who are duly licensed or otherwise legally authorized to render such professional services within this State; provided, however, this provision shall not be interpreted to include in the term \"employee\" as used herein clerks, secre- taries, nurses, administrators, bookkeepers, technicians and other assistants who are not usually and ordinarily considered by law, custom and practice to be rendering professional serv- ices to the public for which a license or other legal authoriza- tion is required in connection with the profession to be prac- ticed, nor does the term \"employee\" include any other person who performs all his employment under the direct supervision and control of an officer, employee or agent who is himself ren- dering professional service to the public on behalf of the pro- fessional corporation ; provided that, no person shall, under the guise of employment, practice a profession unless duly licensed to practice that profession under the laws of this State. Notwithstanding any other or contrary provisions of the laws of this State, a professional corporation organized under this chapter may charge for the services of its officers, employees, and agents, may collect such charges, and may compensate those who render such professional services. Chapter 127 218 Chapter not to affect professional relationship legal liabilities and standards for professional conduct; neg- ligence; attachment of assets Nothing contained in this chapter shall be interpreted to abolish, repeal, modify, restrict or limit the law now in effect in this State applicable to the professional relationship and the contract, tort and other legal liabilities between the person furnishing the professional services and the person receiving such professional service and to the standards for professional conduct, including the confidential relationship between the person rendering the professional services and the person receiving such professional service, if any; and all confidential relationships previously enjoyed under the laws of this State or hereafter enacted shall remain inviolate. Any officer, em- ployee, agent or shareholder of a corporation organized under this chapter shall remain personally and fully liable and ac- countable for any negligent or wrongful acts or misconduct committed by him, or by any person under his direct super- vision and control, while rendering professional service on behalf of the corporation to the person for whom such pro- fessional services were being rendered. The corporation shall be liable up to the full value of its property for any negligent or wrongful acts or misconduct committed by any of its officers, employees, agents or shareholders while they are engaged on behalf of the corporation in the rendering of professional serv- ices. The assets of a professional corporation shall not be liable to attachment for the individual debts of its shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the relationship of an individual to a professional corporation organized under this chapter, with which such individual is or may be associated, whether as officer, employee, agent, or shareholder director, shall in no way modify, extend or diminish the jurisdiction over such individ- ual, of and by whatever State, agency or office which licensed or otherwise legally authorized him for or to render service in a particular field of endeavor. Engaging in other business prohibited No corporation organized under this chapter shall engage in any business other than the rendering of the professional services for which it was specifically incorporated ; provided, 214 Chapter 127 however, nothing in this chapter or in any other provisions of existing law applicable to corporations shall be interpreted to prohibit such corporation from investing its funds in real es- tate, mortgages, stocks, bonds or any other type of investments, or from owning real or personal property necessary for, or appropriate or desirable in, the fulfillment or rendering of its professional services. Issuance of capital stock to licensed individuals; voting trust agreements prohibited; holding of stock by share- holder's estate No corporation organized under the provisions of this chapter may issue any of its capital stock to anyone other than an individual who is duly licensed or otherwise legally author- ized to render the same specific professional services as those for which the corporation was incorporated. No shareholder of a corporation organized under this chapter shall enter into a voting trust agreement or proxy or any other type agreement vesting another person with the authority to exercise the voting power of any or all of his stock. Subject to the provisions of the corporation's certificate of incorporation, the estate of a share- holder who was a person duly licensed or otherwise legally au- thorized to render the same professional service as that for which the professional corporation was organized may continue to hold stock pursuant to the certificate of incorporation for a reasonable period of administration of the estate, but shall not be authorized to participate in any decisions concerning the rendering of professional service. Disqualification of officer, shareholder, agent or em- ployee If any officer, employee, agent or shareholder of a corpora- tion organized under this chapter becomes legally disqualified to render such professional services within this State, or is elected to a public office or accepts employment that, pursuant to existing law, places restrictions or limitations upon his con- tinued rendering of such professional services, he shall sever all employment with, and financial interests in, such corporation, forthwith. A corporation's failure to require compliance with this provision shall constitute a ground for the forfeiture of its Chapter 127 215 charter and its dissolution. When a corporation's failure to comply with this provision is brought to the attention of the office of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State forth- with shall certify that fact to the Attorney General for appro- priate action to dissolve the corporation. Sale or transfer of shares Except as provided in Section 616, no shareholder of a cor- poration organized under this chapter may sell or transfer his shares in such corporation except to the corporation or to an- other individual who is eligible to be a shareholder of such cor- poration, and such sale or transfer may be made only after the same shall have been approved, at a stockholders' meeting spe- cially called for such purpose, or at an annual meeting with ten days' notice of such additional purpose, by such proportion, not less than a majority, of the outstanding stock entitled to be voted on that question as may be provided in the certificate of incorporation or in the by-laws. At such shareholders' meeting the shares of stock held by the shareholder proposing to sell or transfer his shares may not be voted or counted for any purpose. The certificate of incorporation may provide specifically for additional restraints on the alienation of shares and may require the redemption or purchase of such shares by the corporation at prices and in a manner specifically set forth in such certificate or the certificate may specifically authorize the corporation's board of directors or its shareholders to adopt by-laws restrain- ing the alienation of shares and providing for the purchase or redemption by the corporation of its shares ; provided, however, such provisions dealing with the purchase or redemption by the corporation of its share may not be invoked at a time or in a manner that would impair the capital of the corporation. Price for shares If the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of a profes- sional corporation fail to fix a price at which a professional cor- poration or its shareholders may purchase the shares of a de- ceased, retired, expelled, or disqualified shareholder, and if the certificate of incorporation or by-laws do not otherwise provide, then the price for such share or shares shall be the book value of such share or shares at the end of the month immediately 216 Chapter 127 preceding the death of or disqualification of the shareholder. Book value shall be determined by an independent certified pub- lic accountant employed by the professional corporation. The determination by the certified public accountant of book value shall be conclusive on the professional corporation and its share- holders. Perpetual corporate existence A corporation under this chapter shall have perpetual exist- ence until dissolved in accordance with other provisions of this chapter. Conversion into business corporation Whenever all shareholders of a corporation licensed under this chapter shall cease at any time and for any reason to be licensed, certified or registered in the particular field of en- deavor for which such corporation was organized, said corpo- ration shall thereupon be treated as converted into and shall operate henceforth solely as a business corporation under ap- plicable provisions of Chapter I of this Title, exclusive of this chapter. Time for transfer of shares upon death or disqualifi- cation Within 375 days following the date of death of a share- holder, or within 30 days following his disqualification as here- inbefore provided, to own shares in the corporation, all of the shares of such shareholder shall be transferred to, and acquired by, the corporation or persons qualified to own such shares. If no other provision to accomplish such transfer and acquisition is in effect and carried out within said period, the corporation shall thereafter purchase and redeem all of his shares of its stock at the book value thereof, determined as of the end of the month immediately preceding death or disqualification. For this purpose, the book value shall be determined from the books and records of the corporation in accordance with the regular methods o1 accounting used by it for the purposes of determin- ing its net taxable income for Federal income tax purposes; and no subsequent adjustment of such income, whether by the cor- Chapter 127 217 poration itself, by Federal income tax audit made and agreed to, or by a court decision which has become final, shall alter the redemption price.

APPEALS BY THE STATE \u00a7 101. Appeals by the State in criminal cases An appeal may be taken by the State from a lower court to an appellate court in the following instances: Appeal as of right. The State shall have an absolute right to appeal to an appellate court a final order of a lower court where the order constitutes a dismissal of an indictment or information or any count thereof or the granting of any motion vacating any verdict or judgment of conviction where the order of the lower court is based upon the invalidity or con- struction of the statute upon which the indictment or informa- tion is founded or where the order is based on the lack of juris- diction of the lower court over the person or subject matter. Appeal in the discretion of the appellate court. The State may apply to the appellate court to permit an appeal to determine a substantial question of law or procedure, and the appellate court may permit the appeal in its absolute discretion. The appellate court shall have the power to adopt rules govern- ing the allowance of such an appeal; but, in no event shall the decision or result of the appeal affect the rights of the defend- and and he shall not be obligated to defend the appeal, but the Court may require the Public Defender of the State of Delaware to defend the appeal and to argue the cause ; provided, how- ever, that if the order appealed from is an order suppressing or Chapter 133 225 excluding substantial and material evidence the Court may per- mit an interlocutory appeal of any pretrial order, and if the order suppressing such evidence is reversed, the defendant may be subjected to a trial. (3) The appeal or application for appeal shall be filed with the appellate court within 60 days from entry of the order ap- pealed from. \u00a7 103. Definitions relating to section 101 As used in section 101 of this subchapter : \"Appellate court\" means a court of this State having direct appellate jurisdiction over a lower court. \"Lower court\" means any court of this State over which an appellate court of this State has direct appellate juris- diction. The Superior Court is a lower court for the purposes of an appeal to the Supreme Court whether the action of the Su- perior Court which is subject to review by the Supreme Court is action resulting from the original jurisdiction of that court in a trial de novo in a proceeding initiated there or initated in a lower court, or action resulting from a review of action of a lower court under section 101 or any other provision permitting appellate review in the Superior Court. \"Order\" includes any judgment, order, ruling, deci- sion, memorandum, opinion, or equivalent entry of the lower court which constitutes a fixed determination by the lower court.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Dela- ware (three-fourths of all members elected to each House con- curring therein): Section 1. \u00a7 706, Title 18, Delaware Code, is amended by striking said section in its entirety and inserting a new \u00a7 706 to read as follows : \u00a7 706. Statements by the insurance companies; distribution of the proceeds of the special tax on insurance companies covering the risk of loss by fire (a) Every insurance company covering the risk of loss by fire on any real or personal property within this State and/or on motor vehicles, aircraft (as defined by section 102 of Title 2) marine vessels, ships or boats registered or licensed in this State shall annually at the same time that such company files its annual report as required by law, deliver to the Insurance Com- missioner a full detailed statement of the amount of gross pre- miums of all business done by such company in the City of Wil- mington; in the County of New Castle, outside the City of Wil- mington; in Kent County ; and in Sussex County; for the year ending on the previous thirty-first day of December.

In accordance with the terms set forth in this subchapter in \u00a7 1212 through and including \u00a71220, the State of Delaware does- provide for entering into Interstate Agreements on Educational Personnel. Such agreements, properly entered into by the designated State officials, shall be considered as a contract between the State of Delaware and such other states with all jurisdiction legally joining therein in the form set forth in the afore-mentioned sections. 471 472 Chapter 155 \u00a7 1211. Designated state official and official copies of contract The \"designated state official\" for the State shall be the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The State Super- intendent of Public Instruction shall enter into contracts pur- suant to this subchapter only with the approval of the State Board of Education. True copies of all contracts made on be- half of this State pursuant to the agreement set forth herein, shall be placed on file in the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Delaware, in the Office of the Secretary of State in Delaware, and in the office of the Chief State School Officer in such other state as is party to the contract. Reference to the existence of such contracts, including at least a list of states involved and the teaching fields or certificates referred to in each state, shall be published regularly in such certification manuals as may from time to time be published by the State Board of Education. \u00a7 1212. Interstate agreement, Article Ipurpose, findings and policy The States party to this Agreement, desiring by com- mon action to improve their respective school systems by utiliz- ing the teacher or other professional educational person wher- ever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of edu- cation, and of the teaching profession. It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the States party to it, and to authorize specific interstate edu- cational personnel contracts to achieve that end. The party States find that included in the large move- ment of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their profes- sional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from State to State in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps Chapter 155 473 necessary to qualify in other states. As a consequence, a sig- nificant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employ- ment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational re- sources. Participation in this Compact can increase the availa- bility of educational manpower. \u00a7 1213. Interstate agreement, Article IIdefinitions As used in this Agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise : \"Educational personnel\" means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to State law as a condition of employ- ment in educational programs. \"Designated State Official\" means the education official of a State selected by that State to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of his State, contracts pursuant to this Agreement. \"Accept\", or any variant thereof, means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another State re- lating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving State. \"State\" means a State, territory, or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia ; or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. \"Originating State\" means a State (and the subdivision thereof, if any) whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to \u00a7 1214 (Article III). \"Receiving State\" means a State (and the subdivisions thereof) which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III. \u00a7 1214. Interstate agreement, Article IIIinterstate education- al personnel contracts 1. The designated State official of a party State may make 474 Chapter 155 one or more contracts on behalf of his State with one or more other party States providing for the acceptance of educational personnel. Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the States whose designated state officials enter into it, and the subdivisions of those States, with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this Agree- ment. A designated State official may enter into a contract pursuant to this Article only with States in which he finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or quali- fication of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently com- parable, even though not identical to that prevailing in his own State. 2. Any such contract shall provide for: Its duration. The criteria to be applied by an originating State in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving State. Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional accept- ances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract with- out sacrifice of basic educational standards. Any other necessary matters. 3. No contract made pursuant to this Agreement shall be for a term longer than five years but any such contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods. 4. Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which orig- nating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred. No contract made pursuant to this Agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving State of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954. 5. The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has ex- pired or been terminated. However, any certificate or other qual- Chapter 155 475 ifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a cer- tificate or other qualifying document initially granted or ap- proved in the receiving State. 6. A contract committee composed of the designated State officials of the contracting States or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of im- proving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting States. \u00a7 1215. Interstate agreement, Article IVapproved and ac- cepted programs Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party State re- lating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that State. To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this Agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract. \u00a7 1216. Interstate agreement, Article Vinterstate cooperation The party States agree that : They will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multi-lateral contracts pursuant to Article HI of this Agree- ment. They will facilitate and strengthen cooperation in inter- state certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification and for this purpose shall cooperate with agencies, organizations, and associations interested in certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification. \u00a7 1217.

Thereafter it shall become effective as to any State upon its enactment of this Agreement. Any party State may withdraw from this Agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such with- drawal shall take effect until one year after the Governor of the withdrawing State has given notice in writing of the with- drawal to the Governors of all other party States. No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing State of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party. The duration of contracts and the methods and condi- tions of withdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms. \u00a7 1220. Interstate agreement, Article IXconstruction and severability This Agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effec- tuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provi- sion of this Agreement is declared to be contrary to the con- stitution of any State or of the United States, or the applica- tion thereof to any Government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Agreement and the applicability thereof to any Government, agency, per- son, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any State participating therein, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

The decision of the City Council in such cases shall be conclusive. It is the intention of this Charter that, in the perform- ance of his duties and in the exercise of his powers, the City Manager shall not be influenced by any matters whatsoever of a political or factional nature.

To that end, neither the City Council nor any of its committees nor members thereof shall direct or request that appointment of any person to, or his re- moval from, any office by the City Manager or any of his subor- dinates, nor, in any manner, take part in the appointment re- moval of the employees in the administrative service of the affairs of the City under the charge of the City Manager. Ex- cept for purposes of inquiry, the City Council shall deal with that portion of the administrative service for which the City Manager is responsible solely through the City Manager. It shall be the duty of the City Manager to supervise the administration of the affairs of the City under his charge Chapter 170 521 and to make such reports to the City Council as are required by the City Council.

In conjunction with the Mayor of The City of Lewes, he shall sign warrants pursuant to appropriations or resolutions theretofore made by the City Council. He shall prepare and sub- mit to the City Council such reports as may be required by that body. He shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by this Charter or required of him by ordinance or resolution of the City Council. The City Manager and such other officers of the City as may be designated by vote of the City Council shall be en- titled to seats in the meetings of the City Council but shall have no vote therein. The City Manager shall have charge and supervision of streets, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, boardwalks, jetties, piers, parks and other administrative affairs of the City and of all work relating thereto. He shall have charge of and shall collect all taxes, assessments, rentals, license fees, or other charges due the City. He shall have charge of the administration of all pro- visions of this Charter and ordinances and resolutions of the City Council relating to the affairs of the City, when not other- wise provided for by this Charter, or by any ordinance or reso- lution of the City Council. He shall pay over to the City Treas- urer, at least monthly, as hereinbefore provided, and oftener if required by the City Council, all monies received or collected by him and by any employee under him. He shall keep a full and strict account of all monies received and all disbursements by him and such account shall, at all times, be open to inspection by the City Council. (1) He shall give The City of Lewes a Bond, if required 522 Chapter 110 by the City Council, in such sum and in form and with security satisfactory to that body for the faithful performance of the duties of his office and the restoration to The City of Lewes, in case of his death, resignation or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in his possession belonging to the City. (m) In the event of a vacancy in the office of City Man- ager for any reason or reasons whatsoever, the duly appointed and qualified successor to that office shall succeed to all the rights, privileges and powers theretofore reposed in his prede- cessor or predecessors in office in the same manner as though all acts, deeds and steps theretofore taken by any such prede- cessor or predecessors with respect to any matter or thing per- taining to said office had been taken or performed by the suc- cessor to such office.

(a) A remedy by distress as now prescribed by law is hereby preserved to the City Manager for the collection of any taxes, assessments, license fees, warrants, rentals or other charges for which he may be responsible. At any time after the delivery of the duplicate annual tax list or duplicate scrap sewer assessment list or warrant or any other .list of charges due The City of Lewes, the City Mana- ger may institute suit in the name of The City of Lewes before any Justice of the Peace or Court of the State of Delaware, in any of the Counties of the State, for the recovery of the unpaid tax, assessment, license fee, rental or other charge, in any action of debt, and upon judgment obtained, may issue Writs of Exe- cution as in case of other judgments recovered before a Justice of the Peace. The said execution shall constitute a lien upon all the personal property of the taxable within the County where the judgment shall have been obtained, which by virtue of such execution shall be levied upon within thirty (30) days after the issuance thereof, and such lien shall have priority over all other liens against said personal property created or suffered by the taxable, except such liens thereon which may have been created in respect to County Taxes, although such other liens be of date prior to the time of the attachment of the said tax liens. Any time after the delivery of any such duplicate an- nual tax list, assessment list, or warrant, or other lists contain- ing charge due the City, the City Manager may notify, in writ- ing, the person, firm or corporation by whom any taxable is em- ployed that the tax, assessment, license fee, warrant, rental or other charge of said employee is due and unpaid. The notice shall be signed by the City Manager and shall contain the cor- rect name of the taxable as it appears upon any such list, the amount of the tax, assessment, rental or other charge due with 544 Chapter 170 penalties and interest added, if any. Thereupon it shall be the duty of the employer to take from the wage, salary or other money then due the taxable, the amount of the tax, assessment, license fee, warrant, rental or other charge, together with pen- alties and interest added, if any owing, from the employee, and charge the same against him, and to pay the same to the Treas- urer within ten (10) days. The City Manager shall give to the employer a certificate of payment which shall be allowed in any suit or accounting between the employer and taxable. If the employer be notified as aforesaid and, having in his hands money belonging to the taxable, shall neglect or refuse to comply with the provisions hereof, such employer shall become personally liable for the amount of the tax, assessment, license fee, war- rant, or other charges, together with penalties and interest due thereon, if any, of the persons as to whom notice was given, and the amount thereof may be recovered from such employer in an action of debt before any Justice of the Peace, or Court of State of Delaware, as aforesaid. This process shall be deemed to be in the nature of a garnishment proceeding. (e) The City Manager may make a complaint under oath before any Justice of the Peace, that the tax of any taxable is due and unpaid and that he has been unable to make collection of the tax, assessment, license fee; warrant, rental or other charge by any of the methods for the recovery of taxes pre- scribed by this Charter, and thereupon a warrant shall be is- sued for the arrest of such taxable and if, after hearing it shall be found that the tax, assessment, license fee, warrant, rental or other charge, of the person arrested is due and unpaid, and if the taxable shall thereon fail to pay the tax, assessment, license fee, warrant, rental or other charge, together with accrued costs, he shall be committed to the jail of Sussex County, or City lock- up until the tax, assessment, license fee, warrant, rental, pen- alty, cost and charges are paid, but, in no event shall the term of his imprisonment exceed thirty (30) days. (f) For the purpose of collecting the tax, assessment, license fee, warrant, rent or any other charge due the City from any taxable, and without the necessity of first employing the other remedies herein provided the Treasurer is empowered to sell the lands and tenements of the taxable or the improvements Chapter 170 545 of a taxable located on land under a valid lease for a term of at least ten years which said lease is recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds, in and for Sussex County, or the lands and tenements of a taxable, alienated, subsequent to the levy of the tax, assessment, license fee, warrant, rent or other charge.

If the owner is dissatisfied with the amount of compensation or damages allowed by the City as aforesaid, said property owner may, within ten (10) days after such notice as aforesaid was posted or mailed, appeal from the written notice of assessment or com- pensation or damages by serving written notice by registered mail with return receipt requested upon the Mayor of the City to the effect that he or she is dissatisfied with the amount of said compensation or damages, and it is his or her intention to make written application to one of the Judges of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Sussex County for the ap- pointment of a Commission to hear and determine the matter in controversy; and in order to prosecute said appeal, such owner shall within fifteen (15) days after serving said notice upon the Mayor as aforesaid, make written application to said Judge of the Superior Court of this State who is that time resident of Sussex County for the appointment of such a commission ; and thereupon the said Judge shall issue and appoint a Commission directed to five (5) freeholders of the said County, three (3) of whom shall be residents of The City of Lewes, and two of whom shall be non-residents of said City, demanding them to assess the damages which the owner of the real estate through or over which the said street, lane or alley shall pass, and who shall have notified the said City Council of their intention to appeal, may incur by reason thereof, and to make return of their proceeding to the said Judge at the time therein appointed. (e) The freeholders named in such Commission, being first duly sworn or affirmed, shall view the premises and may, or a majority of them, shall assess the damages aforesaid, and shall make return, in writing of their proceedings to the said Judge who shall deliver and return to the City Council, which shall be final and conclusive. The said Judge shall have the power to fill 654 Chapter 170 any vacancy in the Commission. The amount of damages being so ascertained, the City Council may pay or tender the same to the person or persons entitled thereto within thirty (30) days after the same shall be finally ascertained, or if the person or persons so entitled reside out of, or are absent from the City during the said period of thirty (30) days, then same shall be deposited to his or her credit in the Farmers Bank of the State of Delaware with offices in Georgetown, Sussex County, Dela- ware, within said time, and thereupon the said property of lands may be taken or occupied for the uses aforesaid. If the ascertainment and assessment of damages by the freeholders appointed by the Judge as aforesaid shall be in- creased, the cost of the appeal shall be paid by the City out of any money in the hands of the Treasurer belonging to the City; but if said damages shall not be increased, the cost of the appeal shall be paid by the party appealing. The said freeholder mem- bers of the Commission shall receive and be allowed for each day's actual service or of any part of a day the sum of Five Dol- lars ($5.00). After the damages shall be fixed and ascertained by the freeholders, the City Council shall have the option to pay the damages assessed within the time aforesaid and to proceed with the said improvements, or, upon the payment of the costs only, may abandon the proposed improvements. In the event that the City Council feels that the dam- ages assessed are not just as being excessive, it may then appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. If the owner of the property feels that the damages awarded are inadequate, such owner may appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. CURBING AND PAVING Section 35.

SUBCHAPTER III. SELF-INSURANCE \u00a7 6530. Placement of self-insurance When the Committee shall determine and declare it to be advisable to insure against a certain risk or risks through a self-insurance program, no such program being in existence as of the date of the enactment of this statute, then as to such risk or risks there shall be established a State Self-Insurance Fund, hereinafter in this Chapter referred to as The Fund, which Fund shall be established pursuant to the hereinafter provided for schedule and through which Fund said risk or risks shall be insured for each year thereafter until the contrary is deter- mined and declared to be advisable by the Committee or by sub- sequent Legislation. \u00a7 6531. Capitalization of the State Self-Insurance Fund (1) The Fund shall be capitalized according to the follow- ing schedule: Transfer from Fire and Storm Damage Contingency Fund of money theretofore allocated for payment of deductibles. Such amount of money as is at the time of the establishment of The Fund then on the books of the Budget Commission as the Fire and Storm Damage Contingency Fund shall thereupon be transferred to The Fund. Permiums to be allocated as to Property Insurance risks to be covered by The Fund. As to all real and personal property loss risks to be insured by The Fund, an annual premium shall be paid to The Fund for each fiscal year in such amount as the Committee shall deter- 630 Chapter 187 mine and declare to be appropriate, but not to exceed .0008 of the replacement value of such property in any one year or the then existing commercially approved rates for such coverage in any particular year, whichever shall be greater ; Premiums to be allocated as to Workmen's Compensa- tion risks to be covered by The Fund. As to all workmen's compensation loss risks to be insured by The Fund, an annual premium shall be paid to The Fund for each fiscal year in such amount as the Committee shall deter- mine and declare to be appropriate, but not to exceed .002 of the gross annual payroll of the employees so covered or the then existing commercially approved rates for such coverage in any particular year, whichever shall be the greater; Premiums to be allocated as to Fidelity Bonds for State officials or employees to be covered by The Fund. As to all Fidelity Bonds for State officials to be covered by The Fund, an annual premium shall be paid to The Fund for each fiscal year in such amount as the Committee shall deter- mine and declare to be appropriate, but not to exceed .005 of the face value of the Bonds thus covered or the then existing commercially approved rates for such coverage in any particu- lar year, whichever shall be the greater; Premiums to be Allocated as to all other risks covered by The Fund, not specifically referred to in subsections (a) through (d) above. As to all other insurable risks to be covered by The Fund, not specifically referred to in subsections (a) through (d) above, an annual premium shall be paid to The Fund for each fiscal year in such amount as the Committee shall determine and de- clare to be appropriate, but not to exceed the then existing com- mercially approved rates for such coverage in any particular year. (2) Payment of Premium Allocations The gross premium allocation, provided for in subsection (1) above, shall be determined by the Committee for each fiscal year and made a part of the budget request of the Insurance Depart- ment as submitted by the Insurance Commissioner for the fiscal year, and upon approval by the General Assembly in the An- Chapter 187 631 nual Budget, shall be paid to The Fund by the State Treasurer. However, in starting the self-insurance program as to any par- ticular risk, the Committee may direct that the funds theretofor allocated for the payment of commercial insurance premiums for commercial policies covering such risk or risks shall be paid into The Fund as the initial premium for such self-insurance coverage, and upon such direction, as communicated to the State Treasurer by the Insurance Commissioner, the State Treasurer shall so reallocate such specified sum to The Fund. Maximum Level of Effective Capitalization and Termi- nation of Premium Payments upon Reaching Same. The aforesaid premium allocations to The Fund shall con- tinue to be allocated and paid to The Fund until such time as the effective uncommitted gross capitalization of The Fund, when in- vested as hereinafter provided for, shall produce in each year sufficient income to pay the average annual claims made upon The Fund for the risks therein insured as computed upon the record of such claims over the preceding five years, at which point no further premiums will be allocated or paid ; but at such time as the effective uncommitted gross capitalization of The Fund shall fall below such desired level and shall no longer pro- duce sufficient income, because of increased claims or increased coverage or both, to pay the average annuals claims computed as aforesaid, then in that event and at that time the said premium allocations to The Fund shall once again be allocated and paid to The Fund until the aforesaid desired level of capitalization is once again obtained, and such allocations and payments of premiums shall be effected from time to time as the demands upon The Fund shall require. Emergency Back-Up Fund In the event that the Committee determines and declares its intention to embark upon a self-insurance program, as here- in provided for, within two years of the passage of this act, then and in that event there shall be. set aside in the Capital Investment Fund the sum of One Million ($1,000,000.00) Dol- lars, which sum shall remain in the Capital Investment Fund and subject to the administration and control of the Budget Director unless and until it shall be necessary to draw upon same to pay any claim or claims upon the aforesaid State Self- Insurance Fund which exceed the gross effective uncommitted 632 Chapter 187 capitalization of said Fund, at which time such funds as shall be necessary to pay such excess claim or claims up to, but not ex- ceeding, One Million ($1,000,000.00) Dollars, shall be paid from the Capital Investment Fund to the State Self-Insurance Fund upon direction of the Committee. However, as the gross effective uncommitted capitalization of the State Self-Insurance Fund shall have reached the level of One Million ($1,000,000.00) Dollars, then at that time Five Hundred Thousand ($500,000.00) Dollars of the aforesaid committed One Million $1,000,000.00) Dollars of Capital Investment Fund shall be released from this commitment, and at the time that the gross effective uncom- mitted capitalization of the State Self-Insurance Fund shall have reached the level of Two Million ($2,000,000.00) Dollars, then at that time the remaining Five Hundred Thousand ($500,- 000.00) Dollars of the aforesaid committed One Million ($1,000,- 000.00) Dollars of the Capital Investment Fund shall be re- leased from this commitment, unless same shall have been pre- viously expended, as aforesaid, to pay excess claims upon the State Self-Insurance Fund, in which case same shall be repaid to the said Capital Investment Fund according to such schedule as the Committee shall deem appropriate and feasible and not injurious to the operation of the Self-Insurance program. \u00a7 6532.

All income from such investments shall be continued in The Fund to pay the obligations of The Fund and provide for its growth. \u00a7 6534. Provisions for deductible limits The Committee, from time to time, may declare and enforce such deductible limits on any insured risk covering loss to State owned property, both real, personal and mixed, as it shall deem appropriate. \u00a7 6535. Provisions for reinsurance The Committee, from time to time, may determine the ad- visability of purchasing commercial reinsurance contracts as to any risk or risks covered by The Fund and direct the Cov- erage Office to place such insurance, in such amount as the Com- mittee shall have determined to be most feasible, in the manner herein provided for the placement of other commercial insur- ance coverage. \u00a7 6536. Adjusting claims and paying losses The Coverage Office shall have the responsibility of adjust- ing all claims and paying all losses in risks covered by The Fund, and shall carry out its duties in conformity with appropriate regulations promulgated for that purpose by the Insurance Commissioner, which regulations shall be in general conformity with the accepted practice in the commercial insurance indus- try in such matters, and shall be calculated to provide for prompt, efficient and equitable settlement procedures. The Cov- erage Office shall keep such records and files as shall be neces- sary and proper in its fulfillment of this obligation. \u00a7 6537. Arbitration of disputes and litigation of claims (1) Any dispute between the Coverage Office and a State Agency claimant, which cannot be amicably resolved, shall be referred to arbitration before an arbitrator selected by the Sec- 634 Chapter 187 retary of State. The expense of such arbitration will be borne by the disputants equally. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the disputants.

Inspections of insured property The Coverage Office shall have available to it the services of the State Fire Marshal and his deputies for the purpose of inspecting self-insured real and personal property of the State and may call upon the Fire Marshal and his deputies to con- duct such inspections of such property as are reasonable and necessary to determine the risk involved in insuring same and to provide the basis for requests, or suggestions as to how un- desirable hazards may be corrected ; and the Fire Marshal and his deputies shall cooperate with the Coverage Office in this re- gard, conducting such investigations as are requested and re- porting the results thereof to the Coverage Office together with such recommendations as the investigator shall deem to be ap- propriate. All State agencies, officials and employees will render full cooperation to the Fire Marshal and the Coverage Office in these matters and shall promptly correct such hazards as are found to exist, and failure to do so shall be referred to the Gov- ernor by the Coverage Office for such remedial executive action as he shall deem appropriate. \u00a7 6539.

(1) The amount of the surety bond to be required of any nonresident engaged in construction contracting in this State as a contractor or subcontractor shall be as follows: Three per cent of the contract or subcontract price on all contracts of $50,000 or more, or three per cent of contractor's or subcontractor's estimated cost-and-profit under a cost-plus contract of $50,000 or more. When the aggregate of two or more contracts in one calendar year is $50,000 or more, the amount of the bond or Chapter 194 659 bonds shall be three per cent of the aggregate amount of such contracts. Such surety bond shall be filed within 15 days after the commencement of business in this State by said nonresident; except that as to a nonresident engaged in construction contract- ing, such bond shall be filed within 15 days after construction is begun in this State by such contractor or subcontractor on any contract, the price of which is $50,000 or more (or the esti- mated cost-and-profit of which is $50,000 or more), or within 15 days after construction is begun on any contract for less than $50,000 when the amount of such contract, when aggregated with any other contracts on which construction was begun in the same calendar year, equals or exceeds $50,000.

Absence from the Municipality for a period of 12 months shall be prima fade evidence of abandonment of domicile in the Municipality. The burden of establishing legal domicile within the Municipality shall be upon the claimant. \"Tax year\" means the calendar year in which the municipal real estate tax is due and payable. \"Family\" means husband and wife ; a man and woman co- habitating as husband and wife in a home in which there are also children in esse or en ventre sa mere, of either or both ; parent and child ; guardian and ward and also any group or per- sons residing together in one home under one head who are related by blood or marriage. \u00a7 1002.

Application for exemption No exemption from taxation on the valuation of real prop- erty as provided in this chapter, shall be allowed except upon written application therefor, which application shall be on the form prescribed by the Receiver of Taxes and County Treas- urer and provided for the use of claimants under Section 8133 of Title 9, Delaware Code. A copy of each application filed with the assessor of a county taxing district pursuant to Section 8133, Chapter 81, Title 9, Delaware Code, shall be furnished by said assessor to the municipal taxing official of any Municipal- ity in which real property, which is the subject of such applica- tion, is located and shall be deemed an application for exemp- tion under this chapter.

Continuance of exemption A claim having been filed with and allowed by the municipal taxing official shall continue in force from year to year there- after without the necessity for further claim as long as the claimant shall be entitled to exemption under this chapter, but the climant shall be required yearly to establish his income and the municipal taxing official may at any time require the filing of a new application or such proof as he shall deem necessary to establish the right of the claimant to continuance of the ex- emption. It shall be the duty of every claimant to inform the municipal taxing official of any change in his status or property which may affect his right to continuance of the exemption. \u00a7 1007. Tenants in common or joint tenants (a) Where title to property on which an exemption is claimed is held by claimant and another or others, either as Chapter 195 663 tenants in common or as joint tenants, claimant shall not be allowed an exemption against his interest in said property in excess of the assessed valuation of his proportionate share in said property, which proportionate share, for the purposes of this chapter, shall be deemed to be equal to that of each of the other tenants, unless it is shown that the interests in ques- tion are not equal, in which event claimant's proportionate share shall be as shown. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude more than one tenant, whether title be held in common or joint tenancy, from claiming exemption against the property so held, but no more than the equivalent of one full exemption in regard to such property shall be allowed in any year, and in any case in which the claimants cannot agree as to the apportionment thereof, the exemption shall be apportioned between or among them in pro- portion to their interest. Property held by husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety, shall be deemed wholly owned by each tenant, but not more than one exemption in regard to such property shall be allowed in any year. Right to claim exemption under this chapter shall ex- tend to property the title to which is held by a partnership to the extent of the claimant's interest as a partner therein, and by a guardian, trustee, committee, conservator or other fiduci- ary for any person who would otherwise be entitled to claim exemption under this chapter, but not to property the title to which is held by a corporation. \u00a7 1008.

Procedure for determining the amount of a fine upon considering the defendant's gain from the crime or the physical or personal damage resulting therefrom; remittance of fine to victim of crime Order Directing A Hearing In any case where the court or justice of the peace is of the opinion that the sentence should consist of or include a fine and that the defendant's gain from the commission of the offense and/or the loss or physical damage or injury resulting from the commission of the offense should be considered in assessing the amount of the fine to be imposed, the court or justice of the peace may order a hearing upon notice to the defendant and the Attorney General to determine the amount thereof. Conduct of Hearing to Fix Fine (1) At any hearing held pursuant to this section the bur- den of proof shall be upon the State. A finding as to the amount of the defendant's gain and/or the loss or physical damage or injury resulting from the commission of the crime must be based upon a preponderance of the credible evidence. Any rele- vant evidence, not legally privileged, may be received regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence, Chapter 198 667 (2) Following the hearing the court or justice of the peace shall determine the amount of the defendant's gain and/or the amount of the loss or physical damage or personal injury result- ing from the commission of the offense, make written findings of fact, and impose a fine based upon such finding. The court or jus- tice of the peace may impose such fine in lieu of a fine prescribed by statute. (c) Remittance of Fine Any fine imposed and collected under this section shall be remitted to the person or persons who suffered the loss and/or physical or personal damage, or both, up to an amount sufficient to compensate the person or persons for such loss or physical damage as determined by the court or justice of the peace. Re- mittance shall be made in the manner and under the terms and conditions set by the court or justice of the peace. Imposition of the said fine may constitute the entry of a civil judgment against defendant if the court or justice of the peace so orders. Section 2. Chapter 41, Title 11, Delaware Code, is amend- ed by adding a new \u00a7 4105 to read as follows : \u00a7 4105. Fines and costs; how collected (a) When a court or justice of the peace imposes a fine and/or costs upon a defendant, the court or justice of the peace may direct as follows : That the defendant pay the entire amount at the time sentence is imposed ; or That the defendant pay a specified portion of the fine and/or costs at designated periodic intervals, and in such case may direct that the fine and/or costs be remitted to a probation officer who shall report to the court or justice of the peace at such periods as the court or justice of the peace may direct, any failure to comply with the order ; Where the defendant is sentenced to a period of pro- bation as well as a fine and/or costs, that payment of the fine and/or costs shall be a condition of the probation. (b) Any court or justice of the peace may in its discretion permit any person sentenced to pay a fine upon conviction of 668 Chapter 198 crime to elect, in lieu of the payment of the fine ordered, to ex- ecute a bond acknowledging the amount of the fine imposed upon him as a debt due and owing to the State of Delaware and bind- ing himself unto the State in an amount equal to ten times the fine imposed. The bond shall be so conditioned that, should the amount of the fine imposed be paid to the State of Delaware on or before the tenth day next following the day on which the fine is imposed, then in that event the bond shall be null and void. The bond shall contain a warrant of attorney authorizing the prothonotary or any attorney of record in the State of Dela- ware or elsewhere to appear in any court or before any justice of the peace and confess judgment against the person so bound. Upon execution of the said bond, the convicted person shall be required to endorse on the reverse thereof a list of all motor vehicles and any other personal or real property owned by him or in which he has any title or interest with a description and the location thereof. Any court or justice of the peace may in its discretion permit any person sentenced to pay a fine upon conviction of a crime who is employed within the State of Delaware or by a Delaware resident or employer, to elect to execute an assign- ment of a specified periodic sum not to exceed one-third of his total earnings, which assignment shall direct his employer to withhold and remit that amount to the State up to the total of the fine and costs imposed. For purposes of ensuring the payment of fines and the enforcement of any orders imposed under this section, the court or justice of the peace shall retain jurisdiction over the convicted person until any fine imposed shall have been paid in full.

It shall be the duty of the Mayor to keep a book of record or docket in which all judicial proceedings before him shall be entered, and he shall upon the expiration of his term of office deliver over to his successor such book of record or docket within ten days after the election and qualification of such successor. Prosecution before the Mayor shall be by information without indictment by Grand Jury or trial by Petit Jury. Process issued by the Mayor may be directed to any County constable or to the sheriff of any County who shall execute the same in like manner, and be subject to the same penalties as in other cases. Appeals of any verdict by the Mayor must be directed to the Superior Court of the State of Delaware. If the Mayor elects not to serve in the capacity of Justice of the Peace, he may appoint an Alderman, or Aldermen, to serve in this capacity, subject to approval of four members of Coun- cil. Said Alderman, or Aldermen, may be removed from office by the Mayor subject to approval of four members of Council.

In case of necessity, he may command the aid of any citizen or citizens. (c) At the time of employment of any new permanent em- ployee, the Mayor and Council shall adopt a resolution estab- lishing the period of service required for that employee to gain tenure in his position of employment. Employees of the City at the enactment of this Charter shall be deemed to have such ten- ure. Upon the completion of such period of service, the employee shall have tenure and shall not be dismissed except upon the approval of the Mayor and four members of Council, or upon approval of five members of Council without the Mayor, after a hearing at any regular or special meeting of the Mayor and Council, at which meeting the employee may be present and be represented by counsel.

The Mayor shall have authority of suspension over all employees appointed by him, the Councilmen appointed to head the various City departments shall have such authority over the employees of their Departments, and the Treasurer shall have such au- thority over all clerical employees. The official having the au- thority to suspend employees as heretofore set out shall have the power to make such suspension with or without pay at their discretion, but if the employee is not dismissed after the hearing as above provided he shall receive any back-pay he might have been denied during a period of suspension. 702 Chapter 209 (d) In addition to the authority as heretofore provided, the Mayor shall also have authority to appoint an Assessor at the first meeting in January of each year, subject to the approval of four members of Council, who shall be a legally qualified voter of said City, and who shall before entering upon the duties of his office be duly qualified by oath or affirmation to perform the duties of his office to the best of his knowledge, and without favor or partiality. The said assessor shall on or before the second Tuesday in May make a true, just and impartial valua- tion and assessment of all the real estate within said City, lo- cating each parcel of real property by the street and square, and also an assessment of all the residents in said City above the age of twenty-one years, as well those owning as those not owning real property within said City. The said assessor shall on the second Tuesday in May deliver to the Council a typewritten copy containing the names of all persons assessed and the amount of their assessments, distinguishing the real and personal assess- ment of each, and shall upon the said second Tuesday in May hang a typewritten duplicate of such assessment in the postoffice, or such other place as the Council, shall, by ordinance, designate, there to remain for the space of two weeks for public informa- tion. And the said Council shall on the fourth Tuesday in May hold a court of appeals which shall continue open from seven o'clock P.M. until nine o'clock, P.M., when it shall hear and de- termine appeals from said assessment. Notice of the hanging up of the assessment list and also of the time and place of hear- ing appeals shall be given by notices posted by the assessor in at least five public places in said city. The decision of the Council upon any appeal shall be final and conclusive. No member of Council shall sit upon his or her own appeal, but the same shall be heard and determined by the others.

Section 12. (a) The regular meetings of the Council shall be held on the second Monday of each month. At the first regular meeting in April the Council shall choose a Secretary who may be removed at any time for any cause deemed sufficient by a Chapter 209, 703 majority of said Council. It shall be the duty of the said Secre- tary to record all the proceedings of Council and keep a correct journal of the same in a book or books, to be provided for that purpose and also the papers relative and belonging to said City, all of which are to be carefully preserved and delivered to his successor in office. His compensation shall be fixed by the Council. No ordinance, except in cases of emergency, shall be passed by the Council except at a regular meeting and unless such ordinance has been introduced at some previous regular meeting and copies of the proposed ordinance posted in three public places in said City at least ten days before final action of the Council thereon. (b) The said Council after having ascertained the sum necessary to be raised and having apportioned the same on the assessment and valuation aforesaid, shall on the first day of July of each year, furnish the Treasurer of said City, who shall be the collector of taxes for said City with a duplicate containing the names of the taxables, as well as the owners of real estate, as those not owning real estate, distinguishing between them, and also the tax levied on each person and also the tax on the whole valuation and assessment at the rate per hundred dollars. The said duplicate shall have a warrant annexed thereto and shall be signed by the Mayor and a majority of the members of the Council. All taxes shall be paid at the Town Hall during the regular business hours. On all taxes paid before the first day of October, there shall be an abatement of five per centum; on all taxes paid after the first day of October and before the first day of January, there shall be no abatement; and on all taxes paid after the first day of January, there shall be added interest at the rate of one per cent per month until payment is made. The Treasurer shall apply all monies received by him on account of taxes in payment of the oldest taxes due. The salary of the said Treasurer shall be established by resolution of the Mayor and Council. If any person is taxed for several parcels of real estate, or for capitation and real estate in the same tax, the whole of such person's taxes may be collected either out of the real estate, or any part thereof; provided that no land alienated shall be sold, if the person taxed has other sufficient property. 704 Chapter 209 (c) The Treasurer may recover the amount of tax in an action of debt against the person taxed, before an Alderman appointed under this Charter, any Justice of the Peace in New Castle County, or before the Court of Common Pleas or Superior Court of New Castle County; and it shall be sufficient to set forth that the action is to recover a specified sum of money, being a tax or taxes assessed against the defendant, and the time of assessing the same. The right of appeal shall be the same as in other civil action. If judgment be rendered in favor of the Treasurer, the Mayor and Council shall have an allowance for the additional expense in attending to the suit, including counsel fees, and the amount of taxes plus accrued interest, to be taxed by the Court in the costs, and execution shall issue against the real estate of the defendant; provided no execution against the real estate shall issue except out of the Superior Court of New Castle County. Where such judgment is recovered before an Alderman, Justice of the Peace, or Court of Common Pleas, and it is the desire of the Treasurer to proceed against the real estate of the defendant, the said Treasurer shall take a tran- script of the judgment from the Alderman, Justice of the Peace, or Court of Common Pleas and cause the same to be entered on the dockets of the Superior Court. When such transcripts are entered the subsequent proceedings shall be the same as upon other judgments. The lien of the judgment as aforesaid shall be deemed to relate back and take effect from the date of the Treas- urer's duplicate as aforesaid. (d) That in addition to all existing methods and authority for the collection of taxes or special assessments due to \"The Mayor and Council of Delaware City\", the following methods and authority are hereby established: \"The Mayor and Council of Delaware City\" may file, or cause to be filed a Praecipe in the office of the Prothonotary of the Superior Court, in and for New Castle County, which shall contain the name of the person against whom the taxes or as- sesments sought to be collected were assessed, and a copy of the bills showing the amount of taxes or assessment due and the property against which the assessment was laid ; and the state- ment of the lot number or numbers of the particular section in which said property is located shall be sufficient identification Chapter 209 705- and description of the said property.

The Council shall have the power upon the application of five or more citizens of said City, being seized of estates of freehold situate in said City, by petition to it for that purpose, to locate, lay out, or open any street or alley which said five or more freeholders of said City may desire to be located, laid out and opened, allowing to the persons, respectively, through or over whose ground such street or alley may run, such com- pensations or damages therefor as it shall deem reasonable and just under all the circumstances, which compensation, if any be allowed, shall be paid by the Treasurer of said City, out of the monies of said City on warrants drawn on him by the proper authority. Whenever the Council shall have proceeded to locate and lay out any street or alley and shall have fixed the compensation therefor, it shall be its duty immediately after the survey and location of said street or alley to notify in writing the owner or owners of the real estate, through or over which such street or alley may run, of its determination to open the same, and to furnish a general description of the location thereof, and also the amount of such damages or compensation allowed to each.

In order to prosecute said appeal, it shall be the duty of said Council to make application to the Resident Judge of New Castle County, who shall appoint five impartial freeholders of said County. The said freeholders shall view the grounds to be so taken or occupied, and taking into consideration the advantages, as well as the disadvantages which may arise to the property, they or a majority of them, shall assess the damage which might be done to the said prop- erty, and return the same, under oath or affirmation, to the Council, which shall cause such return to be entered on its jour- nal and upon the payment or tender of the said assessed dama- ges to the owner or owners of the property, the said property may be taken or occupied.

Provided, that the foregoing provisions shall not apply to theatricals or other entertainments gotten up by the citizens of said City, or to any farmer, trucker or fisherman sell- ing such farm produce or fish as is of his own growing or catch, or any saleman taking orders from or selling to any licensed merchant.

And if any person shall willfully pluck up, or remove, any of said posts or mark-stones, such person shall, for every such offense, forfeit and pay a fine of One Hundred Dollars, and the Council may reward the informer of such offense, by allowing him a portion of said penalty, not exceeding a moiety thereof. The Mayor and Council of Delaware City shall also have power and authority to levy and collect reasonable taxes upon all telephone, telegraph, electric light, electric power and trolley poles and other erections and equipment of like charac- ter erected within the City of Delaware City, and may by ordi- nance prescribe the mode of levying and collecting the same. In case of any of the owners or lessees of any such poles or erec- tions within said City shall refuse or neglect to pay the taxes that may be levied upon such poles or erections, the Council shall have authority to cause the same to be removed, and may cause to be instituted by the collector, suit to recover the amount of taxes so levied and the expenses incident thereto and the ex- penses incident to the removal of such poles or erections. The Council is hereby empowered, upon the written pe- tition of five or more freeholders of said City who live within Chapter 209 715 300 feet of the owner or owners, to notify in writing, the owner or owners of any house and/or lot in said City, before or in front of which the said Council may deem proper that a pavement should be laid, to lay a pavement of brick, concrete or any other material, which may be approved by said Council. The length and width of such pavement may be prescribed by said Council, but no person shall be obliged to pave any sidewalk or footway to a greater width than four feet in front of any vacant lot or lots not near or adjoining any dwelling house. In like manner upon like petition, the Council is empowered where any pave- ment be deemed insufficient to notify, in writing, the owner or owners of the house and/or lot before or in front of which such pavement is or has been laid, to repair the same. In like man- ner and upon like petition, the Council is empowered to notify in writing, the owner or owners of any house or lot in said City to cover the sidewalk before or in front of such house and/or lot with gravel, sand or other suitable material in case the said Council deems such sidewalk not proper to be paved. If such owner or owners shall neglect or refuse, for the space of twenty days after being notified as aforesaid, to lay such pave- ment or repair the same, or to cover the sidewalk, as above- stated, it shall and may be lawful for the Mayor and Council of Delaware City to cause the said specified work to be done and to charge the cost of the same against the owner or owners of the premises in question, said charge to constitute a lien against said premises, from the date of the beginning of the work until paid. It shall be the duty of the Mayor and Council of Dela- ware City, by Warrant signed by the Mayor and Secretary of said Council, with the Seal affixed thereto, and directed to the Assessor, in which shall be stated the name of the owner or owners, if known; otherwise, it shall be sufficient to list the owner or owners as unknown, the date of the commencement of the work, the nature of the work done and the amount, directing the Assessor to prepare a special assessment list with said in- formation included, which shall be attached to and be a part of his assessment of real estate and personal assessment within said City for the ensuing year. The right of appeal from said assess- ment together with the time of payment and date from which in- terest shall run at the rate of one-half per centum per month on said assessment and the method of collection, shall be the 716 Chapter 209 same in all respects as though it were a claim for real estate taxes, as set out in Section 12 of this Act, excepting that no discount shall be allowed, as is allowed in the case of the pay- ment of taxes. (i) The Council shall also have power, and it is hereby authorized to order and direct the owner or owners of any house or lot, situated on any street where there is or may here- after be a water main or a sewer main, to tap the water main or the sewer main in said street, and to connect said sewer main or said water main, by pipe, with the property so situated on said street aforesaid ; and if such owner or owners neglect or re- fuse so to do for the space of twenty days, the said Mayor and Council of Delaware City shall cause the same to be done and re- cover the cost of the same in the same manner as prescribed for the recovery of cost where new pavements, etc., have been laid. If there be more than one owner of the premises affected by the paving, repaving or tapping of water or sewer /main, no- tice to one shall be deemed sufficient, and if there be no owner of said premises resident in the City of Delaware City, notice to the occupier thereof shall be deemed sufficient, and if there be no occupier, then the posting of said notice upon the prem- ises shall be deemed sufficient. Section 14. The Mayor and Council of Delaware City, under the restrictions hereinafter provided, may borrow for municipal purposes on the credit of said City such sum or sums of money, at such time or times, as they may deem proper, not to exceed eight per centum of the assessed value of the real estate of said City and issue bonds for the payment of the same ; provided, however, that the total indebtedness, of every kind, shall not exceed eight per centum of the assessed value of said real estate ; and provided further, that the said eight per centum may be exceeded for the purpose of borrowing any sum or sums of money to refund or pay off any bond issue or issues of said City. The Mayor and Council of Delaware City, for the purpose of carrying into effect the above provisions, may issue bonds of such denomination as they may deem best, bearing interest at a rate not exceeding five per centum per annum, payable semi- Chapter 209 717 annually. The principal of each issue of said bonds shall be made payable in not more than thirty years from the date of the issue thereof, and the said Mayor and Council of Delaware City may agree to retain the power and authority of redeeming said bonds or any part of them at the expiration of ten years or more from the date of issue of the same. The said bonds shall be signed by the Mayor and countersigned by the Treasurer, and shall be sealed with the corporate seal, and be exempt from all State, County and Municipal taxation. The said Council is authorized, empowered and directed to levy, assess and collect annually in the same manner as provided by law for assessing and collecting other taxes for municipal purposes, a special tax, except that revenue from other sources is adequate, for the purpose of establishing a fund adequate to the redemption at or before maturity of all bonds of any issue; provided that the amount to be raised for the purpose of estab- lishing said sinking fund shall not exceed the sum of five per centum of the amount of such issue. Before any sum or sums of money shall be borrowed, the question of borrowing such sum or sums shall be submitted to the voters of said City, and be approved by a majority of the votes cast at a special election, and at every such election each person within said City, being a resident thereof, shall have the right to cast one vote for every dollar and fractional part of a dollar of tax assessed against him or her respectively; and that every male or female shall have the right to vote provided that he or she shall have paid all taxes heretofore levied and assessed against him or her and shall produce a tax receipt for the same when demanded by any person entitled to vote at said election. Notice of such election and the purpose thereof shall be posted in at least ten public places in said City, at least twenty days be- fore time of such election. No election shall be necessary where the purpose of the new bond issue is to pay off an existing bonded indebtedness in like or less amount at a like or less rate of interest. Also, no election shall be necessary for the Mayor and Council to borrow, on the credit of the corporation, for the ordinary and necessary expenses of the corporation provided that the total outstanding debt so borrowed without any elec- tion shall not exceed $10,000 at any time. Section 15. Whenever at least one hundred legally quali- fied voters of said City shall petition the Council requesting a vote upon any ordinance or any matter which may be the sub- ject of an ordinance for an election thereon, the Council shall appoint a day for such election and shall choose an inspector and judges therefor, and give the same notice of such election as is required to be given at a general municipal election. If two- thirds of the votes cast at such election shall be against such ordinance, such ordinance shall be repealed as though repealed by the action of Council ; or, if two-thirds of the votes cast at such election shall favor any such matter which may be the subject matter of an ordinance, such matter shall be an ordi- nance as though passed by the Council in the manner prescribed in this Act, and the action of such an election can only be voided by an additional referendum or referendums. The subject matter of any such Petition may also be the question of any municipal improvement. The Council may also submit any questions which it may deem proper to the referendum vote of the legally qualified voters of said City. Whenever the Council shall receive a petition for an elec- tion as prescribed in Section 15 of this Act, it shall provide for an election to be held not more than sixty days from the time such petition is received. Section 16. If any part of this Act shall be held uncon- stitutional or otherwise invalid, such holding shall not in any- wise invalidate the remaining provisions of the Act. Section 177. All Acts and doings of \"The Mayor and Coun- cil of Delaware City\", or of any officer of said City lawfully done or performed under the provisions of any Law of this State, or of any ordinance of said City are hereby ratified and confirmed and shall continue in force. All debts, fines or penalties and for- feitures due to said City, and all debts due from said City to any person or persons or to any corporation are declared to be unaffected and unimpaired by this repeal, and all the Laws of the State for the collection and enforcement thereof shall con- tinue in full force until the same shall be lawfully paid. All the powers now conferred by law upon the Collector for the collec- tion and enforcement of all taxes in said City, heretofore as- 718 Chapter 209 Chapter 209 719 sessed and uncollected shall continue in full force and effect un- til all said taxes shall be fully collected and paid. The official bond of Said collector-shall be Unaffected and unimpaired by this repeal, and he and his sureties thereon shall continue liable for any breaches of any of the conditions of said bond, and all pro- ceedings heretofore commenced for the collection of any penalty, fine, forfeiture or debt, due to said City under any Law or ordi- nance shall not be affected or impaired by this repeal, but the same may be prosecuted to judgment and execution until the same be fully paid, liquidated and discharged. Section 18. This Charter shall become effective thirty days after its enactment into law.

DETAINERS; UNIFORM AGREEMENT ON DETAINERS \u00a7 2540. Preamble The Agreement on Detainers is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this State with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows : The contracting states solemnly agree that the party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarce- rated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agree- ment to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with ref- erence to such charges and detainers, when emanating from an- other jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of co- operative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agree- ment to provide such cooperative procedures. \u00a7 2541. Definitions As used in this agreement : (a) \"State\" shall mean a state of the United States ; the United States of America ; a territory or possession of the 742 Chapter 223 United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. \"Sending state\" shall mean a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to \u00a7 2542 hereof or at the time that a re- quest for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to \u00a7 2543 hereof. \"Receiving state\" shall mean the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pur- notice requesting disposition, trial within 180 days; waiver of extradition (a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprison- ment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprison- ment there is pending in any other party state any untried in- dictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a de- tainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appro- priate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint : provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having juris- diction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remain- ing to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. (b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the commissioner of corrections or other official Chapter 223 743 having custody of him, who shall pomptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. The Commissioner of corrections, his delegated agent, or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based. Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notifica- tion sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certifi- cate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or com- plaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, infor- mation or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice. Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of para- graph (d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after corn- pietion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The reque3t for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the plisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned 744 Chapter 223 to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law. (f) Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request. \u00a7 2543. Approval of court; disapproval of Governor, trial; dismissal The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a de- tainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with \u00a7 2544 (a) hereof upon presentation of a 'written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated : provided that the court having jur- isdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request: and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availa- bility, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the pris- oner. Upon receipt of the officer's written request as pro- vided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities hav- ing the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a cer- tificate stating the term of commitment under which the prison- er is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authori- ties simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appro- priate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor. Chapter 223 745 In respect of any proceeding made possible by this section, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being re- turned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a72544 (e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice. \u00a7 2544.

In the case of a federal prisoner, the appro- priate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to tem- porary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prison- er's presence in federal custody at the place for trail, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian. The officer or other representative of a state accept- ing an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand : 746 Chapter 223 Proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given. A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made. If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to ac- cept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in \u00a7 2542 or \u00a7 2543 hereof, the ap- propriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, infor- mation or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dis- missing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease,to be of any force or effect. The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution. At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state. During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as re- quired by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prison- er only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow. For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the Chapter 223 747 jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law. (h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is re- turned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informa- tions or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the department, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor. \u00a7 2545. Time periods; determination; tolling In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in \u00a7 2542 and \u00a7 2543 of this agree- ment, the running of said time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as de- termined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter. No provision of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement, shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be mentally ill. \u00a7 2546.

A state party to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by en- acting a statute repealing the same.

ARTICLE III Contracts (a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration.

ARTICLE IV Procedures and Rights Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to pro- vide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. The appropriate officials of any state party to this com- pact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institu- tion in which it has a contractural right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. 852 Chapter 275 Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdic- tion of the sending state and may at any time be removed there- from for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state ; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.

ARTICLE VII Entry into Force This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state. ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written no- Chapter 275 855 tice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdraw- ing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of with- drawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact. ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confine- ment, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of coopera- tive institutional arrangements. ARTICLE X Construction and Severability The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provi- sion of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitu- tion of any participating state or of the United States or the ap- plicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circum- stance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this com- pact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this com- pact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state par- ticipating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and ef- fect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters. Section 3.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Dela- ware: Section 1. Chapter 11, Title 17, Delaware Code, is hereby amended by striking out said Chapter 11 and substituting there- for a new Chapter 11 to read as follows : CHAPTER 11. REGULATION OF OUTDOOR ADVERTISING Subchapter 1. General Provisions \u00a7 1101. Purpose and policy The rapid growth in the use of motor vehicles throughout this State and the concurrent extension of highways built or improved at public expense has led to great changes in the extent and character of public travel. The investment of this State, municipalities and towns in good roads, parks, parkways, play- grounds and reservations, and the safety, convenience and wel- fare of the inhabitants have been affected. The regulations and control of outdoor advertising signs, displays and devices of all kinds is provided for in order to pro- mote the general welfare, especially in the particulars herein- after recited. The people of this State would suffer economically if the State failed to participate fully in the allocation and opportion- ment of federal-aid highway funds since a reduction in federal- aid highway funds would necessitate increased taxation to sup- port and maintain the State road program and system. It is, consequently, the intention of this act, among other things, to provide a statutory basis for regulation of outdoor advertising consistent with the public policy relating to areas adjacent to federal-aid Interstate and Primary Systems declared by Con- gress of the United States, in Title 23, United States Code.

Railroad tracks and minor sidings. Chapter 276 859 \"Zoned commercial or industrial areas\" mean those areas which are zoned for business, industry, commerce or trade pursuant to a State or local zoning ordinance or regula- tion. \"Unzoned commercial or industrial areas\" mean those areas not zoned by any State, county or local ordinance or regu- lation on which there is located one or more permanent struc- tures devoted to a business activity or on which a commercial or industrial activity is actually conducted, whether or not a per- manent structure is located thereon, and the area along the highway extending for a radius of 1500 feet outward and be- yond the edge of such activity. All measurements shall be from the outer edges of the regularly used buildings, parking lots, stores or processing areas of the commercial or industrial activi- ties, not from the property line of the activities, and shall be along or parallel to the pavement of the highway. \u00a7 1103.

A sign structure may contain one or two signs per fac- ing and two sign facings may be placed back to back or V-Type at one location but in no event shall the total area of any facing exceed 1,200 square feet. A sign which exceeds 600 square feet in area may not be on the same sign facing with any other sign.

In the event the Board of Education determines that a majority of its public school employees are listed as members of said organization, and the majority of such members have indi- cated a desire to be represented by the employee organization in collective bargaining negotiations as prescribed by Section 4003 (b) hereof, the Board of Education shall certify in writing not less than thirty days and not later than forty-five days after the filing and posting of said petition, that said organization is the exclusive negotiating representative of the public school employ- ees of the school district, unless within said thirty day period a petition requesting the holding of an election is filed as herein- after provided. If within 30 days after the filing and posting of said petition at least 30 percent of the total number of the public school employees of the school district file with the Secretary of the Board of Education a petition requesting that an elec- tion be held to determine the exclusive negotiating representa- tive, such election shall be held not less than 30 days of receipt of the petition by the Secretary of the Board of Education, be- tween the dates of September 1 and June 15.

No representative of any employee organization shall be permitted to solicit membership therein, or to solicit petitions or votes for the purpose of obtaining a collective bargaining agreement, on school property at any time, unless he shall be a bona fide employee of the particular school district involved and a member of the local employee organization whom he pur- ports to represent. All election campaigning on school property during school hours shall be restricted to those areas reserved exclusively for teacher use. \u00a7 4010.

If any employee or- ganization violates the provisions hereof, the public school em- ployer shall refrain from making payroll deductions for that or- ganization's dues for a period of one (1) year thereafter. No public school employee shall strike while in the per- formance of his official duties. For purposes of this section the word \"strike\" shall be deemed an unexcused absence. \u00a7 4012. Existing agreements Nothing herein shall be deemed as a termination or invali- dation of existing agreements between a Board of Education and an organization of public school employees, except to the extent that they are in conflict with provisions of this chapter. 914 Chapter 298 \u00a7 4013.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Delaware: Section 1. Chapter 11, Title 30, Delaware Code, is amended by adding a new section 1149 to read as follows : \u00a7 1149. Treatment of capital gains realized from the sale of a taxpayer's principal residence If property used by the taxpayer as his old principal residence is sold by him after December 31, 1968 and within a period beginning one year before the date of such sale and ending one year after such date, property is purchased and used by the Taxpayer as his new principal residence, gain (if any) shall be recognized only to the extent that the taxpayer's adjusted sales price (as defined in subsection (b) ) of the old residence exceeds the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence. Adjusted sales price defined For purposes of this section, the term \"adjusted sales price\" means the amount realized, reduced by the aggregate of the expenses for work performed on the old residence in order to assist in its sale. Limitations. The reduction provided in paragraph (I) applies only to expenses for work performed during the 90-day period ending on the day on which the contract to sell the old residence is entered into; which are paid on or before the 30th day after the date of the sale of the old residence; and which are (I) not allowable as deductions in computing taxable in- come; and 1068 Chapter 346 (ii) not taken into account in computing the amount real- ized from the sale of the old residence. (III) Effective date. The reduction provided in para- graph (I) applies to expenses for work performed in any tax- able year, but only in the case of a sale or exchange or an old residence which occurs after December 31, 1968. (c) Rules for application of section For purposes of this section : An exchange by the taxpayer of his residence for other property shall be treated as a sale of such residence, and the ac- quisition of a residence on the exchange of property shall be treated as a purchase of such residence. A residence any part of which was constructed or re- constructed by the taxpayer shall be treated as purchased by the taxpayer. In determining the taxpayer's cost of purchasing a residence, there shall be included only so much of his cost as is attributable to the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and improvements made which are properly chargeable to capital account, during the period specified in subsection (a) . If a residence is purchased by the taxpayer before the date of his sale of the old residence, the purchased residence shall not be treated as his new residence if sold or otherwise disposed of by him before the date of the sale of the old residence. In the case of a new residence the construction of which was commenced by the taxpayer before the expiration of one year after the date of the sale of the old residence, the period specified in subsection (a), shall be treated as including a period of 18 months beginning with the date of the sale of the old resi- dence. (d) Basis of new residence Where the purchase of a new residence results, under subsection (a) in the nonrecogni- tion of gain on the sale of an old residence, in determining the adjusted basis of the new residence as of any time following the sale of the old residence, the adjusted basis shall include a reduc- tion by an amount equal to the amount of the gain not so recog- nized on the sale of the old residence. For this purpose, the amount of the gain not so recognized on the sale of the old resi- Chapter 346 1069 dence includes only so much of such gain as is not recognized by reason of the cost, up to such time, of purchasing the new resi- dence. In order for this section to apply, the new residence pur- chased must be located within the State of Delaware. If the taxable or taxable and spouse or either of them have reached sixty-five (65) years of age before the date of the sale of their principal residence within Delaware a specific ex- emption of $15,000 shall be granted to be applied against the capital gains resulting from the sale thereof provided that such premises shall have been the principal residence of the taxables during five of the preceding eight years before date of sale. The exemption provided by this subsection shall not apply to any sale made by the taxable or taxable and spouse or either of them if any exemption under this subsection has been allowed to either or both of them with respect to a previous sale of a residence. This subsection shall not apply to the sale of a principal resi- dence which occurs before December 31, 1968. Principal residence shall refer to the dwelling of the taxable and the land immediately adjacent thereto, provided that land in excess of five (5) acres in area shall not be consid- ered a part of the principal residence.

(b) The corporation may apply to such redemption, pur- chase or retirement, under subparagraphs 1, 2 or 3 of subsection (a) of this section, an amount of its capital which shall not be greater than the sum of That part of the consideration received for such shares which shall be capital pursuant to the provisions of section 154 of this title and that part of surplus which shall have been trans- ferred and treated as capital in respect of such shares pursuant to the provisions of that section, and Any amounts by which the capital of the corporation 1198 Chapter 421 ' : , ?, :', ,.,. Y' i-5.: shall have been increased by other transfers from surplus in ac- cordance with the provisions of that section, except those trans- fers, if any, which shall have been made in respect of other pre- ferred or special shares.

It shall be recorded in the office of the Recorder of the County of this State in which the registered office of each such constituent corporation is located ; or if any of the constituent corporations shall have been specially created by a public act of the Legislature, then the agreement shall be recorded in the county where such corporation had its principal place of business in this State.

All Chapter 437 1229 1230 Chapter 437 insurers defined as member insurers in \u00a7 4205 (5) shall be and remain members of the Association as a condition of their au- thority to transact insurance in this State. The Association shall perform its functions under a plan of operation established and approved under \u00a7 4209 and shall exercise its powers through a Board of Directors established under \u00a7 4207. \u00a7 4207. Board of Directors The Board of Directors of the Association shall consist of not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9) persons serving terms as established in the plan of operation. The members of the Board shall be selected by member insurers subject to the ap- proval of the Commissioner. Vacancies of the Board shall be filled for the remaining period of the term in the same manner as ini- tial appointments. If no members are selected within 60 days after the effective date of this Act, the Commissioner may ap- point the initial members of the Board of Directors. In approving selections to the Board, the Commissioner shall consider among other things whether all member insurers are fairly represented. Members of the Board may be reimbursed from the as- sets of the Association for expenses incurred by them as mem- bers of the Board of Directors. \u00a7 4208. Powers and duties of the Association (1) The Association shall : Be obligated to the extent of the covered claims existing prior to the determination of insolvency and arising within 30 days after the determination of insolvency, or before the policy expiration date if less than 30 days after the determination, or before the insured replaces the policy or causes its cancellation, if he does so within 30 days of the determination, but such obli- gation shall include only that amount of each covered claim which is in excess of $100 and is less than $300,000, except that the As- sociation shall pay the full amount of any covered claim arising out of a workmen's compensation policy. In no event shall the Association be obligated to a policyholder or claimant in an amount in excess of the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy from which the claim arises. Be deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation on Chapter 437 1231 the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent. (c) Assess insurers amounts necessary to pay the obliga- tions of the Association under paragraph (a) subsequent to an insolvency, the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, and the cost of examinations under \u00a7 4213 and other expenses authorized by this Act. The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding cal- endar year bears to the net direct written premiums of all mem- ber insurers for the preceding calendar year. Each member in- surer shall be notified of the assessment not later than 30 days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any year an amount greater than 2% of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year. If the maxi- mum assessment, together with the other assets of the Associa- tion, does not provide in any one year an amount sufficient to make an necessary payments, the funds available shall be pro- rated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available. The Association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer, if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdic- tion in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insur- ance. Each member insurer may set off against any assessment, authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses in- curred in the payment of such claims by the member insurer. Investigate claims brought against the Association and adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of the Association's obligation and deny all other claims and may review settlements, releases and judgments to which the insolv- ent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the ex- tent to which such settlements, releases and judgments may be properly contested. Notify such persons as the Commissioner directs under \u00a74210 (2) (a). (f) Handle claims through its employees or through one or 1232 Chapter 437 more insurers or other persons designated as servicing facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of the Commissioner, but such designation may be declined by a member insurer. Reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the Association paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the Association and shall pay the other expenses of the Association authorized by this Act. (2) The Association may: (a) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary to handle claims and perform other duties of the Association. (b) Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of this Act in accord with the plan of operation. Sue or be sued. Negotiate and become a party to such contracts as are necessary to carry out the purpose of this Act. Perform such other acts as are necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose of this Act. Refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to the Association that amount by which the assets of the Association exceed the liabili- ties, if, at the end of any calendar year, the Board of Directors finds that the assets of the Association exceed the liabilities of the Association as estimated by the Board of Directors for the coming year. \u00a7 4209. Plan of Operation (1) (a) The Association shall submit to the Commissioner a plan of operation and any amendments thereto necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administra- tion of the Association. The plan of operation and any amend- ments thereto shall become effective upon approval in writing by the Commissioner. (b) If the Association fails to submit a suitable plan of operation within 90 days following the effective date of this Act or if at any time thereafter the Association fails to submit suit- Chapter 437 1233 able amendments to the plan, the Commissioner shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate such reasonable rules as are necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this Act. Such rules shall continue in force until modified by the Com- missioner or superceded by a plan submitted by the Association and approved by the Commissioner. (2) All member insurers shall comply with the plan of operation. (3) The plan of operation shall : Establish the procedures whereby all the powers and duties of the Association under \u00a7 4208 will be performed. Establish procedures for handling assets of the As- sociation. Establish the amount and method of reimbursing mem- bers of the Board of Directors under \u00a7 4207. Establish procedures by which claims may be filed with the Association and establish acceptable forms of proof of covered claims. Notice of claims to the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent insurer shall be deemed notice to the Association or its agent and a list of such claims shall be periodically submitted to the Association or similar organization in another state by the receiver or liquidator. Establish regular places and times for meetings of the Board of Directors. Establish procedures for records to be kept of all finan- cial transactions of the Association, its agents, and the Board of Directors. Provide that any member insurer aggrieved by any final action or decision of the Association may appeal to the com- missioner within 30 days after the action or decision. Establish the procedures whereby selections for the Board of Directors will be submitted to the Commissioner. Contain additional provisions necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the Association. (4) The plan of operation may provide that any or all 1234 Chapter 437 power and duties of the Association, except those under \u00a7 4208 (1) (c) and \u00a7 4208 (2) (b), are delegated to a corporation, as- sociation, or other organization which performs or will perform functions similar to those of this Association, or its equivalent, in two or more states. Such a corporation, association or organi- zation shall be reimbursed as a servicing facility would be reim- bursed and shall be paid for its performance of any other func- tions of the Association. A delegation under this subsection shall take effect only with the approval of both the Board of Directors and the Commissioner, and may be made only to a corporation, association, or organization which extends protection not sub- stantially less favorable and effective than that provided by this Act. \u00a7 4210. Duties and powers of the Commissioner (1) The Commissioner shall : Notify the Assbciation of the existence of an insolvent insurer not later than 3 days after he receives notice of the de- termination of the insolvency. Upon request of the Board of Directors, provide the As- sociation with a statement of the net direct written premiums of each member insurer. (2) The Commissioner may : Require that the Association notify the insureds of the insolvent insurer and any other interested parties of the determi- nation of insolvency and of their rights under this Act. Such noti- fication shall be by mail at their last known address, where avail- able, but if sufficient information for notification by mail is not available, notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation shall be sufficient. Suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certifi- cate of authority to transact insurance in this State of any mem- ber insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation. As an alternative, the Com- missioner may levy a fine on any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due. Such fine shall not exceed 5% of the unpaid assessment per month, except that no fine shall be less than $100 per month. Chapter 437 1235 (c) Revoke the designation of any servicing facility if he finds claims are being handled unsatisfactorily. (3) Any final action or order of the Commissioner under this Act shall be subject to judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction. \u00a7 4211. Effect of paid claims Any person recovering under this Act shall be deemed to have assigned his rights under the policy to the Association to the extent of his recovery from the Association. Every insured or claimant seeking the protection of this Act shall cooperate with the Association to the same extent as such person would have been required to cooperate with the insolvent insurer. The Association shall have no cause of action against the insured of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out except such causes of action as the insolvent insurer would have had if such sums had been paid by the insolvent insurer. In the case of an insolvent insurer operating on a plan with assessment liability, payments of claims of the Association shall not operate to reduce the liability of insureds to the receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor for unpaid assessments. The receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor of an insolvent insurer shall be bound by settlements of covered claims by the Association or a similar organization in another state. The court having jurisdiction shall grant such claims priority equal to that which the claimant would have been entitled in the absence of this Act against the assets of the insolvent insurer. The ex- penses of the Association or similar organization in handling claims shall be accorded the same priority as the liquidator's expenses. The Association shall periodically file with the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent insurer statements of the covered claims paid by the Association and estimates of anticipated claims on the Association which shall preserve the rights of the Asso- ciation against the assets of the insolvent insurer. \u00a7 4212. Non.duplication of recovery (1) Any person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy other than a policy of an insolvent insurer which is also a covered claim, shall be required 1236 Chapter 437 to exhaust first his right under such policy. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this Act shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under such insurance policy. (2) Any person having a claim which may be recovered under more than one insurance guaranty association or its equiva- lent shall seek recovery first from the association of the place of residents of the insured except that if it is a first party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, he shall seek re- covery first from the association of the location of the property, and if it is a workmen's compensation claim, he shall seek recov- ery first from the association of the residence of the claimant. Any recovery under this Act shall be reduced by the amount of recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent. \u00a7 4213. Prevention of insolveneies To aid in the detection and prevention of insurer in- solvencies It shall be the duty of the Board of Directors, upon majority vote, to notify the Commissioner of any information indicating any member insurer may be insolvent or in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public. The Board of Directors may, upon majority vote, re- quest that the Commissioner order an examination of any mem- ber insurer which the board in good faith believes may be in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public. Within 30 days of the receipt of such request, the Commissioner shall begin such examination. The examination may be conducted as a National Association of Insurance Commissioners' examina- tion or may be conducted by such persons as the Commissioner designates. The cost of such examination shall be paid by the Association and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports. In no event shall such examination report be released to the Board of Directors prior to its release to the public, but this shall not preclude the Commissioner from complying with subsection (3). The Commissioner shall notify the Board of Directors when the examination is completed. The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the Commis- sioner, but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of the examination report to the public. Chapter 437 1237 It shall be the duty of the Commissioner to report to the Board of Directors when he has reasonable cause to believe that any member insurer examined or being examined at the request of the Board of Directors may be insolvent or in a finan- cial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public. The Board of Directors may, upon majority vote, make reports and recommendations to the Commissioner upon any matter germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation of any member insurer. Such reports and recom- mendations shall not be considered public documents. The Board of Directors may, upon majority vote, make recommendations to the Commissioner for the detection and pre- vention of insurer insolvencies. The Board of Directors shall, at the conclusion of any insurer insolvency in which the Association was obligated to pay covered claims, prepare a report on the history and causes of such insolvency, based on the information available to the Asso- ciation and submit such report to the Commissioner. \u00a7 4214. Examination of the Association The Association shall be subject to examination and regu- lation by the Commissioner. The Board of Directors shall submit, not later than March 30 of each year, a financial report for the preceding calendar year in a form approved by the Commissioner. \u00a7 4215. Tax exemption The Association shall be exempt from payment of all fees and all taxes levied by this State or any of its subdivisions except taxes levied on real or personal property. \u00a7 4216. Recognition of assessments in rates The rates and premiums charged for insurance policies to which this Act applies shall include amounts sufficient to recoup a sum equal to the amounts paid to the Association by the member insurer less any amounts returned to the member insurer by the Association and such rates shall not be deemed excessive because they contain an amount reasonably calculated to recoup assess- ments paid by the member insurer. 1238 Chapter 437 \u00a7 4217. Immunity There shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against any member insurer, the Association or its agents or employees, the Board of Directors, or the Commissioner or his representatives for any action taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this Act. \u00a7 4218. Stay of proceedings; reopening of default judgments All proceedings in which the insolvent insurer is a party or is obligated to defend a party in any court in this State shall be stayed for 60 days from the date the insolvency is determined to permit proper defense by the association of all pending causes of action as to any covered claims arising from a judgment under any decision, verdict or finding based on the default of the in- solvent insurer or its failure to defend an insured, the Associa- tion either on its own behalf or on behalf of such insured may apply to have such judgment, order, decision, verdict or finding set aside by the same court or administrator that made such judgement, order, decision, verdict or finding and shall be per- mitted to defend against such claim on the merits.

Manner of executing anatomical gifts A gift of all or part of the body under Section 1781 (a) may be made by will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the testator without waiting for probate. If the will is not probated, or if it is declared invalid for testamentary pur- poses, the gift, to the extent that it has been acted upon in good faith, is nevertheless valid and effective. A gift of all or part of the body under Section 1781 (a) may also be made by document other than a will. The gift becomes effective upon the death of the donor. The document, which may be a card designed to he carried on the person, must be signed by the donor, in the presence of two witnesses who need not be in the presence of each other but who must sign the document in his presence. If the donor cannot sign, the document may be signed for him at his direction and in his presence, and in the presence of two witnesses who must sign the document in his presence. Delivery of the document of gift during the donor's lifetime is not necessary to make the gift valid. The gift may be made to a specified donee or without specifying a donee. If the latter, the gift may be accepted by the attending physician as donee upon or following death. If the gift is made to a specified donee who is not available at the time and 1252 Chapter 445 place of death, the attending physician upon or following death, in the absence of any expressed indication that the donor desired otherwise, may accept the gift as donee. The physician who be- comes a donee under this subsection shall not participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part. Notwithstanding Section 1786 (b), the donor may desig- nate in his will, card or other document of gift the surgeon or physician to carry out the appropriate procedures. In the absence of a designation, or if the designee is not available, the donee or other person authorized to accept the gift may employ or au- thorize any surgeon or physician for the purpose. Any gift by a person designated in Section 1781 (b) shall be made by a document signed by him, or made by his tele- graphic, recorded, telephonic or other recorded message. A person who so directs the manner in which his body or any part of his body shall be disposed of shall receive no re- muneration or other thing of value for such disposition. \u00a7 1784. Delivery of document of gift If the gift is made by the donor to a specified donee, the will, card or other document, or an executed copy thereof, may be de- livered to the donee to expedite the appropriate procedures im- mediately after death, but delivery is not necessary to the validity of the gift. The will, card or other document, or an executed copy thereof, may be deposited in any hospital, bank or storage facility or registry office that accepts them for safekeeping or for facili- tation of procedures after death. On request of any interested party upon or after the donor's death, the person in possession shall produce the document for examination. \u00a7 1785. Amendment or revocation of the gift (a) If the will, card or other document or executed copy thereof has been delivered to a specified donee, the donor may amend or revoke the gift by: the execution and delivery to the donee of a signed state- ment; or an oral statement made in the presence of 2 persons and communicated to the donee; or Chapter 445 1253 a statement during a terminal illness or injury addressed to an attending physician and communicated to the donee; or a signed card or document found on his person or in his effects. Any document of gift which has not been delivered to the donee may be revoked by the donor in the manner set in sub- section (a) or by destruction, cancellation, or mutilation of the document and all executed copies thereof. Any gift made by a will may also be amended or revoked in the manner provided for amendment or revocation of wills, or as provided in subsection (a) . \u00a7 1786. Rights and duties at death The donee may accept or reject the gift. If the donee ac- cepts a gift of the entire body, he may, subject to the terms of the gift, authorize embalming and the use of the body in funeral serv- ices. If the gift is of a part of the body, the donee, upon the death of the donor and prior to embalming, shall cause the part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation. After removal of the part, custody of the remainder of the body vests in the surviving spouse, next of kin or other persons under obligation to dispose of the body. The heir of any donor, at the time the disposition of the body takes place, may submit a request in writing to the donee that the body be returned to the heir at such time as the donee either refuses the disposition of the entire body or the parts thereof or determines that he no longer has use of the remains. The time of death shall be determined by a physician who attends the donor at his death, or, if none, the physician who certifies the death. This physician shall not participate in the pro- cedures for removing or transplanting a part. A person who acts in good faith in accord with the terms of this Act, or under the anatomical gift laws of another state (or a foreign country) is not liable for damages in any civil action or subject to prosecution in any criminal proceeding for his act. Where no other provision for the same exist, a body, or the remains thereof, after it is no longer needed for the pur- pose indicated by the donor, may be buried at public expense, on order of the Medical Council of Delaware, but in no case shall the expense of the burial exceed $100. (e) The provisions of this Act are subject to the laws of this State prescribing powers and duties with respect to autopsies. \u00a7 1787.
