Herbs have the ability to strengthen, support, and bring the body into balance. They are natural forms of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and the body responds well to them. The cultivation of herbs and practice of herbal medicine goes far back in my family and I have been ever so grateful for the ancient wisdom that has been passed down through my family, and of course the plants have taught me many things themselves. My formal training is from the American College of Healthcare Sciences where I obtained an Associates Degree in Complementary & Alternative Medicine in 2017 and a Bachelors Degree in Integrative Health Sciences in 2021, both with specialization in herbal medicine. Always learning and growing, I returned to ACHS in 2023 to work towards my Master's Degree in Integrative Health Sciences, again with a focus on herbal medicine. I have a small variety of loose herbs, teas, and herbal preparations in the boutique and can custom blend for clients. Clients can join my online wellness dispensary and order conveniently for home delivery. Herbal workshops are also available on occasion. The herbs you find here at the studio are either grown or ethically wildcrafted by me, or are of organic, fair trade, non-GMO, and sustainable nature. I grow my herbs with love in a chemical free garden from seeds or plants that are obtained through organic growers. I plant, grow, harvest, and prepare the herbs using the lunar calendar to ensure the strongest plant energy possible. *It is always recommended that you consult with a qualified healthcare practitioner before using herbal products especially if you are pregnant, nursing, taking any medications or if you have any medical conditions.

If you've been around me enough you will soon come to find that I talk about nettles, a lot! Stinging nettle, Urtica dioica, or as my mom calls them \"brennnessel\" in German. In Germany after WWII her family was severely malnourished as there was not much food available, their bodies covered with open sores and they had lost most of their hair. Once Spring arrived my Oma would send my mom and her siblings out along the field ways with big baskets to pick the nettle. She recalls how much they hated picking them because all they had were knives and scissors and no gloves to protect their hands from the sting of the nettle plant. My Oma would cook them like spinach and they swore it returned them to health. As an extremely nutritive herb I can understand why as it is full of important vitamins and minerals. To this day we enjoy eating the nettle daily when they are fresh in the Spring and drinking nettle infusions for good health <3 "}
