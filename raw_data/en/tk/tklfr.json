Heeding that call, the Autism Alliance of Michigan is leading a movement to fight for equity and inclusion in health care, education, employment, housing, and social acceptance. One in 44 Americans are on the autism spectrum and 1 in 5 have a disability. Yet people with autism continue to face biases and barriers that systematize poverty within and prejudice against the community. Too many people with autism live separate and unequal lives, particularly those from minority and low-income households. Autism Alliance of Michigan affirms that people on the spectrum and all Michiganders with disabilities were born with unalienable rights. The fact that these rights are denied to so many highlights the unjust and intractable social-political forces that must be overcome. Throughout its existence, Autism Alliance of Michigan has worked simultaneously on three levels: 1. On a systemic level, the Alliance is changing health care, education, employment, and housing systems for people with disabilities with a goal of making Michigan the best state in the U.S. for autism. 2. On a community level, the Alliance is dismantling social barriers to inclusion and acceptance. 3. On a personal level, the Alliance is fighting one family at a time to empower self- and family-advocates in their quest for services and acceptance - keys to high qualities of life. Join us at the 2023 Michigan Shines for Autism Gala to join this movement and demonstrate your support & advocacy for Michigan's Autism community. ___ COVID-19 Vaccination Policy: Although guests are not required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination to attend this event, Autism Alliance of Michigan (AAoM) reserves the right to update this policy and instate vaccination, masking, and social distancing requirements if an unexpected surge in COVID-19 occurs leading up to the event.
