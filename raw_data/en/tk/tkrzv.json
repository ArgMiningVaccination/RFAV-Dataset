In seven years' time (2023/2024), we will look back on a century during which the Anthroposophical Society and the School of Spiritual Science have evolved and become part of the world. They belong to the twentieth century, which they have influenced and by which they have been shaped. Many tasks are emerging today that need to be faced and taken on. It will be a hundred years in 2017 since Rudolf Steiner first presented his threefold con - cept of the human being and of society. Looking at the challenges we encounter in todays' world makes us aware of how rel - evant this impulse continues to be. How can anthroposophy bring new life to its task of contributing to the way hu - manity and the world are evolving? How can the anthroposophical movement con - tribute to shaping the future with ever greater responsibility? These questions are also reflected in the annual theme, \"Light and Warmth for the Human Soul. How can the Foundation Stone Meditation promote peaceability?\" (see page 7). The School of Spiritual Science is here to pro - vide the knowledge that we need in order to actively promote what wants to evolve in the world. Can the anthroposophical movement, the Society and the School of Spiritual Science find the way forward, out of their awareness of this responsibility? What steps do they need to take? The Goetheanum World Conference of September 2016 asked exactly that ques -tion in dialogue with people from many different places and backgrounds, private and professional. The impulses arising from those meetings will also inform the Annual General Meeting and the annual conference of the anthroposophical movement: as a fo - rum, a place of dialogue, for what wants to be founded and directed, as described in the Foundation Stone Meditation. The newly appointed general secretaries, among oth - ers, will speak about this question. The Goetheanum Leadership and the Executive Council have worked intensive - ly with the impulses of the Goetheanum World Conference. As one of the results of this work we would like to suggest to the General Meeting to agree to the appoint - ment of Matthias Girke as an additional member of the Executive Council. Matth - ias Girke is someone who is fully and ac - tively committed to the Anthroposophical Society and its future. We are looking forward to seeing you at this year's Annual Conference and AGM.

After studying medicine at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, I worked as medical as - sistant in Internal Medicine, followed by several years in the oncology department of a Berlin hospital. During that period I also worked in intensive medicine and as an emergency doctor on the ambulances of the Berlin fire brigade. Internal medicine After completing my specialization in internal medicine (to which I later added diabetology and palliative medi - cine) I took over - with the support of my wife, Anja Girke - the mainstream medical practice of my first boss, which I then turned into a practice for internal anthroposophic medicine. During that time I also deepened my relationship with anthroposophi - cal curative education to which I had a long-standing connection through my parents and grand-parents: whilst run - ning my own practice I also provided medical care for the residents of the Caroline von Heydebrand Home, con - ducted child conferences and attended college meetings. In 1995 I co-founded the Havelh\u00f6he Community Hospital for Anthropo - sophic Medicine, taking responsibility for general internal medicine and dia - betology and later, within our Oncology Centre, also for interdisciplinary oncol - ogy and palliative medicine. During that time I was also actively involved with the hospital management. My on - going endeavours include the deepen - ing of anthroposophic medicine in the various specializations of internal med - icine, medical training - we also estab - lished the Academy for Anthroposophic Medicine within the Havelh\u00f6he Hospi - tal, which includes an anthroposophic- medical training - the promotion of in - terdisciplinary approaches in medicine and therapy and the meditative path of inner development of the School of Spiritual Science. Class work I have actively supported the anthro - posophical work in Berlin for around forty years now. Since 1995 the Class work has been among my central con - cerns. This work is now prepared by the Berlin Class leaders and consists of reg - ular Class lessons as well as Class con - ferences on central topics of the School of Spiritual Science and its meditative path. Medical Section Leader On 18 September 2016 I took over the leadership of the Medical Section together with Georg Soldner. It is my wish to bring my practical medical ex - perience of 33 years to my task as sec - tion leader: to the deepening of the di - verse specialist areas, to training, to the support and cohesion of professional therapy groups and to the further de - velopment of the work in the School of Spiritual Science. I am deeply grateful to my wife and my two now grown-up daughters for supporting me in taking this step. The Section leadership is not like a \"motor nerve\" but like the heart of the medical movement, manifesting itself in atten - tive perception, inspiration, integration and the giving of impulses. I am very grateful for the warmly expressed trust and all the good wishes I have received from within the medical movement for this seven-year leadership task in the Medical Section on which I embarked in 2016.| Matthias Girke Anthroposophical Society Introducing Matthias Girke Motion 1 Motion for secret-ballot voting at Annual General Meeting We move that the Annual General Meeting decide by separate and secret ballot 1. \"that all votes on motions (with the exception of procedural motions) are secret if the presenters of the motion in question request this.\" 2. \"The vote to discharge the Executive Council is always secret.\" Rationale: Considering the situation of the AGM at present, one cannot say that the vote is uninfluenced and free. It is part of the special situation in Dornach that a great number of members attend the AGM who are in various ways dependent on the Goetheanum, because they are - freelance or employed - staff members, annuitants, tenants or occasionally com - missioned artists. One can imagine that they may sometimes not feel free to vote, for instance, against the employer who is sitting directly opposite them on the stage. A truly free ballot therefore needs to be secret. With adequate preparation the additional efforts necessary for this will be tenable and made up for by a result that reflects the actual situation. Dornach, 9 February 2017 Tatiana Garcia-Cuerva, Thomas Heck, Gerd-Mari Savin, Angelika Schuster, Leon - hard Schuster, Roland T\u00fcscher Motion 2 Motion to count abstentions from voting at the Annual General Meeting We move that the Annual General Meeting decide in a secret-ballot vote \"that abstentions are counted in all votes.\" Rationale: With votes regarding the election, or re-election, of Executive Council members and also those to dis - charge the Executive Council, it is impor - tant to differentiate between affirmative votes, negative votes, and abstentions. Presently abstentions are treated as if the members abstaining were not there at all. Abstaining is, however, an important Anthroposophical Society Matthias Girke Photo: Heike Sommer4 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 3/17 School of Spiritual Science way of expressing an opinion that lies be - tween a definite 'yes' and a definite 'no', particularly when it is about discharging the Executive Council. It is therefore not appropriate to deal with abstentions as if the members in question were not even present for the vote. Dornach, 9 February 2017 Helmut Leonhard Schuster, Roland T\u00fcscher Motion 3 Motion to make the initiative 'Ein Nachrichtenblatt' known in An - throposophy Worldwide We move that the 2017 AGM decide that \"The Annual General Meeting will ask the Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society to make it pos - sible, as an expression of a free spiritual life, for the initiative 'Ein Nachrichten - blatt' [a newssheet] to present itself in Anthroposophy Worldwide in order to make itself known to all members.\" Rationale: In 2011 it was decided to cease the publication of the Newsletter \"What is Happening in the Anthropo - sophical Society\" which was founded by Rudolf Steiner and had come out weekly since 1924. It has since been replaced by Anthroposophy Worldwide which ap - pears ten times per year. Its publication frequency and scope do not allow for the former diversity of contributions, such as letters from members, articles, a variety of reports, basic presentations of Society matters, discussions of controversial top - ics etc. etc. Members therefore no longer have the possibility of a lively and topical exchange with one another or with the Goetheanum Leadership. This kind of ex - change does, in fact, no longer take place: you just need to compare the present con - tent with that published around the mil - lennium. In order to ensure that there is a lively organ of communication, members have taken the initiative to publish 'Ein Nach - richtenblatt', now in its seventh year, for members of the Anthroposophical So - ciety and friends of anthroposophy. So far, there has been no recognition of this publication, in the form of a positive per - ception for instance, by the Leadership of the GAS. After six years the members have still not been informed of its existence by the editors of Anthroposophy Worldwide, although such an announcement has been requested repeatedly. \"Ein Nachrich - tenblatt\" has hundreds of subscribers by now. The feedback from readers is largely positive; there clearly is a need for an inde - pendent newsletter so that some degree of free spiritual life can be realized within the General Anthroposophical Society. Anyone who wishes to get an impression of \"Ein Nachrichtenblatt\" can apply for a complimentary copy, either per email from ein.nachrichtenblatt@startmail. com, or by mail from Ein Nachrichten - blatt, R. T\u00fcscher, K. Juel, Apfelseestr. 21, 4147 Aesch, Schweiz. It should be in the interest and intentions of the GAS organs to promote and support a lively exchange and diversity of publication in the sense of a free spiritual life. It should therefore be possible for the Ein Nachrichtenblatt initiative to introduce itself to the entire membership in Anthroposophy World - wide; and there should be scope for con - structive cooperation seeing that one pur - sues the same anthroposophical aims. We therefore ask the Annual General Meet - ing, in the interest of a free spiritual life, to vote in favour of this motion. Dornach, 9 Februar 2017 Tatiana - gelika Schuster, Leonhard Schuster List of supporters of the above motion: Ernst- Felix von Allmen, Peter Vink and 27 othersMotion 4 [for a full report and a members' day on the Faust Project] We move that the Annual General Meeting decide \"to commission the Ex - ecutive Council to publish a full report on the Faust Project by the end of 2017, and to make it possible that a members' day is held where all those in charge are available for members to ask questions and receive information on the Faust production. Rationale: The present Faust cycle will go down in the history of the Goetheanum Stage with three superlative attributions at least: as the shortest, the worst and the most expensive. After just over a year this cycle will end in the summer of 2017, while performance periods in the past stretched over seven to ten years - as had been the original plan for this cycle, too. So there must be good reasons for this decision. Those in charge seem to think, however, that the brief announcement in Anthro - posophy Worldwide 1-2/2017 is sufficient. According to the Bylaws of the Anthro - posophical Society, which was founded during the Christmas Conference of 1923 and which the Executive Council claims to perpetuate (see accession statements of Bodo von Plato and Sergei Prokofieff of 2001), \"the Executive Council gives a full report\" to the Annual General Meeting. For years, only short and hardly informa - tive versions, if any, have been presented (Bodo von Plato at the 2014 AGM). We think, however, that a report on the failed Faust project is urgently necessary, because of its dimension and importance and because the spiritual and material damage will certainly be considerable. Nu - merous members will have helped to make this project possible in good faith, expect - ing a new production in accordance with Rudolf Steiner's intentions. We therefore think that a full assessment and transpar - ency towards the members are absolutely necessary. All responsibilities should be made visible and the experiences gained made fertile for future tasks and projects. Below is a list of points in need of clarification. For most members in the spatial and informal surroundings of the Goetheanum it was clear from very early on that this production would not do jus - Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 3/17 | 5 School of Spiritual Science tice to the intentions of Rudolf Steiner and anthroposophy. This was apparent from, among other things, the choice of directors, the obvious preference for non-anthroposophical actors, the rejec - tion of competent co-workers and artists, reports from those involved, the advertis - ing posters, publications from the produc - tion, also on the internet, and much more. The dramaturgical responsibility, for in - stance, was given to Martina Maria Sam. A few months later her name was no longer mentioned in connection with the Faust production; no official reasons were given. In short: everyone in Dornach - apart from those in charge at the Goetheanum? - knew where this production was heading. The first rehearsals, or the preliminary performance at the latest, must have re - vealed to the Executive Council the inten - tions pursued with this production. Even if one had 'forgotten', when this production was commissioned, to agree on its inten - tions, this would have been the time to in - tervene. The question is why this did not happen, and how it could come to such a production at the Goetheanum. It also needs to be established why the performances were so poorly attended. As is apparent from numerous conversations and from the feedback to the analysis of the Faust production (see Ein Nachrich - tenblatt, 25/2016), many people decided on the basis of the symptoms described above and the advertising style, that they would rather not attend this produc - tion. After the preliminary performance of Faust I, the only one to be sold-out, a review was published in the journal \"Die Drei\" (10/2015) by Ute Hallaschka, who also described the state of this production. One began to ask oneself uneasily, what Faust II would be like - a play, for which Ru - dolf Steiner had given entirely new artis - tic indications as regards its mythological beings and characters. In September 2015, the preliminary performances of Faust II began and these fears were confirmed. All this seems to have had the effect that the informed and anthroposophically ori - ented core audience stayed away from the performances and people around them were obviously not inspired to at - tend the performances. This means that the often officially cited positive feedback must have mostly come from visitors who had either no interest in or knowledge of the Goetheanum's true intentions. When it comes to visitor numbers, a comparison with the Mystery Dramas may be helpful: these plays are certainly less attractive to \"normal\" audiences than Faust, but they are still well attended after a running time of several years. The following questions need to be asked:1. Who commissioned the directors? 2. Who wanted this style of production that give no consideration to Rudolf Steiner's indications? 3. What is the extent of the material damage? 4. Who will take responsibility for the spiritual and material damage? 5. What steps will or have to be taken by those in charge? An in-depth report is urgently needed, particularly with regard to spiritual con - siderations. Countless members will have made donations, expecting that the new production would do justice to Rudolf Steiner's impulses. The material damage - which probably amounts to millions - also needs to be made known. It must therefore be allowed to ask about per - sonal responsibilities and consequences. We therefore ask the Executive Council to publish a detailed written report and to arrange for a members' day that can be moderated and shaped by several mem - bers and by supporters of this motion. Dornach, 9 February 2017 Thomas Heck, Eva Lohmann-Heck, GerdMari Savin, Angelika Schuster, Leon - hard Schuster, Roland T\u00fcscher Motion 5 Motion to change the motion pro- cedure in the GAS The often embarrassing and inappro - priate situations arising in the processing of motions are among the experiences that are painful for everyone involved in the annual general meetings of the GAS. This has been the case for decades, and anyone looking into the history of the GAS will find plenty of similar reports of embarrassing situations during annual general meetings. The problem emerged soon after Ru - dolf Steiner's death, culminated for the first time when members were excluded in 1935 following the motions submit -ted by members in agreement with the Executive Council members. There have always been vehement conflicts at AGMs between groups of members and the Ex - ecutive Council. Many members will re - member the situations in the 1990s and around the millennium. The possibility that members can make motions is highly valuable and is explicitly mentioned in the Bylaws of the Anthro - posophical Society as founded at Christ - mas 1923. This is particularly important because in these Bylaws Rudolf Steiner consciously refrained from using unnec - essary or even generally customary for - mulations. Members have taken the initiative in the past to change the motion procedure, on the one hand so as to make the annual general meetings run more smoothly (a deep and justified wish, especially of those members who travel to Dornach from all over the world), and on the other hand in order to create a legal organ that allows the members and the Executive Council to meet and share their views at eye-level. Karl Heyer relates, for instance, how he failed with such a motion as early as 1930 (source: Karl Heyer, 8/1950). The results of members' initiatives af - ter the millennium, which could only be dealt with within the GAS due to a reso - lution made at the 2001 annual general meeting, were not taken into consider - ation by the leadership of the Society. In - stead, the Executive Council tried repeat - edly, as part of the planned reactivation of the Christmas Conference Society on 28 and 29 December 2002, to restrict the possibility to make motions as much as possible (documented in Ein Nachrichten - blatt 4/2017 of 19 February 2017). The development against the demo - cratic participation of people in creative societal processes that can be observed in the world today must not prevail in our Society if we continue in our aspiration to be a model for the world. \"The Anthropo - sophical Society must unite people who feel that they are the centre of a move - ment that needs to grow in human civi - lization so that humanity can truly move forward and earthly life will not become decadent.\" (Rudolf Steiner, lecture of 2 May 1923, GA 224). The proposers of this 6 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 3/17 antroposophical society motion would therefore like to make a new attempt to develop within the Soci - ety an appropriate and fruitful organ of the legal life for dealing with members' motions. We move that the Annual General Meeting decide to \"ask the Executive Council to set up a work group that in - volves the Social Sciences Section and that will develop proposals for a motion procedure that is right for our time and ap - propriate for the GAS. The work group will report on its progress from time to time and one will aim to make a decision on its results by 2019.\" Dornach, 9 February 2017 Thomas Heck, Eva Lohmann-Heck, GerdMari Savin, Angelika Schuster, Leon - hard Schuster, Roland T\u00fcscher Motion 6 Motion to revoke the resolutions of 1935 At the Annual General Meeting of 14 April 1935 the following motion was made with regard to Ita Wegman and Elisabeth Vreede, and passed with great majority: Agenda items 3 and 4:\"Motion I. The Annual General Meeting of the General Anthroposophical Society of 14 April 1935 states that the two Executive Council members Dr Ita Wegman and Dr Elisabeth Vreede, who have expressed their disrespect of the will of the Society through actions which have self-exclusive character, will no longer be recognized as members. In accordance with the legal re - quirements, the Annual General Meeting decides that 'Dr Ita Wegman and Dr Elisabeth Vreede are excluded from the Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society'. The General Meeting decides that the persons mentioned are no longer entitled to act on behalf of the General Anthro - posophical Society.\" (Nachrichtenblatt 11-12/ 1935 of 17 March 1935). This motion was passed with 1691 af - firmative votes (76 against and 53 absten - tions). Although it has been known for decades that this motion and decision, in particular the \"memorandum\" of 1935 (cf. E. Zeylmans von Emmichoven, Who was Ita Wegman?, volume 3, Mercury Press) were based on false and incorrect claims, the resolution has never been formally revoked and a full investigation of these events within the society has never taken place. At the 1948 Annual General Meeting only parts of the resolutions of 14 April 1935 were revoked, and these did not re - fer to the exclusion of Elisabeth Vreede and Ita Wegman (see Nachrichtenblatt 16 of 18 April 1948 and Emil Leinhas, Ei - nige Gesichtspunkte zum sellschaft nach Rudolf Steiners Tod [Some aspects in explanation of the events in the Anthroposophical Society after Ru - dolf Steiner's death], published privately in 1963). The proposers of this motion think that now, after more than 80 years, it is time to formally revoke the decision of 1935. They therefore ask the Annual General Meeting to decide that \"We hereby revoke the decision taken at the Annual General Meeting of 14 April 1935 with regard to Motion I, item 3 of the agenda.\" Dornach, 9 Worldwide No. 3/17 | 7 The Biodynamic Association of India, the farms of Muhil/Karmuhil and the Section for Social Sciences at the Goethe - anum hosted the gathering at the Pillar Centre in Madurai, where attendees from all corners of the globe came together to discuss, listen, and share the challenges and new ideas emerging for social initia - tives. The welcoming location provided a warm space to meet, reflect and practise the social networking dynamics. Every morning began with exercises on rhythm and movement to awaken the body and the group spirit, followed by key lectures on the subjects of relationships (Joan Sleigh), society (Gerald H\u00e4fner) and caring for the Earth (Jean-Michel Florin). Social exercise sessions led by Joan Sleigh and alumni of the Anthroposophi - cal Studies at the Goetheanum, sought to bring a new level of depth to the words spoken in the lectures by giving partici - pants the chance to experience what it takes to forge meaningful relationships. The dynamics aimed to develop trust, ob - servation skills and cooperation. Understanding local life and customs The afternoon sessions provided ev - eryone with unique opportunities to understand the local life and customs of Madurai. A tour around the farms of Muhil/Karmuhil and Compost and Cow Pat Pit-making workshops gave everyone the chance to understand some of the pro - cesses involved in preparing the earth for biodynamic agriculture. \"The way in which Bio-Dynamic practices have been taken up reflects once again the great energy and above all the deep devotion with which India seems to take everything up, with great attention to detail and a mixture of stern pride in individual mastery, deep re - spect for the teacher and gentle humility towards the Gods,\" said Rob Small, founder of the Farm and Garden National Trust Presentations In the afternoon an open space was cre - ated for initiatives to present their achieve - ments and missions. Amongst the organi - zations presenting was Timbaktu, a collec - tive working in over 150 Indian villages for sustainable development, whose vision is for \"rural communities [to] take control of their own lives, govern themselves and live in social and gender harmony while main - taining a sustainable lifestyle\". Rob Small showed how they fight against poverty and unemployment in Cape Town through the creation of urban micro-farms managed by local people; and David Hogg from Naandi showed attend - ees the outstanding work that the foun - dation carries out to improve health, basic education and sustainable livelihoods for people in the region of Andhra Pradresh. Ute Cramer spoke about the Brazilian ini - tiatives of the Monte Azul community and the Childhood Alliance in Brazil. Florian Kraemer of Vulamasango in South Africa delighted everyone with im - ages of the children's performances around Europe, whilst Pinky Stuurman and Lusanda Bali, project managers and musical directors at the orphanage, gave a live performance: a beautiful gift that truly showed how deeply art touches the human soul. Everyone has a role to play There is an undeniable connection be - tween the state of the Earth, our bodies and the societies of which we are a part. Each of these elements influences and nurtures the other, offering the possibility to work from different disciplines - such as agriculture, medicine, education or social work - to begin a process of devel - oping and healing ourselves, our relation - ships and the environment. The mystery of this relationship broadens our horizons and allows us to ask what does it take from each one of us to support the move - ment towards healthier communities, relationships, lifestyles and ultimately a healthier environment for all beings on planet Earth. All of us, from our different standpoints and walks of life, can play a role. The WSIF 2016 speakers and partici - pants reminded us all of this and of how much could be achieved. The World Social Initiative Forum will continue to grow in 2017 by creating an online platform to showcase a variety of social initiatives aligned with anthropos - ophy, and working towards a more inclu - sive, freer society. A new website - www.wsif.org - is being developed and a team led by Joan Sleigh and the Social Sciences Section at the Goetheanum will manage the network, whose primary responsibil - ity will be to listen, research and under - stand the initiatives and their needs. If you know of a project that would like to become part of this growing communi - ty and could benefit from receiving news about projects, opportunities and events you can now get in touch with Elizabeth Kuriakose and Andrea De La Cruz of the WSIF team. | Andrea De La Cruz Barral, Guadarrrama (ES)India: World Social Initiative Forum Conference The Riddle of Relationship \"Healthy Earth, Healthy Body, Healthy Society: The Riddle of Relationship\" was the title of the most recent World Social Initiative Forum Conference, which took place in Madurai (IN) from 8 to 10 November 2016.

Anthroposophy We each have a role to play, whatever our standpoint or walk of life Foto: Elizabeth Kuriakose Contacts: Elizabeth Kuriakose, Elizabeth@wsif.orgAndrea De | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 3/17 Sebastian J\u00fcngel: What was your inner question in approaching this conference? Johanna Gunkel: The question was, 'How can each perception be stimulated and dealt with in a way that allows an artistic impulse to arise from it?' Because they are linked to perception the middle senses can be seen as gateways to the arts. This gives rise to more questions: What is the role of fostering sensory perception in contrast to working with the feeling world which is adjacent to it? What therapeutic task do these senses have as mediators between inner and outer worlds? How do we work with these senses in therapy? Making good what was neglected J\u00fcngel: What solutions do you have? Gunkel: Because human development pro - ceeds from the lower senses via the middle senses to the higher senses, it is important in therapy that the senses which were ne - glected are given the chance to catch up with their development. Last year's con - ference on the basic senses showed how strong an influence our very first sensory experience - the sense of touch - has on our life and how important it is to experi - ence boundaries, first of all physical bound - aries: Where does my body end, where does that of the other person begin? And then at the soul level: Where is my 'I'? Where is that of the other person? Finding the answer to these questions involves an essential pro - cess of individualization and 'I'-maturation. Take an example from the middle senses: the sense of taste: How do I make some - thing part of myself, as the beginning of an entirely individual digestive process?J\u00fcngel: What do clients appreciate most about art therapy?Gunkel: The non-verbal possibilities of art therapy are the main reason for its popu - larity. Something appears that cannot be put into words, but because the clients meet it - either on the paper in painting therapy, or in sound in music therapy, they can distance themselves from it and this is often helpful and constitutes a first step towards change. J\u00fcngel: What kind of content was offered at this conference? Gunkel: The sensory world is something uniquely individual - we each may perceive the same things, but our sensations are individual. The nervous system is formed through experience; the sensory world helps us to gain clarity about our own selves and to become individuals. Diversity thanks to an interprofessional approach J\u00fcngel: What are the central statements that can be derived from this conference? Gunkel: All the senses are interconnected and they are intimately linked with the lev - els of human existence. We had so many work groups and the most diverse interpro - fessional cooperation - such as music and visual art, modelling and medical aspects, psychotherapy and artistic speech, visual arts and eurythmy - there should really be a report from each of these groups! Research and work are being done in all of these fields. The method we used was interesting in that the presentations by Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler were worked on afterwards in twelve different seminar groups, each with its own approach. It is more difficult to derive particular state - ments from the artistic presentations and the project reports we had from all over the world. The creative and artistic involvement with the methods and approaches was in - tensive and was further enhanced in per - sonal conversations. J\u00fcngel: What did you personally find par - ticularly inspiring?Gunkel: I am personally really excited about meeting people from all corners of the world: the experience that anthropo - sophic art therapy is made available on all continents - by so many wonderful indi - viduals. This great thought inspires me, as did the experiences in my work group on light and darkness, based on Liane Col - lot d'Herbois: that you can really sense it physically when light is created on paper!Medical Section: Anthroposophic Art Therapies Conference \"The world of the senses is uniquely individual\" More than 150 art therapists, eurythmists, physicians and artists from several conti-nents attended the Anthroposophic Art Therapy Conference at the Goetheanum from 5 to 8 January 2017. Following their studies of the lower senses in 2016, their focus this year was on the middle senses.Sebastian J\u00fcngel: How do you recognize other Danes when you are abroad? Niels Henrik Nielsen: Usually from the very informal - sometime maybe too non - chalant - way they dress and behave.J\u00fcngel: What do you miss about Denmark when you are abroad? Nielsen: I always enjoy being abroad. I even used to be sad as a child when we came back to Denmark after being away. But as I grew older I 'discovered' how quaint and beautiful nature is in Denmark. The North Sea coast is truly unique: the elements interact here, creating the most wonderful music. I often miss that. And of course I miss my family, friends and col - leagues. Most of all I miss our bread, espe - cially the dark variety. Danish-German relations J\u00fcngel: Denmark and (Northern) Germany have a special relationship because each has members of the other living in it and they each recognize and grant special rights to this minority population. What makes these two peoples, who used to fight as well as support one another, so open to each other? Nielsen: It is a special kind of coexistence between the Danish minority in northern Germany and vice versa. The relationship between Denmark and Germany in gen - eral is rather complicated. My mother came from Germany; she ar - rived in Denmark in 1963. I have had close experience of the relationship between the Danish and German cultures (my fa - ther is Danish): for a long time Denmark depended on Germany culturally as well as economically. Many Danes admire Ger - many, but they also feel somehow inferior. World War II and the occupation of Den - mark have, on the other hand, created a deep sense of insecurity towards every - thing German. It has not always been easy for my mother to live in Denmark. Luckily, the situation has become more relaxed in the last 25 years. Nowadays we are occu - pied every summer by Germans, but they come with peaceful and friendly inten - tions - as tourists. J\u00fcngel: How much of the Viking mentality still lives in Denmark today? Nielsen: Today's image of the Viking men - tality is rather distorted: Vikings are seen as fearless, wild, 'mj\u00f6d' (mead)-guzzling, all-conquering warriors. But individualiza - tion and globalization play an important antroposophical society School of Spiritual Science Johanna Gunkel is one of the art therapy coordinators in the Medical Section at the Goetheanum International Art Therapy Conference on the four higher senses: 4 to 7 January 2018 Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 3/17 | 9 part now and the old forms are breaking down - as everywhere else. In this mood of departure one occasionally senses a kind of Viking nostalgia - a longing for a glori - ous past that one is proud of. We Danes have been a peaceful, open and tolerant people for a long time. But changes are underway; a certain polarization is taking place; a certain intolerance is noticeable in the media; people distance themselves and judge more easily. Floating rather than striving J\u00fcngel: What is Denmark striving for? Nielsen: That is difficult to say. I think we are struggling with the same problems as the other European countries. Maybe it is more appropriate to speak of floating rather than striving. J\u00fcngel: How does Denmark's spirituality express itself? Nielsen: That's another difficult question. Rudolf Steiner said that the Danish have the task to develop the 'I' in the intellec - tual soul - and we are struggling with this, also when it comes to spirituality. Spiritu - ality either becomes very abstract and dry, or the opposite: it manifests in spiritual feeling experiences (New Age). The well-known clairvoyant and spiritual scientist Martinus presented his teachings very systematically, using tables and symbols. Anthroposophy, on the other hand, speaks to the consciousness soul - this is really a challenge for us. I think that S\u00f8ren Kierkeg - aard, the philosopher, and Hans Christian Andersen, who is best known for his fairy tales, are eminent representatives of the Danish intellectual soul. J\u00fcngel: What is the role of anthroposophy or of the Anthroposophical Society in this? Nielsen: Not a big one, certainly not in the public life. And yet, I am convinced that the anthroposophical work has an effect - which will, however, only become appar - ent in the future. State-funded Waldorf Schools J\u00fcngel: Is it good for the Waldorf move - ment that there are so many private schools in Denmark? Nielsen: Yes and no. Private schools have a tradition in Denmark; they are regulated by the law and given quite a lot of free - dom. The state pays around 75 per cent of the school fees. This means we are still relatively free in the way we work in our schools. But there is also competition, and I am not sure if that is a good thing. I think it has the effect that Waldorf schools are less visible. But opinions diverge on this point. J\u00fcngel: How do you see your role as gen - eral secretary: more like an administrator, manager, healer or pastor? Nielsen: I am \"only\" a general secretary. Troels Ussing is still president. I see my task mainly as a facilitator between Dorn - ach, the other countries and Denmark. But I also see that I need to get a sense of how the Danish anthroposophical work reso - nates with the work in the world. It will take a few years to find my way. But I feel really positive after getting to know the other general secretaries and the Execu - tive Council members. J\u00fcngel: Does being a musician help? Nielsen: I think so. Music is, among other things, a future image for the social life. My work as a musician is very limited now. I used to do a lot of ensemble music. Liv - ing with the great works of classical music has instilled in me a sense of what social forms and time processes could be like - but for now they remain ideals. How I am doing in this respect in actual life situa - tions is for others to say. The School of Spiritual Science J\u00fcngel: What kind of research is typical of the School of Spiritual Science in Den - mark?Nielsen: For many years the School of Spiritual Science was identical with the Class lessons. But that is gradually chang - ing now. There is active section work go - ing on and people meet regularly to share their ideas about various questions. As far as I can see there is no actual spiritual research going on, however. But there are people who address and study various questions competently. The Danish sci - entist Jens-Otto Andersen, for instance, has gained international acclaim with his work on capillary dynamolysis. J\u00fcngel: What needs doing? Nielsen: First of all, a genuine connection needs to be made between the School of Spiritual Science, its fields of practical ap - plication and the Society. Then one needs to find the people who are able and willing to conduct scientific research. At the mo - ment we are trying to establish among our Council members and Lectors what spiri - tual research actually is. Maybe the answer to that question must not be too narrow. The tasks of the School of Spiritual Science also include the arts and universally human aspects - both of which are important for people's spiritual and vocational needs. While it is very im - portant to have an academic and scientific orientation, I can see a great danger if this becomes too one-sided and if there is too much adaptation. J\u00fcngel: Last question: what did you play with as a child? Be honest - was it Lego? Nielsen: No, it was Playmobil. antroposophical society Niels Henrik Nielson: musician, teacher, general secretaryDenmark: New general secretary Niels Henrik Nielsen \"The effects of anthroposophy will become apparent in future\" Niels Henrik Nielsen was born in Denmark in 1964. After spending 18 months in Camphill Scotland, he started work as a cellist at the Music College and spent many years playing in orchestras and chamber ensembles. He is married to a pianist and the couple have two daughters (15 and 18). He is now a Waldorf teacher working in teacher training. www.rudolfsteiner.dk10 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 3/17 Sebastian J\u00fcngel: Norway has the high - est standard of living in the world - even higher than Switzerland. Do you agree with this estimation from the World Eco - nomic Forum's report on growth and de - velopment?Ingrid Reistad: Yes, as regards material standards, Norway is certainly right at the top. This makes life in Norway very com - fortable and easy, in some respects. But prosperity also has its dark sides. One of them is that one feels so comfortable that one becomes a bit \"sleepy\". In my view, this undermines one's sympathy and un - derstanding for people and nations whose situation is very different, because their reality bears no resemblance to one's own. Secondly, a society with a high standard of living also generates high expectations. Young people in Norway often have to cope with pressures - to succeed and to be perfect - and that is not always easy. Living at the edge of Europe J\u00fcngel: What is your present perception of the Norwegian attitude towards life? Reistad: In his book \"Europe, Europe\", Hans Magnus Enzensberger describes Norway as an anachronism. We have material wealth with social and private security on the one hand. Everyday life is managed by mobile phone and Apps; banking, train tickets, shopping, commu - nication - all done by smartphone. On the other hand there is the dream of authentic nature experiences, of the simple life and its traditions. The two have been discon - nected for some time. I often say: in Norway we live at the edge of Europe. We are connected with the whole world, we are informed about everything, we live in a kind of prosper - ity vacuum where old traditions are no longer viable and where difficult global events are easily brushed aside. Living in this kind of discrepancy is challenging for individuals. But there are also many posi - tive initiatives, started by younger or older people: projects to do with environmental awareness and sharing economy in par - ticular. But it is difficult to be an activist in a country where everything is \"just so\". Second language: new-Norwegian J\u00fcngel: Norwegian literature is influential outside your country too. Henrik Ibsen is a theatre classic; Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd's auto - biography has become a bestseller. How do Norwegian's relate to language? Reistad: Norwegians are avid readers. Lots of books are written in Norway, thrillers above all. We also have many dialects and therefore have a second official language: new-Norwegian, our written language. It makes it possible to keep dialects alive, also in the public life. Most Norwegians speak English well and, because of the af - finity of the Scandinavian languages, they are also understood by speakers of Danish and Swedish. Because ours is not a global language, we need to know at least one foreign language in order to widen our own linguistic sphere.J\u00fcngel: Is there anything about the Nor - wegian cultural life that is too little known?Reistad: Many things. But anything that is not expressed in English will hardly be received outside Scandinavia. We have some very good poets in Norway, for in - stance. One of my favourite poets is Hans Brli, who managed, in his poems, to blend subtle nature observations with in - ner spiritual experiences. It is this gentle interweaving of natural and human as - pects that you find with many Norwegian poets. We also have some very good comedians in Norway; they can certainly be seen as part of the cultural-spiritual life. Their as - tute observation and analysis of society and human beings are very much to the point. Sometimes the comedians are the only ones who can speak the truth. No slaves to authority J\u00fcngel: What, in your eyes, is Norway's spiritual contribution to the world?Reistad: One aspect has been demon - strated by the poets: the human spirit-soul working in harmony with nature; in other words, the experience of the spiri - tual in nature and finding one's own 'I' as spirit. There is one other quality that is particular to us Norwegians: we don't like authority; we don't like to be told what to do. We could also put it negatively and say we have a certain tendency to stubborn - ness and complacency. Yet, in conjunction with prosperity and detachedness from old traditions that are no longer relevant this quality could be a wonderful basis for free initiatives and deeds. J\u00fcngel: What is the role of the Anthropo - sophical Society in Norway in this?Reistad: Anthroposophy is no unknown quantity - thanks to earlier and present writers. In literary, and increasingly also in academic circles anthroposophy is talked about and sometimes controversially dis - cussed. The Anthroposophical Society, on the other hand, is not so well known. I do hope, however, that we can become more prominent in the future, and I believe that our love of self-determination in particu - lar will make it possible for us to develop new ideas and take new steps within the Anthroposophical Society. J\u00fcngel: Is the Anthroposophical Society in Norway well equipped for its tasks?Reistad: We are doing our best. It is im - portant to point out that individuals in the Anthroposophical Society have done much over time to support the anthropo - sophical work.Norway: New contact Ingrid Reistad \"A place where the future comes to life\" In September 2014 Frode Barkved stepped down as general secretary and, after a transition period, Ingrid Reistad became the contact person for the Anthroposophical Society in Norway in April 2016. Ingrid Reistad is a eurythmist, kindergarten teacher and a lecturer at the Oslo University College for Waldorf Education. antroposophical society Ingrid Reistad: eurythmist, early years' teacher, lecturer Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 3/17 | 11 antroposophical society New ways of nurturing the spiritual life J\u00fcngel: How do you intend to increase the activities of the Anthroposophical Society in Norway? Reistad: We want to maintain and strengthen our public presence. We also want to develop the good cooperation we have within our organization. It is high time, however, to develop new ways and forms of cultivating the spiritual life. My wish is that spiritual exercises become as normal and matter-of-fact as the physical exercises are that we do to keep fit. For this the gap, which some people still ex - perience between the spiritual life and ev - eryday reality, needs to be bridged; we can achieve this, for instance, by working even more concretely with anthroposophy, spiritually and practically in our everyday lives. That would certainly be a positive and enjoyable endeavour. J\u00fcngel: What should the Anthroposophi - cal Society in Norway be in the coming years? Reistad: We can always dream! I would wish that the Society becomes a place where people experience the reality of the spirit-soul through their own actions, be it through artistic activity or meditation; a place of study, research and discussion; a place where the future comes to life - through lively exchange with anyone who wishes for a spiritual dimension in their life. J\u00fcngel: What is the situation of the School of Spiritual Science in Norway? What kind of research is being done there?Reistad: The following sections are active in Norway: - General Anthroposophical Section, - Pedagogical Section, - the Section for the Performing Arts, - The Social Sciences Section and the Medical Section, which includes the Agri - cultural Section. There is no actual research going on in those sections right now, but work is be - ing done to deepen various topics, and individual members of the Pedagogical Section are involved in research projects elsewhere. New translation of the Class lessons In the autumn of 2016 a new translation of the nineteen Class lessons was pub - lished and offered to the Class members. This was an important achievement and highly welcome. The language of this Nor - wegian translation is very good and makes it possible for people to study the lessons in their own language. Several Class members have expressed the wish to make these texts also avail - able to members of the Anthroposophical Society who have not joint the Class yet. This is something that needs to be dis - cussed further and that would certainly require further work on the texts. J\u00fcngel: Some of your colleagues have re - vealed something about themselves that others would not necessarily expect. How is that with you?Portugal: Light Eurythmy Ensemble From Faust to Saint Odile From 20 to 22 January 2017 the first Portu-guese national Waldorf Teachers' Confer - ence was held in Lisbon. The Light Euryth - my Ensemble from Arlesheim was there. More than 150 teachers and students from diverse anthroposophical education initiatives came together in the premises of Lus\u00f3fona University. The mood was inspiring and intensive. Pedro Miguel, one of the organizers, said there was so much interest in this event that not all applicants could be accepted - so everyone is looking forward to the next conference. The Light Eurythmy Ensemble was in - vited to provide the artistic programmes in the evenings. On the first day they pre - sented a public performance, to a packed auditorium, with eurythmy scenes from Goethe's Faust. Pamela Lippke, who is a eurythmist at the Waldorf School on the Algarve, pointed out in her address that this was the first ever public eurythmy performance in Portugal. A second performance for conference members, with an introduction and dem - onstrations, rounded off the second eve - ning. Hans-Peter Strumm and Sonja Wudy presented two eurythmy workshops on artistic and pedagogical eurythmy as part of the conference programme. On 22 January the ensemble travelled further north to visit Casa de Santa Isabel, a curative education centre in S\u00e3o Rom\u00e3o, where they also gave two eurythmy perfor - mances, this time featuring the legend of Saint Odile. Here too, they received a very warm welcome, from Fernanda and Fritz Wessling. | Sonja Wudy, Oftersheim (DE) Petition No to the digital Kindergarten At the symposium entitled \" A right to childhood - the responsibility lies with us\", which was held in Hamburg (DE) on 19 November 2016, the former leader of the Medical Section in Dornach, Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, and the neurosci-entist Manfred Spitzer, among others, initiated a petition against the digitali-zation of early years' education. Their aim is to collect a minimum of 100,000 signatures by 21 May 2017. 28,600 people have signed so far (as of 20 ry). | Sebastian J\u00fcngel Sign online: Ensemble www.eurythmie.com12 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 3/17 Forum In light of the present confu - sion and disastrous events in the world I would like to appeal to everyone who knows and appreciates the idea of social threefolding to join forces and spread the basic ideas underly - ing this concept among more and more people in the world. Common sense tells us that three vital forces are needed for human beings to live to - gether peacefully. Together these forces preserve the life of any social organism. As human beings we each - make sure that our needs are met; - help to shape and adhere to social agreements and rules; - place our own faculties and ideas in the service of the community when we work. In this process one will expe - rience oneself as another - in - wardly transformed - person, and one will get a sense of how the three areas mentioned re - late to the three great ideals of modern humanity: fraternity, equality and freedom. New thoughts There are plenty of indica - tions by Rudolf Steiner that can give us orientation for our task of disseminating the impulses of social threefolding. The ap - peal, which has been expressed in many places, \"to bring new thoughts into people's heads\", is as relevant today as it was a hundred years ago (GA 185a, lecture of 17 November 1918). The thoughts put forward in the book Towards Social Re - newal are still new today, even if the book needs to be modi -fied and adapted for today's readers in accordance with Ru - dolf Steiner's wishes in regard to the evolving social organism. Today we are no longer, as Rudolf Steiner was, dealing with the \"unused intelligence\" of a proletariat of European industrialized countries at the end of a horrible war. Today there is a worldwide move - ment of people who have a strong sense of justice and who are seeking ways out of the chaos of today's crises in the midst of a global war that has been going on for decades, be - tween rich and poor. In this war countless people have fallen victim to hunger, displacement and even violent death. New communities Many of the communities, initiatives and free organiza - tions that are emerging all over the world follow the voice of their conscience and their sense of moral responsibility. They become active and take steps to protect and bring peace to the earth and to cre - ate a more dignified life. Could they become the force that will fundamentally renew the social life? How can we reach them? We should consider what Rudolf Steiner said in a lecture in November 1918, where he pointed out that social renew - al was only possible on a large scale, not \"in some piecemeal fashion [...] or [...] in a small way\" (GA 185a, lecture of 22 November 1918). What Rudolf Steiner said about the way he explained so - cial threefolding in the spring of 1919 is impressive, \"We were able to reach the broad masses. It gradually dawned on them what the impulse of the threefold social organism was about. [...] People only have dif - ficulties understanding this be - cause they are unable to leave their old thinking patterns be - hind. [...]\" (GA 76, lecture of 8 April 1921) Knowing how other people live What Rudolf Steiner said to the Swiss members in Dornach on 3 October 1919 can help to overcome any reluctance, \"If everything depended on people first becoming anthro - posophists before they can apply the right social thinking, it might well be much, much too late. We therefore have to consider placing the three - folding idea into the world by itself - even if that means that it rests on less solid founda - tions. [...] It will be necessary, however, that this threefold - ing idea is corroborated [...] by the way the members of the anthroposophical movement live their lives [...]. We must try to represent a social life that people can see as trust-inspir - ing because of the way you are representing it, even if it is not possible for us to establish the anthroposophical foundations fast enough.\" Rudolf Steiner then went on to speak about the right way of representing this social movement, saying that \"we need to get rid of the habit of walking past people without knowing what kind of life they live.\" The same message also speaks clearly out of the ap - peal Rudolf Steiner addressed to his listeners on 14 April 1919 in Dornach, outlining as our task \"to spread enlightenment [...] and teach people to change the way they think, [...] teach them in a universal way about what is needed [...] and put these ideas into practice\" (GA 190). These words show the ne - cessity to bring new thoughts into people's heads and hearts against the resistance of old concepts. They tell us that this cannot happen on a small scale, but that the wider public needs to be addressed and that we cannot wait with teaching people about the right social thinking until we have become anthroposophists because it could be too late by then. Summary Many people need to be aware of this shared task and join forces, since otherwise the goal of making the social threefolding impulse fertile in the world cannot be achieved. We must prepare ourselves for the possibilities and ways of introducing the social three - folding impulse in national and international work groups in a way that is suitable for our time. An important first step in this direction has been taken by Rainer Schnurre with his Appeal (\"Auf-Ruf\"), see Anthro - page Sch\u00f6ne, Witten (DE)Appeal: 100 Years of Threefolding No more waiting As we approach the centenary of the social threefolding impulse considerations are afoot on how one could go about making Ru- dolf Steiner's social ideas more widely known. Ulrich Sch\u00f6ne has collated a few thoughts on the topic. The original version of this abridged contribution is avail-able from the author.

Usher and Tho-mas O'Keefe in Anthroposo-phy Worldwide 1-2/2017 I took part in the 2016 Goethe - anum World Conference and witnessed the events described by Justus Wittich in Anthro - posophy Worldwide 12/2016 from up close. I also attended the exhibition in question. My impression is that Ste - phen E. Usher and Thomas O'Keefe picked a detail out of its context and communicated it - pointedly - to the anthro - posophical public using various routes including flyers, emails and newssheets. It surely is no more than a detail. The exhi - bition showed 30 artistic im - ages and the exhibition guide contains 22 short citations from contemporaries or later authors regarding their 'im - age' of Rudolf Steiner. One was a citation taken from Helmut Zander's attempt at a Steiner biography. If comments, then comments on all citations None of the very different citations gives the impression that it reflects the \"opinion\" of the Goetheanum's Documen - tation Department, especially because they are so varied. It would be rather strange to ask for such an opinion. One does find differentiated comments in catalogues of major exhi - bitions and such a catalogue would be highly interesting in this case, too, since it could provide historical context on the diverse author personali - ties, but not on Zander alone, please! Asking the Documentation Department for a comment on the Zander citation only looks like calling for an \"authorita - tive opinion\" - something that would better be avoided. It on - ly needs a bit of inner distance and common sense to see the citation, in the context of this exhibition, for what it is, even if one belongs to the \"less in - formed\" whose advocate Ste - phen E. Usher claims to be. Zander speaks about himself The Zander citation con - tains no image of Rudolf Stein - er, merely speculation. The style of the presentation says more about Zander himself than its content does about Rudolf Steiner. Unlike the other citations, which reflect person - al experiences, Zander claims universality while his thoughts about Rudolf Steiner lack any experiential foundation: with Steiner it could be like this, or like that, or it could be dif - ferent altogether. First there is the thesis that the \"snow\" Steiner mentioned may have referred to cocaine. But be - cause this has long been dis - carded - a fact which Helmut Zander omits to mention - he goes one step back and points out that Steiner's decades-long occupation with \"meditative practices\" would hardly be rec - oncilable with the consump - tion of cocaine. But here he also has reservations: Steiner as an esoteric disciple had remained \"largely concealed to us\" - these are the words of a univer - sity professor who claims uni - versality, for it would have to be \"to him\", or in his words \"to me\". Zander ignores Steiner's detailed descriptions of paths of esoteric experience that re - move any doubts as to Steiner's esoteric discipleship. This dis - cipleship is therefore anything but \"concealed\". It seems that Zander did not personally ven - ture on any of these paths and therefore lacked the personal experience that would have al - lowed him to have an opinion on the subject. We will not hold this against him, however. But if he is not really interested in Steiner's path of inner develop -ment - which is the crux of the matter - it remains a mystery why he studies him so keenly. Zander \"speaks\" less about Steiner than about himself: from a great distance, he pres - ents a few hypothetical state - ments about Steiner which in actual fact characterize his own scientific approach - they are parts of a self-portrait. Open to conversation In my experience Johannes Nilo, head of the Documenta - tion Department, and Bodo von Plato, as a member of the Executive Council, are always open to conversation, even with the \"dissatisfied\". Such a conversation can also take place by phone or email. Why was this way not chosen in - stead of rushing to hand out flyers at the Goetheanum World Conference? | Uwe Wer - ner, Malauc\u00e8ne (FR) There have always been those in the history of the world who spread horrible lies about highly developed indi - vidualities. Luckily the human 'I' is strong enough to differen - tiate and to not give credence to such lies and malice or al - low them to be spread. I am sure that Rudolf Steiner would never pay any attention to such calumnies. By disseminating such statements one feeds the adversary forces. One needs to know them, but not propagate them! Serious disciples of an - throposophy would take such a situation as an opportunity for more intense inner, spiritual work, so that the shining force of our spiritual-scientific path of knowledge can unfold and lies can be transformed into truth. | Aban Bana, Mumbai (IN)\"Ars Herbaria\" author affec- ted by earthquake in Italy Last summer my husband and I moved to the central Marche region of Italy in order to set up a small study cen - tre and a school for medicinal plants in the commune of Ga - gliole. This medieval village was badly damaged in the recent earthquake; our house next to St. Michael's church is now uninhabitable - as is the entire walled-in centre of this ancient village: of the 650 inhabitants 300, us included, live in shelters or share flats in quakeproof houses. All of central Italy has been affected by the tremors and the earth has not calmed down yet. Thousands of animals are left in the cold outside, many are dying; schools threaten to collapse and snowfall has made the whole situation even more difficult.

Adriana was still at school when she heard the call of a world that lay beyond the reach of the physical sens - es. As a psychologist and active scientist she was disappointed with the image of the human being that prevailed in her field of work. Always in search of the essence, she moved in her six - ties, also as a poet, among the upright people who informed the cultural life in her country and made no compromises with the communist regime. Some people were arrested as a consequence and Adriana Onofrei had to leave her re - search work behind. At the age of 34 she was faced with the unexpected death of her fianc\u00e9 and friend. Three years later, her destiny led her to meet anthroposo -phy. Later she would say, \"My life suddenly had a very differ - ent substance; my existence received new dimensions and goals.\" One could add, \"Her po - etic talent was also given wings. The Societatea Anthroposofi c din Rom\u00e2nia (SAR) which was founded in 1928, and banned in 1947, could be newly founded in 1990. Adriana was a member of its council for many years. With her deep affinity to lan - guage she - with two or three others - worked on translating the Mystery Dramas, the Class lessons and other works by Ru - dolf Steiner. From around 2009 onwards, her fruitful work was unfortunately increasingly im - peded by a debilitating illness. In the early morning of 6 No - vember 2016 Adriana Onofrei was released from her suffer - ing. | Gheorghe Paxino, Stutt - gart (DE) School of Spiritual Science Section for the Literary Arts and Humanities Antropososche Vereniging in Nederland Chymical Wedding The Alchemy of the Soul in Imaginations, 5 to 7 May 2017 The images of the Chymical Wedding never cease to invite us to unlock their secret and experience the initiation of Christian Rosenkreutz, because they reveal to us the journey of the human soul to the spirit. In October 2016 a conference on this subject was held by the Anthroposophical Society in Holland. Amsterdam and The Hague are cities which have a strong connection with Jacob Boehme and the Rosicrucians. Some of the artists involved in that conference will now present motifs from those seven days, expressed through eurythmy. We were also able to secure a bril - liant exhibition (\"Divine Wisdom and Divine Nature\") Rosicrucian manuscripts from Amsterdam's Bibliotheca Herme - tika, an excellent collection of original esoteric documents from the hermetic and Rosicrucian traditions. The conference will also focus on the individuality of Christian Rosenkreutz and the impor - tance of Rosicrucianism for the future of anthroposophy. | Chris - tiane Haid and Jaap Sijmons Section for the Literary Arts and Humanities Cultural Science Research Group (Hochschulkreis f\u00fcr Kulturwissenschaften) General Anthroposophical Society Riddles of the Soul Fundamentals of Human Threefoldness in the Age of the Con - sciousness Soul, 19 to 21 May 2017 Rudolf Steiner referred to his work \"Riddles of the Soul\", in which he developed the functional-anatomical threefoldness of the human organism, as the \"justification of the anthroposophi - cal path of knowledge\". As the result of his research it forms the basis of the anthroposophical image of the human being and is an inspiring foundation for understanding the scientific nature of this image. But this conference will not only dwell on scientific-theoretical or philosophical questions, but also consider the trans - formed reality of life resulting from such anthropological three - folding. Aside from fundamental questions regarding \"Riddles of the Soul\" we will deal with the practical effects of the threefold human image in medicine, education, agriculture, social science, in the Youth Section and in general anthroposophy. In composing the Foundation Stone Meditation of the Anthroposophical Soci - ety Rudolf Steiner crystallized this research result into the central meditation of world and self-knowledge. It can be the foundation stone for communal activity in a society and school. We would like to make this initial moment of the threefolding impulse, its social and spiritual dimension, accessible to as many people as possible. Interpretation into other languages will be provided if a minimum of twenty speakers of that language apply. | Christiane Haid, Eckart F\u00f6rster, Harald Schwaetzer, the last crane Adriana Onofrei The last crane in these parts am I Flying towards the \"Light shine forth!\" Above me infinite skies - Below, boundless, ocean's chalice And around me such expanses That my heart grows dense with fear And a prayer is my flight: May my wings carry me!

After 1919 he lived in Belgrade (RS), where he finished the Terazije primary school (1924 to 1928) and completed his sec - ondary education (1928-1936). In 1936 he enrolled in the depart - ment of Mechanical Engineering, University of Belgrade, where he finished the two preparatory years. From 1939 to 1940 he at - tended the School for reserve officers in Sarajevo. He was in the war from 4 to 15 April 1941, when he was captured. Vojislav spent the rest of the war in an officers' prisoner-of-war camp in Germany. He was liberated by the Americans, and returned to Belgrade on 30 June 1945. From 1946 to 1958, he first worked as a senior technician in the technical administration, and subsequently as a freelance designer and a technical direc - tor of a small company, \"Invest- Import\". From 1959 to 1978, he worked in foreign trade in the export of complex industrial in - stallations. He went three times, for extended periods, to India, Burma, Sudan, Vietnam and Brazil. He retired in July 1978. Commitment to anthroposophy In 1953, he encountered an - throposophy through Slobodan Velicki. He was in the inner circles of anthroposophists in Belgrade. Since his retirement, he was working as a translator and writ - er. Starting in 1988 and up until today, he put a special emphasis on the threefold social order and on attempts to spiritualize cul - ture (in the manner of R. Steiner): For the arts: he wrote five dra - All Want That,\" \"Grand trans - lations \"Esoteric and Poems (selection)\" by Nova in Pracht, \"Excerpts from Eurythmy\" by Wolfgang Veit. For science, he wrote The mathematical approach to spiritual science\", On Science,\" (translated into English), \"On Na - ture\", \"Let's put our thinking into order\"; he translated Andre Bjer - ke's Goethe versus Newton.\" For history, he wrote \"Esoter - ic interpretation of Serbian folk poems ,\" Decline of the West, yes or no,'' \"At the end of the twentieth century\",\" Historical symptomatology,\" Peter de Ro - sa Writes, I Comment \", \"What is of the present and what is of the past in human thinking\". For religion, he wrote The Christian Mystery\" (translated into English), \"Masonic order of Henry Tort-Nougu\u00e8s\", On Je - suitism \", The interview with Danilo Lazic\". Copies and online blog For geopolitics, he wrote Four double streams towards the Serbs\", \"Call to Serbian people.\" For the renewal of culture, he wrote Belgrade, a city of free spiritual life\", Proposal to amend the Constitution\", \"Ac - quiring knowledge and mor - als\", Threefold social order.\" Theatres and publishers re - fused all of his work.

This means, however, that the af - fairs of the Irish Society are conducted in two currencies - the pound sterling (GBP) and the euro (EUR) - yet the Society makes its remittances to the Goetheanum via a euro account held in Germany. This ar - rangement is presumably designed to mi - nimise exchange rate 'losses', but is it not possible instead to conduct our affairs on the basis of a world currency - not, how - ever, as the instrument of a supranational economy or central bank. Not to effect monetary affairs, but to reflect them. Building a bridge across Europe In the case of Ireland the need was twofold. Firstly, to avoid either of the na - tional currencies being our official or pre - ferred currency, yet enabling members in each currency area to see (and think) the Society's affairs with the ease that is as - sured when they are presented in one's 'own' currency. Secondly, in order to evalu - ate and indeed 'see' our link to the General Society. For this one needs to be able to 'read' in the currency used by that society, which is the Swiss franc (CHF). Accord - ingly, the Irish Society's finances are now conducted in three currencies - HIB, EUR and GBP - with the Hibernia valued 1:1 to the Swiss franc. So much game-playing? Trivialising the Hibernia Mysteries? Maybe, but probably not. The world is not entirely asleep. Just after we published our budget in Hiber - nias the Irish Republic issued a 2 Euro coin depicting Hibernia with an image reminis - cent of Samothrace's Nike (see pictures). Here is not the place to reiterate the many things Rudolf Steiner said about Hiber - nia, but it is interesting to consider some things he did not say - at least not directly. For example, Hibernia preceded the sub -sequent history of Ireland, especially that portion of its history as the first, and possibly worst-treated of England's colonies. Or that from Ireland as a whole we can hopefully build a bridge that arches across Europe, from Hiber - nia to Golgotha. For such a bridge is urgently needed. The Hibernia Mysteries In 1998, two Swiss colleagues - Marc Desaules (Treasurer and General Secre - tary of the Swiss Anthroposophical So - ciety) and Anita Grandjean, co-founder with Marc of L'Aubier near Neuchatel - and I published research into the links be - tween global money when understood as accounting, Rudolf Steiner's ideas about money, and the essential characteristics of the Hibernia Mysteries. In essence we suggested links be - tween: i) Trading (represented by income and expense accounts), the saying \"I am knowledge but I lack being\", and the fact that the male/sun/winter pillar returned to its original shape when pressed against - a fact reflected in the closing or bringing to zero of all ac - counts at year end, and ii) Capitalisation of capacities (represent - ed by the balance sheet), the saying \"I am phantasy but I lack truth\", and the fact that the female/moon/summer pillar retained any impressions made in it - a fact reflected in the fact that the values on a balance sheet do not disappear. Creating a currency matched to the Swiss franc enables the Society world - wide to operate above all national curren - cies. It can then 'see' its worldwide nature directly in its own accounts. For example, if we know there will be an event some - where in the world we can use funds al -ready held there, or else seek or generate them 'locally'. This is not a complex mat - ter; ask any foreign currency dealer. The difference is that the Hibernia currency is an instrument for perceiving the world - wide economy of the Anthroposophical Society/Movement, not a means of prof - iting from exchange rate differ - ences. The Hibernia flows would be one-way - to - wards (or should that be from?) the future as it unfolds through the will life, for which donations are the best medium. Ex - change rates only become problems when the amount of money available for giving away is not enough to cover such problems or when one expects money to come back - as is the case where econom - ic life relies on lending. The community of humanity In all this it may be that the Irish An - throposophical Society is punching above its weight - the more so because it aims to remit the full amount due per member to the Goetheanum, something very few national societies currently do. But in fi - nance, as in much else in life, things subtle have more significance than things gross. 'Leverage', for example, can be under - stood as financial 'homeopathy'. And then there is timing, world timing - as Daniel Dunlop might have put it - concerning which three final observations: Firstly, were it to adopt the Hibernia, the General Anthroposophical Society would stand 'free' of the Swiss franc, en - abling one to see more clearly the karma of locating the Goetheanum in a particu - lar 'corner' of Europe now known as Swit - zerland. Secondly, the risk of the Swiss franc being usurped by the euro would also become evident. Thirdly, the fact that the Irish Society straddles two countries would not be affected by 'Brexit'. National currencies keep old habits and old enmities alive. However, 'Europa' refers to humanity as a whole, not to a particular region on earth or political bloc, still less to supernations and their curren - cies, for which the European Union and the euro are forerunners. Nothing of this kind informs the Hibernia. | Christopher Houghton Budd, Folkestone (GB)A currency for the Goetheanum The Hibernia Christopher Houghton Budd, treasurer of the Anthroposophical Society in Ireland, has created a virtual currency, the Hibernia, which he thinks can serve the better percep - tion of financial streams within the Anthroposophical Society and movement. He sug-gests that the Goetheanum should use this currency too. "}
