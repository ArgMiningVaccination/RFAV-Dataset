Valmet is also a plaintiff in several lawsuits. Valmet announced on December 22, 2016, that it has received a reassessment decision from the Finnish tax authority for Valmet Technologies Inc. The reassessment decision is a result of a tax audit carried out in the company, concerning tax years 2010-2012. During the first quarter 2017 Valmet paid additional taxes, late payment interests and penalties in total of EUR 19 million related to the reassessment decision. Valmet considers the Finnish tax authority's decision unfounded and has appealed of the decision. Valmet's management does not expect to the best of its present understanding that the outcome of these lawsuits, claims and disputes will have a material adverse effect on Valmet in view of the grounds currently presented for them, provisions made, insurance coverage in force and the extent of Valmet's total business activities. Corporate Governance Statement and Remuneration Report Valmet has published a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2020, which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies. These reports also cover other central areas of corporate governance, and they have been published on Valmet's website, separately from the Report of the Board of Directors, at www.valmet.com/governance .

Share-based incentive plans Valmet's share-based incentive plans are part of the remuneration program for Valmet's key personnel. The aim of the plans is to align the interests of the shareholders and the key employees in order to increase the value of Valmet in the long run, to steer the key employees towards achieving the Company's selected strategic targets, to commit the key employees to the Company, and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on holding the Company's shares. Any shares to be potentially awarded are, or have been, acquired through public trading, and therefore the incentive plans have no diluting effect on the share value. Long-term incentive plan 2018-2020 In December 2017, the Board of Directors of Valmet Oyj approved a long-term share-based incentive plan for Valmet's key employees. The plan included three performance periods, which were the calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Valmet's Board of Directors decided on the performance criteria and targets in the beginning of each performance period. The plan was directed to approximately 130 participants (including Executive Team members, key employees and management talents). Performance period 2018 2019 2020 Incentive based on Comparable EBITA as a percentage of net sales, and orders received growth in the stable business Comparable EBITA as a percentage of net sales, and orders received growth in the stable business Comparable EBITA as a percentage of net sales, and orders received growth in the stable business Reward payment In spring 2019 In spring 2020 In spring 2021 Total gross number of shares Review, January-March 2021 | 18In its meeting on December 17, 2020, the Board of Directors of Valmet decided to use the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting held on June 16, 2020, to repurchase the Company's own shares.

The share acquisitions began on February 10, 2021 and ended on February 12, 2021. The total number of shares acquired was 100,000. The shares were acquired at market price in public trading on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. In the same meeting, Valmet's Board of Directors also decided on a directed share issue related to the reward payment of Valmet's long-term share-based incentive plan for the discretionary period 2020. In the share issue on March 15, 2021, a total of 82,375 Valmet's treasury shares were conveyed without consideration to the participants of the plan, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan. Long-term incentive plan 2021-2023 In its meeting on December 17, 2020, the Board of Directors of Valmet Oyj decided on new share-based long-term incentive plans, a Performance Share Plan and a Deferred Share Plan, for Valmet's key employees. Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan is directed to the Executive Team members. It includes a three- year performance period parallel to a one-year performance period. Valmet's Board of Directors decides on the predefined performance measures and targets in the beginning of each performance period. Performance period 2021 2021-2023 Incentive based on Comparable EBITA as a percentage of net sales, and orders received growth in the stable businessPredefined strategic target for a three- year performance period Reward payment In spring 2022 In spring 2024 Deferred Share Plan The Deferred Share Plan is directed to other key employees and management talents.

Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2021 | 19The Board of Directors of Valmet Oyj approved in December 2017 a share ownership recommendation for Valmet's Executive Team members. All members of the Executive Team are recommended to own and hold an amount of Company shares equaling to their gross annual base salary (100 percent ownership recommendation). At the end of the reporting period, the Company held 391,268 treasury shares related to the share-based incentive programs. More information about share-based incentive plans can be found in Valmet's Remuneration Report, which is available at www.valmet.com/governance . Resolutions of Valmet's Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting 2021 was held in Helsinki on March 23, 2021. The Annual General Meeting adopted the Financial Statements for 2020 and discharged the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the 2020 financial year. In respect of the approval of the Remuneration Report 2020, the majority of votes objected to the approval of the Remuneration Report. The decision is advisory. Valmet will further analyze the voting recommendations and voting results in order to ensure that the remuneration report will better meet the shareholders' expectations. The Annual General Meeting approved the Board of Directors' proposals concerning authorizing the Board to decide on repurchasing the Company's own shares and to decide on the issuance of shares and the issuance of special rights entitling to shares. The Annual General Meeting decided to pay dividends of EUR 0.90 per share for the financial period ended on December 31, 2020. The Annual General Meeting 2021 confirmed the number of Board members as eight and reappointed Mikael M\u00e4kinen as Chairman of Valmet members of the Board. Per Lindberg was elected as a new Board member. The term of office of the members of the Board of Directors expires at the close of the Annual General Meeting 2022. PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy was elected as the Company's auditor for a term expiring at the end of the next Annual General Meeting. Valmet published a stock exchange release on March 23, 2021, concerning the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting and the organizing meeting of the Board of Directors. The stock exchange release and meeting materials can be viewed on Valmet's website at www.valmet.com/agm . In compliance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting, on April 7, 2021, Valmet paid out dividends of EUR 135 million, corresponding to EUR 0.90 per share. Risks and business uncertainties Valmet's operations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunities and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development holds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2021 | 20adverse effects on Valmet's business, financial situation and operating result, or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective of Valmet's risk management is to ensure the implementation of an effective and successful strategy for achieving both long- and short-term goals. The task of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. In assessing risks, Valmet takes into consideration the probability of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales and financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the Company's overall risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical measures available for managing these risks. Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening financial market regulations, may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capital markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's customers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from stable business (Services and Automation) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative effects that market uncertainties may have. If global economic growth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long-term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typically 10-30 percent of the value of the project, and customers make progress payments as the project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's projects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' creditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's products may shrink, which may lead to, for example, tougher price competition. Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can also have critical effects, especially on the energy business. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy. These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers, especially in the energy business. Changes in labor costs and the prices of raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Wage inflation is continuing, but Valmet's goal is to offset this at least partly through increased productivity and strict price discipline. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's customers are raw material producers and their ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity prices and hampered by declining commodity prices. To ensure a high level of quality in both production and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent availability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment programs, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions, Valmet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. The actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, increased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set for the acquired business. Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2021 | 21Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects in particular can be large, thus project-specific risk management is crucial. Key risks related to projects are project cost estimation, scheduling, project risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shall, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity assessment continues during the execution phase of the project. Risk management is based on careful planning and continuous, systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems. There may be changes in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, cost-effective competition in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer service and local presence. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operations requires sufficient available funding under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity of Valmet's non-current debt, excluding lease liabilities, is 2.8 years . Loan facilities include customary covenants, and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a key impact on the adequacy of Valmet's financing. Setting aside investments into the renewal of the ERP system, Valmet does not expect any significant increase in annual capital expenditure and estimates that it is well-positioned to keep capital expenditure at the level of total depreciation. Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Exchange rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the Company's operations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency exposures linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way authorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. As at March 31, 2021 , Valmet had EUR 716 million (EUR 687 million ) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses the carrying value of its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable. Valmet has not identified any indications of impairment during the reporting period. The principles used for impairment testing are presented in the Financial Statements. The COVID-19 pandemic Depending on the success in suppressing the COVID-19 pandemic and in case the outbreak will be further prolonged, there could be further adverse impact on Valmet's operations, customer investment activity, project deliveries, supply chain and availability of financing for both Valmet and its customers. Valmet currently has a solid order backlog, strong balance sheet and liquidity coupled with a flexible organization, and a structured way to operate in Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2021 | 22changing circumstances and different regions. This will aid Valmet in mitigating the global challenges caused by COVID-19 and fully utilizing the post-pandemic opportunities. Events after the reporting period There have been no subsequent events after the review period that required recognition or disclosure. Guidance for 2021 On April 16, 2021, Valmet revised upwards its net sales and Comparable EBITA guidance for 2021. Revised guidance (on April 16, 2021): Valmet estimates that net sales in 2021 will increase in comparison with 2020 (EUR 3,740 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2021 will increase in comparison with 2020 (EUR 365 million). Previous guidance (on February 4, 2021): Valmet estimates that net sales in 2021 will remain at the previous year's level in comparison with 2020 (EUR 3,740 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2021 will remain at the previous year's level in comparison with 2020 (EUR 365 million). Market outlook General economic outlook according to IMF Global growth is projected at 6 percent in 2021, moderating to 4.4 percent in 2022. The revised forecasts reflect additional fiscal support in a few large economies, the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of 2021, and continued adaptation of economic activity to subdued mobility. High uncertainty surrounds this outlook, related to the path of the pandemic, the effectiveness of policy support to provide a bridge to vaccine-powered normalization, and the evolution of financial conditions. (International Monetary Fund, April 2021) Short-term market outlook Valmet estimates that the short-term market outlook for services has improved to satisfactory (previously satisfactory/weak). Valmet reiterates the good short-term market outlook for automation, pulp, board and paper, and tissue and the weak short-term market outlook for energy.

The assumed accounting for the acquisition of PMP Group, including estimated purchase consideration, is based on provisional amounts and the associated purchase accounting is not final. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no material changes made to the provisional amounts recognized as at December 31, 202 0. Reporting segments and geographic information The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the President and CEO of Valmet. Valmet's four business lines are highly integrated through complementing product and service offerings and joint customer projects. Thus, the operations and profitability of Valmet is reported as a single reportable segment with the key operative decisions being made by the CODM at the Valmet Group level. The performance of the Group is reviewed by the CODM. One key indicator of performance reviewed is Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA). Performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e. with EBITA excluding certain items of income and expense that reduce the comparability of the Group's performance from one period to another. The alternative performance measures of EBITA and Comparable EBITA are published by Valmet as part of regulated financial information to enable users of the financial information to prepare more meaningful analysis on Valmet's performance. Items affecting comparability consist of income and expenses arising from activities that amend the capacity of Valmet's operations, such as restructuring costs, and gains or losses on sale of businesses or non-current assets, and income and expenses incurred outside Valmet's normal course of business, such as impairment charges and income and expenses recorded as a result of settlement payments to/from third parties (e.g. penalties incurred as a result of tax audits or settlements to closed law suits) as well as income and expenses arising from changes in legislation expected to affect Valmet temporarily only (e.g. customs or other tariffs imposed by authorities on Valmet's products).

In Q1/2020 , the top three countries were the USA , Brazil and China , which together accounted for 34 percent of total net sales.

Paper, and Pulp and Energy business lines' revenue is derived from large long- term capital projects, for which revenue is mostly recognized over time based on the cost-to- cost method. Service business line's revenue arises from large volume of short-term contracts with relatively low individual value, for which revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. Automation business line's revenue consists of long-term contracts and short-term service contracts. The nature of long-term contracts, and therefore also the revenue recognition method, is similar to capital projects although with average contract values being lower. Revenue for short-term service contracts is recognized at a point in time. Nature of revenue in each area in any given reporting period is driven by volume and size of ongoing capital projects.

During the reporting period Valmet had not entered into any material contracts where the period between when Valmet transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or more. Neither were there any ongoing projects from previous reporting periods for which the former would apply.Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2021 | 33The creditworthiness of a customer is verified before entering into a contract. However, if a risk of non-payment arises after contract inception, the probability of collection of consideration is re-evaluated and if assessed improbable, recognition of revenue is discontinued. An allowance for non-collectability of open receivables and contract assets is established as concluded appropriate. Valmet receives payments from customers based on invoicing schedules as set out in the customer contracts. Changes in contract assets and liabilities are due to Valmet's performance under the contracts. Amounts due from customers under revenue contracts primarily relate to Valmet's right to consideration for work completed but not yet invoiced at the reporting date. These assets are transferred to trade receivables when right to consideration becomes unconditional, which is typically at the time when Valmet has contractual right to issue an invoice. Significant part of amounts due to customers relate to advance consideration received from customers in long-term capital contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These amounts are recognized as revenue as (or when) Valmet performs under the contracts. Following tables provide specification of movements in amounts due from customers under revenue contracts and amounts due to customers under revenue contracts over the reporting period. Revenue recognized in the period also includes revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, the amount of which however is insignificant.

The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as at March 31, 2021 , was EUR 3,709 million (EUR 3,557 million).

There has been no change in Valmet's ownership since September 30, 2020. Valmet's and Neles' financial statements are coterminous, but as Neles publishes its interim reports at or near the same time as Valmet, Valmet's share of Neles' results are accounted for with a lag of one quarter. V almet's financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2021 include Valmet's share of Neles' fourth-quarter 2020 results, amounting to EUR 4 million. Valmet had no material transactions with Neles in the three months ended March 31, 2021, or material receivables or liabilities as at March 31, 2021.
