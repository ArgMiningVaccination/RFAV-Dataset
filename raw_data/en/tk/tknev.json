Integrative medicine is healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person (body, mind, and spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle. It reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches to achieve optimal health and healing in addition to curing illness and disease. Because an informed, empowered patient will make better choices about health care and lifestyle options, patient education is an essential element of integrative care. The principles of integrative medicine: - A partnership between patient and practitioner in the healing process - Appropriate use of conventional and alternative methods to facilitate the body's innate healing response - Consideration of all factors that influence health, wellness and disease, including mind, spirit and community as well as body - A philosophy that neither rejects conventional medicine nor accepts alternative therapies uncritically - Recognition that good medicine should be based in good science, be inquiry driven, and be open to new paradigms - Use of natural, effective, less-invasive interventions whenever possible - Use of the broader concepts of promotion of health and the prevention of illness as well as the treatment of disease - Training of practitioners to be models of health and healing, committed to the process of self-exploration and self-development Check out my video for a list of conditions that I commonly treat at Philadelphia "}
