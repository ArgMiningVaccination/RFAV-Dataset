The committee reviewed the extant published and unpublished epidemiological studies regarding causality and studies of potential biologic mechanisms by which these immunizations might cause autism. The committeeconcludes that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a caus- al relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. The committee also con- cludes that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causalrelationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. The commit- tee further finds that potential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced au- tism that have been generated to date are theoretical only. The committee does not recommend a policy review of the current sched- ule and recommendations for the administration of either the MMR vaccine or thimerosal-containing vaccines. The committee recommends a public healthresponse that fully supports an array of vaccine safety activities. In addition, the committee recommends that available funding for autism research be chan- neled to the most promising areas. The committee makes additional recommen-dations regarding surveillance and epidemiological research, clinical studies, and communication related to these vaccine safety concerns.

Immunization is not without risks,however. It is well established, for example, that the oral polio vaccine on rareoccasion has caused paralytic polio and that vaccines sometimes produce ana-phylactic shock. Given the widespread use of vaccines, state mandates requiringvaccination of children for entry into school, college, or day care, and the impor-tance of ensuring that trust in immunization programs is justified, it is essentialthat safety concerns receive assiduous attention. At the request of the sponsoring agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Institute ofMedicine (IOM) established the Immunization Safety Review Committee toevaluate the evidence on possible causal associations between immunizationsand certain adverse outcomes, and to then present conclusions and recommenda-tions. The committee's mandate also includes assessing the broader significancefor society of these immunization safety issues. The specific vaccine safety hypotheses issues examined by the committee are determined by the Interagency Vaccine Group (IAVG), whose members rep-resent several units of the Department of Health and Human Services: the CDC'sNational Vaccine Program Office, National Immunization Program, and NationalCenter for Infectious Diseases; the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infec-tious Diseases; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the Health Resourcesand Services Administration's National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program;and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The IAVG also includesrepresentation from the Department of Defense and the Agency for InternationalDevelopment. The committee has issued seven previous reports on vaccine safetyissues over the three-year study period (2001-2003). This eighth and final reportfrom the committee examines the hypothesis that vaccines, specifically themeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and vaccines containing the preserva-tive thimerosal, cause autism. In its first two reports that were published in 2001,the committee examined the hypothesized causal association between the MMRvaccine and autism, and thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmentaldisorders, respectively (IOM, 2001a,b). The IAVG asked the committee to revisitthe hypothesized causal association between vaccines and autism in its finalreport in order to update its conclusions and recommendations based on thesignificant number of studies that have been undertaken in the last three years. The committee begins from a position of neutrality regarding the specific immunization safety hypothesis under review. That is, there is no presumptionthat a specific vaccine (or vaccine component) does or does not cause the adverseevent in question. The weight of the available clinical and epidemiologic evi-dence determines whether it is possible to shift from that neutral position to afinding for causality (\"the evidence favors acceptance of a causal relationship\")or against causality (\"the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship\"). Thecommittee does not conclude that the vaccine does not cause the adverse eventCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

Instead, it main- tains a neutral position, concluding that the \"evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship. \" The committee 's causality assessments must be guided by an understanding of relevant biological processes. Therefore the committee 's scientific assessment includes consideration of biological mechanisms by which immunizations mightcause an adverse event. The examination of experimental evidence for biologicalmechanisms has been referred to in previous reports of this committee (IOM,2001a,b) and others (IOM, 1991, 1994) as an assessment of \"biological plausibil- ity.\" The committee has noted, however, that the term \"biologic plausibility \" is a source of confusion on at least two fronts. First, it is associated with a particularset of guidelines (sometimes referred to as the Bradford Hill criteria) for causalinference from epidemiological evidence (Hill, 1965); second, readers sometimesregard the term with a degree of certainty or precision the committee neverintended. For example, a relationship between immunization and a particularadverse event may be found to be biologically plausible at the same time that theepidemiological evidence is found to be inadequate to accept or reject a causalrelationship. Given the resulting lack of clarity, the committee adopted a new terminology and a new approach to its discussions of experimental biological data in its thirdreport (IOM, 2002). The committee now reviews evidence regarding \"biological mechanisms \" that might be consistent with the proposed relationship between immunization and a given adverse event. The biological mechanism evidence reviewed in this report comes from human, animal, and in vitro studies of biological or pathophysiological processes. If the committee identifies evidence of biological mechanisms that could beoperating, it offers a summary judgment of that body of evidence as weak, mod-erate, or strong. Although the committee tends to judge biological evidence inhumans as \"stronger \" than biological evidence from highly contrived animal models or in vitro systems, the summary judgment of the strength of the evidence also depends on the quantity (e.g., number of studies or number of subjects in astudy) and quality (e.g., the nature of the experimental system or study design) ofthe evidence. Obviously, the conclusions drawn from this review depend both onthe specific data and scientific judgment. To ensure that its own summary judg-ment is defensible, the committee aims to be as explicit as possible regarding thestrengths and limitations of the biological data. In this report, the committee examines the hypothesis of whether the MMR vaccine and the use of vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal can causeautism. Autism is a complex and severe set of developmental disorders character-ized by sustained impairments in social interaction, impairments in verbal andnonverbal communication, and stereotypically restricted or repetitive patterns ofbehaviors and interests (APA, 1994; Filipek et al., 1999; Volkmar and Pauls,2003). Over time, research has identified subtle differences in the onset andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

Autism is classified under the umbrella cat- egory of \"pervasive developmental disorders \" (PDDs) (APA, 2000). PDD refers to a continuum of related cognitive and neurobehavioral disorders that reflectsthe heterogeneity of symptoms and clinical presentations, and includes autisticdisorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger 's syndrome, Rett 's syn- drome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, or atypical autism). The term \"autistic spectrum disorders \" (ASD) has come into common use and is essentially synonymous with the term PDD(Volkmar et al., 2003). In this report, the terms \"autism, \" \"autistic, \" and \"autistic spectrum disorders \" are used interchangeably to refer to this broader group of pervasive developmental disorders. 1 Although Rett 's syndrome is among the autistic spectrum disorders, it is considered by many to be a distinct neurologicdisorder and thus its diagnosis is not included in most research that has evaluatedthe association of the vaccines and autism. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence and incidence of autism and trends over time. Some studies have found an increase, but it isdifficult to discern how much of the observed increase is real or possibly due toother factors, such as the adoption of a broader diagnostic concept of autism,improved recognition of autism, or variations in the precision of the studies(Fombonne, 1999, 2003; Gillberg and Wing, 1999). In the committee 's first report, which reviewed the hypothesized causal asso- ciation between the MMR vaccine and autism (IOM, 2001a), the committeeconcluded that the evidence at the time favored rejection of a causal relationshipat the population level between MMR vaccine and autism. The committee 's conclusion did not exclude the possibility that MMR could contribute to autismin a small number of children because the epidemiological studies lacked suffi-cient precision to assess rare occurrences; it was possible, for example, thatepidemiological studies would not detect a relationship between autism and MMRvaccination in a subset of the population with a genetic predisposition to autism.The biological models for an association between MMR and autism were notestablished but nevertheless not disproved. In a subsequent report, the committee reviewed the hypothesized link be- tween thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and a broad range of neurodevelop-mental disorders (NDD), including autism (IOM, 2001b). Thimerosal, an organicmercury compound, has been used as a preservative in some vaccines and otherbiological and pharmaceutical products since the 1930s. FDA regulations requirethe use of preservatives in multidose vials of vaccines, except live virus vaccines,to prevent fungal and bacterial contamination (General Biologics Product Stan- 1The term \"autistic disorder \" refers to a more narrow diagnosis defined by criteria in the Diag- nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV-TR) (APA, 2000).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In that report, the committee concluded that the evidence was inadequate to accept orreject a causal relationship between exposure to thimerosal from vaccines and theNDDs of autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and speech orlanguage delay. The committee 's causality conclusion was based on the fact that there were no published epidemiological studies examining the potential associa-tion between TCVs and NDDs, and the two unpublished, epidemiological studiesthat were available (Blaxill, 2001; Verstraeten, 2001) provided only weak andinconclusive evidence of an association between TCVs and NDDs. The com-mittee also concluded that the hypothesis linking TCVs with NDDs was not yetestablished and rested on incomplete evidence. However, because mercury is aknown neurotoxin, and prenatal exposures to methylmercury (a compound closelyrelated to the form of mercury in TCVs) have been documented to negativelyaffect early childhood development (see NRC, 2000), 2 a potential biological mechanism could be hypothesized based on analogies with this compound. New epidemiological studies and biological mechanism theories on both issues have emerged since the publication of these IOM reports. In this report, thecommittee incorporates the new epidemiological evidence and studies of biologicmechanisms relating to vaccines and autism; it does not address the hypothesizedlink between vaccines and other NDDs. Until 1999, thimerosal was contained in over 30 vaccines licensed and mar- keted in the United States, including some of the vaccines administered to infantsfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and hepatitis B. The controversy over thimerosal in vaccines erupted thatyear, when FDA researchers determined that under the recommended childhoodimmunization schedule, infants might be exposed to cumulative doses of ethyl-mercury that exceed some federal safety guidelines established for ingestion ofmethylmercury, another form of organic mercury (Ball et al., 2001). In July 1999,the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the U.S. Public Health Service(PHS) issued a joint statement recommending the removal of thimerosal fromvaccines as soon as possible (CDC, 1999). With the licensure of a thimerosal-freehepatitis B vaccine in August 1999 and approval of a thimerosal-free preservativehepatitis B vaccine in March 2000, children had access to a hepatitis B vaccinethat did not contain thimerosal as a preservative by March 2000. With the FDAapproval of a second thimerosal-free version of DTaP vaccine in March 2001, allformulations of vaccines on the U.S. recommended childhood immunizationschedule for children 6 years of age or younger became available free of thimero-sal used as a preservative (FDA, 2002). Based on information from vaccine 2For example, there is evidence that fetal exposure to mercury might lead to detectable differ- ences in neurodevelopmental testing that might be consistent with some neurodevelopmental dis- abilities (see NRC, 2000).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Based on these changes, themaximum amount of mercury from vaccines on the recommended childhoodimmunization schedule that an infant (less than 6 months of age) can now beexposed to is <3 \u00b5g, 3 down from 187.5 \u00b5g in 1999 (FDA, 2001, 2004). The controversy regarding the hypothesized link between the MMR vaccine and autism began in 1998 when Dr. Andrew Wakefield and colleagues publisheda case series describing 12 children with pervasive developmental disorder asso-ciated with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and developmental regression(Wakefield et al., 1998). For eight of these children, the onset of their behavioralproblems was associated, through retrospective accounts by their parents or phy-sicians, with MMR vaccination. This study put forth a hypothesis that a newphenotype of autism characterized by GI symptoms and developmental regres-sion could be associated with the MMR vaccine. While the authors acknowl-edged that the study did not prove an association between MMR and the condi-tions seen in these children, the report generated considerable interest and concernabout a possible link between MMR vaccination and ASD \u2014regressive autism in particular. A recent statement from 10 of the original 13 authors states that thedata were insufficient to establish a causal link between MMR vaccine and au-tism (Murch et al., 2004). Causality Argument Epidemiological studies examining TCVs and autism, including three con- trolled observational studies (Hviid et al., 2003; Miller, 2004; Verstraeten et al.,2003) and two uncontrolled observational studies (Madsen et al., 2003; Stehr-Green et al., 2003), consistently provided evidence of no association betweenTCVs and autism, despite the fact that these studies utilized different methodsand examined different populations (in Sweden, Denmark, the United States, andthe United Kingdom). Other studies reported findings of an association. Theseinclude two ecological studies 4 (Geier and Geier, 2003a, 2004a), three studies using passive reporting data (Geier and Geier, 2003a,b,d) one unpublished studyusing Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) data (Geier and Geier, 2004b,c), and one 33\u00b5g is the maximum amount that could have been received by an infant in the first 6 months of life if they received trace-containing formulations (e.g., Engerix B hepatitis B vaccine, Tripedia DTaP vaccine) as opposed to those that contain no thimerosal (e.g., Recombivax HB hepatitis B Daptacel DTaP) (FDA, 2004d). 4These studies were classified as ecological because they rely on aggregate data rather than individual-level data to make inferences about causality. However, the authors appear to attempt an individual-level analysis, but it is unclear how this can be, given the data they used. Based on theavailable information, the study design is indeterminate.

However, the studies by Geier and Geier cited above have serious methodological flaws and their analyticmethods were nontransparent, making their results uninterpretable, and thereforenoncontributory with respect to causality (see text for full discussion). The studyby Blaxill is uninformative with respect to causality because of its methodologicallimitations. Thus, based on this body of evidence, the committee concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. This conclusion differs from the committee 's finding in its 2001 report on TCVs and NDDs which was that the evidence was\"inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between exposure to thimero- sal from childhood vaccines and the neurodevelopmental disorders of autism,ADHD, and speech and language delay. \" (IOM, 2001b, p. 66) The committee 's conclusion in 2001 was based on the fact that there were no published epidemio-logical studies examining the potential association between TCVs and NDDs,and the two unpublished, epidemiological studies that were available (Blaxill,2001; Verstraeten, 2001) provided only weak and inconclusive evidence of anassociation between TCVs and NDDs. Furthermore, the conclusion in the 2001report pertained to a broader set of NDDs, while this report 's conclusion applies only to autism. Studies examining the association between MMR and autism, including nine controlled observational studies (DeStefano et al., 2004; DeWilde et 2002; Takahashi et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 1999, 2002), studies (Dales et al., 2001; Gillberg and Heijbel, 1998; Kaye et al.,2001), and two studies based on passive reporting system in Finland (Patja et al.,2000; Peltola et al., 1998), consistently showed evidence of no association be-tween the MMR vaccine and autism. Two studies reported findings of a positiveassociation between MMR and autism. The first was an ecological study (Geierand Geier, 2004a) that reported a potential positive correlation between the num-ber of doses of measles-containing vaccine and the cases of autism reported to thespecial education system in the 1980s. The second was a study of passive report-ing data by the same authors (Geier and Geier, 2003c) that reported a positivecorrelation between autism reports in the Vaccine Adverse Events ReportingSystem (VAERS) and estimated administered doses of MMR. However, thesetwo studies are characterized by serious methodological flaws and their analyticmethods were nontransparent, making their results uninterpretable, and thereforenoncontributory with respect to causality (see text for full discussion). The caseseries study by Wakefield and colleagues (Wakefield et al., 1998), which origi-nally raised the hypothesis linking MMR and autism, is uninformative withrespect to causality. Based on this body of evidence, the committee concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between MMRvaccine and autism. This conclusion is consistent with the finding in the committee 's previous report on MMR and autism (IOM, 2001a).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

A strong genetic component clearly exists, but there is a growing understanding that environmental factors might beimportant contributors to the expression of that genetic susceptibility. Animalmodels (primarily rat models), clinical observations, and pathological data pointto an array of possible pathways by which autism develops, though none areproven. Many different pathways might lead to similar expressions, which couldaccount for the multiple presentations of autism. A link between vaccine components, such as the measles vaccine-strain virus or the ethylmercury preservative thimerosal, is difficult to establish because ofthe early stage of scientific understanding about the cause(s) of autism. Thecommittee read, and heard presentations at their workshop, about several hypoth-eses. Data presented to support these hypotheses derive from rodent models ofhuman autism, observations of abnormalities in children with autism or theirfamilies, and in vitro studies. One hypothesis about the MMR vaccine involves the presence of measles virus lodging in the intestine of some children, which releases gut-brain media-tors or toxins, leading to autism (Wakefield et al., 2002). Another hypothesisrelated to MMR vaccine is that children with autism have immune abnormalitiesthat are indicative of vaccine-induced-central-nervous system, immune-mediateddamage that leads to autism (Singh, 2004). The thimerosal-related hypothesis is that some genetically susceptible popu- lation of children react to the thimerosal in vaccines with increased accumulationand decreased excretion of mercury from the brain, which alters several keybiochemical pathways \u2014for example, apoptosis and DNA metabolism \u2014leading to autism (Bradstreet, 2004). A genetically susceptible subset of children whodevelop autism following vaccinations is offered as one theoretical explanationfor the findings in epidemiological studies of no association between vaccinationand autism. Autism is a heterogeneous syndrome with a broad range of behavioral symp- toms and severity. As yet, a biological marker specific for autism has not beendefined. It is thus possible that autism encompasses a spectrum of disease sub-types that have different etiologies. This may explain the wide range of immuno-logical abnormalities that have been found in the serum of patients with autism,with some studies reporting evidence of decreased cell-mediated immunity (CMI),and others reporting increased/overactive CMI. Other support for an associationof autism with immune dysfunction includes the increased frequency of an ex-tended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype in autism, increasedautoantibodies to brain antigens, and the increased incidence of autoimmunediseases noted in a retrospective study of relatives of people with autism. However, despite evidence of immune dysregulation in the serum of people with autism, there is as yet no evidence that the immune system plays a direct roleCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Unlike neuroimmunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, there is no evidence of immune activation or inflammatorylesions in the brains or cerebrospinal fluid of people with autism. This fact alsomakes it likely that a link with MMR vaccination is circumstantial rather thancausal. It is clear from twin and family studies that there is a strong genetic basis for autism. The recent discovery of the genetic basis of Rett 's syndrome, a pheno- typically similar NDD with similarly described immunological abnormalities,may shed some light on the pathogenesis of autism. Similar epigenetic mecha-nisms may be operating in autism that lead to simultaneously abnormal develop-ment in the immune and central nervous systems. The hypothesis reviewed by the committee is that vaccine-induced autism represents the end result of a combination of susceptibility (possibly genetic) toimmune dysfunction or to abnormal mercury metabolism. Posited intermediatesteps include enzymatic abnormalities that might be related to the apoptosis andcellular signaling, leading to an array of behavioral, cognitive, sensory, and mo-tor disturbances. Other environmental exposures have similar effects. Rodent models suggest that reactions to some infectious agents (e.g., bornavirus and group A streptococcus) lead to somewhat specific neuronal celldeath and evidence of autoimmune reactions in the developing and adult brains ofrodents. The animals also exhibit abnormal behaviors. These immunological andbehavioral findings are similar to those seen in some humans after infection: thebehavior in children with PANDAS or in the animal models resembles the behav-ior constellations in children with autism. A similar set of comparisons can bemade with mercury exposures (Bernard et al., 2001), although autism has neverbeen documented as a consequence of high-dose mercury exposure, includingacrodynia. While analogies are useful for hypothesis generation, they do notsubstitute for direct evidence. Other evidence offered for the vaccine-autism hypothesis includes analo- gies between rodent behavior and human behavior as well as clinical observa-tions of metabolic or immunologic differences between individuals with autismand normal subjects or subjects with other conditions. In the clinical studies, it isnot clear to what extent the abnormalities are antecedents or are comorbid diseaseexpressions, rather than causal factors. That is, it is possible that some peoplewith autism, perhaps even a subgroup that could be identified at some time in thefuture by genetic markers, also have abnormal immune reactions and abnormalmercury metabolism but that vaccination does not cause these abnormalities, nordo they cause autism. The committee notes several factors that limit acceptance at this time of the hypothesis that vaccines cause autism. The evidence offered for the hypothesisincludes data from in vitro experimental systems, analogies between rodent be- havior, and human behavior and clinical observations that are at least as wellexplained as being comorbid disease expressions than as causal factors.

However, the experiments showingeffects of thimerosal on biochemical pathways in cell culture systems and show-ing abnormalities in the immune system or metal metabolism in people withautism are provocative; the autism research community should consider the ap-propriate composition of the autism research portfolio with some of these newfindings in mind. However, these experiments do not provide evidence of arelationship between vaccines or thimerosal and autism. In the absence of experimental or human evidence that vaccination (either the MMR vaccine or the preservative thimerosal) affects metabolic, developmen-tal, immune, or other physiological or molecular mechanisms that are causallyrelated to the development of autism, the committee concludes that the hypoth-eses generated to date are theoretical only. SIGNIFICANCE ASSESSMENT Autism leads to substantial challenges for the families of affected individuals because many people with autism remain dependent throughout their lives. Spe-cial education costs can exceed $30,000 per year. The annual cost of care in aresidential school may be as much as $80,000-100,000 (CDC, 1999). In additionto the substantial financial strains, families of children with autism face otherdemands. During the committees ' public session in March 2001 and in the mate- rial submitted for the February 2004 meeting, the committee heard about thedifficulties of caring for children with autism. Parents described round-the-clockefforts to care for their child, the difficulty of finding knowledgeable and sympa-thetic health care providers, the challenges in finding high-quality information,and the frustrations of seeing their child change from being active and engaged tobeing aloof and nonresponsive. Many clinicians, including several committeemembers, have treated children with autism and witnessed the difficulties andpain experienced by the children and their families. Although autism is recognized as a serious condition and strides have been made in understanding the disease in many areas, significant gaps remain, par-ticularly regarding its etiology and risk factors. These gaps include uncertaintyabout prevalence and incidence trends; limited knowledge of the natural historyof autism, including its early onset and regressive forms; the lack of a strongbiological model for autism; limited understanding of potentially associated fea-tures (e.g., immune alterations, enterocolitis); and no current basis for identifyingpossible subtypes of autism with different pathogeneses related to genetic andenvironmental interactions. Research has been hindered by changing case defini-tions and the heterogeneity of study populations that may include cases linked toother known medical risk factors (e.g., Fragile X).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

One needs to read just one of the manywebsites and Internet-based discussion groups on the issue of autism 5 to get a picture of the complicated lives of families with children with autism and theanger of some families toward the federal government (particularly the CDC andFDA), vaccine manufacturers, the field of epidemiology, and traditional biomedi-cal research. The volume of correspondence to the committee on this issue isimpassioned and impressive. There are, however, little data to shed light on howmany families believe that vaccination actually caused their child 's autism, 6 so that the magnitude of concern in the general population is uncertain. However, the committee concludes that because autism can be such a devastating dis-ease, any speculation that links vaccines and autism means that this is asignificant issue. There are many examples in medicine of disorders defined by a constellation of symptoms that have multiple etiologies, and autism is likely to be among them.Determining a specific cause in the individual is impossible unless the etiology isknown and there is a biological marker. Determining causality with population-based methods such as epidemiological analyses requires either a well-definedat-risk population or a large effect in the general population. Absent biomarkers,well-defined risk factors, or large effect sizes, the committee cannot rule out,based on the epidemiological evidence, the possibility that vaccines contribute toautism in some small subset or very unusual circumstances. However, there iscurrently no evidence to support this hypothesis either. The committee concludes that much more research must be conducted on autism. However, research should be directed towards those lines of inquiry mostsupported by the current state of knowledge. The vaccine hypotheses are notcurrently supported by the evidence. Much remains unknown about the etiologyor etiologies of autism. Furthermore, there have not been many studies on treat-ments for autism. Research should be directed towards better understanding theetiology or etiologies of autism and on treatments for autism. While the committee strongly supports targeted research that focuses on better understanding the disease of autism, from a public health perspective thecommittee does not consider a significant investment in studies of the theoreticalvaccine-autism connection to be useful at this time. The nature of the debateabout vaccine safety now includes the theory by some that genetic susceptibilitymakes vaccinations risky for some people, which calls into question the appropri-ateness of a public health, or universal, vaccination strategy. However, the ben-efits of vaccination are proven and the hypothesis of susceptible populations is 5See http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Autism-Mercury/messages. 6Over three thousand families have filed claims for compensation for autism with the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Using an unsubstantiated hypothesis to question the safety of vaccination and the ethical behavior of those governmental agencies and scien-tists who advocate for vaccination could lead to widespread rejection of vaccinesand inevitable increases in incidences of serious infectious diseases like measles,whooping cough, and Hib bacterial meningitis. The committee encourages that research on autism focus more broadly on the disorders ' causes of and treatments for it. Thus, the committee recommends a public health response that fully supports an array of vaccine safety activi-ties. In addition the committee recommends that available funding for au-tism research be channeled to the most promising areas. The committee emphasizes that confidence in the safety of vaccines is essen- tial to an effective immunization program \u2014one that provides maximum protec- tion against vaccine-preventable diseases with the safest vaccines possible. Ques-tions about vaccine safety must be addressed responsibly by public healthofficials, health professionals, and vaccine manufacturers. Although the hypoth-eses related to vaccines and autism will remain highly salient to some individuals,(parents, physicians, and researchers), this concern must be balanced against thebroader benefit of the current vaccine program for all children. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE Specific recommendations regarding policy review, epidemiologic research and surveillance, and communication follow. The committee also revisits anddiscusses many of the recommendations of its two previous reports on vaccinesand autism (IOM, 2001a,b). Policy Review At this time, the committee does not recommend a policy review of the licensure of MMR vaccine or of the current schedule and recommenda-tions for the administration of the MMR vaccine. At this time, the committee does not recommend a policy review of the current schedule and recommendations for the administration of routinechildhood vaccines based on hypotheses regarding thimerosal and autism.Currently, thimerosal has been removed from all universally recommended child-hood vaccines except influenza vaccine. A thimerosal-free version of the influenzavaccine exists, however, and is available for use in infants, children, and pregnantwomen. There are a few vaccines with thimerosal (e.g., Td) that infants andyoung children 7 could be exposed to, but only under very special circumstances. 7Td is recommended for children 12-18, but it is conceivable that some infants and young chil- dren could receive Td in lieu of DTaP.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The committee 's recommenda- tion reflected concern about total mercury burden and potential risk of certainNDDs. While the United States chose to eliminate thimerosal from routine child-hood vaccines as a precautionary measure and because it was feasible, the com-mittee recognizes that other countries have different constraints and other factors;their own assessments of the risks and benefits may lead those countries to reachdifferent conclusions regarding the thimerosal content of their vaccines. Given the lack of direct evidence for a biological mechanism and the fact that allwell-designed epidemiological studies provide evidence of no associationbetween thimerosal and autism, the committee recommends that cost-benefitassessments regarding the use of thimerosal-containing versus thimerosal-free vaccines and other biological or pharmaceutical products, whether inthe United States or other countries, should not include autism as a potentialrisk. Surveillance and Epidemiologic Research The committee reaffirms its previous recommendation to use stan- dard and accepted case definitions and assessment protocols for ASD toenhance the precision and comparability of results from surveillance, epide-miological studies, and biological investigations. Studies should also addressthe heterogeneity in the etiology of ASD and the spectrum of clinical presen-tation. The committee reaffirms its previous recommendation to conduct clinical and epidemiological studies of sufficient rigor to identify risk factorsand biological markers of ASD in order to better understand genetic orenvironmental causes of ASD. Surveillance of adverse events related to vaccines is important and should be strengthened in several ways: \u2014The committee recommends that standardized case definitions for adverse events be adopted. \u2014The committee recommends that formal guidelines or criteria be developed for using VAERS data to study adverse events. \u2014The committee recommends the continued use of large-linked da- tabases, active surveillance, and other tools to evaluate potential vaccine-related adverse events. \u2014The committee supports the development of Clinical Immuniza- tion Safety Assessment (CISA) centers to improve understanding of adverseevents at the individual level.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Insofar as monitoring of ASD occurs, one area of comple- mentary research that the committee continues to recommend is surveil-lance of ASD as exposure to thimerosal declines. Any research in this area should be conducted with critical attention to case definition, diagnostic criteria,and other factors (for example, data collection procedures and definitions ofautism in the special education system) that could affect prevalence estimates ofASD. Little is known about the levels of background exposure to mercury in the population. The committee recommends increased efforts to quantify the level of prenatal and postnatal exposure to thimerosal and other forms ofmercury in infants, children, and pregnant women. Clinical Studies The committee heard from some parents of children with ASD who have chosen to rely on chelation therapy as a treatment. The committee saw no scien-tific evidence, however, that chelation is an effective therapy for ASD or is evenindicated in these circumstances. Chelation therapy is currently indicated only forhigh-dose, acute mercury poisonings. Because chelation therapy has poten- tially serious risks, the committee recommends that it be used only in care-fully controlled research settings with appropriate oversight by InstitutionalReview Boards protecting the interests of the children who participate. Communication Many parents described to the committee their concerns about the MMR vaccine and thimerosal use in vaccines. Many expressed their frustration anddifficulties in making informed decisions about vaccination of their children astheir level of trust in the government, media, and science in general has declined.Because of the importance and difficulty of maintaining mutual trust, a modelthat focuses on increasing public participation in risk decisionmaking is likely tomake that process more democratic and improve the relevance and quality of thetechnical analysis (Slovic, 1999). Such participative processes may not necessar-ily lead to increased acceptability of risk policies, but may lead to higher qualitydecision-making processes (Arvai, 2003). However, better risk-benefit commu-nication requires attention to the needs of both the scientific and public commu-nities. Many scientists need to develop a more comprehensive understanding ofwhat risk-benefit communication entails and the rich knowledge base that can beused to design strategic communication programs. Appreciating that risk-benefitcommunication requires two-way exchanges of information and opinions (NRC,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. This executive summary plus thousands more available at http://www.nap.eduImmunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism http://books.nap.edu/catalog/10997.htmlEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 15 1989) and working from a larger frame of communication methods, scientists will be able to work more effectively with the public to address vaccine-relatedissues. A mix of information, dissemination, education services, and community-based dialogues are probably needed (NRC, 1989). To address these goals, the committee recommends developing programs to increase public participation in vaccine safety research and policy deci-sions and to enhance the skills and willingness of scientists and governmentofficials to engage in constructive dialogue with the public about researchfindings and their implications for policy development. Programs such as Project LEAD \u00ae, COPUS Grant Schemes, or the IOM Vaccine Safety Forum may serve as useful models. Any proposed program should be easily accessible to thepublic and should involve a wide range of individuals. Additionally, ways torebuild trust between the public, scientists, professionals, media, and governmentshould be explored.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

The committee concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a causal rela- tionship between MMR vaccine and autism. Biological Mechanisms Conclusions In the absence of experimental or human evidence that vaccination (either the MMR vaccine or the preservative thimerosal) affects metabolic, developmental, immune, or other physiological or molecular mechanisms that are causally relatedto the development of autism, the committee concludes that the hypotheses gen- erated to date are theoretical only. SIGNIFICANCE ASSESSMENT The committee concludes that because autism can be such a devastating dis- ease, any speculation that links vaccines and autism means that this is a signifi- cant issue. PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE RECOMMENDATIONS The committee recommends a public health response that fully supports an array of vaccine safety activities. In addition the committee recommends that avail-able funding for autism research be channeled to the most promising areas. Policy Review At this time, the committee does not recommend a policy review of the licen- sure of MMR vaccine or of the current schedule and recommendations for the administration of the MMR vaccine.

The committee reaffirms its previous recommendation to conduct clinical and epidemiological studies of sufficient rigor to identify risk factors and biological mark- ers of ASD in order to better understand genetic or environmental causes of ASD. Surveillance of adverse events related to vaccines is important and should be strengthened in several ways: The committee recommends that standardized case definitions for adverse events be adopted.

Upon theauthority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr. Bruce M. Alberts is president of the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with theNational Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superiorachievements of engineers. Dr. Wm. A. Wulf is president of the National Academy of Engineering. The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter tobe an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg is president of the Institute of Medicine. The National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy 's purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning inaccordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and thescientific and engineering communities.

In recent years, however, a number of concerns have been raised aboutboth the safety of and the need for certain immunizations. Indeed, immunizationsafety is a contentious area of public health policy, with discourse around ithaving become increasingly polarized and exceedingly difficult. The numerouscontroversies and allegations surrounding immunization safety signify an erosionof public trust in those responsible for vaccine research, development, licensure,scheduling, and policymaking. Because vaccines are so widely used \u2014and be- cause state laws require that children be vaccinated to enter daycare and school,in part to protect others \u2014immunization safety concerns should be vigorously pursued in order to restore this trust. It is in this context that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) was approached over three years ago by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Na-tional Institutes of Health to convene an independent committee that could pro-vide timely and objective assistance to the Department of Health and HumanServices in reviewing emerging immunization safety concerns. The IOM was chartered by the National Academy of Sciences in 1970 to serve as an adviser to the federal government on issues affecting the public 's health, as well as to act independently in identifying important issues of medicalcare, research, and education. The IOM thus brings to this mission three decadesof experience in conducting independent analyses of significant public healthpolicy issues. In particular, as described in more detail in this report, the IOM hasa long history of involvement in vaccine safety. The IOM published its first majorvaccine safety report in 1977, followed by a subsequent report in 1988; bothCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

Two subsequent major reports, published in 1991 and 1994, examined the adverse effects of childhood vaccines. Sincethen, the IOM has conducted several smaller studies and workshops focused onvarious vaccine safety topics. These studies were well received by both the publicand policymakers, and previous IOM committees on vaccine safety issues havebeen viewed as objective and credible. Given the sensitive nature of the present immunization safety review study, the IOM felt it was especially critical to establish strict criteria for committeemembership. These criteria prevented participation by anyone with financial tiesto vaccine manufacturers or their parent companies, or who had given experttestimony on issues of vaccine safety. The rationale for imposing these stringent criteria was twofold. First, given growing public concern about vaccine safety and the public scrutiny surroundingthis committee 's work, it was important to establish standards that would pre- clude any real or perceived conflict of interest or bias on the part of the committeemembers. No member has any vested interest in any of the vaccine safety ques-tions that will come before the committee. Second, the IOM wanted to ensure thatno committee member had participated in the development or evaluation of avaccine under study. Thus, the IOM has convened a distinguished panel of 13 members who are experts in a number of pertinent fields, including pediatrics, neurology, immunol-ogy, internal medicine, infectious diseases, genetics, epidemiology, biostatistics,risk perception and communication, decision analysis, public health, nursing, andethics. The committee members were chosen because they are leading authoritiesin their respective fields, are well respected by their colleagues, and have noconflicts of interest. This committee brought a fresh perspective to these criticallyimportant issues and approached its charge with impartiality and scientific rigor. As with all reports from the IOM, the committee 's work was reviewed by an independent panel of experts. The purpose of the review process is to enhance theclarity, cogency, and accuracy of the final report and to ensure that the authorsand the IOM are creditably represented by the report published in their names.The report review process is overseen by the National Research Council 's (NRC) Report Review Committee (RRC), comprising approximately 30 members of theNational Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and IOM. Aselect panel of reviewers with a diverse set of perspectives are asked to critiquethe report. Unlike the selection criteria for committee membership, many review-ers will have strong opinions and interests related to the report topic. The compo-sition of the review panel is not disclosed to the committee until after the report isapproved for release. While the committee must consider and evaluate all com-ments from reviewers, it is not obligated to change its report in response to thereviewers ' comments. The committee must, however, justify its responses to the reviewers ' comments to the satisfaction of the RRC 's review monitor and the IOM's review coordinator.

The discussions were informative and help-ful. The committee would also like to thank those people who submitted informa-tion to the committee through the mail or via e-mail. Finally, the committeethanks the IOM staff for their dedication to this project. Without their commit-ment, attention to detail, creativity, sensitivity, and hard work, this project wouldbe unworkable.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.
