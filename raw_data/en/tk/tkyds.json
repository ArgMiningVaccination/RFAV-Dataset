The Use of Aromatherapy in Women's Health Abstract Women face problems in different stages of life such as menstruation, prenatal, postnatal, and menopause. The commonality of women's health problems is that they affect women's productivity, performance, and quality of life. The diversity of problems related to women's health and the absence of a drug or treatment that can completely eliminate these problems have led women to traditional and alternative therapy methods. Aromatherapy is one of the traditional and alternative therapies that help women cope with their health problems and relieve symptoms. This review article was conducted to investigate the use of aromatherapy in women's health. Keywords: Aromatherapy, women's health, nursing Introduction Traditional and complementary therapies are widely used around the world. The World Health Organization states that 80% of traditional and complementary therapies are used as part of primary care services in Africa and Asia. Herbal medicines used in tra-ditional treatments constitute 30-50% of the medicine used in China. 1 Complementary and traditional therapies are a newly developing field in Turkey. In the literature, the rate of use of complementary and alternative therapies in Turkey is 35-48% in individuals with chronic diseases such as heart, diabetes, and kidney failure 2-4 and 65.8% in healthy individuals.5 Traditional and complementary therapies, which are increasingly used in the field of health, have also started to attract the attention of women. The risk of reproductive health problems in women increases after adolescence. Women experience various health problems, especially during normal physiological processes such as their men-strual cycle, pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum, and menopause. The side effects of medicines used to cope with these problems, the inability to completely eliminate health problems, and the obstacles encountered in the health system have led women to tradi-tional and complementary therapies. 6-9 Aromatherapy, one of the traditional and complementary methods, is widely used in women's health. 10 Aromatherapy is a traditional and complementary treatment method in which essential oils are used. The problems experienced in women during their men-strual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause affect their physical and mental health nega-tively, and aromatherapy is an effective method that can be used in coping with these problems. 11-14 This review study was performed to examine the use of aromatherapy in women's health. Aromatherapy Methods Correct application of aromatherapy is essential for the therapy to be effective. Aromatherapy can be implemented in three ways: oral, topical, and inhalation method. The oral route is the digestion and metabolism of essential oils through the digestive tract. Gelatin is administered in capsules. The oral route is not similar to the methods in which herbal teas are used. 14,15 Topical administration is applied by bath, massage, or compress. In these ways, essential oils are applied to a certain part of the body. The application of aromatherapy with the massage method accelerates the absorption of essential oils from the skin and spreads The research was presented at the 1st International 2nd National Public Health Nursing Congress held in Ankara.

Aromatherapy and Women the healing effect to the tissues. The oil applied to a certain part of the body by massage passes through the skin to the veins and enters the circulation within 10 minutes. The soluble nature of the essential oil accelerates the absorption in the oil-rich areas of the body sur - face. Thus, very small molecules of the oil show their effect by cross-ing the blood-brain barrier. 14,15 Inhalation is the method of breathing the aroma of essential oil through the nostrils. The fact that the lungs have a large surface and the alveoli are connected with the circulatory system increases the effect of this method. Receptors in the brain detect the odor chemical in the essential oil. When a person breathes, this chemical is carried to the brain through the nose. The message detected from the odor transmitted to the brain by the inhalation method is sent to the body and has an immediate effect. 14 The inhalation method is applied in two ways: direct and indirect. In the direct inhalation method, 1-5 drops of essential oil are dropped on a material such as cotton and inhaled for 5-10 minutes. The second way is to drop the essential oil into boiling water and inhale the mist for 5-10 minutes. Indirect inhalation is also administered by dripping the essential oil into boiling water and then placing it in a censer in the room\u2014spreading the fragrance to the environment. 14-16 Use of Aromatherapy in Women's Health When complementary and traditional treatments are applied at the appropriate dose, route, and time, there is no harm to health.14 The reasons why aromatherapy is preferred in the field of women's health are its ease of application, its ability to be performed independently in the home environment, and its rapid physiological and psycho-logical effects. 14,15 Literature reveals that aromatherapy applied by massage or inhalation method is effective against the problems experienced by women in normal physiological women's processes such as menstrual cycle, pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum period, and menopause. Dysmenorrhea and Aromatherapy Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common gynecological complaints in women during menstruation and affects many women. Abdominal pain which begins a few days before menstruation is a typical symp-tom and may persist for up to 3 days. Abdominal cramps may also be accompanied by symptoms such as low back pain, headache, dizzi-ness, vomiting, nausea, or diarrhea. Aromatherapy with essential oils is the most widely used method among complementary applications to alleviate the pain of dysmenorrhea. 17 Aromatherapy massage applied to the abdomen with essential oils (such as almond oil, marjoram oil, rose oil, and lavender oil) of women with dysmenorrhea reduces menstrual pain. When aromatherapy massage is applied to the abdominal region with essential oils, the oil is absorbed through the skin and spreads to the tissues. 18 Massage improves the spasm that causes menstrual pain by accelerating blood circulation, decreasing stress hormone levels by increas-ing the release of endorphins, and increasing serotonin release by providing parasympathetic activation\u2014thus alleviating menstrual pain. 19-21 Song et al22 found that the inhalation aromatherapy method was effective in reducing menstrual cramps and that aromatherapy massage is more effective than other lavender blends of oils in cop-ing with menstrual pain. A systematic review by Lee et al 23 revealed moderate evidence for the effectiveness of aromatherapy (i.e., inhala-tion, massage, and oral route) in relieving the pain of dysmenorrhea. Premenstrual Syndrome and Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is also used to cope with premenstrual syndrome. In the study conducted by Uzun\u00e7akmak and Ayaz-Alkaya, 11 it was deter - mined that lavender inhalation aromatherapy is effective in coping with anxiety, depressive affect, fatigue, irritability, pain, swelling, and depressive thoughts, which are among the symptoms of premen-strual syndrome. It is thought that lavender oil relieves the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, as the active ingredient enters the body through respiration and enters the circulation in a short time, show-ing its analgesic, sedative, and muscle relaxant properties. 11 Pregnancy, Birth, Postpartum Period, and Aromatherapy Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy are common problems. Due to the harmful effects of the medicines used on the fetus and the mother, the interest in complementary and alternative treatments has increased. In a systematic review by Ozgoli et al. 24 it was found that aromatherapy with ginger, cardamom, lemon, and mint was effective in coping with nausea and vomiting, alleviating the symptoms experi-enced without any side effects. Joulaeerad et al 25 found that inhala- tion aromatherapy with peppermint oil was effective in reducing the severity of nausea and vomiting. Birth is one of the most painful experiences of life and is a complex process involving many physiological and psychological interac-tions. 26 Although labor pain is natural, extreme pain causes signifi- cant physiological changes in cardiopulmonary functions, oxygen consumption, stress response, and uterine contractility. Due to its simplicity and ease of application, aromatherapy can be used in some medical treatments, either alone or in combination with a standard pain control protocol. 27 Aromatherapy reduces labor pain and duration at birth, providing relaxation and satisfaction. 28 The molecules in the essential oil stim- ulate the limbic system. Since there is a direct relationship between the limbic system and emotions\u2014the feelings of depression, anxiety, and pain experienced during childbirth are reduced. 26 Aromatherapy can also help relieve anxiety by reducing cortisol levels and increas-ing serotonin. 29 In a study using 10 different essential oils at birth, no side effects were observed in mothers. In addition, half of the mothers stated that they were satisfied with the relief of their pain and depression levels. 30 Chen et al27 found that aromatherapy is an effective and safe method in reducing labor pain and duration. Hamdamian et al. 29 determined that rose aromatherapy is a reliable method of reducing pain and anxiety in the first stage of labor. Aromatherapy has an important place in the postpartum period as well as childbirth. Aromatherapy reduces the risk of anxiety and depression in the postpartum period when administered by inhala-tion. 12,31 Essential oils are effective on the hypothalamus and limbic system in the body and increase the secretion of soothing, stimulat - ing, and relaxing neurotransmitters.29,32,33 Kianpour et al34 found that there was a significant decrease in depression levels after lavender inhalation was administered to postpartum women. The linalool in the lavender binds to serotonin and plays a carrier role, thereby relieving the symptoms of depression.242JERN 2022; 19(2): 240-243 DOI:10.5152/jern.2022.38455Uzun\u00e7akmak and Alkaya. Aromatherapy and and Aromatherapy To increase milk secretion during breastfeeding, mothers use herbs such as fenugreek, ginger, chamomile, garlic, and thistle as comple-mentary and alternative methods, in conjunction with acupuncture, massage, and chiropractic. 35,36 Kurniyati et al36 determined that aro- matherapy massage administered to mothers during the postpartum period increased milk secretion. More studies are needed to show how aromatherapy is effective during breastfeeding. Menopause and Aromatherapy Menopause is a natural biological process that affects the lives of all women. In this process, women may experience physical, psycho-logical, and genitourinary symptoms. Complementary and alternative treatment methods are frequently used by women in coping with menopause. In a study conducted with lavender inhalation, it was found that aromatherapy reduced menopausal symptoms such as anxiety, depression, physical, and vasomotor symptoms. 37 In another study conducted with women in the menopause period, it was deter - mined that women experienced serious psychological symptoms such as depression, irritability, anxiety, physical, and mental fatigue before aromatherapy massage, and there was a significant decrease in the symptoms experienced after the application. 12 A study using lavender inhalation found that aromatherapy reduced menopausal hot flashes. 38 In a meta-analysis, Khadivzadeh et al39 determined that combined oil aromatherapy with lavender, fennel, geranium, and rose significantly improved sexual function in menopause, but there was no significant change in serum estrogen level. The alleviation of symptoms experienced during menopause is related to the decrease in stress hormones and the regularity of beta-endorphin production. Scientifically, it is suggested that aro-matherapy can be effective both psychologically and physiologically. Essential oils activate olfactory nerve cells, leading to limbic system stimulation. Depending on the aroma type, nerve cells secrete differ - ent neurotransmitters such as encephalin, noradrenaline, and sero-tonin. Considering the relationship between the sense of smell and the human spirit and emotions, aromas can be effective on people's souls and bodies. In fact, it appears that odors can alter emotions in humans. 40 Aromatherapy and Nursing In recent years, the increase in diversity in traditional and comple- mentary treatments and the benefit of individuals from these treat - ments have enabled nurses to enter this field.14,16 The healthcare professionals who want to learn about traditional and complemen-tary therapies are usually nurses. For this reason, it is important for nurses to be educated on this issue, to know the benefits and risks of treatments, and to add their contribution to the protection of health. 41 Aromatherapy is administered using various oils and different meth-ods. Therefore, nurses can inform the women about the appropriate aromatherapy method after evaluating the condition of the women, observing the effectiveness of aromatherapy by following the women with the role of counseling, and helping them alleviate the problems they experience. In addition, the nurses can conduct research on the effects of aromatherapy methods on health problems by using differ - ent essential oils. 42,43The implementation of complementary and traditional thera-pies in Turkey is regulated within the scope of \"Traditional and Complementary Medicine Practices Regulation.\" Within the scope of the regulation, it is stated that applications can only be made by physicians and dentists. 44 In other countries, nurses and other health professionals who have been trained in this subject can apply com-plementary and traditional practices. 1 Nurses who have theoretical and practical knowledge can take an active role in this field by mak - ing the necessary arrangements in Turkey. Conclusion Aromatherapy is an easily applicable method among traditional and complementary treatment methods. Studies examining the effec-tiveness of aromatherapy in coping with processes and problems related to women's health such as dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syn-drome, pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum period, and menopause have shown that the method is useful. Therefore, aromatherapy could be used as a complementary and traditional method for women's reproductive health problems, and strategies could be developed for nurses to take an advanced role in the application of this method.
