Dr. Low Dog is a founding member of the American Board of Integrative Medicine, was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy and served as the Chair of the Dietary Supplements and Botanicals Admission Evaluation Sub-Committee from 2010-2020. Dr. Low Dog has spoken at over 600 medical conferences, has written 54 peer-reviewed articles, 24 medical textbook chapters, and authored five books of her own, including four with Natural Geographic: Fortify Your Life, Healthy at Home, Life is Your Best Medicine, and Guide to Medicinal Herbs. Herbal dietary supplement use in the United States is soaring and shows no sign of slowing. In 2020, sales reached over $11 billion, and surveys report that 25% of patients take herbal supplements alongside prescription medication. However, approximately 75% of those patients do not tell their healthcare providers about their supplement use, and many clinicians report that they lack critical information to effectively counsel patients about the safety and potential benefits of herbal therapies. Using a real-world case scenario, this highly informative session will provide practical tips and authoritative resources to enable clinicians to confidently counsel patients about using herbal dietary supplements. At the end of this activity learners will be able to: 1. Describe two quality concerns with botanical products. 2. Identify two evidence-based resources for evaluating botanicals for potential herb-drug interactions and hepatotoxicity. 3. Discuss the evidence of safety and benefit for four top-selling botanicals in the United States.
