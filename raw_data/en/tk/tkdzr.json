In Taoism, qi is referenced as the creative life force of spirituality that is present in the essence of the breath. The word qi is referenced three times in the Tao Te Ching, in Chapters 10, 42, and 55. In the well-regarded Derek Lin translation published by SkyLight Illuminations, Chapter 10 discusses the mystic virtue that can be achieved by ''concentrating the energy and reaching relaxation.'' This chapter references qi as ''the breath or energy that courses through all living things.'' In Chapter 42, Lao Tzu discusses the ''myriad things, backed by yin and embracing yang.'' Derek Lin notes that ''all living things are thus rooted in yin energy \u2014 the source of life \u2014 while moving to the rhythm of the active yang principle.'' Chapter 55 warns against the excessive cultivation of qi, stating ''mind overusing energy is said to be aggressive.'' Confucius (551-479 B.C.E.), another famed Chinese philosopher and spiritual thinker, does not often discuss qi in his writings, but his teachings are frequently referenced by qigong masters throughout the centuries. Qigong is a Chinese system of breath control and physical exercise that helps the practitioner cultivate qi. Confucius teaches that morality and social order are the paths to the cultivation and transformation of one's life force. Confucius warns his followers to guard against excessive lust, strife, and avarice. Chinese Characters for Qigong | | Following the tradition of Confucianism, Chinese philosopher Mencius (372-289 B.C.E.) connects the cultivation of qi and courageous action to moral righteousness. Mencius discusses that qi is governed by the heart and mind. Qi is discussed in detail in the Taoist book Huai Nan Zi, written c. 122 B.C.E., while 11th-century philosopher Zhang Zai (1020-1077) overviews qi as the energetic essence of the universe. In modern times, qi cultivation is widely practiced by Qigong and martial arts practitioners around the world. Taijiquan, also known as T'ai Chi, a Chinese martial arts system based on slow movements and forms, was formally placed on the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Taijiquan is practiced by hundreds of millions of individuals every day throughout the globe. The Uses of Qi Energy Qi energy has numerous functional uses: for health and well-being, in martial arts, and in architecture, nature, and surroundings. It connects all elements of the universal life force spiritually, emotionally, physically, and energetically. Qi is the electric current that runs through all elements of matter. It runs through the meridians of the body, energetic pathways that allow the energy to flow throughout the entire organism. Health and Well-Being The theoretical foundations of TCM were established between the 2nd century B.C.E. and the 2nd century C.E. Qi is a fundamental concept in medicinal practices such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, and massage. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese practice that involves placing needles into various energetic points in the body to stimulate the flow of qi throughout the body. TCM believes that qi can become ''stuck'' or stagnant in the body, and in those places of stuck qi an individual will experience, pain, disease, and dysfunction. By placing needles in the locations of stuck qi, it is believed that these acupuncture points can stimulate the body's central nervous system, creating biochemical changes that can encourage the activation of the body's natural healing properties. Acupuncture is used to treat physical ailments as well as mental and emotional issues. Herbal medicine is commonly prescribed in TCM. Combinations of herbal remedies are prescribed to help balance a person's qi. TCM practitioners may prescribe moxibustion, which is the burning of mugwort leaves near the skin's surface to enhance acupuncture healing. The purpose of moxibustion can help the body stimulate the blood flow and qi, strengthening a person's overall health and helping to heal chronic pain and digestive symptoms. In some instances, acupuncture practitioners will place the burning moxa leaves on the needles, transferring the heat to the acupuncture point. Common herbs used in TCM include astragalus, licorice, ginger, dong quai, panax ginseng, and lycium. Chinese herbal medicine is used to treat liver disease, infertility, and menstrual pain, and to support cancer treatment. Qi massage therapy is commonly used in TCM to improve the flow of energy in the body, balance the metabolism, and invigorate the circulation of blood. During qi massage therapy, the acupuncture points and energy channels will be manipulated in order to improve the circulatory system, assist in the healing of chronic conditions, and help stimulate the self-healing properties of the body's immune system. Exercise is essential for maintaining a proper balance of qi in the body. Chinese practices such as qigong, tai chi, walking, and martial arts are utilized to cultivate and cleanse the qi of the practitioner. Martial Arts Many martial artists study T'ai Chi and Qigong. The practice of T'ai Chi, or Taijiquan, means cultivating internal energy. In Taijiquan, chi is the cultivation of internal power, known as ji. The famous saying in Chinese proverb is Yi Dao, Qi Dao, which means, ''Where the mind goes, the chi will follow.'' T'ai Chi, Qigong, Bagua Quan, and Xingyiquan are known as internal martial arts, while Shaolin Kung Fu and Judo are external martial arts. Internal martial arts are highly influenced by the spiritual aspects of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. The practice of moving internally in T'ai Chi stimulates a balance of the body and mind and alleviates the potential for illness from Qigong Deviation Syndrome, which is a disease of the mind that occurs when qi is not cultivated without proper instruction. There are five main forms of T'ai Chi: Yang, Chen, Wu, Sun, and Hao. All the styles maintain the same origin but each has unique characteristics that define the methods of movement. Quan is known as ''fist'' in Chinese, and it means to control or subdue the opponent. External quan is found in Shaolin practices, the ancient art of Kung Fu that originated over 1,500 years ago when the Bodhidharma from India arrived at the Shaolin temple and taught the monks a series of practices to cultivate health and self-defense. A practitioner of martial arts cultivates qi in order to create improved levels of quan. Architecture, Nature, and Surroundings The scientific art of feng shui is the Chinese traditional practice of utilizing the interactive energy of the surrounding environment to harmonize with the individuals inhabiting the space. Part mathematics, part astrology, and part science, feng shui is also commonly practiced in architecture. Feng shui translates as ''wind water,'' and the practice of feng shui is used to bring happiness, success, and good fortune to a home or living space. Feng shui teaches that qi comes from the sky (heaven qi), from the mountains, rivers, and underground (earth qi), and one must balance these elements in order to create life-enhancing energy (sheng qi) and avoid stagnant, depleting, and depressing energy (si qi). Feng shui practitioners avoid clutter, as it is indicative of negative energy. Elements of the physical space are balanced between aspects of yin and yang (passive and active). Feng shui promotes proportional energy to create balance in a space and may use water fountains, plants, candles, mirrors, the placement of objects, and a careful selection of colors to stimulate optimal energy. Restoring Balance Using Qi Chinese medicine teaches that in order for the body to regain balance, a balance must be achieved between the functioning of the external elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, and the internal organ system. There are different types of qi in the body: yuan qi (primary), zong qi (lung or chest), ying qi (nutrition), and wei qi (defensive). According to the book The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine written in 237 B.C.E., when the qi flows freely there is no pain, and where there is pain the qi does not flow freely. TCM and internal martial arts are used to heal the human body so it can live in a state of balance and optimal health. Lesson Summary Qi is the ''flowing vital energy'' in traditional Chinese philosophy that binds all elements together in the universe. Within the human body, the quality of qi is reflective of the internal health of the organs and blood as well as the outside elements that are taken into the body such as food, water, air, and the environment. When qi is in balance an individual experiences health, inner calmness, and stability. When qi is out of balance one experiences physical, mental, and emotional illness. The cultivation of qi is utilized in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a philosophy of medicine that works to achieve harmony in an individual's life force. Qi runs through the meridians of the body, which are energetic pathways that flow through an organism. The symbol of yin and yang represents the balance of opposing forces in the universe, and TCM strives to keep a person's yin and yang elements in balance. Early ancient Chinese philosophers such as Lao Tzu, who wrote the Tao Te Ching, referenced qi as an essential element of the breath or energy that exists in all living things. Many martial artists practice Qigong, an internal martial arts system that helps one cultivate qi and proper breath control. External martial arts such as Shaolin cultivate quan, which translates as ''fist'' in Chinese and means to subdue the opponent. "}
