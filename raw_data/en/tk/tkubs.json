Landress |What is public health and who is responsible for insuring the public health? If the state is responsible for public health, how far can the state go to insure the public welfare (and whose welfare counts)? Is there a way to reconcile the collective well-being with individual rights? This course considers the ways in which Americans have answered these questions from the colonial period through the twenty-first century. Using both primary documents and secondary sources, the course explores how American society has responded to both epidemic diseases (from smallpox to Zika) and to immigrants, how Americans have negotiated the challenges of the environment and the workplace, and how as a society we have considered the implications of such behavioral practices as cigarette smoking, wearing motorcycle helmets, and eating fast food for health outcomes. The course examines both the development of public health administrations (at the local, state and federal level) and the role of the legal system in promoting the public health of Americans. | Graduate students enrolled in 509 must enroll concurrently in MED HIST 709. |Cross-listed with History of Science | 3 credits.

Specifically, we will examine the role of language and culture in the creation and circulation of biomedical knowledge; our lived experiences with illness (physical and mental); the intricate intersections of race, gender, sexuality, disability and medicine; the political dimensions of diagnosis, disease, and epidemics, and the role that fiction, creative non-fiction, comics, and film play in shaping our experiences with health and medicine as health care providers and as patients. The course does not assume any background in science or medicine. One of our recurrent topics, in fact, will be to consider how non-experts interact with medicine and its technical vocabularies. Although the primary objective of the course is to understand the cultural, social, and political dimensions of health and medicine, a secondary objective is for students to become more savvy patients and, for the few students who might emerge on the other side of the stethoscope one day, more well-rounded health care professionals.||Cross-listed with English and History of Science | 3 cr.; H Humanities, C (counts for L&S), A (Advanced) Tuesday/Thursday 11:00 am - 12:15 pm Prerequisites: Declared in Health and the Humanities Certificate | | Medical History and Bioethics 532: Instructor: Judith A. Houck |Perhaps it all started with the nature-nurture debate. By dividing the living world into biology (flesh, blood, genes, hormones, germs) and culture (environment, politics, tradition, commerce, history), we have come to regard bodies as objects immune to historical forces. This course challenges this understanding of bodies. By focusing primarily on American bodies in the 19th and 20th centuries, this course demonstrates that human bodies have social and cultural histories. The lived experience and cultural meanings of human bodies are dependent on their social settings. Biology is surely not irrelevant to bodily experience. But the interpretation and valuation of biology, indeed what is considered biological, change over time. This course will highlight the social values placed on different bodies and the changing social expectations bodies create. This course will pay particular attention to the following questions: How have cultural and social changes in American history influenced the meaning and experience of bodies? How have attempts to establish social status and difference focused on bodies? How has the social and economic value of bodies differed according to race, class, sex, and \"fitness?\" How has a focus on bodies individualized social problems?||Cross-listed History of Science and with Gender and Women's Studies | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), A (Advanced) Tuesday/Thursday 9:30 - 10:45 am Prerequisites: Junior standing. | | Medical History and Bioethics 558: Instructor: Rob Streiffer |Study of ethical issues arising from medical procedures and aspects of health care such as abortion, genetic screening, paternalism, informed consent, prenatal diagnosis, prolongation of life, treatment of severe birth defects, and human subjects research.

Whether through fiction or nonfiction, poetry or prose, text or graphics, giving voice to the stories of patients and caregivers allows their experiences to be heard, made sense of, and valued. Learning to listen to others and to express one's own vulnerabilities are valuable tools for all health practitioners, but they are especially valuable in the context of public health. The scope of public health interventions encourages practitioners to think in terms of populations, but efforts to improve quality of life through prevention must ultimately be grounded in individual lives. Explore how narrative medicine techniques can enrich the practice of public health, both through the power of listening to stories to understand how individuals experience health and through the power of telling stories to mobilize communities.||Not cross-listed | 2 cr.

Kreitmair |What is the mind? Today, most philosophers and neuroscientists believe it is, in one way or another, just the brain. Brain research is progressing at a staggering pace. Neuroimaging technology seems to be closing in on 'thought identification', i.e. determining an individual's thought content merely by scanning the brain. Do we have a right to keep our thoughts private or is it permissible to use imaging technologies, perhaps in judicial settings, to identify someone's thoughts? What happens to our concepts of moral responsibility when a brain scan reveals abnormalities in the brain? Do these findings have bearing on our understanding of free will? Simple drugs can prevent the forming of memories of painful events. Should we take these drugs to shield ourselves from traumatic memories or is it good for us to remember unpleasant events in order to learn and grow from them? Neurotechnology and pharmacology that enhances cognition is advancing rapidly. Is manipulating our brains into smarter, more efficient ones ethical? Neurowearables allow us to track and interfere with brain activity. What does this mean for how we live our everyday lives? And what happens to the massive amounts of brain data generated? Patients are surviving severe brain injuries with massive neurological damage and unclear levels of preserved conscious experience. What is the ethically appropriate decision regarding the use of technology and life-sustaining treatments for these individuals? Armed with a foundation in ethical theory and philosophical methodology, we will consider these questions and others like them. While this course requires no previous knowledge of philosophy or neuroscience, it is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students.||Cross-listed with Philosophy | 3 cr.; Humanities, I (Intermediate) Tuesday/Thursday 1:00 -2:15 PM Prerequisites: Junior standing. | | Medical History and Bioethics 545: Instructor: Norman Fost |This course will explore and examine the core ethical issues in clinical research, regulations governing clinical investigation, and the role of good clinical practice for clinical trials.

Keller |Intense concern over the burgeoning of emerging infectious diseases-along with the renewed vigor of known epidemics-has heightened medical, media, and popular attention to the international dimensions of health in a globalizing society. Yet historians have long recognized the \"microbial unification of the world\" as a phenomenon that dates at least to the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Drawing on a wide range of historical and anthropological materials and methods, this course explores the history of public health and medicine as international phenomena, concentrating chiefly on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specific topics include the connections between global pandemics such as cholera and plague to European colonial expansion; the rise of international aid organizations; historical and contemporary anxieties about global migration and the spread of disease; and the international dimensions of a global medical marketplace. Particular themes include the connection between culture and medical ideas and practices; and the tensions of practicing medicine in multi-cultural settings. | Graduate/Professional students registered in Med Hist/Hist of Sci/Pop Hlth 553 must register concurrently in MHB 753. |Cross listed with History of Science and Population Health | 3 credits.

These include animal welfare, animal rights, vegetarianism, and veganism; the environmental impact of agriculture; the treatment of workers in agriculture, the prospects for ethical reform of agriculture; the ethical responsibilities of corporate and industry actors in the food supply; and labeling issues surrounding the use of modern biotechnology in the food supply. Some issues are more theoretical, such as whether certain individuals affected by agriculture deserve direct moral consideration. Other are more practical, such as how to feed a growing global population and how to reduce the diet-related harms caused by our current food system. We will begin with a brief survey of ethical theories and methods of ethical reasoning, and then explore, from both personal and policy perspectives, several food ethics issues.

The course will feature weekly invited lectures from a number of experts coming from the Medical History and Bioethics department. It will examine urgent topics such as the role that race, national origin, gender, sexuality, religion, socio economic status play in shaping ideas about disease, health and body normativity, and how they have modeled medical practice and public health policies. We will pay special attention to how these factors determine how patients and providers experience and ideate disease and treatment, and how they respond to specific health care policies. The course will make emphasis on the important role that conditions of structural violence and inequality play as determinants of health conditions in a globalized world.||Cross-listed with Anthropology | 3 credits.

Kreitmair |What is the mind? Today, most philosophers and neuroscientists believe it is, in one way or another, just the brain. Brain research is progressing at a staggering pace. Neuroimaging technology seems to be closing in on 'thought identification', i.e. determining an individual's thought content merely by scanning the brain. Do we have a right to keep our thoughts private or is it permissible to use imaging technologies, perhaps in judicial settings, to identify someone's thoughts? What happens to our concepts of moral responsibility when a brain scan reveals abnormalities in the brain? Do these findings have bearing on our understanding of free will? Simple drugs can prevent the forming of memories of painful events. Should we take these drugs to shield ourselves from traumatic memories or is it good for us to remember unpleasant events in order to learn and grow from them? Neurotechnology and pharmacology that enhances cognition is advancing rapidly. Is manipulating our brains into smarter, more efficient ones ethical? Neurowearables allow us to track and interfere with brain activity. What does this mean for how we live our everyday lives? And what happens to the massive amounts of brain data generated? Patients are surviving severe brain injuries with massive neurological damage and unclear levels of preserved conscious experience. What is the ethically appropriate decision regarding the use of technology and life-sustaining treatments for these individuals? Armed with a foundation in ethical theory and philosophical methodology, we will consider these questions and others like them. While this course requires no previous knowledge of philosophy or neuroscience, it is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students.||Cross-listed with Philosophy | 3 cr.; Humanities, I (Intermediate) ONLINE, Tuesday/Thursday 1:00 -2:15 PM Prerequisites: Junior standing. | | Medical History and Bioethics 545: Instructor: Norman Fost |This course will explore and examine the core ethical issues in clinical research, regulations governing clinical investigation, and the role of good clinical practice for clinical trials.

Yet historians have long recognized the \"microbial unification of the world\" as a phenomenon that dates at least to the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Drawing on a wide range of historical and anthropological materials and methods, this course explores the history of public health and medicine as international phenomena, concentrating chiefly on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specific topics include the connections between global pandemics such as cholera and plague to European colonial expansion; the rise of international aid organizations; historical and contemporary anxieties about global migration and the spread of disease; and the international dimensions of a global medical marketplace. Particular themes include the connection between culture and medical ideas and practices; and the tensions of practicing medicine in multi-cultural settings. | Graduate/Professional students registered in Med Hist/Hist of Sci/Pop Hlth 553 must register concurrently in MHB 753. |Cross listed with History of Science and Population Health | 3 credits.

In this course we will engage with diverse sources-from philosophy to epidemiology, anthropology, and literature-to address this and many related questions. We will examine the ethical principles that have been said to underlie global health policies, and we will ask how concerns about global health should shape our daily choices. We will ask whether it is moral obligation to be an \"effective altruist,\" which is someone who is dedicated to giving a great deal to the most effective charities around the world. To what extent is it permissible to prioritize causes that are near to our hearts and houses, when that money could do more good if donated to an organization that does work half a world away? \u2014 No prior knowledge of bioethics, philosophy, or global health is required.||Not cross-listed | 3 credits.

Whether through fiction or nonfiction, poetry or prose, text or graphics, giving voice to the stories of patients and caregivers allows their experiences to be heard, made sense of, and valued. Learning to listen to others and to express one's own vulnerabilities are valuable tools for all health practitioners, but they are especially valuable in the context of public health. The scope of public health interventions encourages practitioners to think in terms of populations, but efforts to improve quality of life through prevention must ultimately be grounded in individual lives. Explore how narrative medicine techniques can enrich the practice of public health, both through the power of listening to stories to understand how individuals experience health and through the power of telling stories to mobilize communities.||Not cross-listed | 2 cr.

The course does not assume any background in science or medicine. One of our recurrent topics, in fact, will be to consider how non-experts interact with medicine and its technical vocabularies.

Houck |Perhaps it all started with the nature-nurture debate. By dividing the living world into biology (flesh, blood, genes, hormones, germs) and culture (environment, politics, tradition, commerce, history), we have come to regard bodies as objects immune to historical forces. This course challenges this understanding of bodies. By focusing primarily on American bodies in the 19th and 20th centuries, this course demonstrates that human bodies have social and cultural histories. The lived experience and cultural meanings of human bodies are dependent on their social settings. Biology is surely not irrelevant to bodily experience. But the interpretation and valuation of biology, indeed what is considered biological, change over time. This course will highlight the social values placed on different bodies and the changing social expectations bodies create. This course will pay particular attention to the following questions: How have cultural and social changes in American history influenced the meaning and experience of bodies? How have attempts to establish social status and difference focused on bodies? How has the social and economic value of bodies differed according to race, class, sex, and \"fitness?\" How has a focus on bodies individualized social problems?||Cross-listed History of Science and with Gender and Women's Studies | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), A (Advanced) Tuesday/Thursday 9:30 - 10:45 am Prerequisites: Must have Junior standing or Higher.

Potential topics include: the economic and moral considerations for and against government involvement in health care markets; the vexing question of whether citizens in advanced nations have strong duties to promote the health and well-being of the foreign poor; whether U.S. hospitals have duties to provide \"uncompensated care\" (read: free care) to undocumented immigrants, and whether these hospitals may ethically seek the deportation of undocumented individuals; alternative approaches to rationing health care; the perennial ethical tension between treating those in dire peril now and preventing the deaths of statistical victims in the future; personal responsibility for risky health behaviors and the government's role in influencing health behaviors; and, finally, cutting-edge issues of exploitation in public health research trials.||Not cross-listed | 1 cr.; Graduate, advanced Tuesday 5:30 - 7:00 pm (meets March 6 through May 1) Prerequisites: Limited to 4th year medical students | | Medical History and Bioethics 919: Instructor: Pablo Gomez |In this interdisciplinary graduate course, we will put in conversation recent literature on the history of the body, with histories of race, capitalism, labor, science, biomedicine, and public health. Departing from a well-developed historiography on the cultural and social history of the body, we will examine works that analyze how different societies from the early modern period onwards have developed methods for the quantification of human bodies, and the economic value of corporeality and its imagined labor output. | During the semester, we will pay particular attention to historiographical approaches to the question of how political economy, financial markets, and different economic models around the globe have transformed not only ideas about the body, but also its very materiality. Among other topics, we will study historical examinations of the close relationships between the history of coerced labor - prominently slavery - and capitalism, as well as works focused on the effects of capitalist-embodied material culture on the production of new ways of being-in-the-world. We will also analyze how scholars in a variety of fields have grappled with the history of biomedical bodily quantification, corporeal commodification, racial capitalism, calculation of risk related to the human body, and uses of the value of racialized and gendered bodies in, for instance, financial transactions and public health studies. |Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 credits.

It explores the understanding of health and illness in Western culture, showing why particular ideas of illness came into dominance at different moments in history. Most importantly, by providing the \"long perspective\" on the history of medicine, the course challenges some widely held assumptions about how the advancement of science has contributed to modern medicine. | The historical survey is divided into four units, each of which is based in a different view of the body. The first unit, called \"The Humoral Body\" explains the exceptionally flexible ideas of illness and its causes that were first developed in the ancient world and persisted for many centuries until well past 1700. Some of the ideas first developed in humoral medicine, such as the intimate interactions between the body and its environment, are still with us today. The second unit, called \"The Anatomical-Morphological Body,\" examines the body as a collection of discrete parts which perform particular functions in the body's overall economy. This anatomical view of the body also developed in the ancient world, although anatomically based approaches to the study of illness really only became influential in the 1700s and 1800s. The third unit, \"The Infected Body,\" looks at how illness first came to be seen not merely as something affecting individuals, but also as something having important consequences for society as a whole. This thinking first emerged in the wake of the Black Death in 14th-century Europe, and it was important in the development of the Germ Theory of Disease in the latter part of the 19th century. Finally, the fourth unit of the course will look at \"The body normalized and measured,\" an appropriate label for medicine in the 20th century, when physicians developed the idea that seemingly no one's health could be maintained without incessant medical attention and supervision. Needless to say, this is the view of health and illness that persists in our own time. In this unit we also consider how health has become something that can be purchased like any other consumer product. Course Requirements: Aside from attendance in discussion sections, the basic requirement for the course consists of a mixture of three take-home essays ranging from three to five pages in length, which are based in the readings and designed to illustrate the major issues in each unit. Discussion sections may also feature some shorter and more informal writing assignments.

If the state is responsible for public health, how far can the state go to insure the public welfare (and whose welfare counts)? Is there a way to reconcile the collective well-being with individual rights? This course considers the ways in which Americans have answered these questions from the colonial period through the twenty-first century. Using both primary documents and secondary sources, the course explores how American society has responded to both epidemic diseases (from smallpox to Zika) and to immigrants, how Americans have negotiated the challenges of the environment and the workplace, and how as a society we have considered the implications of such behavioral practices as cigarette smoking, wearing motorcycle helmets, and eating fast food for health outcomes. The course examines both the development of public health administrations (at the local, state and federal level) and the role of the legal system in promoting the public health of Americans. | Graduate students registered in 509 must register concurrently in MHB 709. |Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 credits.

Yet historians have long recognized the \"microbial unification of the world\" as a phenomenon that dates at least to the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Drawing on a wide range of historical and anthropological materials and methods, this course explores the history of public health and medicine as international phenomena, concentrating chiefly on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specific topics include the connections between global pandemics such as cholera and plague to European colonial expansion; the rise of international aid organizations; historical and contemporary anxieties about global migration and the spread of disease; and the international dimensions of a global medical marketplace. Particular themes include the connection between culture and medical ideas and practices; and the tensions of practicing medicine in multi-cultural settings. | Graduate students registered in 553 must register concurrently in MHB 753. |Cross listed with History of Science and Population Health | 3 credits.

Our temporal reach is expansive, from the shifting patterns of yellow fever accompanying the Atlantic slave trade to the global threat of avian influenza arising from factory farms and changing diets worldwide. We will consider a range of commodities\u2014from cotton and coal to latex and blood\u2014to name just a few, to ask what commodities, and associated diseases that accompanied them, can reveal about changing economic, material, political, and social relationships on the global stage. At the same time, we will interrogate the ways that changing ecological regimes of capital have altered and redistributed life\u2014both human and non-human\u2014and created new disease pathways. We will also attend to the different questions, methods, and forms of evidence that economic, environmental, and medical history bring to a consideration of such questions. This is a historiographic based seminar focused on readings and discussion. A sample of likely books include Sven Beckert's Empire of Cotton (2014); Mike Davis's The Monster at Our Door (2006); Gabrielle Hecht's Being Nuclear (2014); Nancy Rose Hunt's A Nervous State (2016); Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner's Lead Wars (2013); Sidney Mintz's Sweetness and Power (1986); John Soluri's Banana Cultures (2006); and Brett Walker's Toxic Archipelago (2009) among many other reading selections.||Crosslisted with History of Science 919 and meets with History 705 | 3 credits.

How do race, class, and gender affect our understandings of and experiences with illness? How have diseases shaped American history? This course is designed to illustrate the various ways disease operates in America. We will examine the role of disease on at least four levels - political, social, cultural, and personal - to demonstrate that diseases are not merely bodily afflictions; they are also participants in the body politic. At first glance, this course outline might look like one disease after another, and on some level it is. However, the diseases are chosen to illustrate a different point about the social and cultural lives of disease in the history of the United States. Although the course moves forward chronologically, it is not meant as a narrative history of disease.||Not cross-listed | 3 cr.; H Humanities, E (Elementary) Tuesday/Thursday 9:30 - 10:15 am | | Medical History and Bioethics 394: Instructor: Scott Prinster |Why is the United States a scientific nation?

We will trace the development of scientific knowledge and institutions in the United States from the colonial period to the present, viewing science, technology, and medicine as social and cultural expressions as well as knowledge about nature. We will cover the migration of European science, its development in colonial America, the formation of a national scientific community, the emergence of Big Science, and the tensions between the sciences and other value systems. We will also give special attention to the complex relationships of science with religion, race and ethnicity, gender, and economics.

Fall 2016 | | Medical History and Bioethics 212: Instructor: Thomas Broman |General Description: This course presents an introductory survey of the history of medicine from Antiquity to the 20th Century, and is aimed primarily at students interested in careers in the health professions. It explores the understanding of health and illness in Western culture, showing why particular ideas of illness came into dominance at different moments in history. Most importantly, by providing the \"long perspective\" on the history of medicine, the course challenges some widely held assumptions about how the advancement of science has contributed to modern medicine. | The historical survey is divided into four units, each of which is based in a different view of the body. The first unit, called \"The Humoral Body\" explains the exceptionally flexible ideas of illness and its causes that were first developed in the ancient world and persisted for many centuries until well past 1700. Some of the ideas first developed in humoral medicine, such as the intimate interactions between the body and its environment, are still with us today. The second unit, called \"The Anatomical-Morphological Body,\" examines the body as a collection of discrete parts which perform particular functions in the body's overall economy. This anatomical view of the body also developed in the ancient world, although anatomically based approaches to the study of illness really only became influential in the 1700s and 1800s. The third unit, \"The Infected Body,\" looks at how illness first came to be seen not merely as something affecting individuals, but also as something having important consequences for society as a whole. This thinking first emerged in the wake of the Black Death in 14th-century Europe, and it was important in the development of the Germ Theory of Disease in the latter part of the 19th century. Finally, the fourth unit of the course will look at \"The body normalized and measured,\" an appropriate label for medicine in the 20th century, when physicians developed the idea that seemingly no one's health could be maintained without incessant medical attention and supervision. Needless to say, this is the view of health and illness that persists in our own time. In this unit we also consider how health has become something that can be purchased like any other consumer product. Course Requirements: Aside from attendance in discussion sections, the basic requirement for the course consists of a mixture of three take-home essays ranging from three to five pages in length, which are based in the readings and designed to illustrate the major issues in each unit. Discussion sections may also feature some shorter and more informal writing assignments.

In this class we will analyze the motivations and actions of individuals engaged in health care, as they contain infectious disease outbreaks, make a profit, deliver children, try to understand suffering, trauma, and death, pioneer new healing techniques, promote social equity and access to care, decide which bodily states are healthy and which are pathological, and, in general, try to promote human flourishing, either just their own or other people's. As such, the sweep of the story of American health care is not just that of the development of new, life-saving treatments for disease, but is also a deeper inquiry into the way medicine interacted with culture, politics and society in America.

Yet historians have long recognized the \"microbial unification of the world\" as a phenomenon that dates at least to the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Drawing on a wide range of historical and anthropological materials and methods, this course explores the history of public health and medicine as international phenomena, concentrating chiefly on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specific topics include the connections between global pandemics such as cholera and plague to European colonial expansion; the rise of international aid organizations; historical and contemporary anxieties about global migration and the spread of disease; and the international dimensions of a global medical marketplace. Particular themes include the connection between culture and medical ideas and practices; and the tensions of practicing medicine in multi-cultural settings. | Graduate students registered in 553 must register concurrently in MHB 753. |Crosslisted with History of Science and Population Health | 3 credits; Either Humanities or Social Science.

Nelson |From medical advancements to environmental crises and global food shortages, biology and the life sciences are implicated in some of the most pressing social issues of our time. This course explores events in the history of biology from the mid twentieth century to today, and examines how developments in this scientific field have shaped and are shaped by society. The course is divided into three thematic units. In the first unit, we investigate the origins of the institutions, technologies, and styles of practice that characterize contemporary biology; such as the use of mice as \"model organisms\" for understanding human diseases. In the second unit, we delve into areas of biology that have raised controversies about regulation, governance, and public participation; such as the introduction of genetically modified plants into the food supply. The final unit asks how biological facts and theories have been and continue to be used as a source for understanding ourselves. Within the units, each week begins with an examination of an historical event or controversy that provides an entry into a discussion about how biology and society interact. The creation of a cloned sheep named Dolly and the ensuing media coverage and controversy, for example, demonstrates how new reproductive technologies are challenging fundamental categories that we use to describe the life course such as \"parent\" and \"offspring.\" This course will help students in the sciences, social sciences, or humanities to develop the analytic and writing skills needed to confront complex social issues involving the life sciences.

How has the rise of emerging diseases shaped visions of the global environment? | This course begins to answer such questions by exploring the dynamic interplay between environment and health over the last 300 years. We will consider both the history of ideas about environment and illness as well as the ways in which changing environments have affected well-being. In addition, we will examine how place - from agricultural plantations to the factory floor, from health resorts to toxic waste sites - has mattered to the experience of illness, the production of knowledge, and the control of disease. We will also investigate various social, economic, and political forces that have historically shaped inequitable environmental and disease burdens and the different struggles for health and environmental justice that have occurred across the globe. |Cross-listed with History of Science, Environmental Studies | 3 credits; Z (Humanities or Social Science), Counts for Liberal Arts and Science credit in L&S.

Fall 2015 | | Medical History and Bioethics 212: Instructor: Thomas Broman |General Description: This course presents an introductory survey of the history of medicine from Antiquity to the 20th Century, and is aimed primarily at students interested in careers in the health professions. It explains how the understanding of health and illness has evolved in Western culture, showing why particular ideas of illness came into dominance at different moments in history. Most importantly, by providing the \"long perspective\" on the history of medicine, the course challenges some widely held assumptions about how the advancement of science has contributed to modern medicine. | The historical survey is divided into four units, each of which is based in a different view of the body. The first unit, called \"The Humoral Body\" explains the exceptionally flexible ideas of illness and its causes that were first developed in the ancient world and persisted for many centuries until well past 1700. Some of the ideas first developed in humoral medicine, such as the intimate interactions between the body and its environment, are still with us today. The second unit, called \"The Anatomical-Morphological Body,\" examines the body as a collection of discrete parts which perform particular functions in the body's overall economy. This anatomical view of the body also developed in the ancient world, although anatomically based approaches to the study of illness really only became influential in the 1700s and 1800s. The third unit, \"The Infected Body,\" looks at how illness first came to be seen not merely as something affecting individuals, but also as something having important consequences for society as a whole. This kind of thinking first emerged in the wake of the Black Death in 14th-century Europe, and it was important in the development of the Germ Theory of Disease in the latter part of the 19th century. Finally, the fourth unit of the course will look at \"The body normalized and measured,\" an appropriate label for medicine in the 20th century, when physicians developed the idea that seemingly no one's health could be maintained without incessant medical attention and supervision. Needless to say, this is the view of health and illness that persists in our own time. In this unit we also consider how health has become something that can be purchased like any other consumer product, as for example in the case of plastic surgery to correct minor flaws in one's appearance. Course Requirements: Aside from attendance in discussion sections, the basic requirement for the course consists of a mixture of three take-home essays, ranging from three to seven pages, which are based in the readings and meant to illustrate the major issues in each unit. Discussion sections may also feature some shorter and more informal writing assignments.

Lederer |This course focuses on medicine and health care in 20th century America. The course addresses, among other topics, why and how the United States developed our current health care system. In so doing, we will consider the changes in both preventative medicine (vaccines, fluoridation) and in medical therapy (especially penicillin and other antibiotics) that transformed the experience of health care and the expectations about what medical science could and should do. Other topics include the rise of hospitals, the changing face of the American medical and nursing professions, development of new technologies (x-rays, telephones, etc), debates over national health insurance, the cultural authority of the medical profession, and media representations of doctors, nurses, patients and hospitals.||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; S (Social Science), C (L&S), E (Elementary) Tuesday/Thursday 11:00 am - 12:15 pm Prerequisites: Open to Freshmen. | | Medical History and Bioethics 284: Instructor: Thomas Broman |This course accompanies Hist.

Because we meet in a seminar-type discussion format, enrollment is limited to eighteen. | The theme for 284 in 2015 will be \"Plagues in History.\" Through readings extending from Antiquity to recent coverage of the ebola epidemic in West Africa, we will begin by examining the origins of the concept of a \"plague\" in Biblical literature as well as in historical writings of ancient Greece. From there we will look at how the concept of plague has been constantly reinforced over many centuries, retaining a core set of key features even as it has also been applied to new outbreaks of disease and to new historical events such as the Holocaust. In all of this our focus will be on the question of what constitutes an event as a plague, as opposed to an epidemic or other outbreak of disease. Requirements: 1) Regular attendance at weekly meetings and preparation for them by doing readings beforehand; 2) Three or more short essays (about 250-350 words) of the \"reading response\" type; and 3) a final 5-6 page essay on recent concepts of plague or a topic of the student's choice, to be worked out in consultation with the instructor. Readings: Readings include a course reader that will be available from L&S Social Science Copy Center in August, Connie Willis Doomsday Book (an award winning sci-fi novel on the Black Death of the fourteenth century), Albert Camus The Plague (a famous allegory about the Holocaust from the late 1940s), and Randy Shilts And the Band Played On (a history of the AIDS epidemic in the late 1970s and 1980s). |Crosslisted with History of Science | 1 credit; H (Humanities), E (Elementary) Wednesday 11:00 - 11:50 am Prerequisites: Concurrent registration for honors in Hist Sci/Hist Med 212 or cons inst.

Nyhart |As many of you have probably experienced, \"biology\" is a very broad category covering many different ways of knowing living nature. This year, we will survey four different traditions in history of the life sciences since the 18th century-natural historical, agricultural, biomedical, and biophysical. We will focus on some \"classics\" and \"game-changers\" in the history of biology, and seek to put them in their broader scientific and social contexts. Such works will likely include: Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle, Mendel's pea-plant experiments, Claude Bernard's Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine, and Erwin Schroedinger's What is Life? | General requirements: Because this course revolves in good part around discussion, its success depends on its participants' having read the material carefully and being willing to talk about it. We will read both 'primary sources' (scientific writings by participants) and 'secondary sources' (writings by historians and scientists reflecting on and analyzing what happened). The reading load for any given week (2 sessions) will range from 100 pages to a (shortish) book. Undergraduate writing requirements: two take-home essay exams (4-5 pages) and a final paper (7-9 pages). For the final paper, students may choose between an exam-question style essay discussing a broad question provided by the professor or a research paper, the topic chosen in consultation with the professor. Students taking the course for Honors credit will write both a final essay and a research paper. Some class sessions may be devoted to workshopping take-home essays and/or presentations of research. Graduate writing requirements: 20+ pages of scholarly prose (4-5 book reviews, a bibliographic or historiographical essay to prepare for prelims, a research paper, a dissertation proposal) as determined by your individual needs. Graduate students will meet separately from undergrads to discuss additional readings from a historiographic perspective. |Crosslisted with History of Science. | 3 credits.

We will then consider the moral implications of health disparities facing traditionally marginalized sub-populations. Finally, we will investigate the nature, justifiability, and methods of health care rationing, which many believe to be an unavoidable requirement of the near-universally shared goal of health care cost containment.||Crosslisted with Philosophy | 3 credits; H (Humanities) A (Advanced) Tuesday/Thursday 1:00 - 2:15 pm Prerequisites: Must have Junior standing or higher.

Yet, history reveals that neither the emergence of high-profile medical technologies nor the dilemmas that often accompany their arrival are strictly 'modern-day' phenomena. History also demonstrates that such technologies tend to reflect not only the medical science, but also the social concerns, of the periods in which they have emerged. In this course, we will explore the ways in which a range of technologies - e.g. stethoscopes, spirometers, sphygmomanometers, vaccines, hospital design, x-rays, ultrasound, computerized record-keeping, pharmaceuticals, reproductive technologies, gene therapy, artificial hearts and kidneys, virtual medicine, etc. - have at once shaped medicine and invited critique. Using readings from a range of sources that illuminate key medical technologies in the 18th- to 21st-century U.S., we will analyze these technologies in historical, social, and theoretical context. Questions guiding our work will include: What are the historical roots of significant medical technologies? How did these technologies change medical practice?||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 credits; Counts for Liberal Arts and Science credit in L&S.

To make headway in answering these questions, we will consider more specifically: whether (and why) we have duties to future generations; whether dominant economic evaluations of climate change are ethically problematic (including whether it is permissible to discount the moral importance of future harms and benefits); whether and how human rights bear on the assignment of climate change-related duties; whether the pattern of historical emissions is relevant to the assignment of such duties; how the current state of global economic development should bear on the assignment of climate change-related duties; whether geoengineering is a permissible response to the climate problem; and whether and how adaptation should figure in the response to climate change.||Not cross-listed | 3 credits.

Instructor Consent Required. Spring 2015 | | Medical History and Bioethics 133: Instructor: Nicole C. Nelson |From medical advancements to environmental crises and global food shortages, biology and the life sciences are implicated in some of the most pressing social issues of our time. This course explores events in the history of biology from the mid-twentieth century to today, and examines how developments in this scientific field have shaped and are shaped by society. The course is divided into three thematic units. In the first unit, we investigate the origins of the institutions, technologies, and styles of practice that characterize contemporary biology; such as the use of mice as \"model organisms\" for understanding human diseases. In the second unit, we delve into areas of biology that have raised controversies about regulation, governance, and public participation; such as the introduction of genetically modified plants into the food supply. The final unit asks how biological facts and theories have been and continue to be used as a source for understanding ourselves. Within the units, each week begins with an examination of an historical event or controversy that provides an entry into a discussion about how biology and society interact. The creation of a cloned sheep named Dolly and the ensuing media coverage and controversy, for example, demonstrates how new reproductive technologies are challenging fundamental categories that we use to describe the life course such as \"parent\" and \"offspring.\" This course will help students in the sciences, social sciences, or humanities to develop the analytic and writing skills needed to confront complex social issues involving the life sciences.

Students will explore prominent theoretical approaches to public health ethics and will engage with several ethical tensions. Issues discussed include: the use of coercive or intrusive public health interventions that restrict individual freedom, infringe upon individual privacy, and/or invite individual harm (or risks of harm); the justification of paternalistic measures in societies or sub-populations that seemingly indulge in pleasurable yet unhealthy behaviors; the need to choose between the identifiable victims we can save with expensive measures here and now and the more numerous unidentifiable victims we could save in the future with the same monetary investment; the trade-offs between maximizing aggregate health benefits and addressing the special needs of vulnerable social sub-groups and individuals; ethical issues in international pharmaceutical research; ethical issues involving vaccination, screening, and surveillance; and the ethics of private gun ownership.||Crosslisted with Philosophy (Phil 515) | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), A (Advanced) Tu/Th 9:30AM - 10:45AM Prerequisites: Must have Junior standing or higher.

Houck |Perhaps it all started with the nature-nurture debate. By dividing the living world into biology (flesh, blood, genes, hormones, germs) and culture (environment, politics, tradition, commerce, history), we have come to regard bodies as objects immune to historical forces. This course challenges this understanding of bodies. By focusing primarily on American bodies in the 19th and 20th centuries, this course demonstrates that human bodies have social and cultural histories. The lived experience and cultural meanings of human bodies are dependent on their social settings. Biology is surely not irrelevant to bodily experience. But the interpretation and valuation of biology, indeed what is considered biological, change over time. This course will highlight the social values placed on different bodies and the changing social expectations bodies create. This course will pay particular attention to the following questions: How have cultural and social changes in American history influenced the meaning and experience of bodies? How have attempts to establish social status and difference focused on bodies? How has the social and economic value of bodies differed according to race, class, sex, and \"fitness?\" How has a focus on bodies individualized social problems?||Cross-listed History of Science and with Gender and Women's Studies | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), A (Advanced) Tu/Th 9:30AM - 10:45AM Prerequisites: Must have Junior standing or Higher.

Readings will be drawn from political philosophy, health care economics, behavioral economics, nonprofit thinktank white papers, Congressional testimony, news articles, and blog posts. The first half of the class will consist of units exploring the philosophical and economic bases underlying currently dominant perspectives on putative entitlements to health care. We will seek to understand health economists' concern to promote the \"efficiency\" of health resource allocation while constraining the \"moral hazard\" they detect when individuals use \"too much\" health care. In this context we will strive to identify values that may either compete with or override concerns with efficiency, so construed. The second half of the class will consist of units investigating the nature, justifiability, and methods of health care rationing-including bedside rationing by doctors-and the myriad issues implicated by the near-universally shared goal of health care cost containment. If time allows, we will further examine one of the following two questions: (1) Are there ethically defensible alternatives to the current patent regime for pharmaceutical development that could reduce drug costs while offering adequate or even enhanced levels of innovation?; (2) What, if anything, does a just government owe immigrants (legal and illegal) when it comes to health care?||Crosslisted with Philosophy | 3 credits; H (Humanities) A (Advanced) Tuesday/Thursday 1:00 - 2:15 pm Prerequisites: Must have Junior standing or higher.

We will consider both the history of ideas about environment and illness as well as the ways in which changing environments have affected well-being. In addition, we will examine how place - from agricultural plantations to the factory floor, from health resorts to toxic waste sites - has mattered to the experience of illness, the production of knowledge, and the control of disease. We will also investigate various social, economic, and political forces that have historically shaped inequitable environmental and disease burdens and the different struggles for health and environmental justice that have occurred across the globe. |Crosslisted with Environmental Studies and History of Science | 3 credits.

Yet, U.S. history reveals that neither the emergence of high-profile medical technologies nor the dilemmas that often accompany their arrival are strictly 'modern-day' phenomena. History also demonstrates that such technologies tend to reflect not only the medical science, but also the social concerns, of the periods in which they have emerged. In this course, we will explore the ways in which a range of technologies - e.g. stethoscopes, spirometers, sphygmomanometers, hospital design, x-rays, reproductive technologies, gene therapy, virtual medicine, etc. - have at once shaped medicine and invited critique. Using readings from a range of sources illuminating key medical technologies in the 18th- to 21st-century U.S., we will analyze these technologies in historical, social, and theoretical context. Questions guiding our work will include: What are the historical roots of significant medical technologies? How did these technologies shape medicine? Why have physicians and the pubic embraced some medical technologies and not others? What non-medical technologies have influenced the development of medical technologies? How has the historiography of medical technology shaped the histories of medicine and science as academic disciplines? Has medical technology ever been \"value free\"?||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 credits; Counts for Liberal Arts and Science credit in L&S.

Yet historians have long recognized the \"microbial unification of the world\" as a phenomenon that dates at least to the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Drawing on a wide range of historical and anthropological materials and methods, this course explores the history of public health and medicine as international phenomena, concentrating chiefly on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specific topics include the connections between global pandemics such as cholera and plague to European colonial expansion; the rise of international aid organizations; historical and contemporary anxieties about global migration and the spread of disease; and the international dimensions of a global medical marketplace. Particular themes include the connection between culture and medical ideas and practices; and the tensions of practicing medicine in multi-cultural settings. | Graduate students registered in 553 must register concurrently in MHB 753. |Crosslisted with History of Science and with Population Health | 3 credits; Either Humanities or Social Science.

Ruis |This course explores the relationship between health and citizenship. Among its key themes are the following questions: When did the link between health and human rights first emerge? How has it developed historically? What factors define citizenship? To what extent does physical and mental health constitute a gauge of enfranchisement and of one's access to power in the modern state? In what ways does the de facto absence of citizenship - in cases like those of ethnic minorities, the desperately poor, and colonial subject populations - delimit the possibility of a human right to health? How have structural health inequities historically posed significant threats to global security? Such questions have been central to studies of the political economy of health and disease, anthropology, and area studies, but have been less apparent in historical research. This course offers a key means for integrating these questions into an interdisciplinary approach to global health. | The course will focus primarily on the development of the relationship between health and citizenship in modern Europe beginning with the French Revolution and through the rise of the welfare state before exploring the implications of ideas about health and human rights in a global context. |Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 credits Tuesday/Thursday 11:00 am - 12:15 pm Prerequisites: Must have Junior standing or higher.

Nelson |From medical advancements to environmental crises and global food shortages, biology and the life sciences are implicated in some of the most pressing social issues of our time. This course explores events in the history of biology from the mid twentieth century to today, and examines how developments in this scientific field have shaped and are shaped by society. The course is divided into three thematic units. In the first unit, we investigate the origins of the institutions, technologies, and styles of practice that characterize contemporary biology; such as the use of mice as \"model organisms\" for understanding human diseases. In the second unit, we delve into areas of biology that have raised controversies about regulation, governance, and public participation; such as the introduction of genetically modified plants into the food supply. The final unit asks how biological facts and theories have been and continue to be used as a source for understanding ourselves. Within the units, each week begins with an examination of an historical event or controversy that provides an entry into a discussion about how biology and society interact. The creation of a cloned sheep named Dolly and the ensuing media coverage and controversy, for example, demonstrates how new reproductive technologies are challenging fundamental categories that we use to describe the life course such as \"parent\" and \"offspring.\" This course will help students in the sciences, social sciences, or humanities to develop the analytic and writing skills needed to confront complex social issues involving the life sciences.

Yet the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Carter Center International Task Force for Disease Eradication have targeted six other diseases for eradication with variable success, redoubling their efforts to eradicate two while ultimately abandoning campaigns to eradicate four others. What are the historical antecedents of 20th and 21st century campaigns to eradicate infectious diseases in global host populations? Why are certain diseases considered \"eradicable\" and how has that concept changed over time? What determines the success or failure of an eradication campaign and how has history shaped these factors? How do global eradication attempts differ from more familiar efforts to control or eliminate diseases like HIV/AIDS within smaller populations - and what is the historical significance of such distinctions? This graduate seminar addresses these questions, placing global infectious disease eradication efforts into a wider context that encompasses several centuries of history. The seminar focuses upon three very different diseases that illuminate wider historical dilemmas and other disease contexts: smallpox (the global eradication \"success story\" that prefigured the eradication of rinderpest and shaped the view that polio and guinea worm disease were suited for global eradication campaigns), malaria (an eradication \"failure\" whose abandoned eradication campaign parallels those of hookworm, yaws, and yellow fever), and HIV/AIDS (a global scourge for which control or elimination seem more prudent than eradication).||Crosslisted with History of Science. | 3 credits.

We will be looking at the ways in which skin color (and other elements of \"racial identity\") have influenced the experiences of patients, physicians and nurses, and medical researchers, seeking to document and analyze how conceptions of race have shaped the health concerns and health outcomes of Americans in the past two hundred years. Topics include the origins of racial classification, the health and medical care of slaves, the use of minorities as research subjects, especially the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, the history of racial disparities in medicine, and the efforts to integrate the American medical profession.||Cross-listed with History of Science and with Afro-American Studies | 3 cr.; S (Social Science), D (Intermediate or Advanced) Tu/Th 11:00AM - 12:15PM Prerequisites: Must have Junior standing or Higher.

Houck |Perhaps it all started with the nature-nurture debate. By dividing the living world into biology (flesh, blood, genes, hormones, germs) and culture (environment, politics, tradition, commerce, history), we have come to regard bodies as objects immune to historical forces. This course challenges this understanding of bodies. By focusing primarily on American bodies in the 19th and 20th centuries, this course demonstrates that human bodies have social and cultural histories. The lived experience and cultural meanings of human bodies are dependent on their social settings. Biology is surely not irrelevant to bodily experience. But the interpretation and valuation of biology, indeed what is considered biological, change over time. This course will highlight the social values placed on different bodies and the changing social expectations bodies create. This course will pay particular attention to the following questions: How have cultural and social changes in American history influenced the meaning and experience of bodies? How have attempts to establish social status and difference focused on bodies? How has the social and economic value of bodies differed according to race, class, sex, and \"fitness?\" How has a focus on bodies individualized social problems?||Cross-listed History of Science and with Gender and Women's Studies | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), A (Advanced) Tu/Th 9:30AM - 10:45AM Prerequisites: Must have Junior standing or Higher.

We will focus in particular on central issues raised by the recent U.S. health care reform debate and resulting legislation. Readings will be drawn from political philosophy, health care economics, behavioral economics, nonprofit thinktank white papers, Congressional testimony, news articles, and blog posts. The first half of the class will consist of units exploring the philosophical and economic bases underlying currently dominant perspectives on putative entitlements to health care. We will seek to understand health economists' concern to promote the \"efficiency\" of health resource allocation while constraining the \"moral hazard\" they detect when individuals use \"too much\" health care. In this context we will strive to identify values that may either compete with or override concerns with efficiency, so construed. The second half of the class will consist of units investigating the nature, justifiability, and methods of health care rationing-including bedside rationing by doctors-and the myriad issues implicated by the near-universally shared goal of health care cost containment. If time allows, we will further examine one of the following two questions: (1) Are there ethically defensible alternatives to the current patent regime for pharmaceutical development that could reduce drug costs while offering adequate or even enhanced levels of innovation?; (2) What, if anything, does a just government owe immigrants (legal and illegal) when it comes to health care?||Not cross-listed | 3 credits. 11:00am-12:15pm T/TH Prerequisites: Must have Junior standing or higher.

Yet, U.S. history reveals that neither the emergence of high-profile medical technologies nor the dilemmas that often accompany their arrival are strictly 'modern-day' phenomena. History also demonstrates that such technologies tend to reflect not only the medical science, but also the social concerns, of the periods in which they have emerged. In this course, we will explore the ways in which a range of technologies - e.g. stethoscopes, spirometers, sphygmomanometers, hospital design, x-rays, reproductive technologies, gene therapy, virtual medicine, etc. - have at once shaped medicine and invited critique. Using readings from a range of sources illuminating key medical technologies in the 18th- to 21st-century U.S., we will analyze these technologies in historical, social, and theoretical context. Questions guiding our work will include: What are the historical roots of significant medical technologies? How did these technologies shape medicine? Why have physicians and the pubic embraced some medical technologies and not others? What non-medical technologies have influenced the development of medical technologies? How has the historiography of medical technology shaped the histories of medicine and science as academic disciplines? Has medical technology ever been \"value free\"?||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 credits. Counts for Liberal Arts and Science credit in L&S.

Yet historians have long recognized the \"microbial unification of the world\" as a phenomenon that dates at least to the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Drawing on a wide range of historical and anthropological materials and methods, this course explores the history of public health and medicine as international phenomena, concentrating chiefly on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specific topics include the connections between global pandemics such as cholera and plague to European colonial expansion; the rise of international aid organizations; historical and contemporary anxieties about global migration and the spread of disease; and the international dimensions of a global medical marketplace. Particular themes include the connection between culture and medical ideas and practices; and the tensions of practicing medicine in multi-cultural settings. | Graduate students registered in 553 must register concurrently in MHB 753. |Crosslisted with History of Science and with Population Health. | 3 credits.

We will consider both the history of ideas about environment and disease as well as the ways in which changing environments have affected well-being. In addition, we will examine how places - as sites of study, experimentation, and intervention - have mattered to the production of knowledge and the control of disease. We will also investigate various social, economic, and political phenomena that have impinged upon and influenced health and healing on regional and global levels. |Crosslisted with Environmental Studies and History of Science. | 3 credits.

While the principal focus will be the place of madness and psychiatry in Western medicine, comparisons with Africa and Asia will also play a role in the course. We will examine the history of madness through a close reading of medical, sociological, philosophical, and popular literature. Focused readings of these texts will help reveal changes in social, medical, and aesthetic views on psychopathology in the modern period, providing a basis for understanding the place of madness in the contemporary world. | Graduate students registered in 543 must register concurrently in MHB 743. |Crosslisted with History of Science and with History. | 3 credits; Either Humanities or Social Science Counts for Liberal Arts and Science credit in L&S.

Yet historians have long recognized the \"microbial unification of the world\" as a phenomenon that dates at least to the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Drawing on a wide range of historical and anthropological materials and methods, this course explores the history of public health and medicine as international phenomena, concentrating chiefly on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specific topics include the connections between global pandemics such as cholera and plague to European colonial expansion; the rise of international aid organizations; historical and contemporary anxieties about global migration and the spread of disease; and the international dimensions of a global medical marketplace. Particular themes include the connection between culture and medical ideas and practices; and the tensions of practicing medicine in multi-cultural settings. | Graduate students registered in 553 must register concurrently in MHB 753. |Crosslisted with History of Science and with Population Health. | 3 credits; Either Humanities or Social Science.

Readings will be drawn from political philosophy, health care economics, behavioral economics, nonprofit thinktank white papers, Congressional testimony, news articles, and blog posts. The first half of the class will consist of units exploring the philosophical and economic bases underlying currently dominant perspectives on putative entitlements to health care. We will seek to understand health economists' concern to promote the \"efficiency\" of health resource allocation while constraining the \"moral hazard\" they detect when individuals use \"too much\" health care. In this context we will strive to identify values that may either compete with or override concerns with efficiency, so construed. The second half of the class will consist of units investigating the nature, justifiability, and methods of health care rationing\u2014including bedside rationing by doctors\u2014and the myriad issues implicated by the near-universally shared goal of health care cost containment. If time allows, we will further examine one of the following two questions: (1) Are there ethically defensible alternatives to the current patent regime for pharmaceutical development that could reduce drug costs while offering adequate or even enhanced levels of innovation?; (2) What, if anything, does a just government owe immigrants (legal and illegal) when it comes to health care?||Not cross-listed | 3 credits; Humanities.

Should equality be construed more as a desirable feature of distributions (e.g. of income or health statuses) or as a virtue of social relations (as in a \"society of equals\")? Does the specific cause of an inequality affect its moral urgency? Might the goal of health equity ever conflict with the goal of making everyone healthier? The first week of this 3-week intercession course will survey several ethical approaches to understanding the nature, value, and importance of equality. The second week brings ethical analysis to bear on recent work in social epidemiology and health economics on the social determinants of population health. The third week will focus on international health inequalities and will ask whether and why citizens in rich countries have urgent duties to aid those who suffer ill health in developing countries.||Not cross-listed | 3 credits. 9:00am - 12:00pm M, T, W, TH, F Prerequisites: Graduate students and Professional track. | | Medical History and Bioethics 999: Instructor: Staff |To be arranged with instructor.||Not cross-listed 1-3 cr.; A (Advanced) Time to be arranged Prerequisites: Grad stdts who have the Masters or equiv, or Postdoc fellows who wish to undertake an independent research project.

Yet many tales of conflict between science and religion (including medicine and religion) continue to circulate. How is this possible? Is it that religion and/or science have forgotten their proper roles and have illegitimately invaded each other's territory? Or is the notion that science and religion inhabit separate worlds based on a misunderstanding of the nature of science and the nature of religion?

Students will explore prominent theoretical approaches to public health ethics and will engage with several ethical tensions. Special topics for the Spring 2011 semester include climate change and the social determinants of health. Other issues we will discuss include: the use of coercive or intrusive public health interventions that restrict individual freedom, infringe upon individual privacy, and/or invite individual harm (or risks of harm); the justification of paternalistic measures in societies or sub-populations that seemingly indulge in pleasurable yet unhealthy behaviors; the extent to which societies should hold individuals responsible for their health conditions; the need to decide who receives life-saving treatment or vaccination when not all can; the need to choose between the identifiable victims we can save with expensive measures here and now and the more numerous unidentifiable victims we could save in the future with the same monetary investment; the trade-offs between maximizing aggregate health benefits and addressing the special needs of vulnerable social sub-groups and individuals; and the need to establish reasonable limits to public health demands in a world where health outcomes are profoundly influenced by policies in other domains (such as transportation, housing, unemployment, and education) that generate their own ethical problems and imperatives.||Meets with Phil 305-001 | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), D (Intermediate or Advanced) TuTh 11:00AM - 12:15PM Prerequisites: Cons inst; enrollment may be limited depending on topic and approach | | Medical History and Bioethics 559-003: Instructor: Robert K. Streiffer |This is a course for upper-level undergraduates. Much of the environmental ethics literature focuses on the related questions of whether nature has intrinsic value and whether humans have direct moral obligations to non-human entities, including plants, animals, species, ecosystems, and the biosphere as a whole. Indeed, some have argued that for an ethic to truly be an environmental ethic just is for it to answer those questions in the affirmative. But a growing number of philosophers are arguing that an anthropocentric (human-centered) ethic can justify environmental protections substantially equivalent to those justified by non-anthropocentric theories. This course focuses on anthropocentric environmental ethics approaches that address the connections between human health, both individual and public, and the natural environment. We will study representative examples and defenses of these perspectives, consider the extent to which they overlap and converge on a practical agenda, and explore several related areas of applied ethics, including: environmental justice, global climate change, intergenerational justice, and population ethics.||Meets with Phil 543-001 | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), D (Intermediate or Advanced) TuTh 1:00PM - 2:15PM Prerequisites: Cons inst; enrollment may be limited depending on topic and approach | | Medical History and Bioethics 562: Instructor: John Scarborough |Byzantine and Islamic medicine and drug lore from Oribasius to the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance (c. 350-c. 1400 A.D.).||Crosslisted with S&A Pharmacy, History, History of Science, and Medieval | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), I (Intermediate) Time: TuTh 2:30PM - 3:45PM Prerequisites: Jr or Sr st or cons inst | | Medical History and Bioethics 610: Instructors: Regenerative Medicine Ethics and Society |This course is designed to introduce graduate students to ethical, policy and social issues related to regenerative medicine, specifically stem cell research.

From debates about end-of-life issues to Social Security from test-taking 'allowances' to Not-Dead-Yet, from Medicaid cutbacks to Terry Schiavo, disability is in the media, on our lips and in our ears. What is disability? How has disability changed over time and in different cultures? Where does such an idea come from? What social, cultural, and political assumptions is it based upon? Examining a wide range of historical arguments about the nature and purpose of disability, from pre-history to Plato, to medieval theologians, to more contemporary works, we will approach the history of disability in Western thought and social practice in terms of its relation to arguments about the role of human development and the formulation of personhood, citizenship, and social well being. The readings will include a thick mixture of primary sources in translation and secondary sources, both classic and newly published. We will encounter a variety of techniques and tools used by historians and other scholars as we course through the sessions. The emphasis of our discussions will be the characteristics of disability in a variety of centuries and cultures as well as lacunae in our understanding and debates in the literature.||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; A (Advanced) MW 2:30pm - 3:45pm Prerequisites: Junior Bioethics 668-002: Instructor: Dayle DeLancey |From imaging devices to pharmaceuticals, medical technologies are often among the most novel and controversial aspects of contemporary society. Yet, U.S. history reveals that neither the emergence of high profile medical technologies nor the dilemmas that often accompany their arrival are strictly 'modern day' phenomena. History also demonstrates that such technologies tend to reflect not only the medical science, but also the social concerns, of the periods in which they have emerged. In this course, we will explore the ways in which a range of technologies - e.g. stethoscopes, spirometers, sphygmomanometers, hospital design, x-rays, reproductive technologies, gene therapy, virtual medicine, etc. - have at once shaped medicine and invited critique. Using readings from a range of sources illuminating key medical technologies in the 18th to 21st century U.S., we will analyze these technologies in historical, social, and theoretical context. Questions guiding our work will include: What are the historical roots of significant medical technologies? How did these technologies shape medicine? Why have physicians and the pubic embraced some medical technologies and not others? What non-medical technologies have influenced the development of medical technologies? How has the historiography of medical technology shaped the histories of medicine and science as academic disciplines? Has medical technology ever been 'value free'?||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; A (Advanced) 11:00-12:15 TR Prerequisites: Junior standing | | Medical History and Bioethics 668-004: Instructor: Helen Tilley |This seminar explores the history of health and disease in Africa, focusing most extensively on the effects and legacies of European colonialism from 1880 to the present. The readings and class discussions will consider a variety of \"healing\" traditions and cognitive frameworks, both indigenous and introduced. Since no approach was monolithic or static, a central aim of the course will be to understand how developments like imperialism, market economies, migration, and epidemiological and demographic change have affected health conditions and responses in the continent. We will pay considerable attention in this course to \"hybrid\" situations during the colonial and post-colonial periods in which multiple approaches to health care were pursued simultaneously. This should help put more recent experiences with HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases (sleeping sickness, tuberculosis, malaria), and also with magic and medicine in a deeper historical context.||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; A (Advanced) 9:30-10:45 TR Prerequisites: Junior standing | | Medical History and Bioethics 668-005: Instructors: Richard Keller and Helen Tilley |The global expansion of infectious diseases and increasing health disparities between industrialized and developing countries have been among the major concerns in international health circles for at least two decades.

We will be looking at the ways in which skin color (and other elements of \"racial identity\") have influenced the experiences of patients, physicians and nurses, and medical researchers, seeking to document and analyze how conceptions of race have shaped the health concerns and health outcomes of Americans in the past two hundred years. Topics include the origins of racial classification, the health and medical care of slaves, the use of minorities as research subjects, especially the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, the history of racial disparities in medicine, and the efforts to integrate the American medical profession.||Crosslisted with History of Science and with Afro-American Studies | 3 cr.; S (Social Science), D (Intermediate or Advanced) 2:30-3:45 MW Prerequisites: Junior or Senior standing | | Medical History and Bioethics 532: Instructor: Judith A.

We begin with a pair of philosophical concepts \u2014 natural order and human dignity \u2014 that are widely invoked in contemporary debates over genetic manipulation of humans and other organisms. We ask why it is so often thought crucial that our beliefs and practices accord with \"nature\" (including \"human nature\") and also why some philosophers have rejected this perspective. We then examine both pre-World War II efforts to improve the human genome and contemporary practices of genetic testing, including prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, carrier testing, predictive testing for late-onset conditions, newborn screening, and the use of genetic tests to determine ancestry. We end by exploring the development of new forms of association and advocacy based on shared genetic risk.||Not cross-listed | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), D (Intermediate or Advanced) 9:30-10:45 TR Prerequisites: Cons inst; enrollment may be limited depending on topic and approach | | Medical History and Bioethics 559-002: Instructor: Paul Kelleher |This course focuses on ethical issues distinctive of a population-level approach to disease prevention and health promotion, especially as they bear on the activities of governmental health agencies. Students will explore prominent theoretical approaches to public health ethics and will engage with several ethical tensions, including: the trade-offs between maximizing aggregate health benefits and addressing the special needs of vulnerable social sub-groups and individuals; the use of coercive or intrusive public health interventions that restrict individual freedom, infringe upon individual privacy, and/or invite individual harm (or risks of harm); the justification of paternalistic measures in societies or sub-populations that seemingly indulge in pleasurable yet unhealthy behaviors; the extent to which societies should hold individuals responsible for their health conditions; the need to decide who receives life-saving treatment or vaccination when not all can; the need to choose between the identifiable victims we can save with expensive measures here and now and the more numerous unidentifiable victims we could save in the future with the same monetary investment; and the need to establish reasonable limits to public health demands in a world where health outcomes are profoundly influenced by policies in other domains (such as transportation, housing, unemployment, and education) that generate their own ethical problems and imperatives.||Meets with Phil 305-001 | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), D (Intermediate or Advanced) 9:30-10:45 TR Prerequisites: Cons inst; enrollment may be limited depending on topic and approach | | Medical History and Bioethics 559-003: Instructor: Paul Kelleher |This course will focus on the question: What do we owe each other healthwise? Ever since John Rawls ducked this question in his influential work, A Theory of Justice, many others have offered philosophical frameworks that address it head on. With a primary focus on the domestic context, we will investigate the bases on which various frameworks found political duties to address health needs. Special attention will be paid both to the ways in which the demandingness of candidate duties shapes the content and scope of bona fide social obligations, and to the special features of the domestic political context that might generate health-related responsibilities of citizenship. We will also ask how a just society will respond to the presence of disability in the populace; this will force us to address the fact that many forms of disability appear to be the result of an interplay between biomedical impairment and the wider built and social environment. When disabilities can be eliminated or alleviated through social accommodation and environmental change, how should the burdens of accommodation be distributed? Are there some disabilities that ought always to be addressed via social accommodation, even if more individualized measures (surgery or special wheelchairs, e.g.) are less expensive or less socially disruptive? Finally, we will take up the question of justice for persons with cognitive disabilities, which is still largely neglected by philosophers concerned with justice in health and health care.||Meets with Phil 305-002 | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), D (Intermediate or Advanced) 4:00-5:15 TR Prerequisites: Cons inst; enrollment may be limited depending on topic and approach | | Medical History and Bioethics 565: Instructor: Robert Streiffer |Study of ethical issues arising from the application of modern biotechnology to microorganisms, crops, and non-human animals.

From debates about end-of-life issues to Social Security from test-taking 'allowances' to Not-Dead-Yet, from Medicaid cutbacks to Terry Schiavo, disability is in the media, on our lips and in our ears. What is disability? How has disability changed over time and in different cultures? Where does such an idea come from? What social, cultural, and political assumptions is it based upon? Examining a wide range of historical arguments about the nature and purpose of disability, from pre-history to Plato, to medieval theologians, to more contemporary works, we will approach the history of disability in Western thought and social practice in terms of its relation to arguments about the role of human development and the formulation of personhood, citizenship, and social well being. The readings will include a thick mixture of primary sources in translation and secondary sources, both classic and newly published. We will encounter a variety of techniques and tools used by historians and other scholars as we course through the sessions. The emphasis of our discussions will be the characteristics of disability in a variety of centuries and cultures as well as lacunae in our understanding and debates in the literature.||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; A (Advanced) MW 2:30pm - 3:45pm Prerequisites: Junior Bioethics 668-002: Instructor: Dayle DeLancey |From imaging devices to pharmaceuticals, medical technologies are often among the most novel and controversial aspects of contemporary society. Yet, U.S. history reveals that neither the emergence of high-profile medical technologies nor the dilemmas that often accompany their arrival are strictly 'modern-day' phenomena. History also demonstrates that such technologies tend to reflect not only the medical science, but also the social concerns, of the periods in which they have emerged. In this course, we will explore the ways in which a range of technologies - e.g. stethoscopes, spirometers, sphygmomanometers, hospital design, x-rays, reproductive technologies, gene therapy, virtual medicine, etc. - have at once shaped medicine and invited critique. Using readings from a range of sources illuminating key medical technologies in the 18th- to 21st-century U.S., we will analyze these technologies in historical, social, and theoretical context. Questions guiding our work will include: What are the historical roots of significant medical technologies? How did these technologies shape medicine? Why have physicians and the pubic embraced some medical technologies and not others? What non-medical technologies have influenced the development of medical technologies? How has the historiography of medical technology shaped the histories of medicine and science as academic disciplines? Has medical technology ever been \"value free\"?||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; A (Advanced) 1:00-2:15 TR Prerequisites: Junior standing | | Medical History and Bioethics 669: Instructor: Staff |To be arranged 1-3 cr.; C (counts for L&S), A (Advanced) Time to be arranged Prerequisites: Jr st and cons instr | | Medical History and Bioethics 699: Instructor: be arranged 1-3 cr.; C (counts for L&S), A (Advanced) Time to be arranged Prerequisites: Jr st and cons instr | | Medical History and Bioethics 728: Instructor: Linda Hogle |The aims of this course are to provide understandings of the broader social, cultural and political contexts in which bioethical debates and medical practice occur, to explore social science perspectives on medicine and bioethics and to examine the use of qualitative and interdisciplinary methods to conduct research in these areas.

More recently, the emergence of stem cells, health care, hunger, and human rights, as major political issues, reflects the ongoing centrality of biological life for politics. This course will examine this convergence through a rigorous consideration of the theory of biopolitics and its cross-disciplinary application. We will focus on work in philosophy and literature, but also anthropology, sociology, and history. Topics may include: Biological Citizenship; Biopoetics; Hunger, Food, and Obesity; Biomedicine and subjectivity; etc. Authors: Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, Hannah Arendt, Roberto Esposito, Barbara Johnson, Judith Butler, Lauren Berlant, Philippe Bourgois, Achille Mbembe, Nikolas Rose, Paul Rabinow, among others.

This course on the history and historiography of eugenics explores the following questions: Why did the concept of selective human breeding take hold in the late19th century? How crucial to this development was Francis Galton's effort to demonstrate the hereditary character of mental and moral traits, the new popularity of animal breeding, and publication of Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory? How did Galton's work relate to earlier popular doctrines, such as phrenology and physiognomy, which stressed the importance of heredity and its implications for reproduction? Why did eugenics become increasingly popular after the turn of the twentieth century? What role did geneticists, religious leaders, and other groups play in its success? How was eugenics inflected by race and gender? What concrete forms did it take in various countries? How was eugenics linked to public health, and to the feminist, conservation and other social movements? Who opposed it, and for what reasons? How did both advances in genetics and revelations of Nazi atrocities affect its reputation? What lessons have scholars and popular writers drawn from its history, and why are they so fiercely contested? Throughout the seminar, we will be attentive to trends in the scholarly interpretation of eugenics and to current debates over how best to make sense of its fraught history.||Not cross-listed | 3 cr.; Graduate, advanced M 4:00-6:30 Prerequisites: Consent of inst | Medical History 999-001: Instructor: Robert Streiffer |Introduction to Research Ethics: For doctoral students in the life sci disciplines not already served by the existing courses in human biomedical research ethics.

Fall 2009 | | Medical History and Bioethics 218: Instructor: Susan E. Lederer |In March, 2009 President Barack Obama called for an ambitious reform of the American health care system. This time, he insisted, \"the call for reform is coming from the bottom up, from all across the spectrum from doctors, nurses and patients: unions and businesses; hospitals, healthcare providers and community groups. This time there is no debate about whether all Americans should have quality, affordable healthcare, the only question is, how?\" This course addresses the question of how the United States developed its current health care system. In doing so, the course will focus on the changes in medical care and medical science over the course of the twentieth century, as well as the changing face of the medical profession and the institutions which deliver health care. Topics include advances in medical technology and therapy, the debate over national health insurance, the cultural authority of the medical profession, and media representations of doctors, nurses, patients and hospitals.||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; S (Social Science), C (L&S), E (Elementary); 11:00 - 12:15 TR Open to Freshmen. | | Medical History and Bioethics 504: Instructor: Ronald Numbers |Health care in America since the colonial period; emphasis on social developments.

There are three principal themes. The first focuses on the evolving concepts of illness, beginning with the ideas of the Hippocratics, who lived during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. We will study how their ideas were taken up and transformed by later scholars, with particular emphasis being paid to medicine in medieval Islam and the reception of medical knowledge in western Europe after 500 A.D. through its transformation in the newfangled universities. We will also pay close attention to the teaching and practice of anatomy in those universities. The second theme studies the medical practitioners of this era, focusing primarily on physicians but also paying significant attention to surgeons, apothecaries, female healers and the various other health-providers who together comprised the practice of healing in the ancient and medieval worlds. Within that theme, the notion of the medieval medical marketplace will be an important one. The third theme centers on the evolution of health as a social and political problem. It includes the emergence of hospitals in Constantinople and Baghdad, two large medieval cities where caring for the sick poor became a matter of pressing concern and the evolution of public health through the period of the Black Death in the later fourteenth century and beyond. | Each week there will be one 75-minute lecture on Monday to introduce the weeks subject, followed by a 75- minute seminar/lecture on Wednesday to flesh out the readings in depth. Depending on the complexity of the material, readings for the seminar meeting will be about 100 pages per week. Readings depend primarily on a packet of readings, but we will also have recourse to two textbooks: Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine by Nancy Siraisi, and Carole Rawcliffe's Sources for the History of Medicine in Late Medieval England. Written work will consist of 2 to 3 take-home essay assignments, each of 5-15 pages in length. |Crosslisted with History of Science and with History | 3 cr., H (Humanities), I (Intermediate) 2:30-3:45 MW Prerequisites: Junior standing. | | Medical History and Bioethics 509: Instructor: Judith Leavitt |This course surveys the history of public health in the United States from the colonial period to the late twentieth century, emphasizing many issues in the development of public responsibility for health that are relevant at the beginning of the 21st century. The course is run as a seminar/discussion, and the student requirements include regular and constructive class participation. | The course materials include many \"primary\" documents, writings from the period under discussion, so that students can come to appreciate and understand (but not necessarily to agree with) various historical points of view, with the ultimate goal of toleration of ambiguity and contradiction. The past was just as complex and interesting as the present, and in this course we aim to become familiar with some of the complexity of human experiences and work with the historical record on its own terms, even as we also seek to understand what we can learn from the past to help us to understand and explain the present. We sit today at the beginning of the twenty-first century, reading history to enrich ourselves culturally; at the same time we can use our knowledge to make our world in this new century a little bit better. The seminar-discussion approach grows directly out of an appreciation of the benefits of active learning, in which the professor is a facilitator of learning rather than a dispenser of information and students actively pursue their education rather than passively receive knowledge. The general goals of a university education focus on critical thinking, being willing to explore ideas contrary to one's own beliefs, knowing when information or data are relevant to an issue and how to seek and find that information and apply it methodologically to the problem at hand. Class time will be a time to present new material, but even more, it will be used to provide experiences in learning what to do with new material and to clear up problems so that students can take responsibility for learning and solving problems rather than waiting for them to be solved by the instructor. Cooperative and group learning and exercises will be encouraged, with the assumption that everyone brings something valuable and unique to the class. Active discussion, expressing one's ideas and getting reactions from other students and the teacher, has been demonstrated to make a big difference in learning, retention, and use of knowledge. Verbalizing an idea can be one way of getting checks and extensions of it. Thus students will be required to talk about their ideas openly, listen and respond to others' ideas, remain sensitive to the feelings of other class members, and take responsibility for moving class discussions forward. |Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; B (Biological Science), C (L&S), I (Intermediate) 1:00-2:15 TR Prerequisites: Jr st & cons inst.

Can frigidity in women best be cured by a pill, an analyst's couch, or sweeping social change? Are sexual psychopaths sick or criminal? What determines a person's sex? Are there therapeutic uses for sex toys?. | Over the course of the twentieth century medicine and biomedical science have become increasingly influential in the social and cultural lives of Americans. This course looks at the changing place of medicine in our public and private lives. We will be guided by five particular questions: How has medicine (and scientific authority) helped to define and control appropriate sexual behavior? How has medicine become involved in the definition and creation of sex? What do medical interventions reveal about social and cultural ideas of sex and sexuality? How do campaigns against sexual disease illuminate cultural judgments about social groups? How do boundaries defining appropriate sexual behavior also define appropriate sex/gender roles? |Crosslisted with History of Science and with Women's Studies | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), C (L&S), I (Intermediate) 11:00 - 12:15 TR Prerequisites: Prev history (incl med hist & hist sci) History and Bioethics 526: Instructor: Linda Hogle |There is a long history of bodily modification throughout time and across many kinds of societies. Modifications can be for functional restoration, augmentation, enhancement, or aesthetic purposes. This course will explore the ways that bodily modifications and the development of body-altering technologies co-evolve with social and technical understandings of appearance, function and perception. | Industrialized societies are experiencing dramatic variations in individuals' body size and appearance, due to changes in nutritional and consumption patterns, changing cultural views of the body, and the emergence of technologies that change the physical appearance and functioning of both healthy and disabled bodies. At the same time, innovations in biomedicine and bioengineering are leading to novel forms of designed bodies. But just what is a \"properly functioning\" body in light of emerging biology-altering technologies and what is its relation to body image and perception? Alternate body forms, including those that dramatically change appearance, or may incorporate synthetic parts could make a body \"more normal\" or could potentially create improved features. Yet there are social and ethical implications for such transformations. What do we consider to be \"deficient\" or \"normal\" and why? Also, some kinds of modifications of appearance or function may be understood by some as \"pathological\" or \"unnatural,\" while others are viewed positively, as \"\"therapeutic\" or \"empowering.\" How do we make sense? The course will create an opportunity for students to explore the relations of biological, cultural, and technological aspects of bodily modifications. Students will learn about issues of identity and subjectivity as related to physical appearance and functioning, the ethical use of body modification technologies, and public health and policy frameworks and implications. The course will appeal to all social science students, as well as students seeking careers in the medical professions, psychology, ethics, and health policy. |Not crosslisted | 3 cr.; C (L&S), I (Intermediate) 1:00 - 2:15 TR Prerequisites: So st or cons inst.

Among its key themes are the following questions: When did the link between health and human rights first emerge? How has it developed historically? What factors define citizenship? To what extent does physical and mental health constitute a gauge of enfranchisement and of one's access to power in the modern state? In what ways does the de facto absence of citizenship - in cases like those of migrant laborers, ethnic minorities, and colonial subjects - delimit the possibility of a human right to health? How have structural health inequities historically posed significant threats to global security? Such questions have been central to studies of the political economy of health and disease, anthropology, and area studies, but have been less apparent in historical research. This seminar, limited to 15 students, offers a key means for integrating these questions into an interdisciplinary approach to global health. The course will focus primarily on the development of the relationship between health and citizenship in modern Europe beginning with the French Revolution and through the rise of the welfare state before exploring the implications of ideas about health and human rights in a global context.||Not cross-listed | 3 cr.; C (L&S), A (Advanced) 1:00 - 3:30 T Prerequisites: Prerequisites: Junior standing. | | Medical History and Bioethics 699: Instructor: Staff |To be arranged 1-3 cr.; C (counts for L&S), A (Advanced) Time to be arranged Prerequisites: Jr st and cons instr | | Medical History and Bioethics 709: Instructor: Judith Leavitt |See MHB 509.

Latino/as are now the 'majority minority' population in the United States, yet the cultural dynamism, variation and beliefs of Latino/as are largely unknown to health practitioners and researchers, or are assumed to parallel those of the dominant culture of the U.S. Latina/os are over-represented in a host of chronic diseases, and have disproportionate exposure to environmental sources of ill health. Latino/as were at the forefront of the environmental health movement and pioneered the use of community-based health workers, yet they remain under-represented in the health professions.

From debates about end-of-life issues to Social Security from test-taking 'allowances' to Not-Dead-Yet, from Medicaid cutbacks to Terry Schiavo, disability is in the media, on our lips and in our ears. What is disability? How has disability changed over time and in different cultures? Where does such an idea come from? What social, cultural, and political assumptions is it based upon? Examining a wide range of historical arguments about the nature and purpose of disability, from pre-history to Plato, to medieval theologians, to more contemporary works, we will approach the history of disability in Western thought and social practice in terms of its relation to arguments about the role of human development and the formulation of personhood, citizenship, and social well being. The readings will include a thick mixture of primary sources in translation and secondary sources, both classic and newly published. We will encounter a variety of techniques and tools used by historians and other scholars as we course through the sessions. The emphasis of our discussions will be the characteristics of disability in a variety of centuries and cultures as well as lacunae in our understanding and debates in the literature.||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; A (Advanced) MW 2:30pm - 3:45pm Prerequisites: Junior standing | Medical History and Bioethics 668-002: Instructor: Staff |This course explores the historical context of various United States Supreme Court cases important to the development of American public health and medicine in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The course will provide an intensive introduction to the relationships between biology, culture, and society in an era of globalization that the pandemic reveals and shapes. A central focus for the course is the inextricability of connections between the epidemiological, political, economic, and historical dimensions of HIV/AIDS.

There are three principal themes. The first focuses on the evolving concepts of illness, beginning with the ideas of the Hippocratics, who lived during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. We will study how their ideas were taken up and transformed by later scholars, with particular emphasis being paid to medicine in medieval Islam and the reception of medical knowledge in western Europe after 500 A.D. through its transformation in the newfangled universities. We will also pay close attention to the teaching and practice of anatomy in those universities. The second theme studies the medical practitioners of this era, focusing primarily on physicians but also paying significant attention to surgeons, apothecaries, female healers and the various other health-providers who together comprised the practice of healing in the ancient and medieval worlds. Within that theme, the notion of the medieval medical marketplace will be an important one. The third theme centers on the evolution of health as a social and political problem. It includes the emergence of hospitals in Constantinople and Baghdad, two large medieval cities where caring for the sick poor became a matter of pressing concern and the evolution of public health through the period of the Black Death in the later fourteenth century and beyond. | Each week there will be one 75-minute lecture on Monday to introduce the weeks subject, followed by a 75- minute seminar/lecture on Wednesday to flesh out the readings in depth. Depending on the complexity of the material, readings for the seminar meeting will be about 100 pages per week. Readings depend primarily on a packet of readings, but we will also have recourse to two textbooks: Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine by Nancy Siraisi, and Carole Rawcliffe's Sources for the History of Medicine in Late Medieval England. Written work will consist of 3 take-home essay assignments, each of 5-6 pages in length. |Crosslisted with History of Science and with History | 3 cr., H (Humanities), I (Intermediate) 2:30-3:45 MW Prerequisites: Junior standing. | | Medical History and Bioethics 509: Instructor: Judith Leavitt |This course surveys the history of public health in the United States from the colonial period to the late twentieth century, emphasizing many issues in the development of public responsibility for health that are relevant at the beginning of the 21st century. The course is run as a seminar/discussion, and the student requirements include regular and constructive class participation. | The course materials include many \"primary\" documents, writings from the period under discussion, so that students can come to appreciate and understand (but not necessarily to agree with) various historical points of view, with the ultimate goal of toleration of ambiguity and contradiction. The past was just as complex and interesting as the present, and in this course we aim to become familiar with some of the complexity of human experiences and work with the historical record on its own terms, even as we also seek to understand what we can learn from the past to help us to understand and explain the present. We sit today at the beginning of the twenty-first century, reading history to enrich ourselves culturally; at the same time we can use our knowledge to make our world in this new century a little bit better. The seminar-discussion approach grows directly out of an appreciation of the benefits of active learning, in which the professor is a facilitator of learning rather than a dispenser of information and students actively pursue their education rather than passively receive knowledge. The general goals of a university education focus on critical thinking, being willing to explore ideas contrary to one's own beliefs, knowing when information or data are relevant to an issue and how to seek and find that information and apply it methodologically to the problem at hand. Class time will be a time to present new material, but even more, it will be used to provide experiences in learning what to do with new material and to clear up problems so that students can take responsibility for learning and solving problems rather than waiting for them to be solved by the instructor. Cooperative and group learning and exercises will be encouraged, with the assumption that everyone brings something valuable and unique to the class. Active discussion, expressing one's ideas and getting reactions from other students and the teacher, has been demonstrated to make a big difference in learning, retention, and use of knowledge. Verbalizing an idea can be one way of getting checks and extensions of it. Thus students will be required to talk about their ideas openly, listen and respond to others' ideas, remain sensitive to the feelings of other class members, and take responsibility for moving class discussions forward. |Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; B (Biological Science), I (Intermediate) 1:00-2:15 TR Prerequisites: Junior standing and consent of instructor.

Fall 2007 | | Medical History and Bioethics 350: Instructor: Gregg Mitman |How has film shaped past and present interactions between humans and the environment across different cultures and landscapes? The success of An Inconvenient Truth and March of the Penguins and the impact, in all of its myriad meanings, of Blue Vinyl and The Real Dirt on Farmer John are recent reminders of the extent to which film can inform and engage the public in critical environmental issues that affect human and animal lives across the globe. And, yet, the very different conventions of these films also remind us, as the French film critic, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, once noted: \"The bounds of the science film are as undefined as those of the documentary. But, after all, who cares!\" | We take Bazin's dilettantish attitude toward scientific cinema in exploring the history and theory of an amalgam of films that, for better or worse, might be labeled environmental cinema. As this seminar reveals, however, what we call environmental cinema is itself shaped by the changing cultural and social meanings of nature and the environment over time. From travelogue-exploration films of the 1920s, to the experimental avant-garde of surrealist scientific filmmakers such as Jean Painlev\u00e9, from the worlds of Walt Disney to those of Jacques Cousteau, from the social documentaries of John Grierson and Pare Lorentz to more contemporary cinema documenting the struggles of peoples confronting issues of environmental injustice across the globe, this seminar will call students to rethink the ways in which cinema has shaped how we see, think about, consume, and politicize nature in both past and present societies. Students will be required to attend film screenings to be held throughout the semester, which will take place on Thursday or Friday evenings. In addition to select film reviews, the main assignment will be for students to choose a recent or historical environmental film and write a 15-20 page essay analyzing its myriad impacts\u2014economic, cultural, political, and social. How does one measure a film's impact? Did the film alter public attitudes toward nature or the environment in significant ways? The seminar will lay the theoretical and empirical groundwork for students to be able to address these questions in their final assignment. |Meets with Env Studies 402, Lec. 5 and Comm Arts 469 | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), D (Intermediate or Advanced); 9:00-11:30 F Prerequisites: Sophomore Honors or Junior standing. | | Medical History and Bioethics 394: Instructor: Ronald Numbers |From the colonial period to the present; emphasis on the development of scientific institutions and the influence of science on American life.||Crosslisted with History and with History of Science | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), D (Intermediate or Advanced) 11:00-12:15 TR Prerequisites: Junior standing or consent of instructor. | | Medical History and Bioethics 504: Instructor: Eric Boyle |Health care in America since the colonial period; emphasis on social developments.||Crosslisted with History and History of Science | 3 cr.; B (Biological Science), I (Intermediate) 4:00-5:15 MW Prerequisites: Junior standing or consent of instructor. | | Medical History and Bioethics 507: Instructor: Walton Schalick |This course presents an in-depth survey of medicine and public health from its roots in Antiquity through approximately 1500.

By dividing the living world into biology (flesh, blood, genes, hormones, germs) and culture (environment, politics, tradition, commerce, history), we have come to regard bodies as objects immune to historical forces. This course challenges this understanding of bodies. By focusing primarily on American bodies in the 19th and 20th centuries, this course demonstrates that human bodies have social and cultural histories. The lived experience and cultural meanings of human bodies are dependent on their social settings. Biology is surely not irrelevant to bodily experience. But the interpretation and valuation of biology, indeed what is considered biological, change over time. Within a larger three-unit framework, this course will highlight the social values placed on different bodies and the changing social expectations bodies create. This course will pay particular attention to the following questions: How have cultural and social changes in American history influenced the meaning and experience of bodies? How have attempts to establish social status and difference focused on bodies? How has the social and economic value of bodies differed according to race, class, sex, and \"fitness?\" How has a focus on bodies individualized social problems?||Crosslisted with Women's Studies and History of Science | 3 cr.; H (Humanities), A (Advanced) 9:30-10:15 MW Prerequisites: Women St or hist (incl med hist & History and Bioethics 545: Instructor: Norman C.

The Internet, television, and print journalism ensure that we are never unaware of the health crises that besiege our globalizing society, to the extent that we see these problems as a symptom of globalization itself. Yet such concern is far from new. Historians and epidemiologists have long recognized that the \"microbial unification of the world\" dates at least to the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Throughout the nineteenth century, cholera devastated South Asia, Europe, and the United States; a century ago, bubonic plague and flu each killed millions globally. In this course, we will draw on a wide range of historical and anthropological materials and methods to examine the history of public health and medicine as international phenomena. Focusing on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, we will explore topics such as the connections between global pandemics of infectious disease and European colonial expansion; strategies for curtailing the spread of disease across borders; historical and contemporary anxieties about the health consequences of global migration; and the emergence of a global medical marketplace. Particular themes include the connection between health and wealth; the relationship between culture and medical ideas and practices; and the tensions of practicing medicine in multicultural settings.

Modifications can be for functional restoration, augmentation, enhancement, or aesthetic purposes. This course will explore the ways that bodily modifications and the development of body-altering technologies co-evolve with social and technical understandings of appearance, function and perception. Industrialized societies are experiencing dramatic variations in individuals' body size and appearance, due to changes in nutritional and consumption patterns, changing cultural views of the body, and the emergence of technologies that change the physical appearance and functioning of both healthy and disabled bodies. At the same time, innovations in biomedicine and bioengineering are leading to novel forms of designed bodies. But just what is a \"properly functioning\" body in light of emerging biology-altering technologies and what is its relation to body image and perception? Alternate body forms, including those that dramatically change appearance, or may incorporate synthetic parts could make a body \"more normal\" or could potentially create improved features. Yet there are social and ethical implications for such transformations. What do we consider to be \"deficient\" or \"normal\" and why? Also, some kinds of modifications of appearance or function may be understood by some as \"pathological\" or \"unnatural,\" while others are viewed positively, as \"therapeutic\" or \"empowering.\" How do we make sense The course will create an opportunity for students to explore the relations of biological, cultural, and technological aspects of bodily modifications. Students will learn about issues of identity and subjectivity as related to physical appearance and functioning, the ethical use of body modification technologies, and public health and policy frameworks and implications. The course will appeal to all social science students, as well as students seeking careers in the medical professions, psychology, ethics, and health policy. Open to upper level undergraduates; graduate students welcome. 1. Introduction: What's \"normal?\" What's an \"able\" body? 2.

Prerequisite: Consent of instructor. | | Medical History and Bioethics 919: Instructor: Richard Keller |This graduate seminar focuses on the historical and contemporary dimensions of disaster and catastrophe in the modern world. It explores the coupling of human and natural systems through a concentration on intersections between natural and human-made hazards and disasters. The course examines such \"natural\" disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, and heat waves, but also industrial catastrophes such as the Bhopal and Chernobyl explosions. The focus is principally on acute rather than chronic disasters and degradation. The seminar provides an introduction to an expanding humanities and social science literature on disaster. Students are required to participate actively in discussions and to produce an original research paper on a related topic.||Crosslisted with History of Science | 3 cr.; Graduate, advanced 1:15-3:15 W Prerequisites: Graduate standing and consent of instructor. | | Medical History and Bioethics 999: Instructor: Staff |To be arranged with instructor.||Not cross-listed 1-3 cr.; A (Advanced) Time to be arranged Prerequisites: Grad stdts who have the Masters or equiv, or Postdoc fellows who wish to undertake an independent research project.
