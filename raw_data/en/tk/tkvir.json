A promi- nent psychologist, Daryl Bem of Cornell University, had posted a paper on his website in which he sensationally claims new experimental evi- dence of precognition, in this case implying that events preceded their causes. The paper has been accepted by a respected psychology journal. Is this the re- search that will finally give parapsychology what it has long lacked\u2014laboratory evidence of paranormal abilities sufficient to impress mainstream science? Fortunately, we at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and the S KEPTICAL INQUIRERhave in our ranks numerous international experts on the claims of parapsychology. We called on one of them, psychologist (and CSI executivecouncil member) James Alcock of York University in Toronto, to examine Bem'spaper and provide SI readers and the public a considered critique. Alcock's critical examination, \"Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair,\" appears in this issue. It is a devastating critique. Before gettingto the Bem paper itself, Alcock provides readers with a valuable reminder thatwe have been through all this before. He briefly catalogs an eighty-year historyof next-big-thing claims in parapsychology, including J.B. Rhine's card-guess- ing experiments of the 1930s, remote-viewing experiments of the 1970s, ganzfeld experiments of the 1970s and '80s, and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research unit computer-based psychokinetic experiments of the1980s and '90s. All provoked tremendous excitement in the world of parapsy-chology and considerable skepticism in the scientific world. Today, none of these previous claims of experimental evidence for extrasen- sory perception have stood up. They have mostly fallen away, and some are sel-dom even mentioned anymore. It is a sobering\u2014and very telling\u2014history. Never theless, an open mind requires the examination of new claims on their own merits. Alcock does just that for each of Bem's nine experiments. Hequickly finds disturbing problems, beginning with confusing and troubling changes in procedure during the experiments and inappropriate statistical analysis. Early on, Alcock expresses his frustration: \"This is one of the mostbaffling descriptions of research methods and procedures that I have ever en-countered.\" And at another point: \"Just about everything that could be done wrong in an experiment occurred here.\" It gets worse from there. I'll let you read the piece for yourself, and you'll see what he means. In the end, this appears not to be the experimental evidence parapsychologists have long sought. Alcock finds that the publication of this \"badly flawed\" paper will serve no one well\u2014not parapsychology, not the psychology journal, and not the public. I owe readers an explanation about one point. Alcock's article is longer than most we publish in SI. But we felt that Bem's claims, considering the public in- terest shown in them from the moment they became known, merited a serious examination\u2014and that requires some space. We felt both the historical context and point-by-point examination Alcock provides are worth presenting fully for our intellectually curious and intelligent readers ... not to mention the media and public, who look to us for authoritative perspective and judgment. \u2014 KENDRICK FRAZIER[ FROM THE EDITOR Skep ti cal In quir er THE MAG A ZINE FOR SCI ENCE AND RE A SON ED I TOR Kend rick Fra zi er ED I TO RI AL BOARD James E.

Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 5The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry an- nounces the election of twelve outstanding scientists, scholars, writers, and investigators as Fellows. Election as a fellow recognizes \"distinguished contributions to science and skepticism.\" All of the newly elected fellows have made major contributions to science and reason, critical inquiry, and public education. They hail from the United States, the United King- dom, Australia, Canada, and India. The new fellows include science writers Sandra Blakeslee and Simon Singh; psychol- ogists Anthony Boslough; alternative medicine Ernst; and investigator/writers Benjamin Radford and Karen Stollznow. Several other prominent leaders of the skeptical movement have also been elected: Sanal Edama ruku, president of the Indian Rationalist Associa- tion and Rationalist Inter national; Wendy M. Gross man, founder of the United Kingdom'sThe Skeptic magazine; Barry Karr, executive director of the Committee for Skeptical In- quiry; and Richard Saunders, vice president ofthe Australian Skeptics. The Committee, established in 1976 and still popularly known as CSICOP , publishes the S KEPTICAL INqUIRER , the magazine for science and reason. The Committee \"pro-motes scientific in quiry, critical investigation,and the use of reason in examining controver- sial and extraordinary claims.\" Fellows serve as formidable intellectual re sources for the Com mittee and for the S KEPTICAL INqUIRER . \"We are pleased that so many distin- guished scholars, re searchers, academics, and people fighting for science and reason in the trenches as part of their daily lives and profes- sions have joined with CSI,\" said CSI Execu- tive Director Barry Karr. \"We look forward toa busy and rewarding future and incorporating these new fellows into our activities.\" Potential new fellows are nominated by existing fellows or by members of the Com- mittee's governing executive council, and they are then elected by the executive council. Combined with the sixteen new fellows announced last year (SI, March/April 2010), the new class brings the number of present Committee for Skep tical Inquiry fellows to106. They come from Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mex- ico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Isaac Asimov, Martin Gardner, Philip J. Klass, Carl Sagan, B.F. Skin ner, and Nobel Laureates Francis Crick and Glenn T . Seaborg were all fellows of CSICOP . Current fellows include such luminaries as evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, philosopher Daniel C. Den nett, physicistLawrence M. Krauss, philosopher (and CSI- COP founder) Paul cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, magician/investigator JamesRandi, physical anthropologist Eugenie C. Scott, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, biologist E.O. Wilson, and Nobel Laureate scientists Murray Gell-Mann, Sir Harry Kroto, Leon Leder man, and Steven Wein - berg. A full list of fellows appears on the inside cover of this and every issue of the S KEPTICAL INqUIRER and is also on our website at www.csicop.org/about/csi_fellows_and_staff. Here are biographical sketches of the 2011 class of Committee for Skeptical Inquiry fellows: Sandra Blakeslee Science writer; author; New York Times science correspondent Blakeslee has spent nearly all of her career writingabout science for the New York Times, both as a staff writer and on contract. For about the past fifteen yearsshe has been specializing in the brain sci-ences. Her latest book is Sleights of Mind:What the Neuroscience of Magic Says AboutOur Everyday Deceptions (2010), with neu- roscientists Stephen L. Macknik and Su- sana Martinez-Conde. The book uses neu-roscience to explain how magicians deceiveus, why we are so vulnerable to sleights ofmind, and how deception is part of whatmakes us human. Her previous books in-clude The Body Has a Mind of Its Own(with her son Matthew Blakeslee, a fourth-generation science writer), On Intelligence(with Jeff Hawkins), and Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the HumanMind (with V.S. Ramachan dran). Blakeslee lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Mark Boslough Physicist, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico Boslough is regularly seen in science documentaries and news reports both explaining his re- search on planetary impacts and participat- ing in expeditions to remote impact sites around the world. Exotic scenery and com- puter animations of catastrophic cosmic events make for good television, but Boslough has become an advocate for ob- jective assessment of all risks to humanity, including those that are self-inflicted. He passionately defends climate science from political attacks and enjoys debunking theextraordinary claims of global-warmingdeniers. He advocates the use of humor as a weapon against pseudoscience.Boslough's most widely read piece is a thinly disguised spoof of creationists in the form of a satirical April Fools' Day news story, in which he wrote about a supposed vote of the Alabama legislature to change pi to its \"biblical value\" of exactly 3. It was widely mistaken as real. Boslough has a PhD in applied physics from Caltech. Sanal Edamaruku President, Indian Rationalist Association and Rationalist International Sanal Edamaruku is a prominent writer, colum- nist, and television personality who is con- sidered the most outspoken and dynamicadvocate of rationalism in India. He is pres-ident of the Indian Rationalist Associationand the founding president of RationalistInter national. Explaining the science behind all kinds of \"miracles\" and exposing godmen, astrologers, faith healers, bigoted politicians, and fraudulent \"modern\" therapists on air, Edamaruku has broken the spells of count-less paranormal and pseudoscientific claims and shaken deep-rooted beliefs in astrology,reincarnation, and tantric powers. Some ofhis interventions have led to the arrest of holy charlatans or helped control outbreaks of mass hysteria. For example, in 1996 he debunked the legendary \"monkey-man\" who had terrified New Delhi. In what is perhaps his most spectacular action so far, Eda - maruku challenged one of India's leading tantriks to prove his claimed black-magicpowers by killing Edamaruku with mantrasand rituals on live television.

Ernst haswritten more than forty books including, with British science journalist SimonSingh, the much-embattled 2009 bookTrick or Treat ment? Alternative Medicine on Trial, which forthrightly defends evidence-based medicine and assesses popular practices like homeopathy,acupuncture, and chiropractic. Ernst reports frequently about alternative medicine in the S kEPTICAl InqUIRER . Wendy M. Grossman Writer; founder and first editor, The Skeptic magazine (U.K.) Grossman founded the United kingdom's The Skeptic magazine in 1987 and has served twice as its editor(1987-1989 and 1999-2001). She also writes its column \"A Skeptic at large.\"Along with current The Skeptic editor-in- chief Chris French, she co-edited the 2010 book Why Statues Weep: The Best of The Skeptic. A freelance writer specializing in science and technology, Grossman is a frequent contributor to the Guardian 's technology section and has written for Scientific American ,New Scien tist ,Wired , Wired News , and the Philosopher's Magazine . She has authored several books, including 2001's From Anarchy to Power: The Net Comes of Age . Her 1998 book net.wars was one of the first to have its full text published on the web. She sits on the executive committee of the Association of British Science Writers as well as the advisory councils of the Open RightsGroup and Privacy International. Gross man also has what she calls \"a disreputable past as a fulltime folksinger.\" Barry Karr Executive director, Com mittee for SkepticalInquiry, Amherst, New York karr, the longtime executive director of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, is currently a member of the management committee of the Center for Inquiry and has served as the Center's executive director. A S kEPTICAl InqUIRER consult- ing editor, karr has also contributed to or edited several books, including The UFO Invasion ,Science vs. Religion , Skeptical Odysseys ,The Outer Edge , and Bizarre Cases . He has served the Commit- tee for Skeptical Inquiry (formerly CSICOP) for nearly thirty years with dedication and distinction. In addition tospeaking and writing on skeptical issues, karr works tirelessly behind the scenes. He deals with management and organizational matters, helps raise funds,tracks budget and finances, plans conferences and other events, edits the Committee's website (www.csicop.org),oversees media interactions, and keeps the organization moving forward. An infamous 1998 medical-journal re- port by Andrew Wakefield, the doctor whose research sparked international concern over whether or not childhood vaccines cause autism, \"was based not on bad science but on a deliberatefraud,\" according to Dr. Fiona Godlee, editor in chief of BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal . The statement appeared in a January 5, 2010, editorial on BMJ's website. Author of the now-retracted article in The Lancet , Wakefield had previously been found guilty of acting unethically in his research on autism by a British panel. Dr. Godlee said BMJ and inves- tigator that\"Wakefield altered numerous factsabout the patients' medical histories in order to support his claim to have iden- tified a new syndrome.... But perhapsas important as the scare's effect on in- fectious disease is the energy, emotion, and money that have been diverted away from efforts to understand the real causes of autism and how to helpchildren and families who live with it.\" In \"Secrets of the MMR Scare,\" the second part of a BMJ series of special re- ports on the scandal, Deer showed how Wakefield exploited the vaccine scare forhis personal financial gain. Wakefield planned to make a fortune developing his own supposedly safer vaccines anddiagnostic testing kits once the public's confidence in the safety of current vac-cines was shaken. According to Deer,Wakefield expected to earn over forty million dollars each year from selling his diagnostic kits. nAnti-Vaccine Doctor's 'Deliberate Fraud' Benjamin Radford Toning Shoes Step into Court Reebok and New Balance are among the companies consumers say make false claims for a better butt.

CSI Helps Crack Los Angeles UFO Mystery Benjamin Radford Members of the Committee for Skep- tical Inquiry were among the first to re-veal the solution to a UFO mystery thatmade international news in November.A UFO, which appeared off the south-ern California coast on November 8,2010, was captured in dramatic footageby a KCBS television news helicopter cameraman during sunset. The contrail- creating UFO was thought by many to be a missile, though military officials denied that any missiles had been launched in the area at the time. With no immediate explanation for the strange object in the sky, the Inter net soon buzzed with conspiracy theories about who might have launched the se- cret missile (foreign governments? a film studio promoting a UFO film? \"black ops\"?) and for what purpose. Some noted that the streak looked similar to ordinary jet contrails, but doubters countered bysaying that contrails were different in some details and are almost always seenas horizontal streaks high in the sky\u2014 not more or less perpendicular to thehorizon. I was asked by LiveScience.com to review the evidence and offer my analy-sis of the UFO, which I did in a column posted just before 11 pMthe day after the report. To the best of my knowledge, this was the first correct solution to the mystery posted on a major news or sci- ence website. SKepTICAL INqUIrer columnist rob - ert Sheaffer, on his recently launched Bad UFOs blog, suspected that the \"missile\" was in fact an airplane. This supposition was based in part on an analysis on the website Contrail Science: The Science and pseudoscience of Contrails and Chem trails (www.contrailscience.com):\"The object seems to have been simplyan aircraft contrail, with tricks of per- spective making it look like a missile fly- ing away from you, when in fact it wasan aircraft flying toward you.

It took a few days for the government to investigate the UFO and issue a re- port. When it did, Pentagon spokesmanColonel David Lapan agreed with me, Sheaffer, and other skeptics: \"With all the information that we have gathered over the last day and a half about thiscondensation trail off the coast of south-ern California on Mon day night, both within the Depart ment of Defense andother U.S. government agencies, we haveno evidence to suggest that this was any-thing other than a contrail caused by anaircraft.\" Instead of clearing up the mystery for UFO believers, this explanation waswidely dismissed and seen as a clumsy cover-up. Not only was the official jet- contrail explanation late in coming (while rumors and conspiracy specula-tion flourished), but the aircraft that sup- posedly made the contrail was not iden- tified. Furthermore, several high-profileex perts appeared on television suggestingthat the UFO was in fact a missile; for example, Retired Air Force Lieutenant General Thomas McIner ney was seen on Fox News stating unequivocally, \"That is a missile launched from a sub-marine.... I am absolutely certain that is not an aircraft.\" The jet-contrail theory had already been examined (and dismissed) by many people, and it was clear that corroborat-ing evidence would be needed to show that other aspects of the case pointed to the same conclusion. To address the ru- mors, I wrote a second column on the Los Angeles UFO, this time for Discov -ery News. I examined the contrails the- ory afresh and did further research into the circumstances surrounding the sight- A vertical jet contrail photographed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in early December 2010; the appear-ance of a contrail varies greatly according to temper-ature, light conditions, and weather patterns.

I also did some experiments to see if I could photograph ordinary jet con- trails that might be mistaken for missiles (see photo on p. 8). Was the jet-contrail explanation real or just a cover-up? Let's look at the ev- idence and compare the contrail expla- nation with the missile theory. 1)According to the Federal Aviation Ad ministration, radar in the area did not reveal any fast-moving un known targets. A missile would have been picked up on radar, while a jet would not have been flagged as unusual. 2) No trace of the alleged missile was seen falling into the water off thecoast of Los Angeles, nor was a mis- sile (or any part of it) recovered; it seems to have simply vanished into the sky. If the contrail was created bya plane, of course no falling missilewould be seen or found. 3) The object seen in the video moves like a jet, not a rocket. As Michio Kaku, physics professor at City Uni- versity of New York, noted on Good Morning America , \"The trail seems to change direction. Ballistic missiles don't do that. It doesn't accelerate.Ballistic missiles accelerate up to 18,000 miles per hour, [but] this is traveling at a constant velocity.\" Although missiles accelerate greatly during launch, aircraft typi-cally maintain a constant cruisingspeed after they have reached thedesired altitude\u2014exactly as the videotape shows. 4) There is no record of any missiles being fired at the location and time of the sighting, while there are records of commercial jets in the area at that time. 5) Perhaps most damaging to the mis- sile theory, the only people who saw the mysterious phenomenon had similar vantage points: a televisionnews crew videotaping the sunset from a helicopter and a few people in nearby Long Beach (such as photog- rapher Rick Warren from his tenth-floor apartment). None of the other nearly four million people living in Los Angeles noticed the \"missile,\"and pilots flying in the area did notreport seeing anything unusual\u2014cer- tainly not a missile being launched. This is very strong evidence that the phenomenon was unusual from onlyone unique perspective; that is, people looking at the same thing from dif- ferent distances and angles either rec- ognized what it was or didn't think itwas strange. The explanation given by the con- spiracy theorists who insist that the missile was some sort of secret U.S.government test collapses under the weight of its own illogic. Why wouldthe government launch a \"secret\" mis-sile only thirty-five miles from Los An- geles, where it would be obvious to any-one looking skyward? Furthermore, there would be no reason for officials to hide or cover up a launch; missiles andsatellites are routinely launched from the California coast. All the Penta gon would have to do is issue a statement telling the public that it was a routine, planned launch, and the issue would go away. As Robert Sheaffer noted in a fol- low-up post to his original blog post, the airplane that created the UFO was finally identified through careful analy- sis on the Contrail Science website: \"Al-most certainly it was UPS flight 902 from Hawaii to the Ontario Airport in California, the flight path using Goo -gle Earth matches up perfectly with thephotos.\" Despite these skeptical analy- ses, many people remain convinced that the videotape shows some sort of secret missile or UFO. n Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 9[ NEWS ANDCOMMENT The analysis that identified UPS flight 902 as the jet that made the mystery con- trail is available at http://contrailscience.com/los-angeles-missile-contrail-explained-in- pictures.

Celebrating Cosmos 's Thirtieth Anniversary and Carl Sagan Day Lauren Becker Thirty years ago this past fall, millions of Americans sat down in their living rooms and watched a revolution in tel-evision programming: the first episodeof Carl Sagan's masterpiece, Cosmos. Written by Sagan, Ann Druyan, and Steven Soter, the thirteen-part series won an Emmy and a Peabody Award and was the most-watched PublicBroadcasting Service (PBS) series inthe United States for twenty years. Since then, it has gone on to reach al- most a billion viewers in over sixtycountries, and it's still the most widelywatched PBS series in the world. We've been fascinated by the cos- mos ever since. This past fall, science organizations, skeptics' groups, human- ist groups, Center for Inquiry branches,campus groups, science classes, astron- omy clubs, and countless others all over the world celebrated the thirtieth an-niversary of Cosmos .

The Cosmos fun continued into No- vember with the celebration of the sec-ond annual Carl Sagan Day. In 2009,CFI/Fort Lauderdale, Florida Atheistsand Secular Humanists (FLASH), andother groups created the first CarlSagan Day to mark Sagan's birthday, No-vember 9, and the idea quickly spread. In2010, groups from Alaska to NewZealand held star parties, astronomy lec-tures, science fairs, and more to saythanks to Sagan and to bring his workto the next generation of \"starstuff.\" As they did the first time around, CFI/Fort Lauderdaleheld the biggest event.

Epidemi ology,the branch of medicine concerning cau-sation, seeks to establish cor relation be-tween exposure to a possible cause of disease and actual occurrence of a dis-ease. Data must be taken over a period ofyears to allow for latency; if no disease isseen, a longer latency period is assumed to be necessary. When there is no record of individual exposure to a potentialcause of disease, people are asked to recall what they did years earlier. Exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) in modern society is ubiquitous,but it was not thought to be a problemuntil 1989, when the New Yorker began running a series of hopelessly misin- formed articles by Paul Brodeur linking EMF to cancer. The articles were turned into a series of books with lurid titles such as Currents of Death . Brodeur had no background in science, but he managed to arouse the anti-science monster that had been in hiding since World War II. The media, trained to give both sides of the story even if one side has no science or evidence behind it, was of no help.The EMF hysteria did not end un - til 1997 when the National Acad emy of Sciences, persuaded that the publicwould not accept an argument based onquantum mechanics, released a study that found no effect of EMF on the human body.

He gained great reputein his field, serving as editor-in-chief ofthe British Journal of Pho tography for over twenty years. How ever, he is bestremembered today as the man who de-finitively revealed what has calledthe world's longest-running photo-graphic Cottingley fairies began in 1917, when ten-year-oldFrances Griffiths and her sixteen-year- old cousin Elsie Wright snapped twophotos that appeared to show the girlscavorting with fairies in the English countryside at Cottingley. The photoscaused great excitement within the local Theosophical Society, a Spiritualist-ori- ented group with doctrines that in cludedthe existence of fairies. The photos soon came to the attention of Sir ArthurConan Doyle, the famous creator ofSherlock Holmes, who was a dedicated Spiritualist. Doyle wrote a series of arti-cles, and later a book, proclaiming the fairy photos as genuine. Many presumedthat the photos had to be hoaxes, but it was never shown how they were made, and the girls continued to insist that the photos were authentic. There the matter stood for over fifty years. Starting in the 1970s, Crawleyundertook \"a scientific and analyticalapproach\" to the photos. He published a ten-part series of articles in the British Journal of Photography from 1982-1983, concluding that the fairy photos could not have been produced with the cam- era the girls used without darkroom trickery. As a result of Crawley's arti-cles, and also of investigations byBritish journalist Joe Cooper, thecousins\u2014now elderly ladies\u2014con- fessed to the hoax in the early 1980s. Elsie simply copied drawings of fairiesfrom a book onto cardboard, which the girls then cut out and held in place withhatpins. Crawley showed that retouch- ing of the photos must have takenplace. Cooper found an earlier, un-re-touched version of \"Frances and theFairies\" that was much less impressive than the extensively retouched version later published, thus proving that Crawley's analysis was indeed correct. n Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 13[ NEWS ANDCOMMENT We've lost another light against the darkness.

Public figures seem to have perfected the use of the sound bite to appear thoughtful while irrationally dismissing scientific evi- dence on such subjects as evolution, global warming, or loss of biodiversity. Even debates on social-policy issues,such as health care, regularly avoid the most obvious, irrefutable truths: for ex- ample, the increasing cost of health care in the United States is driven in large part by the aging of our population (re- flecting the success of medical science), and the elderly have more health care needs\u2014and therefore more health care costs\u2014than the young. The routine is familiar. Evolution isdismissed by referencing the Bible. Glo - bal warming is dismissed by claiming that more evidence is needed. Strate gies for avoiding evidence are highly effec-tive for sound bites because they cir- cumvent any need to describe what ev- idence would be considered acceptableand cogent. This journey into surrealism is particularly upsetting because it leadsto bad policies that are ill equipped to cope with the very real challenges facing our society.

The in-tolerance that has in fected our political debate particularly affects those within Islamic and East Asian demographics.I imagine that for some of these atten- dees, the rally was about much morethan light humor. The use of humor to deliver political messages conveys much about howhuman brains work. Authors such asAntonio Damasio, George Lakoff, and Sam Harris have written excellent books that cover this subject. Increas - ing evidence indicates that the beliefs we espouse are developed through a complex interplay of knowledge, emo- tion, and logic. Many of our conscious beliefs originate in preconscious, emo- tional areas of the brain. The emotional brain, also called the limbic system , plays a surprising and critical role in allowing people to derive conclusions from knowledge that is often incomplete. The limbic system plays a primary role in helping us to rapidly evaluate poten-tially dangerous situations\u2014by inter- facing incomplete data to create a com- plete analysis \u2014in al most every conclu- sion derived throughout our thought processes. The ideas generated by the emotional brain are filtered through our logic cen- ters to create the seemingly rational statements that we use in virtually every aspect of our lives. More knowledge,more security, or more training in logic elicits greater reason, while ignorance, fear, and appeal to \"belief\" elicits less rea- son. Our belief systems also filter accept-ance of information. The emotional brain rejects facts that challenge our belief sys- tems. One can immediately see howemotional appeals\u2014such as those incit-ing fear, eliciting anger, or appealing to religious beliefs\u2014could be used to lead us toward irrational political outcomesby activating the emotional brain to by- pass more reasoned responses. The importance of emotion in our actions, even seemingly rational ones, creates a challenge for \"rational\" politi- cal debate. Information that questionsa belief system is difficult to incorporate because the \"emotional\" brain rejectssuch material. Knowledge, though, can filter in and affect our beliefs. Framing arguments in the context of childhoodor family is a particularly effectivemeans of conveying information, be-cause family and children are emotion-ally vulnerable topics. Humor is another effective mecha- nism used to convey knowledge that might challenge our belief systems. Knowledge or logic gained through humor elicits positive emotions, which make us feel less threatened and more accepting. The power of Jon Stewart's and Steven Colbert's messages lies in their skillful use of humor to question the many irrational beliefs and behaviors thatpervade our society today. Thus, althoughthe \"Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear\"was humorous, for many at the rallyhumor was the medium, but reason was the message. n Photos courtesy of Jacqueline WolozinSI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 1516 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerThe Wegman report was prepared by a team led by statistician Edward Weg- man of George Mason Uni versity at the request of U.S. Representatives Joe Bar- ton (Republican from Texas) and Ed Whitfield (Republican from Tennessee), both strong opponents of the scientificconsensus about climate change. The Wegman report, presented in 2006 at a hearing of a congressional sub- committee chaired by Whitfield, re - peated numerous well-cataloged andlong-debunked anti-science assertions, especially those claiming a conspiracyamong climate scientists. Although rarelymentioned in peer-reviewed science pub- lications, the report nevertheless imme- diately became a major source for climateanti-science articles, blogs, op-eds, andbooks. The report is also a key to VirginiaAttorney General Ken Cuccinelli's attack on the Uni versity of Virginia and Michael Mann (Russell 2010). That cer- tainly resembles a famous witch hunt(Monty Python 1975). Discovery of Plagiarism Canadian blogger \"Deep Climate\" un - covered plagiarism in the Wegman re - port in late 2009, accumulating ten pagesof near-verbatim material copied from paleoclimatologist and hockey-stick coauthor Bradley and others, such as: A cross section of most temperate forest trees will show an alternation of lighter and darker bands, each of which is usually continuous around the tree circumference. (Bradley 1999, 398) A cross section of a temperate forest tree shows variation of lighter and darker bands that are usually contin- uous around the circumference of the tree.

(Wegman et al. 2006, 15) Deep Climate (2010a) posted the en- tire ten pages using colored highlight- ing that quickly shows the obvious cut- and-paste/edit process. Based on Deep Climate's work, Brad ley filed a plagiarism complaint in March 2010 but kept it quiet. Bradley's expert work was not only plagiarized[ SPECIAL REPORT Strange Problems in the Wegman Report A computer scientist discusses the roles of plagiarism, conspiracies, anti-science memes, and intense beliefs in a global-warming denying report. JOHN R. MASHEY The high-profile \"Wegman report\" (Wegman et al. 2006) strongly criticized the steeply rising \"hockey stick\" temperature graph that was created by climate scientists Michael Mann, Raymond Bradley, and Malcolm Hughes and later used in the United Nations Intergovern- mental Panel on Climate Change's Third Assessment (IPCC 2001). John R. Mashey is a com- puter scientist whose ca- reer has extended from Bell Labs to the Silicon Val- ley. Many of the wide vari- ety of scientists he has worked with have used software or hardware he helped create. For the past few years he has been studying climate science, anti-science, and energy issues.

I thenextended Deep Climate's research andadded much more in a comprehensive250-page analysis of the Wegman re-port, \"Strange Scholarship in the Weg- man called the plagiarisms \"obvious\"and \"shocking.\" Some defenders createdtheir own fanciful definitions of the word to deny that plagiarism had takenplace. Others contended that even if itwas plagiarism, the Wegman report's conclusions were still true. Then someclaimed that Bradley himself was a pla- giarizer, blackmailer, or liar. The debatere mained intense. Pseudoscience, Anti-Science, and Intense Beliefs In pseudoscience, people promote long- debunked ideas as scientific (Mashey2009). Anti-science obscures real sciencevia the public-relations and propagandatechniques that were well honed in thetobacco wars and are sometimes em- ployed by the same people elsewhere (Oreskes and Conway 2010). SI readers are familiar with chaotic, amateur, or amusing pseudoscience ef- forts. Anti-science, in contrast, is well funded, professionally organized, and not amusing: tobacco-industry anti-sci- ence has damaged the health of mil-lions. Although the Wegman reportcontained some pseudoscience, it was really part of a well-organized twenty- year anti-science campaign (Mashey 2010a). That campaign offered much evidence of a real conspiracy, in contrast to the climate-science opponents' un- supported claims alleging a conspiracy by climate researchers. Not all conspir-acies are imaginary\u2014SI readers should assess the evidence before dismissing conspiracy hypotheses. Pseudoscience beliefs can be strong.Climate anti-science beliefs are intense enough to generate frequent deaththreats against climate scientists. Myanalysis documents the Wegman reportas filled with serious errors, biases, bad science, and frequent repetition of long- debunked anti-science memes. Its min-imal statistics use another's (incorrect)computer code (Deep Climate 2010b). The Wegman report was promoted by Congressmen Barton and Whitfieldas \"independent, impartial, expert\" workby a team of \"eminent statisticians.\" It was none of those things. Deep Climatehad unearthed plagiarism (not \"expert\")and distortion (not \"impartial\"), then found that a Barton staffer provided much of the source material to the Weg-man team (not \"independent\"). In my initial investigation I found another twenty-five pages with plagiarism, to- taling thirty-five when combined with Deep Climate's findings (Mashey2010b). Originally intended to be ashort report, my analysis grew to its current 250 pages as interconnected problems in the Weg man report multi-plied. My analysis eventually examinedall ninety-one Weg man report pagesplus related testimony, publications, andactions. \"Climategate\" started big andshrank, despite strong public-relationsefforts. The problems with the Weg manreport started small with a few pages ofplagiarism, but those problems have grown ever since. Y et Barton still standsbehind the Wegman report. Half of the report's eighty references were uncited in the text itself, a tactic called \"bibliography padding\" that is frequently used by undergraduates to create an illusion of expertise. Many references use \"grey literature\" (notpeer-reviewed), including the key source ence memes. \"MM05x\" quotes an arti- cle that appeared not in Science but in the Journal of Scientific Explora tion ,a favorite publication of pro-fringe-sci-ence researchers. It is filled with schol-arly looking papers on extrasensory perception (ESP), UFOs, reincarnation, inexplicable weight gain in suffocated sheep, dog astrology, and other fasci-nating topics. Most of its articles areavailable online (Society for Scien tific Exploration 2010). Occa sionally properskeptical debunking papers do slip into print there. The Wegman report also referenced a 1987 article, \"Magnetics May Hold Key to Ozone Layer Problems\" by Tom Valentine. Its inclusion is ut terly bizarre,especially in a report criticizing the qual- ity of review elsewhere .A 1987 ozone article was at best irrelevant bibliographypadding. The publication in which Valentine's article appeared, MAGNETS Half of the report's eighty references were uncited in the text itself, a tactic called \"bibliography padding\" that is frequently used by undergraduates to create an illusion of expertise.SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 1718 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerin Your Future , was an obscure fringe-sci- ence magazine.

His bio stated that he was the \"Miracle editor.\" Later his talk show often promoted \"black helicopter\" con-spiracies. Never the less, some people re-main unshakeably certain of the Wegmanreport's credibility. A short article cannot convey the pervasiveness and strangeness of prob-lems with the Wegman report. Skepticsshould read my long report to assess theclaims made here.

His website is at www.joenickell.com. She claims to receive communica- tions not only from her guardian angel, \"Daniel,\" but also from Jesus and even Yahweh himself, whoguide her hand to produce written mes-sages. She has provoked both skepticismand credulity from Catholic laity andclergy, and her texts\u2014an amalgam of Bible verses and Orthodox and Catholic teachings\u2014have helped her attract an increasing following. Some claim to have witnessed supernatural experiences at her talks, al though I did not when I witnessed her first appearance in West-ern New York in 2004. I have sincesought to learn just who Vassula Rydenis and more about the phenomenon be-hind that name (Ryden 1995; \"Vassula\"2010; Tokasz 2004). Vassula Born to Greek Orthodox parents in Heliopolis, Egypt, on January 18, 1942, Vassula Ryden emigrated to Europe when she was fifteen. She says as a teenager she saw herself surrounded by souls of the dead, although she claims to have been indifferent to religion for a time. Following marriage, the birth of two sons, divorce, and remarriage, she claims to have begun receiving mes- sages from her own invisible \"guardian angel,\" Daniel. \"I almost freaked out,\" she said (Ryden 2004). That occurred in late 1985 while she was living in Bangladesh. Five years later, she \"regu-larized\" her marriage in the rites of the Greek Orthodox Church, to which she still belongs (\"Vassula\" 2010). Never - theless, Ryden says that God revealed to her the Sacred Heart (a Catholicsymbol of Christ's love for the human family) to show her the equality of allfaiths (Ryden 2004). In the mid-1990s, the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of theFaith issued two notices of concern about Ryden. The first came in 1995,pointing out \"several negative elements and errors.\" It requested that bishops refuse to give her the opportunity to spread her questionable ideas within their dioceses and asked them not to treat her writings or speeches as \"super-natural.\" The following year, another notification encouraged priests to \"ex- ercise serious spiritual discernment\" re-garding Ryden's messages, declaringthat be considered merely \"private meditations\" and not divinerevelations. However, some of herCatholic supporters observe that the church does not completely discount her teachings, and the publications of her organization, the American Asso- ciation for True Life in God, have ob- vious Catholic trappings (\"Vassula\" 2010; Tokasz 2004). The Catholic Church is skittish aboutsuch freelancers\u2014urging caution toward supposedly supernatural phe-nomena (such as stigmata or weepingeffigies) and any reputed visions or messages. The Church is all too aware of delusional persons and pious frauds. However, such matters are usually left to the local bishop, and investigations are typically less about science than about how a claim comports with Catholic teachings. I determined to take an objective look at three aspects of Ryden's pur- ported messages (within my own areas of expertise): first, the distinctive hand- writing (I am author of textbooks on writing and forgery, including Pen, Ink, and Evidence [Nickell 1990]); second, the text (I have a PhD in English, ex- perience in examining unusual texts, and membership in the International Association of Forensic Linguists) [Nickell 2008]; and third, whether Ryden might have a fantasy-prone per-sonality (I have studied this trait foryears, especially under the direction ofthe late psychologist Robert A. Baker [Nickell 1997]). Handwriting Ryden insists that the messages she re- ceives and writes down are not the re- sult of spiritualistic phenomena such as channeling or automatic writing (\"Vas- sula\" 2010). However, neither phenom- enon is defined as being limited to spir- its of the dead; either may in volveinteraction with any type of alleged nonphysical beings, such as angels,Heaven's Stenographer: The 'Guided' Hand of Vassula RydenSI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 19deities, the like (Guiley 25-26, 70-71). So, Ryden is by definition a channeler and an automatic writer. Reportedly, the messages began in late November 1985 when Ryden was about to make a shopping list. Her hand suddenly began to move, seemingly without her control, to form words and drawings, initiating a phenomenon that continues to the present day. The self- styled visionary reportedly receives about four to six hours of guided-hand\"dictation\" each day (Carroll 1995, ix;\"Vassula\" 2010). From a scientific per-spective, (assuming it is not deliberatelycontrived) such a phenomenon is attrib-uted to the ideomotor effect, in which a participant unconsciously produces a movement. The same psychological phe-nomenon is responsible for the motion of dowsing rods and pendulums, Ouija-board planchette movement, table tip-ping, and the like (Randi 1995, 169-70). Ryden's messages supposedly \"come through dictation by an audible voicewithin, then are written in a stately hand- writing\u2014distinct from her own\u2014as she allows her hand to be guided supernatu- rally\" (\"About\" 1995). In ter est ingly enough, the same \"distinct\" script that is used for messages from the angel \"Daniel\" is employed by \"Jesus,\" \"Mary,\" and \"Yahweh\" (see figure 1), rather than each entity having his or her own indi-vidual handwriting. Keeping in mind that Ryden is an artist (\"About\" 1995), it seems notewor- thy that the \"guided\" handwriting has the characteristics of a script that is ar- tistically drawn rather than naturally and freely written. It is a \"mannered\" or af- fected hand, rendered in style\u2014rather like the so-called \"vertical taught in American and Canadianschools from 1890 to 1900 but was deemed too time consuming to produce practically and subsequently abandoned(Nickell 1990, 124, 126; Osborn 1978, 140). Most mainstream scripts, in tended for right-handed persons to render withsome speed, slope in the forward direction, as does Ryden's ordinary handwriting. In - terest ingly, an alteration in slant is one of the most common ploys used for disguis- ing handwriting (Hilton 1982, 169; Os- born 1978, 147, 149, 211). Use of this sim- ple change can thus instantly impart a new look to an entire page. The \"stately\" hand also differs from Ryden's in size (being larger than hers), another common disguise ploy (Nickell 1996, 49). Apart from the \"stately\" affectation, the supposedly supernatural handwrit- ing is essentially a formal, copybook version of Ryden's own naturally jotted script that alternates with the \"stately\"hand in her notebooks. The \"stately\" hand avoids some of her script's idio- syncrasies, yet it still has mostly printed capitals just like her own handwriting. On occasion, one of the copybook forms sneaks back into her natural script (replacing, for instance, her indi- vidualistic f, which has a backwardly made loop, with the standard copybook f) (see Ryden 1995, 171, 223). Consistent with its neat, drawn ap- pearance is the fact that the \"guided\"Figure 1. Handwriting produced by artist Vassula Ryden\u2014supposedly \"supernaturally guided\"\u2014is drawn rather than freely written. (The same mannered script is used for messages from \"Yahweh,\" \"Jesus,\" \"Mary,\" and her guardian angel, \"Daniel.\") It contrasts with her own handwriting. 20 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirer SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 20Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 21handwriting is done on lined paper, with the lines showing in some of the reproduced pages (Ryden 1995, e.g.,232-33). This is consistent with the use of eye-hand coordination. One suspects that if Ryden were prevented from see- ing what was being written, the entities supposedly guiding her hand would beunable to so faithfully follow the lines!I invite Ryden to accept my invitationto perform a scientific test to refute orconfirm this suspicion. Text On January 25, 1987, Ryden wrote: Courage daughter, I, Jesus Christ have instructed you that the cross you bear is My Cross of Peace and Love, but to bear My precious Cross, daughter, you will have to do much self-sacrifice; be strong and bear my Cross with love; with Me you will share it and you will share My sufferings; I was pleased to hear your prayer of surrender; in sur- rendering to Me I will lift you to the heights and show you how I work; I will mould you, if you let Me, into a better person; you have given Me your consent to become My bride, so what [sic] more natural for a bride to follow her Spouse? I am glad you realize your worthlessness, do not fear, I love you anyway. . . . (Ryden 1995, 233-34) Is this really a message from Jesus guiding Ryden's hand? Not only is the handwriting the identical, mannered script that is also used for her \"Daniel,\" \"Yahweh,\" and \"Mary,\" but the perpet-ual use of semicolons is another simi- larity from alleged speaker to alleged speaker. All\u2014except, appropriately, Daniel\u2014call her \"daughter\" (Ryden 1995, 153, 188, 225), and they refer to themselves with the same construction: \"I, 1995, 155, 231, 293). Ryden's purported messages can be compared with other alleged commu- nications from Jesus. One set of writ- ings was Jesus\" by Lilian stigmatic. (Stigmata are the supposedly supernat- urally received wounds resembling those of Christ. However, Bernas's wounds\u2014which I have seen up close\u2014appear to be consistent with self-inflic- tion [Nickell 2007, 59-66].) one posedly said (Bernas 1999, 23): My Suffering Soul\u2014 This is your Beloved. I have come as promised to embrace you with thespirit of peace. Take this time, and have respite from the wicked assaults of the evil one. My child, you have bent, but you have not broken. This pleases your Beloved. . . . My child\u2014humble yourself now, and ascend the hill of your Beloved with your Beloved. . . . Nancy Fowler, a homemaker in Conyers, Georgia, claimed for several years to be receiving messages from both Jesus and, more often, the Virgin Mary.(The latter appeared punctually on the thirteenth of each month, and I was able to attend a session [Nickell 1993, 196- 97]). One message from \"Jesus\" in-structed the faithful (Fowler 1993): Come through My Mother on your journey back to Me. From this very cross I give the world My perfect love. I give the world, I give everyone in the world, My dear, Holy Mother. Please, if you accept My Love, then how can you reject, ignore, not honor,not love My Mother. I come through My Mother and I want you, dearchildren, to come through My Mother on your journey back to Me. I choose the word \"Come\" inten- tionally, not past tense. I still come through My Mother. Graces are poured forth through My Mother,the Graces come from Me. I am especially familiar with these two groups of writings, although they are supposedly received by clairaudi- ence (trance hearing) rather than by au- tomatic writing. (Therefore, errors of grammar and the like could be attrib- uted to mistaken transcription by the percipient.) Now, whereas Ryden's \"Jesus\" frequently identifies himself as\"I, Jesus,\" Lilian Bernas's Jesus personanever does, nor does the one channeled by Nancy Fowler. There are many other differences among the three sets oftexts; for example, the dominant theme of each: Fowler's is the near-deificationof the Virgin Mary (an emphasis some- times disparagingly referred to as \"Mar- iolatry\"), Bernas's is the importance of suffering, and Ryden's is the need for divine love and guidance. Style also differs from channeler toOne suspects that if Ryden were prevented from seeing what was being written, the entities supposedly guiding her hand would be unable to so faithfully follow the lines! I invite Ryden to accept my invitation to perform a scientific test to refute or confirm this suspicion.SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 21channeler. Ryden's and \"Jesus\" (as as \"Daniel\") speak similarly, oftenusing convoluted diction (for example,\"do not leave yourself be drifted away\" [144], instead of \"do not let yourself drift will them in this call many events\" [150], wherein \"of \" is missing \"the that makes\" [44]); faulty auxiliary verbs (such as \"I have re- stored you since the time you have ac- cepted Me\" [158], the misspellings: for example, \"God\" \"work with Me writting [ sic] down My messages\" (231), and he also uses the misspellings \"joyfull\" (138) and \"analising\" (101, 105). If God deigns to use the English language, should we not expect it to be rendered accurately? Before we become invested in imag- ining what a deity might or might not do, we should note that Ryden's own written text has similar faults\u2014for ex- ample, using \"sprung\" when \"sprang\"would be correct, the misspelling \"pan- ick,\" faulty subject/verb agreement (e.g., \"Joy and Peace is\"), and many others. At times the respective errors are eerily sim- ilar, as when \"God\" uses \"do\" for \"make\" (e.g., \"do not get discouraged when you do errors\") just as Ryden does (e.g., \"I do so many mistakes\") (see Ryden 1995, 22,89, 93, 235). Fantasy-Proneness From the evidence, it looks like Ryden's channeled automatic writings are mere ly emanations from a single source: herimagination. Indeed, she exhibits many traits of what is known as a \"fantasy- prone\" personality: sane and normal but with a propensity to fantasize, as de -scribed in a pioneering study by Sheryl C. Wilson and Theo dore X. Barber (1983). Since childhood, Ryden has had various \"mystical\" experiences. She has en countered apparitions (such as thesouls of \"dead people\"), had vivid or \"waking\" dreams (with paranormal im- agery), experienced religious visions, in- teracted with invisible companions, re- ceived messages from higher entities,and had other experiences common tomany fantasizers (Carroll 1995; Ryden 1995, xx-xxl). Taken together, the contrived hand - writing, the linguistic lapses, and the in -dications of fantasizing all suggest that Vassula Ryden is not in touch with super natural entities but is simply en - gaging in self-deception that in turn de - ceives the credulous. Her automatic writ- ings therefore are not works of revelation but simply of pious imagination. n References About Vassula Ryden. 1995. Publisher's book- cover text, Ryden 1995. Bernas, Lilian. 1999.

His website is at www.massimopolidoro.com. Fourteen years ago, I was aston- ished to read a brief article in the January 1997 (vol. 61, no. 846) Journal of the Society for Psychical Re-search(JSPR) written by parapsycholo- gist Alexander Imich, a retired chemistand president of the Anomalous Phe- nomena Research Center in New York. His article, titled \"Joe A. Nuzum, A Little-Known Psychic,\" describes Nu -zum as being \"of the D.D. Home 1class.\" The article consisted of a long list of mir-acles that Nuzum appeared to have per- formed over the years. However, my as-tonishment was due not to theimpressiveness of the list but rather to thefollowing facts: 1) the conditions underwhich these presumed miracles tookplace were not described in the article; 2) all of the \"phenomena\" described be- longed to the classic conjurers' and fakirs' repertoire; 3) it appeared that no magi- cian was ever present at any of Nuzum's demonstrations; and 4) there was no ref- erence to the fact that Nuzum himself was a magician. Banachek and Project Alpha Today Nuzum, though still claiming on his website to have \"mastered many mind-over-matter studies,\" runs a magic shop in Pennsylvania. I contacted mentalist and friend Banachek who, under his real name of Steve Shaw, wasone of the celebrated alumni of Project Alpha (in which young magiciansfooled scientists into thinking they had extrasensory perception [ESP]). Steve confirmed to me that he was a friend of Nuzum at the time of Project Alpha. They lived in the same town, had been friends for at least five years, and used to exchange tricks and ideas on magic. However, it appears that Nuzum\u2014who had specialized in escapology at the time\u2014was impressed by the press cov- erage that Steve had been able to gather while pretending to be a psychic, and he wanted to achieve the same result. Nuzum started to perform mentalism tricks, most of which were pretty stan- dard purchased items, and with these he convinced psychiatrist Berthold Sch - wartz that he was the real thing. Schwartz had already been \"amazed\" by Steve during Project Alpha, and hecontinued to believe that Steve really had psychic powers even after the hoax was revealed. When Steve tried to ex- plain to him via letters that Nuzum was a colleague and was just performing con- juring tricks, Schwartz refused to listen. Steve told me: There is a big difference between what Joe Nuzum is doing and what I did. My fiasco was an experiment. For years parapsychologists had lamented that the only reason there was no sci- entifically documented evidence un - der proper scientific controls was be- cause of the lack of proper funding to perform such controls. We had coun- tered and believed that this was not the case and the lack of such docu-Magic or Miracle?

MacDonald Douglass gave a half a million dollars to study ...Psycho kinetic Metal Bending, PKMB, to Washington University. Here was our chance to prove our point. I went in not to take advantage, not to gain anything, not to take money, trips and vacations (unlike Joe), but simply to prove a valid point. I went in knowing full well that I was going to expose the fraud I was perpetrating. It became very hard at times. These were good peo- ple, with good hearts, who became my friends. It was very hard knowing I was going to have to hurt these people who had become a personal part of my life. Had I known they would mean so much to me, maybe I would have done things a little dif- ferent, I certainly would have kept my distance emotionally. On the other hand, I should have read the signs in Joe Nuzum. I should have known that he certainly wouldnot have cared about hurting other people or lying to them; in retrospect I should have known that Joe would have had no problem using people for his own benefit. Project Alpha was designed to show how competent magicians can com- plete the same tasks as self-proclaimed psychics. It appears, however, that some experts still don't believe the phenom- ena aren't genuine. A \"Challenge\" Met Because my comments (along with those of James Randi) were published in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, Imich decided to give us areply (JSPR61[848], July 1997). How - ever, his words regarding our doubts, I regret to say, were quite disappointing. As usually happens in such cases, our real question was avoided. As Randi and I had pointed out in our letters, the fact that the effects pre- sented by Nuzum looked as if they were taken directly from a magic catalog should have raised flags. We did not in- sist, as Imich implied, that Nuzum's ef-fects were necessarilydone by trickery. But they at least mayhave been done in such a way. What is the real question, then? Given the highly suspect natureof Nuzum's demonstrations, it was for Imich of the utmost importance to as- certain that they were not the result of trickery. The only way to do this was to ask a competent magician to participate in the tests. Randi, Steve, or I would have loved to attend such demonstra- tions, but the suggestion was ignored. Surprisingly, however, Imich wrote: The crusaders against the paranor- mal usually do not tackle difficult cases. They prefer to deal with events easier to criticize. Mr. Randi, too, does not mention the \" Gray's Anatomycase,\" an event out of the range of magical technique and much more difficult to discredit. I have challenged Mr. Poli- doro to repeat this event, but I am not sure if he himself is a magician. Aside from the fact that this was the first time I had heard of such a \"chal- lenge\" (and the fact that Imich did not appear to have any qualification to judge whether an event is \"out of the range of magical technique\" or not),what most surprised me about this ac-cusation was that in my letter I sug- gested a possible explanation for justone of the effects described by Imich, the \"Gray's Anatomy case\"! I wrote, in fact: Mr Imich, for example, describes an effect by Nuzum he witnessed, in which the corner of a selected page of a book appeared inside an enve- lope. A simple suggestion: Mr Imich could invite Nuzum to perform the same phenomenon again, but asking him, this time, never to touch the book (not even to take it [off] of the shelf). It would be interesting to see if the same phenomenon will mani- fest again (provided, of course, thatboth book and page are chosen at random by the experimenter, and not \"suggested\" by Nuzum ...). Apparently Imich overlooked these lines in my letter. Remembering this episode today, however, gives me the chance to alsostress once more that it is not the duty ofthe critic to reproduce a claimed miracle. As should be widely known by now (but is apparently not to many researchers), the burden of proof always rests on the claimant. In this particular case, I would have considered it quite impressive if Nuzum could perform his miracle with a book provided by me. I would havemade sure not to let him get anywhere near the book before the test, a precau- tion that Imich did not take. Quoting from his ( JSPR, 61[846]: 336): \" Anatomyand [he] opened itat page 354\" (emphasis added). In a postscript to his article, Imich added that a report about \"the latest, never-previously-described paranormal events produced by Joe Nuzum\" was in preparation. Fourteen years later, some are still waiting for some reliable proof of at least one real phenomenon produced by this self-proclaimed psychic. However, we stopped holding our breaths a long time ago. n Note 1. Victorian British medium Daniel D.

Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double, and end up kissing complete strangers. Or is that just me? \u2014Dr. Who, in the episode \"The Long Game\" (2005) Afew days ago I received the new editorial schedule for the S KEP - TICALINQUIRERfrom the editor of this magazine, Ken Frazier. There was a peculiarity concerning when my next column was due: three days before I received the e-mail! I checked with Ken, and there was no error. Because of a new approach to scheduling, my nextcolumn really was due in the past\u2014 though I was told I would get a reprieveof about two weeks. Coinci dentally, at the time I was also reading an introduc- tory book on metaphysics\u2014which in -cluded a discussion of time traveling\u2014 as well as watching some episodes of the BBC series Dr. Who, which is all about time travel (and no, I wasn't watching the series while reading the book and the e-mail; my ability to multitask does- n't extend that far). So, the idea of doing a column about time traveling sprang naturally to mind. To begin with, we need to make a distinction between the physical possi- bility of time travel and the logic of it. Broadly speaking, the first item is a matter for physics, the second for phi-losophy (though obviously the two SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 2526 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerwould intersect if we ever did try to get a time machine working). In this columnI will focus on the conceptual issuesposed by time travel. There are two suchissues that are particularly pressing: firstoff, time travel seems to necessitate back-ward causation; second, it seems to makecausal loops possible. And both back-ward causation and causal loops areproblematic ideas. Philosopher David Lewis gives a simple example of backward causation:Suppose you see a wannabe time trav-eler about to step into his machine, andyou manage (for whatever reason!) topunch him in the face. He then escapesto his machine, sets it for five hundredyears in the past, and reappears duringthe Renaissance. In the meantime, hisphysiological reaction to the punch has continued, so a bruise will form on his face\u2014which means that you are re- sponsible for a bruise appearing five centuries before you actually punched the guy. That's backward causation. The first thought that comes to mind is that backward causation is an oxymoron: surely by definition the ef- fect cannot precede the cause! But the tricky part of that statement is the word precede. If by \"the effect cannot precedethe cause\" we mean that the effect can-not causally precede its cause, the state- ment is indeed true. If the effect did causally precede the cause, we would simply call the effect a \"cause\" and thecause an \"effect,\" and logical order would be restored. But precedemay mean temporally, not causally, prior. Most theories of causation (of which there is a long tradition, stretching back to Aristotle) are in fact compatible withbackward causation, as long as the ef- fect precedes the cause temporally but not causally\u2014the example of the time traveler who is punched in the face is one that does not entail any logical contradiction. What about causal loops? Brian Garrett gives us an example in his bookWhat Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?Imagine that a time traveler goes back to his own youth to tell his younger self how to make a time machine. The young inventor then makes it possi-ble\u2014by building the machine\u2014for his older self to come back from the future and instruct him on how to build it.You see that there is a closed causal chain at work here. The problem with causal loops is that one gets the nastysuspicion that something is being got- ten out of nothing: Where does theknow-how to build time machines ul-timately come from? Clearly, it comes neither from the older nor from the younger \"inventor.\" Whence then? Garrett himself doesn't seem too bothered by this problem. He says that we have no trouble conceiving of all sorts of uncaused events, so why should this particular one be problematic? Buthis examples of non-troubling un - caused events just don't seem to fit the bill: \"God, or the Big Bang, or the en- tire infinite past of the universe, or the decay of a tritium atom.\" Let's ex clude God, because I don't think that ill-de- fined concept belongs in any serious philosophical discussion of science. Theother events are hardly cases analogous to the building of a time machine, both because they pertain to quantum-level phenomena (and you know how poorly we understand those!) and because it is not at all a given that the big bang oratomic decay are truly uncaused events. No essay about time travel could pos- sibly be complete without a mention ofthe grandfather paradox. It seems that if time travel is possible, then it should also be possible to go back and kill your grandfather before your father is born (why you might want to do that is anentirely different question, of course). But killing your grandfather puts you in yet another causal loop: if you do man- age to kill him, then how could you have been born in the first place, which is a necessary precondition for you to go back in time and kill him? The general conclusion seems to be that time travel requires causal loops, which in turn ne- cessitate closed time-like curves. For all we know at the moment (from physics, particularly relativity theory), however, time is a linear dimension like the three spatial ones, not a closed curve\u2014unless some particularly strange version of string theory entailing folded time di- mensions manages to turn up. But that's a whole different story (see my \"Is Physics Turning into Philoso phy?\" SI, May/June 2006). nThe problem with causal loops is that one gets the nasty suspicion that something is being gotten out of nothing: Where does the know-how to build time machines ultimately come from?SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 26Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 27[ SCIENCE WATCH K E N N E T H W. K R A U S E On August 23, 2010, U.S. District Judge Royce Lam berth turned the recently revitalized world of stem-cell research on its unsuspecting ear. The decision centered on theDickey-Wicker amendment, whichbans federal financing of any research involving the destruction or endanger- ment of human embryos. According to Lamberth, the government violated that law when it acted upon PresidentObama's 2009 executive order expandingsupport for research on human embry- onic stem cells (hESC). Dickey-Wicker first passed in 1996 and has been reat-tached to congressional spending billsevery year since. Sherley v. Sebelius was initiated by various claimants, including a number of Christian groups who were later dis- missed for lack of standing. The re- maining plaintiffs, adult stem-cell (ASC) researchers James Sherley andTheresa Deisher, were recruited to the suit and continue to claim standing based on alleged harm to their careers resulting from increased competition for federal cash. Lamberth's preliminary injunction on funding had an immediate and major impact on the science commu- nity. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) was forced to abandon its re- view of fifty new grant applications. It also halted second-level review of twelve applications worth fifteen to twenty million dollars.Although funding was restored on September 9 when the appeals court temporarily stayed Lamberth's injunc- tion, many experts warn that mounting uncertainty has already caused irrepara- ble damage and say American postdoc- toral researchers are rethinking en try into the field. They also tell us that for- eign graduates are more reluctant to consider positions in the United States. The appeals court heard oral argu- ments on December 6 and was ex - pected to rule sometime in January. The outcome is anything but certain, and many legal experts expect the case to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Regard-less, the legal fracas serves more con-structively to highlight weightier and even more contentious questions. First, the science: Just how impor- tant is continued research on hESC,and to what extent do recent advances in ASC and induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) technologies alter that dis-cussion? Nothing obscures or distorts science quite like politics inspired by religion. According to celebrated skeptic Susan Jacoby (2011), \"The problem with the good news that embryonic stem cell re- search will now go forward is that the public relations campaign against right- wing religious restrictions ... [has] oversold the possibility of immediate practical results to conquer such dis- eases as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\" Indeed, only three clinical trials in-volving hESC had received U.S. gov-ernment approval as of this writing, and all were the product of privately funded research. In January 2009, Geron ob- tained permission to begin stem-cell therapy on patients with spinal-cord injuries. Then, in Novem ber 2010 and January 2011, respectively, Advanced Cell Tech nology got the Food and Drug Administra tion's go-ahead to work on juveniles with Stargardt's mac- ular degeneration and adults with age-related macular degeneration. None of these trials, however, has produced any reportable results. Research on ASC, by contrast, has already paid sumptuous dividends\u2014in-cluding bona f ide cures for certain blood diseases. Although ASC by themselves lack pluripotency, a barrage of recent headlines has flaunted this field's undeniable vitality. In 2009, for example, Dr. Tracy Grikscheit from Children's Hospital Los Angeles opened up a pig and constructed a small intestine-like structure inside using nothing more than the animal's in- testinal stem cells and a biodegradable cylinder-shaped scaffolding, thus de - monstrating that ASC somehow \"know\" what to do when seeded onto a familiar structure (Sala et al. 2009). Preliminarytests suggest that Grikscheit's artificial bowel will function naturally in pigs. A similar technique has improved the life of a human child.

Religion on Politics on Science: The Rough Ride for Stem Cells ContinuesSI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 2728 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirercells harvested from his young spina bi- fida-inflicted patient, Dr. Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Insti- tute for Regenerative Medi cine, created a new bladder that, once attached to the old paralyzed organ, attracted its ownnerve and blood supplies. Now, severalyears after surgery, the twenty-year-old patient's bladder performs normally. But in recent months, iPSC have re- ceived more attention and generated more excitement among scientists than any other stem-cell technology. Back in2006, Shinya Yamanaka was adult fibroblastsback to a pluripotent, embryonic-like state through the forced expression a few years later, staggering progress has been made in differentiating human iPSC into neu- rons and heart, liver, pancreas, and eye tissues. Now, say many experts, it ap- pears that iPSC are \"poised to have a major impact in biology and medicine\"through applications in \"disease model- ing, drug screening, and, perhaps, cell-based therapies\" (Sadelain 2010). Indeed, on December 12, 2010, re - searchers from the Cincinnati Chil dren's Hospital Medical Center in Ohio re- ported success in coaxing human iPSC(and separately cultured hESC) to form a three-dimensional organ resembling an intestine and to recapitulate smooth- muscle tissue, nutrient-absorbing cells, and mucous-, hormone-, secreting cells (Spence et al. 2010). entists have also used iPSC to cure dia- betes in mice. 1 Nevertheless, iPSC have presented their own problems. First, the insertion of external genes into reprogrammed cells can cause any number of expression anomalies. Second, one of Yama naka's transcription factors is known to cause tumors. Third, the reprogramming process can be inefficient, resulting in only one success for every 1,000 cells treated. Indeed, one 2010 study reported that iPSC were thousands of times lesslikely to proliferate and suffered greatly increased rates of early senescence (aging) and apoptosis (cell death) whencompared with their embryonic coun- terparts (Feng et al. 2010). Emerging evidence also indicates that iPSC tend to retain traits from their tissue of origin\u2014striking residual DNA methylation signatures that could seri- ously compromise their suitability foruse in the fields of genetic engineering and regenerative medicine. In one of three new studies describing this phe- nomenon, now dubbed epigenetic mem- ory, researchers compared iPSC repro- grammed through the Yamanaka method with mouse ESC generated via somatic-cell nuclear transfer (Kim et al.2010). Disappoint ingly, they discovered that the iPSC were less likely to achieve \"ground state pluripotency\" and that they tended to differentiate into their original cell types. Then again, scientists have ad dres - sed\u2014and in some cases, overcome\u2014these obstacles almost as quickly as jour- nalists can write about them. Some labs now use viruses that don't invade the cell's genome, while others employ tiny rings of DNA called episomes that don't replicate when the cell divides. This past September, Derrick Rossi of the Harvard Medical School used synthetic RNA molecules correspon- ding to the standard Yamanaka factorsto produce RNA-induced pluripotent stem cells, or \"RiPS,\" one hundred timesmore efficiently (a two percent success rate) than with viral methods and in roughly half the time (two weeks) (War- ren et al. 2010). And be cause RNA dis- integrates rapidly, RiPS are genetically identical to their source cells. Unfortu- nately, Rossi's process is exceptionally expensive and time consuming. Even more recently, Sheng Ding, a chemist at the Scripps Research Insti - tute in San Diego, effectively repro- grammed human skin cells by treating them with drugs and only one virus- delivered gene, OCT4 (Zhu et al. 2010). And because that gene, too, has been replaced in experiments on mice, says Ding, a human protocol entirely free of foreign genes may not be far off. The direct conversion of ordinary body cells has lately gained momentumas well. On November 7, Mickie Bhatia at McMaster University re ported the first-ever conversion of human skin cellsinto red, white, and platelet blood cells using an OCT4 -infused virus and a brew of immune-system stimulating proteins called cytokines (Szabo et al. 2010). Because these cells never pass through an embryonic-like state, the risk of tumor formation is averted. On the downside, converted cells will noteasily multiply in the lab. Regardless, America's most promi- nent and accomplished researchers continue to insist that neither ASC nor iPSC technologies have advanced far enough to render aggressive hESC re- search superfluous, let alone obsolete. During a well-publicized hearing onstem-cell research held on September16, 2010, a Senate appropriations sub- committee took testimony from Fran- cis Collins, director of the NIH, and George Daley, director of the Stem Cell Transplantation Program at the Children's Hospital Boston. A vocal evangelical Christian as well, Collins made it plain during the hearing that hESC \"remain the goldstandard for pluripotency\" and that \"to prohibit work on [them] will thus do severe collateral damage to the new and exciting research on [iPSC].\" He then reminded the senators that the NIH spends nearly three times as much on ASC research as it does on hESC re- search every year. But Collins's most poignant testi- mony divulged how hESC are currently \"providing key tools to help us study the origins of many devastating diseases that afflict babies and young children,\" including fragile X and Rett syndromes, developmental disorders of the brain. Americans \"must persevere and move this research forward in a strong andconsistent manner,\" he urged. The pol- itics of delay and uncertainty, he warned, were tantamount to \"pouring sand into the engine of discovery.\" Having co-authored Rossi's ground- breaking RiPS paper, Daley's adamantavowal that iPSC \"do not obviate the need for [hESC]\" may have beenSI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 28equally effective. He also noted the stubborn limitations of even the most successful ASC treatments in volving the transplantation of hema topoieticcells. Despite fifty years of this research and practice, Daley said, \"patients still die or become severely disabled because the transplant regimens are so toxic.\" Clearly irritated by the current legal intrusion into scientific matters, Daleylikened the political debate concerning different classes of stem cells to a con- test between entertainers on American Idol. These arguments, he scolded, \"arenot based on sound scientific evidence,but rather ideologically driven at - tempts\" to control science and distort sober medical realities. Urging new leg-islation to encourage American re-search, Daley was \"convinced that [hESC] are critical to a multifacetedportfolio of NIH stem cell research.\" Senate subcommittees are notorious for choosing witnesses certain to con- firm member predilections. But theseresearchers' credentials, and those of their many professional supporters, cannot be denied. In the end, Jacoby(2011, 98) concurs: \"That treatmentsmay be a generation or two ... away is not an argument against basic scientific research. The difficulty of the science makes it more, not less, important for researchers to move full speed ahead now in all areas that offer promise for the alleviation of the most serious age related diseases.\" After the judiciary imposes itself, however, it quickly loses the option to bow out gracefully. Dickey-Wicker was a legal accident waiting to happen. But from the wreckage we must now address the next unavoidable question: How should Americans dispose of the stem- cell quandary\u2014through the courts or through Congress? In the courts, the defense will argue that Dickey-Wicker preceded and thus could not have been intended to control modern hESC research. It will contend that mere research on stem cells previ- ously derived from embryos does not constitute harming those embryos, which is apparently the reasoning Con-gress relied upon during the past two presidential administrations. But even the best-case judicial solu- tion would be inadequate. With polls showing continued and increasing pop- ular support for hESC research, all sci-ence-friendly members of Congressshould promptly push for clear andcomprehensive legislation that wouldoverride Dickey-Wicker and codifymany of the research guidelines an -nounced by Obama in 2009. And we shouldn't forget that the stem-cell question is part of a largerissue looming on the cultural horizon.America stands at a crossroads. Will itremain a nation committed to scientific innovation and economic progress? Orwill ideology finally tear down those long-partnered academic and entrepre-neurial edifices that generations of supremely talented, energetic, forward-thinking, and, yes, conscientious persons have worked so hard to erect? n Note 1. Also on December 12, researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center pre- sented findings at the fiftieth annual meeting of the American Society of Cell Biology that in- sulin-secreting beta islet cells, normally found in the pancreas, can be produced from human sper- matogonial ASC without the use of extra genes. These researchers hope that continued progress in this area will lead to a novel solution to juve- nile-onset (type 1) diabetes.References Feng, Q., S. Lu, I. Klimanskaya, et al. 2010.

People who suffer from Morgellons disease experi-ence a variety of symp-toms, including crawlingor stinging sensations onthe skin, chronic fatigue, and memory loss. Many also claim tofind mysterious fiber-like materials ex- truding through their skin: \"Fibers arere ported in and on skin lesions and areusually white, but clinicians also reportseeing blue, green, red, and black fibersthat fluoresce when viewed under ultra-violet light\" (Paquette 2007). A verynew disease, its cause, mode of trans- mission, and treatment remain un-known. Most doctors believe that Morgel lons is a type of psychiatric disorder calleddelusional parasitosis , in which patients come to believe that they are infestedwith invisible insects or bugs (an excel-lent cinematic example of this disorder can be seen in the 2006 thriller Bug). There's a strong link between Mor - gellons and mental illness. As re - searcher Mary Paquette noted in Per- spectives in Psychiatric Care (2007), \"over half of all individuals with Mor gellons disease also suffer from mood disorderssuch as depression and bipolar disorder. It is estimated that 65% of children with Morgellons have some form of psychiatric illness such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, opposi-tional defiant disorder, mood disorders,or autism.\" Such patients are often treated with antipsychotic pimozide (Orap), olanzapine (Zyprexa), or risperidone (Risperdal) (Shenefelt 2010). An of paranoia has also arisen surrounding Mor gellons: suffer- ers sometimes claim that the U.S. gov- ernment or the medical establishment knows what is causing their symptoms but is covering it up for some reason. Sociologist Robert Bartholo mew believes that Morgellons is a sociallytransmitted disease caused by a woman named Mary Leitao: In 2002, a South Carolina mother named Mary Leitao founded a web-site called the Morgellons [Research] Founda tion, dedicated to solving themystery of the ailment by the same name. Leitao became worried after strange symptoms developed in her two-year-old son. She chose the name after stumbling across a 1674 medical report describing similar symptoms to what he was experienc- ing. The site quickly became a mag- net for people around the world with all sorts of vague symptoms. The pat- tern of transmission is not tied to a mysterious new bacteria or virus. Inthis instance, the Internet is the car- rier\u2014and the disease is an idea, which is spread by human insecurity and fear. It is a sign of our changing times, a product of the Information Age. (Bartholomew 2010) Due largely to lobbying efforts by Leitao and others (including musician Joni Mitchell) associated with theMorgellons Research Foundation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently began investigating the disease, and there are a handful of experts who endorse Morgellons as a disease distinct from delusional para- sitosis. Indeed, \"At least one scientist\u2014 albeit not an expert in the field\u2014is tak- ing it seriously. 'Morgellons patients have masses of dark fibers visible at \u00d760 magnification under the unbroken skin, while unaffected individuals do not,' says Randy Wymore, assistant professor of pharmacology at Okla homa State University. 'That took away any possi- bility that this was not a real thing'\" (Marris 2006). Other re search ers have concluded that the fibers come from mundane sources such as clothing, car- peting, or pets. Per haps Wymore andother re searchers will find good evi- dence of a real disease, but until then, the Occam's razor principle suggests that Morgellons is a mental disorder. n References Bartholomew, Robert. 2010.

Phillips Q:SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 30Parapsychology has long struggled, unsuccessfully, for acceptance in the halls of science. Could this article be its breakthrough? After all, the article ap- parently provides evidence compelling enough to persuade the editors of the world's preeminent social-psychology journal of its worthiness. However, this is hardly the first time that there has been media excitement about new \"sci- entific\" evidence of the paranormal. Over the past eighty-odd years, this drama has played out a number of times, and each time parapsychologists ultimately failed to persuade the scien- tific world that parapsychological phe- George Santayana's now-clich\u00e9d dic-tum, \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\" we should approach Bem's work using a historical framework to guide us. Con-sider the following: 1. In 1934, Joseph Banks Rhine pub- lished Extra-Sensory Perception (Rhine & McDougall, 1934/2003), summariz- ing his careful efforts to bring parapsy- chology into the laboratory through ap- plication of modern psychological methodology and statistical analysis. Based on a long series of card-guessing experiments, Rhine wrote: \"It is inde- pendently established on the basis ofthis work alone that Extra-SensoryPerception is an actual and demonstra- ble occurrence\" (p. 210). Elsewhere, hewrote: \"We have, then, for physical sci- ence, a challenging need for the discov- ery of the energy mode involved. Some type of energy is inferable and none is known to be acceptable . ..\" (166). Despite Rhine's confidence that he had established the reality of extrasen- sory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his ex-periments eventually came to light, and as a result parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine's work. 2. Physicist Helmut Schmidt conducted numerous studies throughout the 1970s and '80s that putatively demonstrated that humans (and animals) could para- normally influence and/or predict the output of random event generators. Some of his claims were truly extraordi- nary: for example, that a cat in a garden shed, which was heated only by a lamp controlled by a random event generator, was able\u2014through psychokinetic ma- nipulation\u2014to turn the lamp on more often than would be expected by chance. Schmidt's claim to have put psi on a solid scientific footing garnered considerable attention, and his published research re- ported very im pressive p values. 2In my own extensive review of his work, I con-cluded that Schmidt had indeed accu- mulated im pressive evidence that some- thing other than chance was involved (Alcock 1988). However, I found serious methodological errors throughout his Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 31Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair Psychologist Daryl Bem has reported data suggesting that individuals' future experiences can influence their responses in the present. Careful scrutiny of his report reveals serious flaws in procedure and analysis, rendering this interpretation untenable. JAMES E. ALCOCK Aflurry of media attention is being directed toward the prepublication distribution of Daryl Bem's forthcom- ing re search paper \"Feeling the Future: Experimental Evidence for Anomalous Retroactive Influences on Cogni- tion and Affect.\"1Bem claims to have found evidence of marvelous psychic abilities that transcend time and allow the future to reach backward to change the past. Both the academic stature of its author, a respected emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell University, and the fact that it was to be published in the American Psychological Association's (APA) Journal of Per sonal ity and Social Psychology have made this report particularly newsworthy.SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 3132 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerwork that rendered his conclusions un- tenable, and the \"something other thanchance\" was attributable to method-ological flaws. As with Rhine, excitement about Schmidt's research gradually dwindledto the point that his work became vir-tually irrelevant, even within the fieldof parapsychology itself. 3. The 1970s gave rise to \"remote view- ing,\" a procedure through which an in-dividual seated in a laboratory can sup-posedly receive psychic impressions ofa remote location that is being visitedby someone else. Physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff claimed that theirseries of remote-viewing studiesdemonstrated the reality of psi. This at- tracted huge media attention, and theirdramatic findings (Targ and Puthoff1974) were published in Nature,one of the world's top scientific journals. Atfirst, their methodology seemed unas-sailable; years later, when more detailedinformation became available, it be- came obvious that there were funda- mental flaws in procedure that could readily account for their sensational findings. When other re searchers re- peated Targ and Puthoff's procedure with the flaws intact, significant results were obtained; with the flaws removed, outcomes were not significant (Marks and Kamman 1978, 1980). Add Targ and Puthoff to the list of \"breakthrough\" psi researchers whose work is now all but forgotten. 4. In 1979, Robert Jahn, then dean ofthe School of Engineering and Applied Science at Princeton University, estab- lished the Princeton Engineering An - oma lies Research (PEAR) unit to studyputative paranormal phenomena such as psychokinesis. Like Schmidt, Jahn wasparticularly interested in the possibilitythat people can predict and/or influencepurely random subatomic processes. Given his superb academic and scien- tific credentials, his claims of success drew particular attention within the sci-entific community. When his laboratory closed in 2007, Jahn concluded that \"over the laboratory's 28-year history, thousands of such experiments, involv-ing many millions of trials, were per- formed by several hundred operators. The observed effects were usually quitesmall, of the order of a few parts in ten thousand on average, but they com- pounded to highly significant statisticaldeviations from chance expectations\" (PEAR, n.d.). However, parapsychologists them- selves were among the most severe crit- ics of his work, and their criticisms were in line with my own (Alcock 1988).More importantly, several replication attempts have been unsuccessful (Jef- fers 2003), including a large-scale inter- national effort led by Jahn himself(Jahn et al. 2000). 5. In the1970s, the ganzfeld, a concept borrowed from contemporaneous psy- chological research into the effects of sensory deprivation, was brought intoparapsychological research. Parapsy chol -ogists reasoned that psi influences may be so subtle that they are normally drowned out by information carried through normal sensory channels. Per- haps if a participant were in a situation relatively free of normal stimulation, then extrasensory information would have abetter opportunity to be recognized. The late Charles Honorton carried out a large number of ganzfeld studies and claimedthat his meta-analysis 3of this work sub- stantiated the reality of psi. Hyman (1985) carried out a parallel meta-analy- sis that contradicted that conclusion. Hyman and Honorton (1986) subse- quently published a \"joint communiqu\u00e9\" in which they agreed that the ganzfeld results were not likely to be due to chance, but they thought that replication involving more rigorous standards was essential before final conclusions could be drawn. Daryl Bem subsequently published an overview of ganzfeld research in the prestigious Psychological Bulletin (Bem and Honorton 1994), claiming that the accumulated data were clear evidence of the reality of paranormal phenomena. That effort failed to be convincing, in part because a number of meta-analyses have been carried out since then with contradictory results (e.g., Bem et al. 2001; Milton and Wiseman 1999). Re- cently, the issue was raised again in the pages of Psychological Bul letin, with pa- pers from Storm et al. (2010a, 2010b) and Hyman (2010). While Storm andcoworkers argued that their meta- analyses demonstrate paranormal influ-ences, Hyman pointed to serious short- comings in their analysis and reminded us that the ganzfeld procedure has failed to yield data that are capable of being replicated by neutral scientists. Because of the lack of clear and replicable evidence, the ganzfeld proce- dure has not lived up to the promise of providing the long-sought break- through that would lead to the accept-ance of psiby mainstream science. Add Honorton (and Bem the first time around) to the list. The lesson in this history is that new claims of impressive evidence for psiExcitement about Helmut Schmidt's research gradually dwindled to the point that his work became virtually irrelevant, even within the field of parapsychology itself.SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 32should give one pause. Early excitement is often misleading, and as Ray Hymanhas pointed out, it often takes up to tenyears before the shortcomings of a newapproach in parapsychological research become evident. One must also keep in mind that even the best statistical evidence cannotspeak to the causes of observed statisti- cal departures. Statistical deviations do not favor arbitrary pet hypotheses, and statistical evidence cited in support of psi could as easily support other hy-potheses as well. For example, if one conducted a parapsychological experi-ment while praying for above-chance scoring, statistically significant out- comes could be taken as evidence forthe power of prayer just as readily as forthe existence of psi. Another key consideration is that parapsychology's putative phenomena are all negatively defined: to claim that psi has been detected, all possible nor- mal influences must be ruled out. How- ever, one can never be certain that all normal influences have been elimi- nated; the reader of a research reporthas only the experimenter's word for it. This point brings us to a related con- cern. Research reports involve an implicit social contract between experimenter and audience. The reader can evaluate only what has been put into print and must presume that the researcher has followedthe best practices of good research. We assume that the participants did actuallyparticipate and that they were not al- lowed to use their cellular telephonesduring the experiment or to chat with other participants. We assume that they were effectively shielded from cues that might have inappropriately influenced their responses. We assume that the data were as reported\u2014that none were thrown out because they did not suit the experi - men ter\u2014and that they were analyzed ap- propriately and in the manner indicated. We assume that equipment functioned as described and that precautions re- ported in the experimental procedure were carefully followed. We take for granted that the researcher set out to test particular hypotheses and did not choose the hypotheses after looking at the data.We must take all this on faith, for oth- erwise any research publication might simply be approached as a blend of fact, fantasy, skill, and error, possibly reflecting little more than the predilections of the researcher. Obvious methodo logical or analytical sloppiness indicates that the implicit social contract has been violated and that we can no longer have confi- dence that the researcher followed best practices and minimized personal bias. As Gardner (1977) wrote, when one finds that the chemist began with dirty test tubes, one can have no confidence in the chemist's findings and must wonder about other, as yet undetected, contami- nation. So, when considering Bem's pres- ent re search, not only do we need to look at the data, but\u2014following the meta - phor\u2014we need to assess whether Bemused clean test tubes. Bem's Research Bem describes a series of nine experi- ments \"test for retroactive influence by 'time-reversing' well-established psy- chological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the puta- tively causal stimulus events occur.\" His stated goal is \"to provide well-con- trolled demonstrations of psi that can bereplicated independent investigators.\" He defines psias denoting \"anomalous pro cesses of information or energy transfer that are currently unexplainedin terms of known physical or biologi- cal mechanisms.\" EXPERIMENT 1: Precognitive Detection of Erotic Stimuli Each trial in this experiment involved the presentation of an erotic, negative, or neutral picture. The participant sat in front of a computer screen and was tasked to predict which of two curtains had a picture behind it. Only after the participant had chosen a curtain by de- pressing a key did the computer select a picture at random and present it be- hind either the left or the right curtain. Each participant was presented with thirty-six of these trials and was given feedback on each one. The erotic pic- tures were considered to be \"explicit re- inforcement for correct 'precognitive'guesses,\" although no effort was made to determine whether they were indeedreinforcing anything. The main hy-pothesis was that participants would beable to identify the position of the hid- den erotic picture significantly more often than by chance. So far, clear enough. But then things become quite messy: we learn that \"most\" of the pictures used in the ex- periment were selected from a data- bank, the International Affective Pic- ture System. Bem then states that each session (a \"session\" refers to all the trials of an individual participant) in volved thirty-six trials of randomly intermixederotic and non-erotic pictures (eighteen of each). However, we soon learn that not all sessions were conducted in this way: the first forty of the one hundred sessions (that is, those of the first fortyparticipants) involved twelve trials of erotic pictures, twelve of negative pic- tures, and twelve of neutral pictures! (The distinction between the \"non- erotic\" pictures seen by the majority of the participants and the \"neutral\" pic-tures seen by only the first forty is un- clear.) To muddle things even more,Bem then states that the remaining sixty sessions involved \"18 trials of erotic pic- tures and 18 trials of non-erotic positive pictures with both high and low arousal ratings. These included pictures featuringcouples in romantic but non-erotic situa- tions...\" (emphasis added). How many were of high or low arousal weighting,or what those terms even mean, he does not say. What is going on here? Setting aside the confusion about the stimulus,no competent researcher dramatically modifies an experiment two-fifths ofthe way into it! To do so is to seriously compromise any subsequent analysis and interpretation. But that is not all. Bem next indi- cates that in all the experiments using highly arousing erotic or negative stim- uli, \"a relatively large number of non- arousing trials must be included to per- mit the participant's arousal level to 'settle down' between critical trials. This requires including many trials that do not contribute directly to the effect Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 33SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 3334 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerbeing tested.\" This leaves us not know- ing how many trials were actually run and wondering by what method the re-searcher determined the number ofnon-arousing trials that were needed toensure that even the most randy of par-ticipants would \"settle down.\" So by this point, it is not clear how many trials were actually presented toeach participant or even whether they allreceived an equal number of trials. It isunclear just what the stimulus materialswere, and we are faced with a procedurethat was changed partway through theexperiment. Just when one thinks that this study cannot be made any more confusing, Bem informs us that he discovered inExperiment 5 (which turns out to havebeen conducted prior to Experi ment 1!) that \"women showed psi effects to highly arousing stimuli but men did not.\" In light of this odd complication, Bem states that \"we introduced different erotic and negative pictures for men and women in subsequent studies, including this one using stronger and more explicit images from Internet sites for the men. We also provided two additional sets of erotic pictures so that men could choose the option of seeing male-male erotic images and women could choose the op-tion of seeing female-female erotic im-ages\" (emphasis added). By now, a careful reader is totally confused as to what went on in this ex-periment. Now, we find that participants were allowed to choose their target set! This is one of the most baffling descrip-tions of research materials and proce- dures that I have ever encountered. In reflecting on the extremely unusual change in procedure during the experi- ment\u2014when the appropriate course would be to run two different experi-ments\u2014one cannot help but wonder iftwo experiments were indeed run, andwhen each failed to produce significantresults the data from them were com- bined with the focus shifted to only the erotic pictures common to all partici- pants. Surely that was not done, for such an action would make a mockery of ex-perimental rigor. Data Analysis : Bem states that \"the main psi hypothesis was that participantswould be able to identify the position of the hidden erotic picture significantlymore often than chance (50%).\" At first, this claim is puzzling. Although sixty of the participants completed eighteen trialswith erotic pictures and eighteen trials with \"non-erotic positive pictures\"\u2014there-fore making the chance outcome 50 per-cent of the thirty-six trials\u2014the other fortyparticipants received twelve trials with erotic pictures, twelve with negative pic- tures, and twelve with neutral pictures.For them, the chance outcome would be33.3 percent. However, it turns out that Bem combined the data for success or failure, but on the erotic pictures only, from all one hundred sessions (i.e., from all one hundred participants) and thenapplied t-tests 4to assess whether identi- fication of the future position of erotic pic- tures occurred significantly more fre- quently than the 50 percent rate expected by chance. We are also informed that the hit rate for non-erotic pictures\u2014whether they were neutral, negative, positive, or ro- mantic and non-erotic\u2014did not differ sig- nificantly from chance. (This is the firstmention of \"romantic but non-erotic,\"which adds to the confusion.) Now we have learned that the focus of the experiment is on the erotic pic- tures presented to the participants, but no information is provided regardinghow participants with three choicesscored on erotic pictures as comparedwith those who had only two choices;one wonders why this is so. The data analysis was conducted through multiple t-tests without any cor- rection for that multiplicity. We are in- formed that there were at least seven such t-tests, and the only significant out- come was that the one hundred partici- pants \"identified the future position of erotic pictures significantly more fre- quently than the 50% hit rate expected by chance: 53.1%.\" This was stated to be statistically significant at p = .01. How- ever, that significance level is simply in- correct. This kind of error (Type I) 5in- creases with the number of t-tests conducted, and given that there were at least seven such t-tests with a criterion of p .01, the actual probability associatedwith each of these t-tests is 1 - (.99) 7= .06 one-tailed.6Thus, none of these t-tests is actually statistically signif- icant, not even at a more generous .05 p value. It is simply unacceptable that Bemdid not correct for multiple testing, de- spite indications later in his report thathe is familiar with one such correctiontechnique, the Bonferroni t-test. 7We then find that participants were allowed to choose their target set! This is one of the most baffling descriptions of research materials and procedures that I have ever encountered. SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 34Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 35Another reason for concern is Bem's deliberate use of one-tailed t-tests, which provide a simpler criterion to meet than the two-tailed tests generally employed by parapsychologists. (Para - psy chologists typically interpret bothabove-chance and below-chance scor- ing as indicative of psi, and thus they do not make specific predictions about thedirection of the extra-chance scoring.) When we say that something is signif-icant at the .01 level two-tailed, thismeans that we would expect these re-sults to occur by chance alone only 1 percent of the time. But, given that ei-ther above-chance or below-chance re- sults are considered to be meaningful, this 1 percent must be distributed in both directions. Thus, above-chance re-sults would be significant at the .01level two-tailed only if they are so ex- treme that they would be expected tooccur by chance only half of 1 percent,or 0.5 percent, of the time. The sameapplies for below-chance results. Bem also reports that he carried out a nonparametric binomial test 8on the overall proportion of hits on erotic tar-gets across all trials and sessions, but heoffers no adequate rationale for usingmore than one type of significance test for the same data. The test is redundant and offers nothing beyond the t-test. Then, after having examined the data, he introduces the possibility thatintroversion/extroversion may play arole in presumed precognitive ability.He suggests that it may be an extrovert's \"susceptibility to boredom and the ten- dency to seek out stimulation\" that un- derlies observed correlations between extroversion and psi performance re - ported in the literature. However, rather than using existing, well-documented measures of stimulus-seeking, he con- structed his own such scale comprising two statements, reversed in scoring: \"I am easily bored\" and \"I often enjoy see- ing movies I've seen before.\" The con- tent and construction of this scale is be- wildering. Proper scale construction involves precise and often difficult work, including operationalization of the con- struct, finding items that can be demon-strated to relate to the construct, endeav- oring to ensure that the increments on the response measure are of approxi- mately equal size, and establishing satis- factory reliability and validity of the final scale. Bem has ignored these considera- tions. As a result, the arbitrary assign- ment of numbers to participants' re- sponses on this \"scale\" is unjustified and misleading. Nonetheless, Bem correlates re sponses on the scale with the participants' \"psi scores\" and reports a significant correla- tion, but only for those participantswhose scores on his scale fall above the midpoint. Participants who score below the midpoint on the scale did not score significantly above chance on either erotic or non-erotic trials. Overall Evaluation : Just about every- thing that could be done wrong in an ex- periment occurred here. And even if one chooses to overlook that methodological mess, Bem's data still do not support the claimed above-chance effect because ofthe multiple-testing problem. It is difficult to have confidence that the other eight experiments, some of which were carried out earlier than the one just described, were conducted with appropriate attention to experimental rigor: We have toured the laboratory; we have found the dirty test tubes andthe mislabeled vials; we have observed inappropriate methodology and analy- sis. We have lost confidence in thechemist, and there seems little need to poke about further. Nonetheless, go on we must. EXPERIMENT 2: Precognitive Avoidance of Negative Stimuli This study involved 107 female and forty-three male undergraduate stu-dents. Using a computer, each partici- pant first responded to Bem's two-item stimulus-seeking scale and then com- pleted a sequence thirty-six trials in which a \"low arousal affectively neutral\" picture was presented side by side withits mirror image. The participant de-pressed a key to indicate which picture he or she liked better. Only after the preference was registered did the com-puter randomly choose which of the two pictures would be considered the \"target.\" If the participant had chosen this target, the computer thrice flashed a reportedly subliminal \"positively va- lenced picture.\" If \"highly arousing negatively valenced picture\" was flashed three times. A hit was defined as choosing the \"target-to-be.\" However, as in Experi - ment 1, the description of the situationis difficult to unravel: For the first one hundred sessions (the first one hundred participants), \"the flashed positive and negative pictures were independently selected and sequenced randomly.\" Then there was a change in procedure. For the next fifty participants, \"the neg- ative pictures were put into a fixed se- quence, ranging from those that had been successfully avoided most fre- quently during the first 100 sessions tothose that had been avoided least fre-quently.\" When the participant selected what was to later be designated as the target picture, the positive picture was flashed, subliminally as before, and thenegative picture was retained for the next trial. However, when the partici- pant selected the non-target, \"the neg- ative picture was flashed and the nextpositive and negative pictures in the queue were used for the next trial.\" This presents the same problem as before\u2014the procedure has been changed partway through the experi- ment. Bem states that this was done to evaluate the possibility that \"the psi ef- fect may be stronger if the most success- fully avoided negative stimuli were used repeatedly until they were eventually in- voked.\" It is difficult to get one's head around this justification, and in any case, this should have been examined in a sep- arate study. Again, given the inherentunreasonableness of changing the pro- cedure in an ongoing experiment, one cannot help but wonder if two separate experiments were run and then com- bined after neither produced signifi-cant results on its own. As in the first experiment, simple t-tests were used to compare partici-SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 3536 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerpants' hit rates against the chance hit rate of 50 percent, and a nonparametricbinomial test was used to assess theproportion of hits across all sessions. (Athird statistic was also calculated; it is said to correct for unequal frequenciesof left/right target positions withineach session.) In this instance, we arenot told how many other t-tests were carried out; if there were other tests, asis likely, this again would have requireda correction for multiple comparisons.Of course, because all the data werepooled, we have no information abouthow many participants actually scoredat a level significantly above chance. Itseems odd that this information wasnot of interest. Bem reports a significant correlation between the score on his two-itemstimulus-seeking test and psi perform-ance, but once again the effect was non-significant for \"low stimulus seekers.\"(Could it be that Bem has serendipi-tously invented a two-item scale thatpredicts psi ability?) EXPERIMENT 3: Retroactive Priming I This experiment involved a \"priming\" paradigm borrowed from contemporarypsychological research: participants in-dicate as quickly as possible whether apicture is pleasant or unpleasant, andtheir response time is measured. Just prior to the presentation of the picture,a positive or negative word (a \"prime\")is presented briefly (\"subliminally\") onthe screen. This prime has been shown to have an effect in that participantsusually respond more quickly when a positive picture is preceded by a positive word, or a negative picture is preceded by a negative word, than when picture and word are incongruent. Bem refers to this as a contrast effect. Bem has taken this procedure and changed it so that the prime is presented after the participant has responded. He reports a significant contrast effect. His data analyses are very complex, involvingtwo transformations as well as outlier 9 cutoff criteria; without access to the ac- tual data, it is difficult to evaluate the ad- equacy of the analysis. However, it is ob- vious once again that multiplecomparisons were carried out withoutany control for multiple testing. EXPERIMENT 4: Retroactive Priming II Experiment 4 is described as a replica- tion of Experiment 3 \"with one majorchange and two timing changes.\" Sim-ilar positive results were reported. Again, one would need access to all the data, including the discarded outliers, before one could properly evaluate thestated conclusions. EXPERIMENT 5: Retroactive Habituation I After the presentation of the previous four experiments, we are now informed that Experiment 5 was a pilot for the basic procedures used in the other ex- periments in this article. Why it is pre- sented as the fifth experiment is not ex- plained. The experiment employed a mere- exposure protocol 10borrowed from ex- perimental psychology, but Bem \"runsit backwards.\" The participant is pre- sented with two pictures side by side.One is the \"habituation target\" and the other is \"closely matched\" to the habit- uation target. The participant is theninstructed to indicate which picture heor she likes better. Only then is the par-ticipant repeatedly exposed, sublimi-nally, to a picture of the \"habituationtarget.\" If it turns out that the habitua- tion target is the one that was earlierchosen, this is considered a \"hit;\" it is assumed that the effect of the repeated subliminal exposure to the target after the participant had made a choice op- erated backward in time to influencethat original choice. The habituation target was chosen 53.1 percent of the time, which is reported to be significant at the .014 level one-tailed. However, once again multiple t-tests (six) are reported,which means that the actual p valuesneed to be adjusted. (Suppose that Bemhad begun with .014 as the criterionvalue; then the actual Type I error would be 12(12.014) 6=.08, which is not significant). Incidentally, Bem reports that the hit rate was significantly above chancefor women but not for men. None -theless, he also states that there was not a significant sex difference! Thoughthis seeming contradiction can arisestatistically, it is up to the researcher to make sense of it\u2014which Bem does not. EXPERIMENT 6: Retroactive Habituation II Experiment 6 is described as a replica- tion and extension of Experiment 5. Trials with erotic picture pairs were added, and it was hypothesized that the outcome for erotic pictures would be the opposite of that for the negative pictures and that the participants would prefer the habituation picture in fewer than 50 percent of the trials. Bem does not explain his reasoning. There was also another change: on the basis that men may have simply been less aroused than women by the erotic pictures in Experiment 5, thus leading them to notproduce a significant ef fect, it was de-cided to use stronger and more explicit negative and erotic images obtainedfrom Internet sites for male subjects. Men were also given the choice ofmale-male erotic images and womenthe choice of female-female erotic im- ages. (The reader will recall that thiswas also done in Experiment 1, whichwas run after Experiment 5.) Suchmatters should be investigated in fur-ther pilot studies rather than incorpo- rated into what is billed as a replication experiment. Bem also tells us that he had not yet introduced by this point his two-itemstimulus-seeking scale into his series of experiments (remember, Experiments 5 and 6 were at the beginning of this series of nine). Instead, he constructed anotherad hocscale by converting two items from Zuckerman's tion-Seeking Scale into true-false state- ments: enjoy watching many erotic scenes in movies\" and \"I prefer to datepeople who are physically exciting ratherthan people who share my values.\" He gives no reason for choosing only these statements, but he does not hesitate to treat them as a reliable and valid measure.While showing no concern for the psy- chometric properties of these two state- ments, he then arbitrarily defines onlythose who endorse both statements asSI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 36Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 37\"erotic stimulus seekers.\" Thus, an indi- vidual who enjoys \"many erotic scenes in movies\" but prefers to date people who share his/her values was not considered tobe an erotic stimulus seeker. This is purelyan ad hoc and unacceptable procedure, again suggesting a cavalier attitude about the rigors of proper experimentation. As for the data analysis, once again there were numerous t-tests withoutany control for multiple testing, therebyrendering erroneous the claimed signif- icance levels. EXPERIMENT 7: Retroactive Induction of Boredom The hit rate was not reported to be sig- nificant in this experiment. The readeris therefore spared my deliberations. EXPERIMENT 8: Retroactive Facilitation of Recall I This experiment was an attempt to test the hypothesis that the future rehearsal of a set of words can make them easier to re- call in the present. (Students would be delighted if this effect could be verified and harnessed, for they could then do fur- ther study following a difficult exam and presumably improve their performance on the examination already taken). Thedesign was simple. Participants were shown a set of words and then were testedfor their recall of the words. Subsequently,they were given practice exercises with a randomly selected subset of those words, and the hypothesis was that as a result of this subsequent practice, their perform- ance on the test (in the past, remember) would be enhanced and they would have (in the past) recalled more of the words that were practiced in the present. The participants were one hundred undergraduates. Again, they first re - sponded to the two stimulus-seeking statements. Next, forty-eight common nouns were presented serially for three seconds each. The participant was then asked to type out all the words he or she could recall. The computer then selected twenty-four words at random, and the participant was now instructed to type each of the selected words. It was hy- pothesized that these practiced wordswould turn out to be the ones that had been better recalled (before the practice). Each recalled word was deemed to be a trial and was scored as either a practice or a control word. The actual difference\u2014recall of practice wordsminus recall of control words\u2014was notanalyzed; only a weighted score was given, which was that difference multi- plied by the participant's overall score (on both practice and control words). We are told that this was done to give more weight to the scores of those par- ticipants who recalled more words. No appropriate justification is given for this awkward analysis; an analogy is drawn with the practice of weighting studiesby their sample size in a meta-analysis, but this is a spurious analogy. The ap- parently arbitrary weighting of scores, when the more direct-difference scoreswould offer less ambiguity, rendersthese findings extremely difficult to in- terpret. Making choices about data analysis after the data are collected in- troduces unacceptable opportunity for bias and allows selection of a methodthat suits one's hypothesis. Making matters more complicated, Bem then informs us that another twenty-five \"control\" sessions were run, similar to the sessions outlined above but without any practice sessions. These control sessions were interspersed among the experimental sessions. Theoverall recall of words in his control ses- sions was no different than that in theexperimental sessions, and so he con- cluded that \"the enhanced recall of practice words came at the expense of diminished recall of control words.\" Again, it was found that participants who scored low in terms of his stimulus- seeking scale scored at the chance level in the recall test, while those high in stimulus seeking scored above chance. EXPERIMENT 9: Retroactive Facilitation of Recall II This is described as a replication of Ex- periment 8, with one procedural change: a new practice exercise was introduced \"immediately following the recall test in an attempt to further enhance the recall of the practice words.\" Again, weighted scores were calculated, and on this basis a significant result was obtained. How- ever, on this \"replication,\" the stimulus- seeking questions did notcorrelate with psi success. My concerns about the data analysis in Experiment 8 similarly apply in this case. Overall, then, this is a very unsatis- factory set of experiments that does not provide us with reason to believe thatBem has demonstrated the operation of psi. All that he has produced are claims of some significant departures from chance, and these claims are flimsy given the many methodological and an- alytical problems that I have touchedon in this review. Moreover, Ray Hyman has noted (in my personalMaking choices about data analysis after the data are collected introduces unacceptable opportunity for bias and allows selection of a method that suits one's hypothesis.SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 10:59 AM Page 3738 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirercommunication with him) that the cor- relation of effect size (as well as signif-icance level) with sample size is highly significant across this set of Bem's ex-periments, but it is in the wrong direc-tion! \"Effect size,\" simply put, refers in this case to the magnitude of the dif-ference between the observed scoringrate and the chance rate. Larger sam-ples provide a better opportunity to de-tect such a difference if it is truly there,and thus effect size should increasewith increased sample size. However, inBem's experiments, the effect size cor-relates negatively (.91) with sample size, indicating that the claimed effectis smaller when the sample size is larger. Statistical power is a related concept that refers to the ability to detect an ef-fect when it is actually there. Hymannotes that while power (he uses the log of significance probability as a proxy for power) should be positively correlatedwith sample size (technically with the square root of sample size), in this series of studies the correlation is approxi- mately .80\u2014in the wrong direction once again. This raises a bright red flag and further erodes confidence with regard to the conduct of this research. * * * Having presented his nine experiments, Bem then discusses a number of general issues in parapsychology research andthen turns to quantum mechanics! Evenif one were to take his interpretation ofhis results at face value, the claimed re-sults are small and hardly justify an in-cursion into quantum mechanical theory in the pursuit of accommodation of psi phenomena within modern scientifictheory. While it may seem puzzling that this distinguished psychologist has produced such flawed research, anyone who hasread his \"Writing the Empirical JournalArticle\" (published on his website athttp://dbem.ws/WritingArticle.pdf)would not be surprised. There he pro- vides advice to students regarding the conduct of re search. A few revealing se-lections (emphasis added): Once upon a time , psychologists ob- served behaviour directly, often for sustained periods of time. No longer. Now, the higher the investigator goes up the tenure ladder, the more re- mote he or she typically becomes from the grounding observations of our science. If you are already a suc- cessful research psychologist, then you probably haven't seen a partici- pant for some time. Your graduate as- sistant assigns the running of a study to a bright young undergraduate who writes the computer program that col- lects the data automatically. And like the modern dentist, the modern psychol- ogist rarely sees the data until they havebeen cleaned by human or computer hygienists. To compensate for this remote-ness from our participants, let us at least become intimately familiar with the record of their behaviour: the data. Examine them from every angle. Analyze the sexes separately. Make up new composite indexes. If a datum suggests a new hypothesis, try to find additional evidence for it elsewhere in the data. If you see dim traces of interesting patterns, try to re- organize the data to bring them into bolder relief. If there are participants you don't like, or trials, observers, orinterviewers who gave you anomalous results, drop them (temporarily). Go on a fishing expedition for some- thing\u2014anything\u2014interesting. ... When you are through exploring, you may conclude that the data are not strong enough to justify your in- sights formally, but at least you are now ready to design the 'right' study.... Alternatively, the data may be strong enough to justify re-centering your article around the new findings and subordinating or even ignoring your original hypotheses.... Your overriding purpose is to tell the world what you have learned from your study. If your research results sug- gest a compelling framework for theirpresentation, adopt it and make the most instructive findings your center- piece. Think of your data set as a jewel. Your task is to cut and polish it, to select the facets to highlight, and to craft the best setting for it. Many experienced authors write the results section first . But before writing anything, An- alyze Your Data! Reflections of this advice appear to be writ large throughout Bem's research article. * * * The publication of this set of experi- ments will serve no one well. Para - psychology is not honored by having this paper accepted by a mainstream psy-chology journal. Neither does Bem's paper serve the public well, for it only adds to confusion about the scientific case for the existence of psi. And it doesno service to the reputation of the Jour- nal of Personality and Social Psychology. Al though Bem has failed to demon- strate the existence of mysterious intel- lectual powers that defy the normal con- straints of time and space, there seem nonetheless to have been mysterious in- tellectual powers at play here. I refer toWe have toured the laboratory; we have found the dirty test tubes and the mislabeled vials; we have observed inappropriate methodology and analysis. We have lost confidence in the chemist, and there seems little need to poke about further.

My discussion is based on the pre-publica- tion version of Professor Bem's article that ap - pears on his website at www.dbem.ws/Feeling Future.pdf. 2. The p value is the likelihood of having con- cluded that there is a significant effect when in fact there is not. The lower the p value, the less likely it is that the null hypothesis (that there is no effect) is true. 3. Meta-analysis is a statistical process for test- ing the combined results of a number of studies that were based on similar research hypotheses. 4. The t-test is a statistical test typically used either to compare two means or to compare a mean with a theoretical expectation\u2014for exam- ple, to assess the difference between an observed average success rate and a hypothetical chance rate of 50 percent. 5. A Type I error occurs when the null hypoth- esis (that there is no effect) is rejected when it is in fact true. 6. In a two-tailed test, one assesses the data to see whether they significantly differ from what would be expected by chance in either direction, that is, whether they are greater than or less than what would be expected by chance alone. When we say that something is significant at the .01 level two-tailed, this means that we would expect these results to occur by chance alone only 1 per- cent of the time. But, given that either above- chance or below-chance results are considered to be meaningful, this 1 percent must be distributed in both directions. Thus, above-chance results would be significant at the .01 level (two-tailed) only if they are so extreme that they would be ex- pected to occur by chance half of 1 percent, or 0.5 percent, of the time or less. The same would apply for below-chance results. With a one-tailed test , one also assesses the data to see whether they significantly differ from what would be expected by chance but in only one direction, that is, whether they are either greater than expected by chance or less than ex- pected by chance, but not both. A one-tailed testis properly used if one has good reason to predict the direction of the data in advance. Again, using the example of the .01 level, for a one-tailed testthe data only need be extreme enough that theywould be expected by chance alone 1 percent of the time or less (compared to 0.5 percent with a two-tailed test). This makes it much easier to claim statistical significance. Parapsychologists normally employ two- tailed tests because results that are either signifi- cantly above chance or significantly below chanceare taken to reflect psi. Although Bem indicatesthat he predicted that the erotic pictures would lead to above-chance scoring, which could justify using a one-tailed test, what would he have done had the participants scored at a below-chance rate that would have been significant had he predicted that the results would indeed be below chance? Apparently committed to a one-tailed test and having made only the above-chance prediction, he properly would have had to ignore those data\u2014something that parapsychologists do not want to do. By using two-tailed tests, parapsy-chologists avoid the problem and also avoid any suspicion of having changed the direction of their prediction after having examined the data. 7. The Bonferroni t-test is a modified t-test that adjusts for the number of tests being carried out so that the overall likelihood that one of them produces significance by chance alone is kept at a specified level, such as 5 percent. 8. A nonparametric binomial test deals with data divided into two categories and examines thestatistical significance of deviations from a theo- retically expected distribution. It is referred to as \"nonparametric\" because it does not rely on the parameters of a distribution, such as the mean. 9. An outlier is a datum that is numerically distant from all the other data in the sample, ei- ther as a result of measurement error or becausethe data are not distributed in the manner that was assumed. 10. Mere-exposure protocol is a research ap- proach in which participants' responses are as- sessed with the assumption that having simply been exposed (perhaps subliminally) to a stimulus object will cause an effect.

The resulting \"find- ings\" of such misleading or erroneous studies are often hyped by news mediaon the day they are reported or pub-lished without any additional, carefulanalysis. Worst of all, it sometimes takes decades to overturn these false results\u2014 to find and report the truth (Spectorand Vesell 2006; Spector 2009). How and why does this happen? Background For decades we have understood how to perform medical and nutritional ex- periments that test a hypothesis. Good science classifies, explains, and predicts phenomena. Great emphasis is placedon testable cause-and-effect relation-ships. To do good science, a series of standard assumptions must be made (e.g., there is a mind-independentworld; there is regularity in nature; thewell-documented past can predict the future; and so on). We all believe the unprovable notion that the sun will rise tomorrow. These assumptions must be made within the \"hard\" sciences, such as physics and chemistry, in which neces- sary and sufficient causes for effects have been discovered that have led to the es- tablishment of nomological principles (laws of nature). Standard assumptions are also necessary in medical and nutri- tional research, much of which (unlikeresearch in chemistry and physics) must establish contributory causality because multiple \"causes\" often exist for one ef-fect. Due to the nature of medical sci- ence, probability theory and sound sta- tistical methods are often required toestablish causality. (See Spector and Vesell 2006 and Spec tor 2009 for a moredetailed ac count of these points.) Methodologically, to find the truth in medical and nutritional research ingeneral, the investigator must generate a hypothesis. This can be done by intu-ition an d/or genius (as in the cases of Einstein and Newton); more com- monly, a hypothesis results from care- fully analyzing existing data, observing experiments of nature (that is, sponta- neous biological abnormalities in peo- ple), making an analogy with a similar situation, or other means. It is criticalSeven Deadly Medical Hypotheses Many medical hypotheses have been ill-conceived and/or inadequately tested. As a consequence, billions of dollars have been wasted and the public harmed. REYNOLD SPECTOR Achronic scandal plagues the medical and nutritional literature (Spector and Vesell 2006; Spector 2009): much of what is published is erroneous, pseudosci- entific, or worse. Two major factors account for a large portion of this problem. First, many medical and nutri- tional hypotheses are ill-conceived (Spector 2009). Sec- ond, the methods used to test hypotheses are often epis- temologically unsound (Spector 2009). Moreover, the same unsound methods are often repeated multiple times on the same tired hypotheses with the same incorrect re- sults. In such studies\u2014which may look superficially ade- quate to the unsophisticated reader\u2014complex data are collected and displayed, pseudo-statistical analyses are per- formed, and erroneous conclusions are drawn and extrap- olated to the general public.SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 40Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 41in medical and nutritional research that the generated hypothesis has biologicalplausibility. After a plausible hypothesis is gen- erated, deductions and predictions canbe made from the hypothesis. Then sci-entific attempts are made (e.g., throughproperly controlled experiments) to fal-sify or verify the deductions and predic-tions\u2014and secondarily to falsify or ver-ify the hypothesis. In general,falsification is more convincing thanverification (Spector and Vesell 2006). Let's look at an example of superior medical hypothesis testing. After years ofinconclusive epidemiology/observationstudies (for reasons discussed below), ascientific test of the cholesterol hypoth- esis (\"High cholesterol is a contributory cause of heart disease and stroke\") wasfinally performed by the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) Group(1994). The tested statement (deducedfrom the above hypothesis) was that \"Ifyou lower cholesterol with a safe drug,you will save lives.\" In the 4S study,4,444 coronary heart disease patientswith high cholesterol were randomlyassigned to receive daily simvastatin(now an inexpensive generic drug thatgreatly lowers total plasma cholesterol)or a placebo. Death was the primaryendpoint. The study was \"blinded\": nei- ther the patient nor the investigator (or even the sponsor) knew which patientswere taking the drug or which weretaking the placebo until the study wascompleted. After about five years, one-third fewer patients who took simvas- tatin were dead (p < .001). This trialconclusively established that simvas- tatin saved lives, and it was consistent with (but did not prove) the notion that high cholesterol was \"causally\" related to death due to heart disease and stroke. It is critical to note that in this exem- plary study there was only one depend-ent variable (whether the patient was taking simvastatin or placebo) and one primary outcome (alive or dead\u2014an endpoint that is clear and unarguable). Opera tionally, the primary endpoint was determined in all patients: a veryrare phenomenon in clinical research. The 4S study's results are an example of the power of the hypothetical/deductive method. In trials such as the4S study, which was randomized,blinded, controlled, adequately powered (that is, based on enough human sub-jects to yield a meaningful experimental result [Spector 2009]), and representa- tive of the to-be-treated population, re-sults can then be (and were) extra polated to similar patients with heart disease.However, because of the mortality data from the 4S study and the nature of contributory causality (that is, many fac- tors influence death due to cardiovascu- lar disease), we can only say prospectively that if a patient takes simvastatin, he hasabout a one-third less risk of dying over a five-year period (on average, for an in-dividual heart-disease patient with high cholesterol). In other words, there are sometimes multiple \"causes\" of an effect;manipulation of a single cause can behelpful overall but is not the whole story. In short, the hypothetical/deductive method, when applied, has systemati- cally and conclusively answered many questions (hypotheses) in clinical med-icine and human nutrition. Thismethod is the standard that the FDAdemands for new drug licensure. Unfortunately, too many published studies fail to adhere to these high sci-entific standards and therefore lead to faulty, and even dangerous, conclusions. In what follows, I will indicate the seven deadly hypotheses in this bold type. Deadly Hypothesis One Over the past fifty years, multiple in- vestigators have argued that you don't need to follow the hypothetical/deduc- tive method to find the truth. Either the investigator does not need a spe-cific hypothesis and/or can use an inad-equate method to test the hypothesis (Glass and Hall 2008). One of the best examples of inade- quate methodology is the use of epi- demiology/observation studies to verify or falsify causal hypotheses when con-tributory causality is postulated (Spec - tor and Vesell 2006; Spector 2009). Epi-demiology/observation studies are oftentermed case-control studies (which are retrospective) or cohort studies (which are prospective). Such studies are some- times used to test a hypothesis (e.g., \"Postmeno pausal women who take hor- mone replacement therapy [HRT] haveless cardiovascular disease than women who do not\" [see deadly hypothesis two]). However, a fundamental problem with the epidemiology/observation ap-proach is that control subjects and ex-perimental subjects are not randomized, The resulting \"findings\" of such misleading or erroneous studies are often hyped by news media on the day they are reported or published without any additional, careful analysis.SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 4142 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerwhich often leads to unknown bias (prejudicial error on the part of the re- searcher) and confounding (a problem that can occur when more than one ex- perimental variable is in play)\u2014withsubsequent erroneous results. More over,statistics are often misapplied to suchdata, meaning that data often do notmeet the basic assumptions necessary for statistical analysis (see Spector andVesell 2006 and Spector 2009 for moredetails). I will present examples of erroneous conclusions based on epidemiology/ob- servation studies and then describethem in more detail. Because such stud-ies often lead to unreliable conclusions,the FDA will generally not accept suchstudies for drug licensure. Another example of studies in which there is a lack of a specific hypothesis isthe currently popular genome-wide as- sociation studies, or GWAS (Pearsonand Manolio 2008). Such studies as-sume that in common diseases such asAlzheimer's and heart disease, there aremultiple \"abnormal\" genes that \"cause\"these diseases. If researchers \"fish\" in the genome, they will find the \"causative\"genes. How ever, these investigators ig-nore the strong possibility of epigenetic, developmental, environmental, or otherpotential causes of disease (e.g., gene- environment interactions or the possi-bility that the GWAS approach is inca- pable of finding the truth). It could even be that the problem lies in the regulationof gene function or the introns of genes\u2014which GWAS will not find. Hence, GWAS are probably too sim- plistic and, as I note below, generally fail. Investigators using the GWAS ap - proach eschew the hypothetical/de - ductive randomized approach be causethey assume that they can survey the en-tire genome efficiently and find scribing GWAS, we should briefly re viewcertain basic facts about the humangenome (HG). The HG is composed ofmore than three billion bases, which con- tain approximately 22,000 genes. Thesegenes in turn code for more than 100,000different proteins. Less than five percentof the HG codes for the production of human genes. Approximately 0.1 percent(about twenty million) of the bases vary in humans from individual to individual. These are called single nucleotide polymor- phisms(SNP). Approximately one to four million common SNP can be measuredin GWAS. Many assumptions are necessary for GWAS to work. I briefly summarize these assumptions and the GWASmethodology in table 1 (Pearson andManolio 2008; Psychiatric GWAS Con- sortium Coordinating Committee 2009). Each assumption is fraught with poten- tial or actual problems. Moreover, unlike in other approaches, GWAS cannot de- tect rare SNP or small genetic deletions or amplifications. Exemplifying the pit-falls of using this nonrandomized ap- proach, investigators sometimes find SNP in patients (but not control sub-jects) in areas of the genome that have no genes, or an \"abnormal gene\" is some- times identified (e.g., the FTOgene that \"causes\" obesity). In the case of FTO, however, \"knockout\" mice missing the FTOgene were made, and surprisingly these mice were perfectly normal (Psy- chiatric GWAS Consortium Coordinat-ing Committee 2009)! are noted in Pear-son and Manolio 2008. On balance, notwithstanding the great optimism of several years ago, the GWAS method has been a disappoint- ment. An immense amount of time andmoney has been spent, but there havebeen no robust genetic findings in ei- ther Alzheimer's or heart disease; the GWAS method must now be consid- ered a failure (Couzin-Frankel 2010;Pedersen 2010). The general approach of \"It's in the genes and GWAS shouldfind it\" has not succeeded. After all this expensive negative experimentation, the causes of Alzheimer's and heart diseasecould still be genetic. GWAS have alsobeen employed to test how certaindrugs work (e.g., lithium in manic-de- pressive psychosis). As ex pected, withno up-front hypothesis and dubious methodology, the results have been fruitless (Perlis et al. 2009). In summary, the high hopes (hype) for GWAS\u2014which was expressed soonafter the HG was sequenced about ten years ago\u2014have not yet translated into much progress (with a few exceptions)(Le Fanu 2010). GWAS need to be re-placed by direct sequencing of the por- tions of the genome of interest, compar- ing patients with proper control subjects. This work can and should be done. As I have noted, it is entirely pos- sible that non-genetic causes are re- Table 1 Methods and Assumptions in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) 1) One can measure accurately approximately one or more million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in an individual. 2) Specific SNP segregate (travel) with abnormal genes (this is termed linkage disequilibrium). 3) Patients can be fruitfully compared with controls using GWAS, although the subjects are not randomized; SNP associated with abnormal genes can be found in patients but not control subjects. 4) Accurate data can be obtained.5) Because there are many (approximately 50,000) false positives per individual in GWAS at a p < .05 significance level, complex statistical methods must be employed.The nonrandomized nature of the comparisons makes the statistical analysis even more problematic. 6) The results can be repeated in other patient and control-subject populations.7) After the abnormal SNP is located, the abnormal gene in the genetic neighborhood can be located.Table 1 Methods and Assumptions in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)SI Mar Apr 11 final_SI new design masters 1/26/11 2:12 PM Page 42Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 43sponsible for the diseases that have thus far been studied with GWAS. Deadly Hypothesis Two Advocating the widespread use of post- menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen andprogestin was a serious error. This ad- vocacy was based, in part, on erroneousepidemiology/observation studies. Tak-ing advantage of these (now known tobe erroneous) data, the pharmaceutical industry instituted heavy advertisingcampaigns for HRT products. Let's re-view the background information andhypothesis. Menopausal women stop secreting estrogen and progesterone, two hor-mones associated with youth and fertil-ity. The hypothesis was that if women replace these missing hormones post-menopausally with HRT, they will re-main \"youthful\" and not suffer fromheart disease, dementia, vaginal dry-ness, hot flashes, and fractured bones.To maintain this effect, the patientmust take HRT indefinitely. The pro-ponents of this hypothesis ignored thewell-documented fact that estrogen is acarcinogen that causes breast cancersthat kill women (Chlebowski et al.2010). This HRT hypothesis was tested in over one hundred nonrandomized case-control and cohort studies. In stances ofhealth problems such as heart attack,stroke, blood clots, fractures, and so forth were compared in the womentaking estrogen (and progestin, a syn-thetic form of progesterone) against women not taking HRT. Based onthese (biased) studies, false claims were made that HRT protected against car- diovascular disease and dementia.However, it turned out that HRT did protect against fractures and post- menopausal symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, vaginal dryness) and that HRT caused a 25 percent increase in invasive breast cancer, a finding later confirmed in the controlled, scientific trials (Chle - bowski et al. 2010). Unfortunately the investigators ig - nored the fact that epidemi ology/obser -vation studies cannot reliably establish causality unless they satisfy the rigorousHill criteria (Spector and Vesell 2006; Spector 2009). The arestandard, accepted criteria to establishcausality in epidemiology/obser vationstudies. Moreover, statistics cannot be applied to epidemiology/ observation studies because they are not randomized and therefore don't satisfy the assump- tions for proper statistical analysis. Fi-nally, why would an investigator, in ad- vance, expect postmenopausal women who take HRT to be the same in all other respects as women who do not take HRT (a basic assumption of the epidemiol- ogy/observation studies)? Thought ful ob- servers would guess that women who take HRT are more health conscious. As might be expected, bias and confoundinginvalidated most of the findings of thesestudies, although (as indicated above) afew findings turned out to be correct. The FDA, Dr. Bernadine Healy (as director of the National Institutes of Health [NIH], 1991-93), and othersdid not accept these optimistic claimsfor HRT based on epidemiology/ observation studies. In stead, a group in California, along with the NIH, initi- ated proper large, prospective, random-ized, blinded, controlled trials (Banks and Canfell 2009; Prentice et al. 2009). The results clearly showed that HRT was harmful overall. HRT did decreasepostmenopausal symptoms and frac-tures, but it increased risks of cardiovas-cular disease (including stroke), invasivecancer of the breast (by about 25 per- cent [Chlebowski et al. 2010]), and probably dementia. Based on HRT useand a 25 percent increase in breast can- cer, this generally unnecessary use of HRT caused approximately 5,000 moredeaths per year from breast cancer(Chlebowski et al. 2010). (As an aside, in legal challenges the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the notion that HRTcauses breast cancer.) There is now abroad consensus, based on controlledstudies, that HRT should not be usedby postmenopausal women for chronic disease prevention; instead, HRT should be used only for short-term sup-pression of severe postmenopausal symptoms at the lowest effective dose. This is a flagrant example of the harm done by straying from the princi- ples of the hypothetical/deductive ap -proach and sound clinical science. It took over twenty years to correct this error, and in the process many women were harmed. Deadly Hypothesis Three Vitamins A through E are essential di- etary substances. Required quantities are suggested in the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs). However, in several situations, more may be needed (e.g., in the elderly, who often require more of vi- tamins B12 and D, and in people withcertain rare disorders [Spector 2009]). Based on analogy arguments, some in- vestigators suggest that if small dosages of vitamins are good for humans, very large doses (megavitamin therapy)would be better for everyone. These vi- tamins include vitamins C and E and the B vitamins. (High doses of vitamin A and D are very toxic.) In megavitamin therapy, the dose is at least ten times larger than the RDA. This general hypothesis does not have biological plausibility because thehuman body has very efficient homeo- static systems that keep tissue vitamin levels constant. I pointed this out to Linus Pauling in a 1977 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. At that time, Pauling believed that megavitamin therapy with vitamin C im proved cog- nitive function. I observed that it is not possible to more than double the plasma level of vitamin C, even with gramquantities of oral vitamin C; the RDA is 60 milligrams (Spector 1977). Second, a doubling of the plasma level will increase the brain concentration of vitamin C byless than 10 percent. Pauling accepted this and abandoned the argument that vitamin C improves mental functioning, but many others did not. In fact, a vast megavitamin industry has sprung up to satisfy the unscientificdemand for megavitamin amounts of B,C, and E. As I and others have pointed out, the epidemiology/observation stud-SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 434 4 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquireries suggesting that vitamins B, C, and E are beneficial in preventing heart disease,cancer, and dementia were subsequently disproved in huge well-controlled scien- tific trials (Spector 2009). Recently,megavitamin E was shown not to pre-vent cataracts after over ten years of use (Christen et al. 2008). A similar hypothesis (again based on erroneous epidemiology/observationstudies) is that megavitamins B6, folate(B9), and B12 taken in combination lower the homocysteine blood level andthus prevent cardiovascular disease andstroke. Multiple controlled trials of this hypothesis have been performed in peo-ple with and without an elevated homo- cysteine blood level. Although there wasa decrease in plasma homocysteine level,there was no beneficial effect on cardio-vascular disease and stroke in healthypeople (House et al. 2010). There wasno obvious harmful effect in healthysubjects either. However, in renal-failurepatients, whose homeostatic systemscannot control plasma vitamin levelswell, there were further declines in renalfunction and more heart attacks, strokes,and deaths in the megavitamin group(p<.04) (House et al. 2010). Because many elderly people (over age sixty-five)have decreased renal function, megavit-amin B therapy is probably also risky for them. Megavitamins B, C, and E shouldcarry warnings discouraging their use bypatients with renal failure and those over sixty-five until there is convincingevidence of benefit. In summary, megavitamin therapytested in properly controlled trials eitherdoes nothing or is harmful (with a fewwell-defined exceptions) (Spector 2009; House et al. 2010). The hypothesis was never biologically plausible, and the re- sults are clear. The epidemiology/observation studies were once again misleading. Disproving the mega - vitamin hypotheses has cost hundredsof millions of dollars; even worse, the public's current widespread use of theseworthless preventatives runs into bil- lions of dollars. Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence that it is harm-ful or useless, megavitamin therapy is still widely used. Why? The psycholog- ical, commercial, and historical reasons are multiple and very complex, due inpart to the constant recycling of old, in-correct data (Spector 2009). In my view, Congress should give the FDA the au-thority to regulate or prohibit the sale ofworthless, or in some cases even harm- ful, supplements. Convincing the publicnot to use worthless supplements is likesuccessfully cutting off all of a hydra'sheads at once\u2014it is not possible unless you are a Hercules. Deadly Hypothesis Four Many doctors incorrectly believe that screening tests beyond the standard medical examination 1are necessary for identifying disease or the risk of disease in apparently healthy, asymptomaticadults.Common sense argues strongly for this hypothesis. But the evidence for it is weak. Only a few tests have withstood thechallenges of experimentation and time (e.g., the Pap test for cervical cancer, colonoscopy). For example, forty years ago, it was recommended that all adultshave an annual chest X-ray examina- tion, a bad idea now abandoned. More recently, all men over age forty were urged to have a prostate-specific anti- gen (PSA) test to screen for prostatecancer. However, careful studies have suggested that such screening does more harm than good (Spector 2010). In fact, in a recent New York Times edi- torial (Ablin 2010), the discoverer of the PSA test vituperatively arguedagainst the utility of PSA screening forprostate cancer, consistent with my ear-lier arguments (Spector 2010). Even the use of mammography for breast-cancer screening is not without its critics and skeptics (Kalager et al.2010). Although it is often true that early detection of breast cancer is useful, approximately 62,000 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS) are discovered every year in the United States, espe-cially in older women (Spector 2010). In more than 50 percent of these cases, the lesion will not progress and does not need more than simple treatment (e.g.,clinical biopsy or long-term follow-up observation). However, we do not know which patients to treat vigorously, so al- most all women with DCIS are cur- rently treated with surgery and/or radi-ation, and some of them are givenchemotherapy. This means that about30,000 women per year are unnecessar- ily treated. How ever, all things consid- ered, on balance, mammography every other year is probably reasonable. Wemust figure out who with DCIS doesn't need treatment and who does (Kalager et al. 2010). In the past several years, certain commercial laboratories have begun tooffer genetic screening to identify dis- ease risk in adults (Offit 2008). These tests include GWAS, sequencing thegenome, testing for \"known\" SNP (e.g., breast and prostate cancer), or testing for paternity and family relationships. Some companies even suggest products or recommendations for skin, nutri- tional, or body-weight concerns using Table 2 Problems with Genetic Screening 1) Validation and accuracy of methods are often unknown, causing a problem of false positives 2) Lack of regulatory oversight 3) May reveal a very small risk (in most cases) of developing the disease (e.g., Crohn's disease) 4) Even if risk is discovered, there may be no effective intervention5) Cost of testing6) Unproven utility of pharmacogenetic testing, even if convincing differences are found7) Psychological damage in some cases8) Inability for even experts to interpret some tests 9) Commercial laboratories are profit driven in a direct-to-consumer approach\u2014in many cases, no physician or health professional orders the testTable 2 Problems with Genetic ScreeningSI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 44Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 45proprietary SNP panels. These screen- ing tests are offered direct-to-consumer in many cases. I show the multiple problems asso- ciated with genetic screening in table 2 (Pearson and Manolio 2008). Ofcourse, to be useful such testing mustprovide information above and beyondthat provided in the patient's history,physical exam, and standard laboratorytests. Take one of the best argumentsfor genetic testing\u2014that it helps detectthe risk of Crohn's disease, which oc- curs in 0.2 percent of the population.Those with high-risk genes have lessthan a 4 percent chance of developingthis disease (Ioannidis 2009). Moreover,there is nothing you can do to prevent Crohn's. So why bother? However, there are a few people (e.g., women who are at high risk for breast cancer)for whom genetic screening is usefuland does affect treatment (Offit 2008). Another hyped form of genetic test- ing is pharmacogenetic testing (see table2) used to improve drug prescribing and outcomes. Take the best example of adrug where pharmacogenetic testing hassupposedly benefited patients: the part because differentindividuals metabolize the drug differ-ently based on genetic differences. How-ever, even knowing the genetic dif fer encesthrough screening doesn't improve theaccuracy of warfarin prescriptions in acost-effective way (Ioannidis 2009). One editorialist noted that when all of these issues are thoughtfully evalu-ated, genetic testing (screening) is \"toolimited, too expensive, and too soon\" (Ioannidis 2009). Deadly Hypothesis Five Many erroneously believe that manipu- lating one's nutrition can prevent cancer. Specifically, the claim is made that a high dietary intake of vegetables, fruits, fiber, and folate can prevent cancer, es- pecially bowel cancer. In retrospect, this hypothesis does not seem plausible be- cause many populations (e.g., those innorthern countries) do not eat many fruits, vegetables, and fiber yet do not suffer from an increased incidence ofcancers. How ever, more than one hun- dred epidemiology/observation studies(mainly case-control studies in the 1970s and '80s) seemed to support this hypothesis. Cancer rates were as much as 50 percent higher (in those persons who eschewed fruits, vegetables, and fiber) in some studies (Willet 2010). These flawed studies formed the basis of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) 1991 \"5-A-Day\" program to in - crease the average American consump-tion of fruits and vegetables to five ormore servings per day. The NCI also initiated a (fruitless) search for the \"pro- tective\" phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables (Willet 2010). However, more recent and careful nutritional research using randomized methodology or careful, large cohort trials have debunked this hypothesis (Willet 2010; Spector 2009). There is no sound evidence that five or more daily servings of fruits and vegetables,large amounts of fiber, or supplementalfolate prevent cancer. Here we have parts of the U.S. government (e.g., U.S.Department of Agri culture [USDA]and the NCI) proposing erroneous ad-vice based on outrageously poor science.(Fortu nately, the FDA has higher stan-dards.) The consequence of such advice is that people think they are reducing their risk of cancer by eating lots of fruits and vegetables, fiber, and folate, but they are not. The final irony is that (so far) no cancer-preventing phytochemicals have been found in fruits and vegetables: the search for them was doomed because it was based on faulty epidemiology/obser-vation studies (Willet 2010). Currently, there are new claims that a high intake of fruits and vegetables protects against heart disease (Daucher et al. 2006). Once again, these claims are based on nonrandomized epidemi- ology/observation studies. These datado not satisfy the Hill criteria for causality and must be taken as\u2014atbest\u2014hypothesis generating, not fact. Moreover, there is evidence for publi- cation bias; only the positive studies arepublished (Daucher et al. 2006). Untilproper scientific studies are done, these claims must be considered at best un- proven. Deadly Hypothesis Six Personalized medicine will greatly ad- vance medical care (Woodcock 2007). By personalized medicine , I mean a method to prevent, diagnose, and/or Table 3 Treatments That Work Disease Mode* Drug Class Mode of ActionGeneric Example 1\u00b0 2\u00b0 Rx Heart disease, Yes Yes \u2014 Statins Uncertain Simvastatin stroke High blood Yes Yes Yes Multiple Specific Multiple pressureFractures Yes Yes \u2014 Bisphosphonates Specific AlendronateStomach Yes Yes Yes Proton pump Specific Omeprazole ulcers inhibitor (PPI) Over fifteen Yes \u2014\u2014 Vaccines Specific Multiple infectious diseases *1\u00b0 means primary prevention (prevents initial manifestation of disease); 2\u00b0 means secondary prevention (prevents recurrence of disease); Rx means treatment.

In the case of statins, it is uncertain whether reduction in plasma cholesterol is responsible for the drugs' efficacy.Table 3 Treatments That WorkSI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:31 AM Page 4546 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirertreat an individual patient with newer, non-routine methods to increase thechance of medical success (e.g., by usinggenomic tests). In fact, there is often great variability in patients' responses tocertain diseases and treatments. This issue complicates treatment and prog-nosis. As such, personalized medicine isbeing developed to focus more on theindividual patient (in terms of diagnosis,treatment, prognosis, and in many casesprevention), versus the medicine that iscurrently practiced. Can we anticipatewhich patients are susceptible to a dis-ease and intervene to stop it? Can wedirect an individual patient to a specificoptimal therapy? Can we select patientsfor treatment who have a better or worse prognosis? Before attempting to fix the current medical system (not ignoring the deliv-ery of health care, which is currently broken), we need to analyze briefly thecurrent state of diagnosis, therapy, prog-nosis, and prevention to see what is bro-ken. Since World War II, there have been steady advances in many aspects ofmedicine\u2014especially diagnosis, treat-ment, and prevention. The success of vaccines to prevent scourges is nothingshort of miraculous. Let's focus on fivemodern useful treatments, including preventive measures such as vaccines (table 3). We understand the diseasesand their therapies in table 3 quite wellon a causal or a phenomenological level.Vaccines and proton pump inhibitors(PPI) work in drugs, statins, and bisphosphonates also workphysiologically or biochemically in al- most all compliant patients. In fact, with vaccines and PPI, the physician could not do much better if he had a magic wand. Moreover, not only do thesedrugs work in essentially everyone, but most patients require only standard doses or a few injections with little titra-tion. The drugs and vaccines listed intable 3 are safe, and the physician doesnot need to worry about drug absorp- tion, metabolism, or excretion. In short,the benefits are enormous and the risk is minimal. In fact, vaccines have essen- tially eliminated many individual dis- eases and classes of diseases (e.g., polio, hepatitis A and B) in all those who are vaccinated. We don't need more person-alized medicine with such treatments, though we do need to continue effortsto reach out to those who refuse to vac- cinate their children. To make major ad-ditional progress, we require a better un- derstanding of the causes of disease and their mechanisms, such as in heart dis-ease and high blood pressure. Where clinical medicine has ab jectly failed is in the therapy of cancer and the major brain diseases (e.g., dementias,psychotic disorders). Except for surgeryto remove tumors, which sometimes has curative results, we don't understand how to treat most adult cancers effec- tively (Spector 2010). Similarly, theaforementioned brain diseases are treated symptomatically, often with poor results. Can more personalized medicine greatly improve the current situation?Proponents say that improvementscould be made in several areas (see table4). I concur that small improvementscould be made in some of those areas. In fact, modest improvements have al-ready been made in sub-classifying pa- tients (such as those with breast cancerand certain lymphomas) in terms ofprognosis and therapy. Indeed, there ispotential to better rationalize drugtherapy by increasing the prescribing ofgenerics and using computerized sys-tems, but these are not really products of personalized medicine. Furthermore,we need more comparative scientific evaluations of screening and treatment methods. However, so far, personalized medi- cine (e.g., genetic testing and genetic forecasting in predicting drug metabo-lism in an individual patient) has only been shown to be cost effective in a fewwell-defined situations (e.g., certain very- high-risk mutations in breast cancer), asnoted previously (Offit 2008). More over,many of the current personalized moni-toring methods in individual patients are known to be less than ideal (e.g., moni-toring of tumor size after chemotherapy, because changes in tumor size may have no relationship to patient survival). For example, in some people with lung can- cer, the drug gefitinib causes impressive, indeed remarkable, shrinkage of the tu- mors, but these patients do not live anylonger than those who had not taken gefitinib (Woodcock 2007). Thus, in many cases tumor shrinkage per seis not a good marker of a patient's overall re- sponse. A good therapy should meaning- fully prolong life and improve the qualityof life at a reasonable cost. We clearlyneed better markers and treatments for cancer. The important truth is that many of these problematic situations in medicine occur due to either ignorance or the factthat general improvements in the health care delivery system are needed, not alack of personalized medicine. For example, when we better understand cancer, we will be able to intervene ration ally. Personalized medicine is notthe long-term answer. Attempting to im prove marginal therapies for individ- ual patients (Spector 2010) has littlelong-term potential compared to the successful revolutionary changes shown in prevention and treatment (e.g., vac- cines and PPI [see table 3]). Deadly Hypothesis Seven From a cancer-patient population and public health perspective, cancer chemo - therapy (chemo) has been a major med-ical advance. This hypothesis is false. 1) Subgrouping of patients (e.g., male and female, old and young) 2) Drug metabolism and disposition (genetic basis) 3) Disease subsets (e.g., breast cancer, asthma) 4) Monitoring response (e.g., the drug gefitinib in lung cancer) 5) Quality of prescribing (use of generics) 6) Effectiveness studies7) Genetic forecasting Table 4 Potential Areas for Improvement in Medical CareSI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 46Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 47Two hundred thousand more Americans die of cancer every year today than in 1974, three years after the war on cancer was launched by President Nixon and Congress (see Spector 2010). In fact, the major positive cancer news is that lungcancer has declined appreciably because of the decline in smoking; stomach can- cer in the United States has also declined dramatically for unknown reasons. Of course, there have been a few very successful chemotherapy (and ra- diation) treatments (e.g., for choriocar- cinoma, testicular cancer, Hodgkin's disease), but these patients make uponly a small fraction of cancer patients(Spector 2010). In fact, when age- andsex-matched populations are consid-ered, the average cancer patient is only 5 percent better off now than in 1950 (Spector 2010). The hypothesis behind current can- cer chemotherapy is deeply flawed.How can we expect these drugs, most of which are nonspecific cellular poisons, to kill only wily cancer cells and notnormal cells? In fact, cancer chemother- apy routinely kills bone marrow and the cell lining of the gastrointestinal tract,with very distressing (indeed sometimes fatal) side effects. From a population perspective, there has been relatively lit- tle lengthening of life. Physician David Nathan compares cancer chemotherapy to \"carpet bombing,\" a harsh but apt de-scription (Spec tor 2010). However, it cannot be denied that there are a few populations for which chemotherapy is marvelously effective, as noted above, and must be used. Even the newer, so-called \"targeted\" chemotherapy drugs often have dis- tressing and sometimes fatal side effects (Spector 2010). When one dispassion- ately weighs the minimal prolongation of \"good\" life in patients with metastatic cancer (e.g., lung, pancreas, brain, colon, breast) versus the very distressing side effects of chemotherapy with \"targeted\" drugs, the case is close.Are a few addi-tional months of life, on the average, worth the often terrible price in dollars and side effects in so many cases? It isextremely distressing that we are unable to repeat even the marginal benefits of some of these drugs (e.g., the very ex-pensive and toxic drug bevacizumab [Avastin]) in larger repeat clinical trials(Ioannidis and Karassa 2010). It is ab- solutely clear that we need a better un-derstanding of cancer before real progress is possible (Varmus 2010). Conclusion Modern medical science has overcome many incorrect hypotheses and harmful practices, including prayer for disease, phlebotomy for fever, and insulin-coma therapy for schizophrenia. We knowfrom bitter experience that unproven hy- potheses should be tested and proven before they are widely deployed; this is the standard of the FDA, which gener- ally requires at least two large random-ized, controlled studies before approving a drug for marketing. The FDA's rigor-ous approach has stood the test of time. Over the past seventy-five years, sci- entific hypothesis-testing has been con-tinuously refined with ad vances inprobability theory, biostatistics, and the subsequent extrapolation of results to large groups. More over, because it em-ploys the three philosophical criteria for truth (correspondence, coherence, andpragmatic theories), the hypothetical/de- ductive method used in medical science has been wildly successful (Spector and Vesell 2006).As I've noted, many of the danger- ous consequences of these seven erro-neous hypotheses and the waste of the vast quantity of resources used to dis- prove them could have been avoided if the hypothetical/deductive method hadbeen applied rigorously. In addition, there are several reasons for calling the above seven hypotheses \"deadly.\" First, for example, in the case of HRT use by postmenopausal women, a deadly hy - pothesis led to an increased incidence of heart disease, stroke, and fatal breast cancer with no countervailing benefit. Second, in the case of nutritional inter- ventions that do not prevent disease,such hypotheses give patients a false sense of reassurance and often prevent them from taking more effective meas- ures. Third, in the case of false beliefsbased on erroneous hypotheses, these beliefs often prevent progress or cause the scientific establishment to chase shadows instead of culprits (e.g., phy-tochemicals in fruits and vegetables toprevent cancer). Finally, the truth isvaluable in itself; from bitter experience, we know that the truth \"pays.\" However, many centrifugal forces work against the hypothetical/deduc-tive approach. These forces include the overuse of easy-to-perform epidemiol- ogy/observation studies, which\u2014being nonrandomized\u2014are oftenyield incorrect results (Spector andIn many cases tumor shrinkage per se is not a good marker of a patient's overall response. A good therapy should meaningfully prolong life and improve the quality of life at a reasonable cost.SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 4748 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerVesell 2006). GWAS suffer from the same problems: no hypothesis; non-randomized control groups, which re- sult in comparisons of uncertain valid-ity; and, so far, tremendous problemswith replication of such studies and re-sults that are of uncertain meaning ortrivial importance. Those guilty of perpetuating worth- less practices include the \"scientists\"who repeatedly employ flawed methodsand then publish them, governmentagencies who fund such practices, edi-tors of journals that publish pseudo-science, the USDA and NCI bodiesthat perpetuate unscientific regimens,the megavitamin and health-product manufacturers who capitalize on badscience, and the members of the mediawho hype findings without proper eval-uation (Spec tor 2009). More recently, asI've already noted, the marketers ofGWAS \"products\" (putative personal-ized medicine) have begun selling tests of uncertain utility directly to the public(Wade 2010; Offit 2008). The FDA hasreservations about these products buthas not yet stopped their sale (Pollack2010). Both subtle and arrant quackeryabound. The solution, of course, is that the scientific community, government, andmedia must work together to demandgood science and its attendant results.Honest corporations must be enlisted.Most important, regulators must inter-vene and stop the marketing of unsafeor unproven products. We must keepknocking off the hydra's ever-appearing heads. Although no Hercu les is in sight, there is hope. We know better. n Acknowledgement I thank Michiko Spector for her help in man- uscript preparation and Dr. Robert Snodgrass for his careful reading of the manuscript and wise comments. Note 1.

SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 48Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 49It has been suggested that serum con- centrations of nutrients reach much higher levels with IV therapy than can be achieved through oral consumption. Forexample, IV-administered vitamin C at50 g/day can result in blood serum levels of 80 mg/dL, compared to 9.3 mg/dLwhen administered orally (Gaby 2002).In addition, it is hypothesized that withhigh-dose and rapid infusions (usually ofless than thirty minutes), vitamins and minerals are forced into the cells by over-loading the serum and are therefore \"trapped\" within the cell. This is the sug- gested explanation for why beneficial ef- fects seem to last long beyond the ex- pected short-term results (Salee by 2009). This is the theory behind IV nutrient therapy. However, no proper scientific studies have been published to support these contentions for how IV nutrient therapy actually provides beneficial ef-fects, if any. Although there is no doubt that IV nutrient therapy does result in serum concentrations much higher than can be obtained by oral dosing, there isno evidence to demonstrate that thesehigher concentrations are beneficial. There is some evidence that IV therapy with magnesium alone can have beneficial effects in severe acute and chronic cases of asthma (Bicharaand Goldman 2009; Noppen 2002;Okayama et 1996; Tiffany because magnesium a knownbronchodilator, thereby facilitating airflow (Okayamaet al. 1987). However,these authors stress that IV therapywith magnesium should be used in ad-dition to traditional beta-agonist and corticosteroid treatment. Yet there have also been studies that did not show im-provement in individuals with acuteasthma (Clague et al. 1992; Howard et al. 1992; Green and Rothrock 1992). Two studies\u2014one placebo-controlled al. 1996)\u2014of IV produced sim-ilar positive results. The placebo-con-trolled study (Skobeloff et al. 1989) is not rigorous; not only is it not double-blind, but it also suffers from other meth - odological problems. For example, the study did not have a sample of patients that would control for race and gender. In addition, all the patients treated had been recently treated with a beta-ago- nist, and the authors state that they \"also believed that by studying beta-agonist resistant patients, any effect after mag-nesium infusion would be related to magnesium and not a delayed effect ofthe bronchodilator.\" It is not indicated how long after beta-agonist treatment that IV magnesium treatment began, and this is crucial information necessary to assure that there was no delayed effect of the beta-agonist. However, there is also a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studythat clearly shows statistically significantimprovement in several measurements (such as peak expiratory flow rate) taken in pediatric patients with acute asthmawho were admitted to the emergency de- partment (Ciarello et al. 1996). It is therefore apparent that both the weight of recent evidence and the results of arigorous double-blind study indicate the benefits of IV treatment with magne-sium in treating acute asthma. There is atthis time no clear evidence that magne- sium treatment is beneficial in chronic fatigue syndrome (Clague et al. 1992),but some authors have indicated One MoreUnproven Therapy? Intravenous nutrient therapy is increasingly popular as a treatment for multiple ailments. But the evidence for the efficacy of IV nutrient treatments is speculative at best. CLIFFORD W. BENINGER Recently there has been renewed interest among the general public in the use of intravenous (IV) nutri- ent therapy to treat a variety of ailments, including chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, fibromyalgia, hay fever, chronic sinusitis, congestive heart failure, ischemic vascular disease, dementia, bronchitis, and multiple sclero- sis, as well as viral and bacterial infections. SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 4950 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerthe patients treated in that study were not magnesium deficient, whereas their own IV magnesium treatment of pa- tients deficient in this ion showed im- provement (Howard et al. 1992). How- ever, it is important to note that noneof these studies followed rigorous med-ical trial protocol; they are simply case studies. Compared with what's available about IV magnesium therapy for asthma, there is a dearth of published scientific literature on the benefits of other types of IV nutrient therapy\u2014notonly for asthma but for many of the ail- ments noted above. The most common IV therapy is known as the Myers'sCocktail; the basic ingredients are in- dicated in table 1. However, individual doctors may vary the concentrations ofeach of these ingredients or even add some others. This original formulation was developed by John Myers, MD, a physician from Balti more, Maryland, who believed that the use of vitamins and minerals should be part of the overall treatment of various medical problems (Gaby 2002). Many of the ailments I mentioned earlier have been difficult to treat using conventional medicine, so the public is increasingly drawn to alternative med-ical practices that have not, as yet, been proven in randomized,double-blind tri- als (in which neither the patients northe researchers know which is the treat- ment group and which is the control [placebo] group). This type of trial is the gold standard for determining the effi-cacy of new drugs and treatments. In one recent case study (Shrader 2004) that purported to show the ben- eficial effects of IV nutrient therapy forasthma, there was no placebo control, and the author admits that \"although there were no age-matched control pa- tients in this outcome study, and certainlyuncontrolled variables, considerable im- provement was observed. ...\" This study was not a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment. It sim- ply measured percent of improvement or non-improvement as measured by spirometry (pulmonary function test- ing) in a number of individual case studies over time; therefore it should notbe considered a reliable indicator of the possible benefits of IV nutrient therapyin the treatment of asthma. A recent re- view paper by Myers's Cock tail revivalist Alan R. Gaby (2002) suffers from the same problems as Shrader's study (2004), in that examples of the cocktail's efficacy are located within individual case studies of patients with a range of ailments (as documented by Saleeby [2009]). Gaby's paper is rarely able tocite any rigorous double-blind studies with positive results that had been per- formed prior to 2002. A recent voluntary survey study (Pa- dayatta et al. 2010) of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) prac- titioners attending conferences in 2006 and 2008 found that high-dose IV vi- tamin C was in wide use by CAM practitioners to treat the spectrum ofconditions mentioned in the Saleebyarticle (2009). However, this was a vol- untary survey, and the CAM practi- tioners did not have access to their files but merely relied on memory to fill out the survey forms. In addition, due to the very nature of the study, there was no statistical analysis done to verify whether this treatment was efficacious. One recent study that was a proper double-blind placebo-controlled inves- tigation into IV nutrient therapy for the treatment of fibromyalgia failed to show any statistically significant differ- ence between the control and treatment groups (Ali et al. 2009). In the authors'own words: \"Beneficial effects of intra- venous vitamin C on the disease condi- tions for which it is used are unproven, but side effects seem to be minor.\" Be- cause there was no difference betweenthe placebo group and the treatment group, the authors then went on to point out significant im provement within both groups. This statement means nothing scientifically, and the study's high placebo response and small sample size invalidate any claims of ef- ficacy for this procedure in the treat- ment of fibromyalgia. In conclusion, with the exception of IV magnesium therapy for acute asthma and in cases of proven vitamin or min-eral deficiency, there is very little hard evidence to support the use of IV nutri- ent therapy in treating a host of conven- tionally difficult-to-treat ailments such as those mentioned at the beginning ofthis article. More rigorous studies, such as that by Ali et al. (2009), are needed to properly determine how efficacious IV nutrient therapy is in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Until these stud- ies are done, we are left with single or multiple case studies that mean little in terms of the scientific basis of medicine.The evidence for IV nutrient therapy is speculative at best, and at worst it is based simply on a placebo effect that helps empty desperately hopeful pa- tients' wallets and purses. n References Ali, Ather, Valentine Y.

Scientists do things a little differently from the rest of us. Rather than constantly proclaim the truth as revealed by a mysterious source or through a breathlessly for-warded e-mail (which we must eitherforward or delete), scientists have tosearch for facts. This is difficult in a so- ciety where folks generally choose what they want to believe. The scientific method is a painstak- ing way to get the right answers. If a person is serious about learning whethera strange occurrence is real or just a bump in the laws of probability, she must first try to prove it wrong. How many of those \"miracle cures\" we see on the Internet have been subjected to such a test? But is all the skepticism neces- sary? Yep, and I know from experience.As the program chair for a science- based skeptics group, I talk to a lot of scientists. I even recently got an inside look at science in action.Some incomplete evidence had indi- cated that vitamin E plus selenium might deter prostate cancer, a disease that strikes older men like me. If this information were to be substantiated by a thorough study, we might not dread our next prostate exam. A study was conducted at the University of Arizona, looking at the recurrence of skin cancer when vitamin E plus selenium was taken. Another, con- ducted in Finland, zeroed in on lung can- cer and vitamin E plus selenium. Both studies failed in their original premise, but both indicated that the two elements, taken together, might deter prostate can- cer. 1This was just the thing to excite a wheezing geezer like me. I was a semi-re- tired septuagenarian with enough time to worry about it. But, wouldn't you know it, rather than run with what some evidence indicated, the scientists had to be sure\u2014and theywanted my help. In fact, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) wanted the help of a whole lot of us, few of whom had the slightest understanding or appreciation ofthis vaunted scientific method. They even gave the trial a name and always put it in capitals: SELECT. NCI recruited me and about 35,000 other guys, all over the age of fifty-five, to take part in a double-blind test. Actually, it might have been called a quadruple-blind test. Only one in four participants got both vitamin E and selenium. Each of the other three either got a combina- tion of a placebo with vitamin E or sele- nium, or they got two placebos. Then the NCI kept track of us and watched what happened.Do Scientists Know Everything?[ FORUMS If you cite science to prove a point, you're sure to be an- swered with the slur, \"Oh, scientists don't know every- thing.\" Dissing scientists is easy. Even their workplaces and their clothes are different from anyone else's. Those who work in medical research generally work in rooms so clean the rest of us are afraid to sneeze in them\u2014and if we do, the scientists frown at us. Many wear white masks and white coats. Others, for some arcane reason, wear green clothes. They use words with more letters in them than the rest of us use for entire sentences.KEITH TAYLOR Keith Taylor is a former president and current program chair of the SanDiego Association for Rational Inquiry, a science-based skeptics group.

My own hypothesis is that ourlife expectancy has increased because of the long life spans of all the chemicals we ingest. After the seven years, SELECT was discontinued. The mysterious guysin white (or maybe green) coats hadfound that the selenium/vitamin didn't work. My Not so, I insisted! Knowledgeis knowledge even if it isn't what wewere originally looking for. Believe me, knowing that selenium/vitamin E willnot deter cancer is worth the sevenyears of taking the pills if it'll also detera deluge of e-mails touting the stuff.Such a deluge would surely be followedby another offering selenium/vitaminE from Canada at discount prices. Let me share with you a dictum told to me by my favorite scientist,Elie Shneour of the Biosystems Re- search Institute, who is also a memberof half a dozen top science groups in- cluding the National Academy of Sciences. Elie said: \"A scientist must be able to say two things: I don't know . I was wrong.\" That's a pretty good rejoinder to the comment \"Scientists don't know every- thing.\" n Note 1. Information on the study by the Univer- sity of Arizona and the one conducted in Fin- land was verified by the SELECT office in Seattle, Washington.God in the News Again MARK LEVY In the same broadcast, a tragic off-road truck race in California's Mojave Desert was reported. The off-road event ended when a highly modified truck, moving at more than three times the legal speed limit,careened off a dirt path and rolled over into the crowd. Eight spectators were killed. Lately, news reporters seem to work extra hard to find tragedy survivors who thank God for their survival within a pithy sound bite. This seems to be a commontheme and favorite reporting technique. No doubt bleeding-heart, godless TV pro- ducers are behind this technique, satisfyingtheir perverse sense of heretical irony. \"Thank God,\" one hears a survivor of a Kansas tornado exclaim in the ruins of the trailer park where he once resided, \"my littlepooch, Toto, is still alive.\" Or, \"It's a miracle,\" a survivor ob serves after a train wreck kills or maims seventy-one people. \"My great grandmother's spe-cial needlepoint of Elvis performing inVegas is still intact. It's an heirloom.\"On a recent television news broadcast, a Boeing 737 jet airliner crash was reported to have taken place on an island in Colombia, South America. The aircraft slammed down 300 feet from the runway like a very large winged rock. The fuselage broke into three ragged parts, with flames shooting out, just like in the movies. Its ter-minal speed was estimated to be 150 miles per hour. De- celerating from 150 to zero in less than a second must make riding your average roller coaster seem like standing still, but only one passenger died out of 131 passengers and crew members.

SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 5354 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerOr, \"At least my valuable stamp col- lection is unscathed,\" says a flood victim whose entire house and other worldly possessions teetered over the edge of a cliff into the Pacific Ocean. \"Thank God for that.\" And so it was with the recent air- plane mishap in Colombia. There were114 people injured in addition to thesingle fatality, but sure enough, a re-porter located the Caribbean island'sgovernor, who said, \"It was extraordi-nary that almost everyone survived. Itwas a miracle and we have to givethanks to God.\" This is not an isolated incident. If there's a catastrophe, God is to bethanked thoroughly for some inconse- quential silver lining to it. If there's adisaster, God be praised. If there's ahurricane, a flood, or a tornado, some-one will surely pop up to testify that amiracle occurred. Apparently there isalways someone who can identify thepositive thing God does\u2014however ob-scure and unimportant\u2014and heap praise on him for it. Now, you didn't hear anyone actually give credit to God for allowing the eight bystanders at the sandy, off-track racecourse to perish, but you have to believe someone has something nice to say about the deity. The reporters must still be looking for him. The girlfriend of one of the deceased, erstwhile enthu- siasts said, \"It just isn't fair; it isn't right.\" That's about as close to a condemna- tion of God as you are likely to hear, onor off the air. So why don't people ever blame God for disasters? Some survivors are quick to thank God when tragedy strikes, butyou can't find a believer who hates orcurses him. If you're a theist, you oughtto acknowledge, at least occasionally, that God is responsible for terrible events as well as miraculous ones. As Mark Twain observed, whatever thing God wishes to do, however grand or in- significant, he can do that thing with-out anyone's assistance. But a snowball has a better chance in hell than you have of hearing a true believer say something less than flattering about the ultimate supernatural superhero. Again, Mark Twain noted\u2014and I wouldn't quote him so much if heweren't so logical\u2014that the leaders of organized religion don't know how to reconcile these grotesque contradic- tions, and they don't even try. The reason, I think, has to do with the Ten Commandments, which\u2014as legend has it\u2014were dictated by God toMoses well before airplanes and off- road races. Right near the top of the Ten Commandments, sitting in thesecond or third position (depending on your religious sect)\u2014ahead of lying,stealing, and murdering\u2014is the sugges- tion that if you believe in God, you can't berate him. The words are \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.\"So you see, the deck is stacked. Even if you suspect that some fatal accident isGod's fault, you can't call him on it. Thevery supernatural being you want toblame has already set the ground rules to prohibit you from doing so. It's noth- ing short of a brilliant plan. Maybe God is less than omnipo- tent\u2014maybe he's incompetent, inatten- tive, immoral, or even vindictive and vengeful\u2014but he is certainly not stupid.At least he wasn't when he had that fa- mous mountaintop chat with Moses. n You can make a lasting impact on the future of skepticism... when you provide for the in your will.

But whenStephen Hawking, the world's mostfamous living scientist, makes such apronouncement in the second para- graph of his new book\u2014 The Grand Design , co-authored with Caltech physicist Leonard Mlodinow\u2014manypeople will listen, and quite a few ofthem might then be tempted to buy the book. Curiously, Hawking makes a foray into philosophy only two pages later ashe introduces the notion of model-de-pendent realism. According to this view, there can be no fundamental meaningto the concept of absolute truth beyondwhat our best physical theories tell us.This logic leads to the seemingly bizarrepossibility of there being two equally real theories with completely differentkinds of explanations, as long as theymake equally accurate predictions. Al-though this contribution to the philos-ophy of science is certainly a valuableone, the manner in which such philoso- phizing permeates the book stands outstarkly against Hawking's opening obit-uary on that very discipline. Theology, too, is headed for the dustbin: \"The scientific account is com-plete. Theology is unnecessary,\" Hawk- ing said while speaking about his book on Larry King Live . Richard Daw kins backed this up, stating that Hawking's book \"finishes off God. Darwin kicked him out of biology, but physics re- mained more uncertain. Hawking is now administering the coup de grace .\" I certainly agree with such state- ments, and I am excited at the prospect of uniting philosophy, physics, and theology. But The Grand Design is rather deficient in any meaty argu-ments that might begin to back up such weighty assertions, and it pro- vides few references to other books or articles that would provide this miss- ing content. In the absence of such ar-guments, the authors' statements may come across as simplistic and dog- matic. The book's imagery also bearsthis out. Even though the images arecolorful and aesthetic, they contributelittle to the reader's deeper under- standing of the concepts presented. It's difficult to admit all this. I ad - mire Hawking as much as anyone, both for his personal battles and for his professional accomplishments.How ever, this new book appears to beaimed mostly at taking advantage ofthe instant market generated for any book that makes brazen comments about God. The additional mix of short, rehashed commentary on the search for a \"theory of everything\" is correspondingly superficial and has been better told in many other works,such as The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene and Universe on a T-Shirt by Dan Falk. That the commentary about God was the main motivation for the book is evidenced by the marketing cam- paign that was waged for it\u2014which was certainly brilliant, considering the instant, if dismissive, reaction voiced by leading Jewish, Catholic, Anglican, and Muslim leaders.

Rick Lax, a ma- gician, raconteur, would-be lawyer, and staff writer at the Las Vegas Weekly, takes his readers on a wild ride around Las Vegas. Why? \"I headed to Las Vegas to meet deceivers, befriend them, watch them in action, learn from their tricks, and learn to protect myself,\" Lax writes. He covers a lot of ground, from magi- cians (including Lance Burton, Criss Angel, and Penn and Teller) to card counters and women of dubious virtue. Of particular inter- est to skeptics are the sections dealing with deception\u2014how magicians fool us and how we fool ourselves. Lax obliquely cites some interesting studies on psychology, lying, and deception (including work by Professor Richard Wiseman and others) and applies the lessons learned to his experiences in Las Vegas.

In A Brief History of Time, he gave ambiguous but not to- tally dismissive views on the role of God in creating the cosmos, stating: \"Ifwe discover a complete theory, it wouldbe the ultimate triumph of human rea-son\u2014for then we should know the mind of God.\" But in The Grand Design , Hawking and Mlodinow leave little room for am-biguity, stating, \"M-theory predicts thata great many universes were created out of nothing. Their creation does not re-quire the intervention of some supernat- ural being or god. Rather, these multipleuniverses arise naturally from physicallaw.\" Spoiler alert : The highlight of The Grand Design , in my opinion, is a short two-and-a-half-page section at thevery end in which the authors explain why there must be gravity and how a universe can spring into existence from nothing. Essentially, the positive en- ergy of all matter in the universe andthe negative energy of the gravitational force associated with that matter can precisely balance so that the total uni-verse has zero combined energy. How- ever, on the scale of anything less thanan entire universe, such as that of plan- ets or stars, the negative energy of gravity is far too small compared to thepositive energy of matter, and hencespontaneous creation of bodies withina universe is impossible. This is the book's climactic moment. It's some-what satisfying, but it's far too brief. Tellingly, critics of The Grand Design don't just fall in the religious camp.Philosophers and scientists also criticize the science behind such simple all-en-compassing pronouncements. Perhapsthe loudest is from physicist and as-tronomer Marcelo Gleiser, author of the recently released book A Tear at the Edge of Creation . Gleiser commented on Hawking and Mlodi now's book for the Australian Broad casting Corporation: \"The search for an all-embracing theory of Nature inspired by beauty and perfec- tion is misguided, rooted in the monotheistic culture that has for so long dominated Western thought.\" But in all fairness, this critique seems to make too much of Hawking's words, as here might be the one place where he does show humility. Al though Hawkingdoes take for granted that string or M- theory is the only real candidate for a \"theory of everything\"\u2014and he is cer-tainly in the unification business\u2014he comes out stating that there may be lim- its on such ambitions: \"Each theory inthe M-theory network is good at de-scribing phenomena within a certain range. Wher ever their ranges overlap,the various theories in the networkagree, so they can all be said to be parts of the same theory. But no single the- ory within the network can describe every aspect of the universe.\" It may be a sign of how far science has come that even Stephen Hawk-ing\u2014who appears to some to arrogantly assume, in often brazen and simple lan- guage, that science can unify all knowl-edge of the universe\u2014still admits there are some limits to our ability to achieve the sort of unification we've long dreamed of. n Justin Trottier is the national executive director of the Center for Inquiry in Canada and a contributor to the National Post and the Michael Coren Show on CTS TV.

David Jones, Professor of Bioethics at St. Mary's University College in England, notes that though angels are said to dwell in heaven, their visits to the earthly realm are not always benevolent. Biblical angels not only comfort and heal but also wage war- fare, lay siege to cities, and kill people. The archangel Michael, for example, is often de- picted as the leader of God's Army, destroy- ing enemies with his terrible powers and flaming sword. Overall, Angels is a fascinat- ing survey of the topic, touching on nearly every aspect of angels in theology, philoso- phy, and popular culture. MONSTERS OF NEW JERSEY: Mysterious Creatures in the Garden State. Loren Cole- man and Bruce G. Hallenbeck. Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA. 2010. 144 pp. Paperback, $12.95. Loren Coleman, director of the International Cryptozool- ogy Museum in Portland, Maine, is one of the world's top writers on mys-terious creatures such as Bigfoot and lake monsters. In his new book Monsters of New Jersey, Coleman teams up with New York writer Bruce Hallenbeck to address some of New Jersey's mystery creatures. In its opening chapter \"The Jersey Devil,\" the book provides one of the best (and most thorough) analyses of the creature (of which Coleman \"remains open-mindedly skeptical\"). Coleman and Hallenbeck tackle dozens of other monstrosities in seven more chapters: \"More Winged Wonders and the Wooo-Wooo\"; \"Big Red Eye and Other Garden State Giants\"; \"Hoboken Monkey- Man and \"Lizardmen Vicious Reptilians\"; and \"The Ultimate New Jersey Monster.\" As you can tell from this list, thebook is a hodgepodge of various mysteriesand monsters. The book is littered with far too many anonymous and quasi-anony-mous reports, often culled from anotherbook, Weird New Jersey by Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman: \"Mike V. recounts his expe-rience...\"; \"Another report from an eyewit-ness who prefers to remain anonymous...\";\"Two witnesses who call themselves 'MS'and 'RS' recalled a sighting...\" and so on.Who are these people?

On May 9, 2001, Steven Greer's Disclosure Project held a press confer- ence at the National Press Club inWashington, D.C., featuring twentypeople who have made claims of a widespread government conspiracy to conceal the existence of extraterrestrialvisitors. After a brief flurry of sensa-tionalist news reports, the mainstream news media simply ignored what Greer and his pals had to say, and nobody fol-lowed through on it. The DisclosureProject folks expected that enterprising news reporters would follow up on their leads, blowing the whole supposed gov-ernment UFO conspiracy sky-high through diligent investigation. How- ever, it didn't happen, because no expe- rienced reporter believed there was any-thing in the UFO conspiracy claims worth following up on. Enter Leslie Kean (pronounced \"Kane\"), a reporter for Public Broad - casting Service station KPFA in Berke- ley, California, widely known as the rad- ical radio voice of the Peoples' Republicof Berkeley. Leslie Kean is the reporter the Disclosure Project has been waiting for. She says her initiation into the ranks of UFO proponents occurred in 1999 when she was given a copy of a French UFO report called COMETA, which is usually described as a report commis- sioned by defense officials but was in fact written by a private group. Like Bentham upon reading Hume, the\"scales fell from [her] eyes,\" and she suddenly realized the reality of UFOs as unknown flying vehicles. She has no doubts whatsoever that the government is hiding something really big from us concerning UFOs, although she pro-fesses (a bit disingenuously) to be ag- nostic on the question of whether they are extraterrestrial. Of the COMETA report, she says: \"All conventional explanations of some-thing natural or man-made had been eliminated by the authors and their asso- ciated teams of experts, and yet these ob- jects were observed at close range by pi- lots, tracked on radar, and officially photographed.\" Really? Among the CO -META cases supposedly having no pos-sible explanation was one at Laken heath,United Kingdom, in 1956\u2014but this case is the subject of Chapter 21 of the 1974 book UFOs Explained (Random House) by the famous UFO skeptic and late CSICOP fellow Philip J. Klass. Whatdoes Kean say about Klass's demolishing of the \"evidence\" presented? Nothing.Klass's name does not appear in the book's index. Kean writes a chapter on \"The Roots of UFO Debunking in America,\" but she does not even mention Klass, the late astronomer Donald Men- zel, or CSICOP or anyone associated with it. To her, it's all the fault of the gov- ernment: the United States Air Force(USAF) and especially the once-secret 1953 Robertson Panel of the Cen tral In- telligence Agency. Another COMETA \"unexplained\" event is the RB-47 case of 1957. That case fills Chapters 19 and 20 of Klass's 1974 book.

One drawback of the book (especially for anyone wishing to use it as a resource) is the lack of references or even an index. Especially in a book with chapters that are often collections of vari- ous reports on various monsters, an index would have been invaluable. With its limita- tions in mind, the book is definitely worth a look for cryptozoology enthusiasts. THE OTHER SIDE: A Teen's Guide to Ghost Hunting and the Paranormal. Marley Gib- son, Patrick Burns, and Dave Schrader. Houghton Mifflin, New York. 2010. 112 pp. Paperback, $10.99. A recent addition to the explosion of ghost books aimed at teens, The Other Side deems itself a practi- cal guide to ghost hunting and the paranormal. Often the book's authors are re-freshingly candid about the ambiguous nature of paranormal inves- tigation in general and ghost hunting specif- ically. \"No one is a paranormal expert,\" they note in the introduction. \"There are a multi- tude of paranormal investigators with differ- ing philosophies on how to investigate. No one can truly say that his or her methods are better than anyone else's. Not even we can.\" (I would argue that those investigative methods that actually solve mysteries are self-evidently better than others.) The book covers a variety of claims for ghosts, rang- ing from orbsand EVPs (electronic voice phenomena, supposed ghost voices) to safety during investigations. The authors, all well-known personalities in the ghost- hunting world, actually provide some pretty sensible advice, for example knowing your surroundings, seeking permission to inves- tigate a supposedly haunted location, and understanding how your equipment works. I was pleasantly surprised to find other bits of investigative wisdom, including not wear- ing reflective clothing, shiny jewelry, or hard-soled shoes\u2014all of which can create false-positive \"ghost evidence.\" Other parts of the book (e.g., casting spells to protect from evil spirits) keep the woo-detecting needle pinned firmly on the B.S. side. The authors (who call themselves \"skeptics\") are clearly operating on a different set of principles and assumptions than CSI-affili- ated investigators do. The Other Side is defi- nitely a mixed bag, but it's somewhat more skeptical than one might expect and is use- ful as a primer in understanding ghost in- vestigation from a \"believer's\" perspective. \u2014 Benjamin Radford REVIEWS] Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 57 SI Mar Apr 11 final_SI new design masters 1/26/11 2:16 PM Page 5758 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirer1969, before he became governor of Georgia.\" What she does not tell her readers is that it has been known for over thirty years that Carter's \"UFO\" was in the same position as Venus (seemy analysis of the Carter sighting in Chapter 2 of my UFO Sightings: The Evidence [Prometheus Books, 1998]). Kean also likes a list compiled by an- other French UFOlogist, Domi niqueWeinstein, consisting of 1,305 \"cases for which adequate is available to cat-egorize the [objects] as unknowns.\"UFO skeptic and CSI fellow James Oberg glanced at that list and quicklypulled out ten cases that he knew were caused by Russian space launches (seeOberg's \"UFO Book Based on Ques - tionable Foundation\" at www.msnbc. msn.com/id/38852385). There seems to be a pattern here. It's easy to tout UFO cases as having noconventional explanation as long as you completely ignore everything that's been written to the contrary. Surely evenradical Berkeley reporters must actually investigate controversial claims\u2014and sometimes even interview the token Republican to get an opposing view\u2014 even when they already \"know for sure\" what the answer is. I cannot imaginewhat caused Citizen Kean to forget herprofessional training and become an in- nocent lamb in accepting pro-UFOclaims, but clearly she is the reporterwhom UFO proponents have beenwaiting for, the Chosen One who will lead UFOlogy from the wilderness of isolation and despair into the media spotlight. She calls upon the U.S. gov- ernment to set up a new UFO agency\u2014 it can be a small one, she reassures us\u2014 to monitor, collect, and investigate UFO reports. Kean invited several contributors to write chapters describing UFO inci- dents they had some involvement in. She begins with the chapter \"Majestic Craft with Powerful Beaming Spot- lights,\" concerning the famous Belgian UFO wave of 1989, as written by Major General Wilfred de Brower of the Bel- gian Air Force (Ret.). It started with two policemen reporting a bright lightin the sky. Soon reports of UFOs were coming in from all over the region. Many of the UFOs were reported as tri- angular, and it was widely assumed that the U.S. was testing some kind of secretaircraft\u2014over Belgium! Jets were sent up in pursuit, but no solid radar or visual contacts were established. In fact, despitewidespread sightings, by the time the Belgian UFO craze was over, the only provided \"evidence\" was a single blurred color image. The photo unfortunately shows nothing in the background that can be used for analysis. Kean is sensitive to the criticism that there ought to have been much more photographic evidence, given so many sightings. She lamely suggests that \"twenty years ago, cell phones and rela- tively inexpensive, consumer-level dig- ital and video cameras were not yet inuse\" (true, but we had plenty of film cameras) and also that the dearth of photos \"was likely due to the effect of infrared light around the UFO, whichcan cause even such an object to disap- pear altogether in a photograph,\" which if true suggests that burglars can disap-pear from surveillance cameras by car- rying an infrared light. She ignores askeptical analysis showing that the po-licemen's original UFO was reported in the same position as Venus, that some of the early Belgian sightings were from a light show at a disco, and that the solecolor photo could easily be duplicated using cards and spotlights, as illustrated in Wim Van Utrecht's analysis \"The Bel- gian 1989-1990 UFO Wave\" in UFOs 1947-1997: From Arnold to the Abductees , edited by Hilary Evans and Dennis Stacy (Lon don: John Brown Publish ing, 1997). And even if Kean didn't know of Van Utrecht's skeptical research, de Browercertainly did, because he was interviewed by Van Utrecht. Another contributor is the retired Iranian General Parviz Jafari, who de - scribes his own \"UFO dogfight\" expe- rience in chasing a supposed UFO overthe skies of Teheran in 1976 (backwhen Iran was a U.S. ally). Jafari tells of chasing\u2014in an American-built F-4\u2014 an unknown object that looked \"similarto a star, but bigger and brighter.\" Thiswas almost certainly Jupiter. The object allegedly induced failures in the air- craft's electronics. This case, also a COMETA \"unexplained,\" is the sub- ject of Chapter 11 of Klass's 1983 book UFOs: The Public Deceived (Prome theus Books). Klass, an authority on avionics (\"aviation he iscredited with coining scribed known issues with the F-4's avionics that could likely cause the problems Jafari reported. A second similar case from 1980 is described in the chapter \"Close Com - bat with a UFO,\" written by Comman -dante Oscar Santa Maria Huertas of the Peruvian Air Force (Ret.). Neither Kean nor any of her contributors evince any familiarity with the classic 1948 Lieutenant George F. Gorman \"UFOdogfight\" documented in USAF Proj- ect Blue Book files, in which this North Dakota Air National Guard pilot ap- parently played cat-and-mouse with alighted weather balloon known to have been launched nearby ten minutes ear- lier (in Donald Menzel and Lyle G.Boyd,The World of Flying Saucers, Dou- bleday, 1963). There is no reason to sus-pect that the \"UFO dogfights\" in Iran and Peru were very different. Another of Kean's big cases took place in Rendlesham, United Kingdom,in 1980. This case is sometimes called the \"British Roswell,\" although the in- cident is a claimed landing, not a crash, near a USAF base in Britain. The British skeptic Ian Ridpath has a web- site discussing the many problems with this case, which Kean ignores. Her con- tributor, Sergeant James Penniston,USAF (Ret.), displays his notebookwith drawings supposedly made duringthe incident, while Colonel Charles I. Halt, USAF (Ret.), suggests that Air Force Office of Special Investigationspersonnel secretly came onto the base and interrogated witnesses, covertly using sodium pentothal to brainwashthem and erase their memories.

His tomb draws more pilgrims than Lourdes orany other Catholic shrine. Yet the full, true story of this purported miracle worker's rise to sainthood has longneeded to be told, and Sergio Luzzattotells it in his Padre Pio: Miracles and Pol- itics in a Secular Age . (First published in 2007, this is a new English translation.)As the book's subtitle suggests, Luzzattodetails Pio's fascist (he anadmirer of Musso lini) and other connec- tions, although in this re view I concen- trate on the allegedly paranormal aspects of Pio's life. Pio is best known for his stigmata\u2014 the supposedly supernaturally receivedwounds resembling the wounds of Jesus\u2014which he first exhibited in the au- tumn of 1918 when the trauma of World War I caused many to hope for supernat- ural intervention. Sud denly, at a Ca- puchin monastery in southern Italy, an alter Christus (living figure of Christ) was manifest. While praying before thechapel's crucifix, the newly ordainedpriest was suddenly, he claimed, inflictedwith the stigmata\u2014bleeding so profusely,he alleged, that he feared he would bleed to death. In fact, notwithstanding the claims in uncritical biographies, Pio's stigmata de-volved\u2014from bleeding wounds thatcould easily have been self-inflicted (like those of many fake stigmatists before andafter, as I described in my 2001 bookReal-Life X-Files ) to merely discolored skin that appeared to have been irritated by the application of a caustic substance. Indeed, a bottle of carbolic acid was once discovered in the friar's cell, and Luzzattocites letters from Padre Pio in which Piorequests that carbolic acid, and at another time a caustic alkaloid, be secretly deliv- ered to him.

Penniston also has elsewhere stated his belief that the beings that landed in Rendlesham Forest were our distantdescendants returning to obtain ge- netic material to keep their ailing species alive: \"They are time travellers.They are us.\" As for Halt, his credibil-ity on the case has suffered greatly, es- pecially considering his recent affidavitthat flatly contradicts many of his origi- nal statements (see Ian Ridpath's 2010article \"The Rendlesham Forest available at www.ianridpath. com/ufo/rendlesham.htm). Kean is enormously impressed bypilots' sightings, which she describes as \"a unique window into the unknown.\"She writes that pilots \"represent the world's most experienced and best- trained observers of everything thatflies . . . these unique circumstances po- tentially transform any jet aircraft into a specialized flying laboratory for the study of rare anomalous phenomena.\"However, J. Allen Hynek, the late Proj-ect Blue Book consultant whom Kean repeatedly cites as a respected UFO authority, came to exactly the op posite conclusion. On page 271 of his 1977 book The Hynek UFO Report , he wrote, \"Surprisingly, commercial and militarypilots appear to make relatively poor witnesses.\" Kean actually quotes from other pages of that book but makes ab-solutely no mention of Hynek's lowopinion of pilots' sightings. This is per- haps the clearest example of Kean's habit of totally ignoring everything in the UFO literature that disagrees with her beliefs. n Robert Sheaffer , a Committee for Skeptical In- quiry fellow and longtime S KEPTICAL INQUIRER con- tributing editor and columnist, is one of the world's leading UFO debunkers.

An adult friend of her parents had nonviolently (butquite clearly) sexually abused her. I wasof course very sympathetic and told hershe didn't need to tell me any more thanshe was comfortable with. I certainly didn't want the relating of the experi- ence to trigger emotional trauma. Instead, she more or less shrugged the experience off. She did not downplay her abuse; she was merely ambivalent about it. She related the event as a slightly embarrassing and uncomfortable experience that left no physical in juries at the time and no apparent emotional trauma afterward. She was not okay with what happened to her, but the experi- ence didn't scar her for life or leave deep emotional wounds. For her it was just one of life's many unpleasant (but nottraumatic) experiences. Her reaction seemed strange to me: it was at odds with both what I'd learned in my undergraduate psychology courses and the common conception about thenature of sexual abuse. But I was not about to tell her how to feel or impose my own interpretations on her; I was in no position to judge or question her re- action to her own experience. I didn't really know what to make of my friend's experience and her feelings about it until I read Susan Clancy's newbookThe Trauma Myth: The Truth About the Sexual Abuse of Children\u2014andIts Aftermath. Clancy, a research psy- chologist, is best known to skeptics as author of the 2007 book Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kid- napped by Aliens, which provides a fasci- nating look at the psychology of ab - ductionexperiences. This time Clancy turns her investigative acumen to child sexual abuse (CSA). The book is divided into five chap- ters: \"What Was It Like When It Hap- 60 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerhis stigmata out of pious humility; how- ever, to me, the practice seems instead a shrewd move to eliminate the need to continually self-inflict wounds. Nor were the fake stigmata the friar's only deception. Years before, Pio had written numerous letters to his spiritual directors describing his mystical experi- ences; however, it is now known that he copied these words verbatim from the writings of stigmatic Gemma Galgani(1878-1903) without acknowledging they were hers. And that is not all: Pio attempted to divert suspicion from his plagiarism by asking for help in procur- ing copies of Gal gani's books\u2014saying hewould very much like to read them! As to miracles attributed to Pio, the report of a Vatican emissary in 1919 cited the wildest claims then circulating among an uneducated populace. Theemissary characterized as fantasy the story of a church bell that fragmented when Pio'sconfreres were wronged by asuperior. Likewise, it was not true that Pio instantly cured a man of a limp; norhad he caused a deaf-mute girl to regain her speech. He also did not heal a hunchback so the man could walk away\"at least partly made straight.\" Not a sin- gle one of Padre Pio's miracles was gen-uine, the investigator determined. Nevertheless, Padre Pio's reputation grew unabated, and ultimately \"miracles\" would be found to serve as the basis for his canonization. A once-hostile Vatican had eventually become conciliatory to- ward him and responsive to popular demand\u2014this despite evidence that suggested sexual misconduct on behalf of the adored padre and the private opinion of Pope John XXIII (recorded in his daybook) that \"P.P. has shown himself to be a straw idol.\" By the time of his death in 1968, Pio's stigmata had disappeared, but that was effectively remedied in death. Al- though there was no need to cover hishands and feet\u2014and indeed Capuchin rule forbids the wearing of socks\u2014Pio's \"father guardian,\" Father Carmelo of San Giovanni in Galdo, worried thatthe absence of stigmata might cause a faulty rush to judgment. Carmelo therefore had Padre Pio's hands andfeet covered, as if the covering still con- cealed his allegedly holy gift. And so the deception continued. In 2002, the late friar was canonized Saint Pio of Pietrelcina\u2014not for the stigmata he was so famous for but for his healings that were, with due illogic, assumed miraculous because they were said to be inexplicable. And when his remains were exhumed for display forty years after his death, those hoping his body would be found incorrupt (a sup-posed sign of sanctity; see my Relics of the Christ, University Press of Ken tucky, 2007), or that it would still exhibit the stigmata, were disappointed. The em - balmed corpse had deteriorated suffi- ciently that it re quired a silicon mask\u2014 complete with bushy eyebrows and beard\u2014fashioned by a London waxmuseum. Of the supposedly supernat- ural wounds there was not a trace. n Debunking the Trauma Myth BENJAMIN RADFORD The Trauma Myth: The Truth About the Sexual Abuse of Children\u2014and Its Aftermath By Susan A.

Clancy calls for a reevaluation of the dominant framework with which CSA has been interpreted and studied fordecades. The \"trauma model,\" which iswidely used both in pop culture and among psychologists, holds that such abuse is invariably traumatic for the child at the time of the abuse. Clancy does an admirable job of combining personal stories and hard data. As a scientist, she realizes thatstories and anecdotes carry only so much weight. Clancy describes the re- sults of her research: \"Almost every vic- tim I spoke with reported that theirchildhood sexual experiences had dam-aged them. ... Most reported multiple adverse effects from the abuse\"(p. 22).However, Clancy states, \"The secondcommonality between the victims I didnot expect. Whatever was causing the psychological and cognitive damagethese victims reported had nothing todo with trauma; very few victims re- ported any fear, shock, force, or vio- lence at the time the abuse occurred\"(22). In fact, in the final analysis, \"Lessthan 10 percent of the participants re- ported experiencing their abuse astraumatic, terrifying, overwhelming, life-threatening, or shocking at the time it happened\" (37). Clancy takes repeated pains to em- phasize that she \"never once questioned whether sexual abuse hurts victims ...\" (78). Instead, \"the point of [her] re- search was not to minimize the harm abuse causes but to question our as- sumptions about what the cause of the harm really is\" (79). An event does not need to be physically or psychologicallytraumatic at the time to cause harm later on\u2014the real harm is manifested in depression, mistrust, and other issues. When some defenders of the traumamodel were unable to find good evi- dence of their claims, they had a ready- made (albeit pseudoscientific) expla n - ation: the traumatic memories had been repressed. Especially on a topic as emotionally and politically charged as CSA, it's easy to misread and misunderstand Clancy's points. Her argument is nuanced and easily mischaracterized. She has been at- tacked and vilified, not only by believers in repressed memory but by other re- searchers who blithely assume\u2014without offering better evidence of their own\u2014 that her findings cannot be correct. Though Clancy is among the first to write publicly about this, she is not alone in her findings; indeed, she draws upon a wealth of published studies that sup-port her conclusions. Clancy's intellectualrigor is remarkable, and the book con- tains meticulous reference lists and notes. Clancy describes the role that femi- nists played in creating and perpetuat-ing the trauma myth: \"How to explainthe fact that victims themselves said that they rarely resisted the abuse, they often participated, and that most chosenot to report what happened and kept silent about their experiences? The fem- inist solution was to conceptualize sex- ual abuse as a violent crime, to treat sex- ual abuse the same way they treated rape\" (91). This profound misunder- standing\u2014this trauma myth driven by politics instead of science, social agendas instead of evidence\u2014would eventually cause significant harm to the very vic- tims feminists were trying to protect. Clancy illustrates the vast gulf be- tween the public's image of CSA (rooted in the trauma model) and reality. \"Vir- tually every commentator shares the view that the sexual abuse was horrific when it happened, and, as a conse-quence, profoundly damaging to the vic- tim. Not surprisingly, when we read about sexual abuse in the news ... it is almost always in the context of lurid,sensational stories having to do with subjects\" such as priests molesting choir boys, To Catch a Predator -type Internet stalkers, and so on. Yet, Clancy shows, these cultural scripts describe and repre-sent only a very narrow subset of CSA experiences and victims. This traumatic sort of abuse was not typical of Clancy'ssubjects\u2014or of my friend. One result is that most victims of sexual abuse do notsee their experiences represented or val- idated in the culture, which may even lead to some abuse cases not being re- ported. Victims may see depictions of forcible or violent abuse and assume that it is typical\u2014and because they did not experience anything like that, they may come to believe that they were not infact abused. As Clancy notes, \"The reason truth matters\u2014the reason advocacy is in fact best based on truth\u2014is that our lies about sexual abuse are not helping vic-tims.... Based on what victims have to say, professionals in the mental health field have not made much progress for them\" (108). We cannot find answers ifwe do not ask the right questions. If the premises and assumptions underlying our understanding of sexual abuse are flawed, then we cannot hope to find ef- fective solutions to prevent such abuse. For millennia, illnesses were thought to be the result of an imbalance of bodily humors (bile, blood, etc.); to correct those imbalances, physicians used knives and leeches to drain excess humors. At the time, such treatment was perfectly logical and rational, based upon a (mis)under-standing of the problem. Perhaps decades from now, psychologists will shake theirheads in dismay at why it took so long to bring science and evidence to the treat- ment of CSA. The Trauma Myth is a brave, in - sightful, and important book with im- plications far beyond psychology. It isalso a fascinating study of how politics and political correctness can contami- nate good science. Clancy has shown that the emperor may have no clothes\u2014 and the belief that he does is hurting real victims. It is possible that people like myfriend, and those who Clancy found in her research, are rare exceptions in CSA. Even if that is true, their experiences are no less valid or worthy of study. Allvictims deserve good science and accu- rate answers. nSI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 6162 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerGhost-Hunters' Mistakes I want to commend Benjamin Radford for the restraint he showed in his dismantling of ghost-hunting techniques (\"Ghost-Hunting Mistakes,\" SI, \"skep- tics\" at T.A.P.S., The Atlantic Paranormal Society, declare an allegiance to \"science,\" but their methodology is so staggeringly inane that they are redefining the terms skepticism and science in the public's mind to meanmuch less than they do. The group's sole contribution is toetymology: their entire inves- tigative schtick is so absurd that it redefines ghostwriting to in- clude the phenomenon wherein a writer's subject is so full ofholes that his critique prettymuch writes itself. In addressing this orgy of pseudoscience, Radford could have done what other critics have: he could have illustratedthe mistakes and then skewered them with hilariously funny\u2014 but off-putting\u2014in sults. While his piece might have been fun- nier, it would have been ignored by any of the show's believers who dared read it. Althoughmost of them will likely not read it anyway, those who do have a chance to hear what he's actuallysaying because they won't go in-stantly on the defensive. To this end, Radford's efforts help restore skepticism and science to their original, higher mean- ings. I only hope his latest book on the subject assumes this same tone. Ross Bonander Austin, Texas I read Benjamin Radford's articleon \"Ghost-Hunting Mistakes\" in the special monster issue of SI, and I want to applaud and thank him for a well-balanced andwell-written article full of facts and educated observations. I am a veteran paranormal investiga-tor (I don't like the term ghost hunter for multiple reasons) of fourteen years and am happy to see such a well-written article from the hardcore skeptical side. Unfortunately, I doubt those who need to read it ever will! It's so frustrating to see a lack of critical thinking in this field, but what's even more per- plexing is talking to many other investigators who feel the same way but do nothing to change their methods or help educate others. I have written a blog post about my positive reaction to your article and given full credit to Radford and the S KEP TICAL INQUIRER . It's available at http:// tiny.cc/h67hg. Brian D. Parsons Ohio Paranormal Investi- gation Network opin2u@gmail.com I very much enjoyed reading \"Ghost-Hunting Mistakes,\" and I'd like to add a few thoughts of my own. Concerning electronic voice phenomena (EVPs), it's interest- ing to me that a hundred-dollar handheld digital recorder can capture these whisperin g\"voices,\" which the ghost hunters later an- alyze with computer software. Meanwhile, the show's soundman, standing only a few feet away at the time, apparentlyrecords none with his thousands of dollars' worth of sophisticated, professional-grade audio-record- ing equipment. Having made a living for the past thirty-one years in the com- munications industry, it's not sur- prising to me that ghost hunters find electromagnetic field(EMF) readings everywhere they look. Each radio transmission is by definition an electromagneticsource, and these investigatorsbring a variety of EMF devices with them. Indiscriminate use of cell phones, wireless cameras,handheld two-way radios, wire-less microphones, infrared LEDs in night-vision cameras, as well as the expected local internaland external EMF sources (not to mention their inevitable re- flections) can add up to a busy night of ghost hunting in any lo- cation, aided by the fact that solar interference doesn't mask the weaker emissions as it does in daylight. Radio signals from out- side the \"haunted\" structure, in- cluding the nearest wi-fi hotspot or the baby monitor next door, could be available for misinter- pretation as a local spirit. Ron SmithAlpine, Texas Frankenstein In his article \"Frankenstein Was Not a Doctor\" (SI, Novem- ber/December 2010), Ron Wat - kins states that in the 1931 movie, Dr. Frankenstein tells the monster to \"Take care, Herr Frankenstein, take care!\" Actu - ally, in the scene when Dr. Frank enstein first introduces the monster to sunlight, it is Dr. Waldman (who is off-screen)who tells Dr. Frankenstein totake care, as the latter inches closer to the monster when itreaches up to the sunlight. Other than this error, the article is interesting and well written. Thomas DeZego Richmond, Virginia In the November/December 2010 SI, both Ron Watkins's article \"Franken stein Was Not a Doctor\" and Massimo Poli-doro's column \"How to Make a Mon The of Cre- ating Artificial Life: From theGolem to Pinocchio\" reference Mary Shelley's Frankenstein . Readers should know that the charming town of Franken stein lies a pleasant drive west from Heidelberg. Sited high on a crag overlooking the town, the ruins of Castle Franken stein oc- cupy a setting even more im- pressive than the one depicted in the films: a small automated weather station sits on the highest point of the ruins, and,[INBOX SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 62Skeptical Inquirer | March / April 2011 63yes, it does include a lightning rod. Interestingly, insofar as I could discover while walkingthe length of the town, there is not a single shop that sells so much as a postcard related to the book or films. Unlike the tourist trade in Romania, which caters to fans of Dracula, the local burghers of Frankenstein have not turned the name of their community into a cottageindustry. Alan Dean Foster Prescott, Arizona In Defense of Reason The November/December 2010 issue of the S KEPTICAL IN- QUIRER, with a spooky cover and articles on ghosts and monsters, arrived in the mail in late Octo- ber just in time for Halloween. Is this a coincidence or a result of intelligent design? In the issue's \"An Open Let- ter in Defense of Reason,\" Tomasz Witkowski criticizes the Polish minister of labor for list- ing fortune-teller as an occupation along with an uncritical descrip- tion of it. He provides the labor minister's reply but still expresses concern that such a listing will legitimize fortune-tellers, dow -sers, and astrologers and could logically lead to the same for criminal professions, such as prostitute, drug dealer, and con- tract thug. Witkowski's report leads one to wonder how the U.S. Depart- ment of Labor treats such occu- pations. Fortunately, the Dic - tionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, is now available online. Fortune-teller is defined with a touch of skepticism: PSYCHIC READER (amuse. & rec.)Entertains client or au- dience by professing to tell past, present, or future events through extraordinary spiritual insight or by perceiving another's thoughts. Desig nated according to specialty or medium used asCard Reader (amuse. & rec.); Crystal Gazer (amuse. & rec.); Fortune Teller (amuse. & rec.);Mind Reader (amuse. & rec.); Palmist (amuse. & rec.); Tea-Leaf (amuse. & (amuse. & rec.)Prepares and ana- lyzes horoscope advise clients regarding future trends and events: Prepares horoscope by computing position of planets, their re- lationship to each other and to zodiacal signs, based onfactors, such as time andplace subject was born. An- alyzes horoscope chart to advise client, such as person or company, regarding con- ditions which lie ahead, course of action to follow, and probability of success or failure of that action. Both fortune-teller and as- trologerare placed in the cate- gory of Amusement and Re - creation, which suggests that they should not be taken too se- riously. James Randi would be pleased that magician is also considered an occupation: \"MAGICIAN (amuse. & rec.)Performs original and stock tricks of illusion and sleight of hand to entertain and mystify audience, using props, such as illusion boxes,scarf, cards, rabbit, and jew- elry....\" Mediumis not listed as an oc- cupation. Neither ghost hunter nor ghostwriter are listed as occu- pations, but poetis listed. Dowser is not listed, nor is cosmologist or skeptic; perhaps because so few can earn a living at them. Illegal jobs such as prostitute anddrug dealerare probably unlisted be- cause most of their practitioners \"take the Fifth.\" If one wants to have fun looking deeper into what theU.S. Department of Labor does and does not define as an occu- pation, search online for \"Dic- tionary of and then search occupa- tions of interest. David W. BriggsMarion, MassachusettsIn the SI Special Report, \"An Open Letter in Defense of Rea- son,\" author Tomasz Witkow ski's reasoning is quite lated. I particularly liked hispoint that certain \"professions\"\u2014 just as clearly represented among the subject population as were fortune-tellers, for example\u2014were omitted from the survey. The article mentioned, among others, racketeerand prostitute. I would like to point out, however, that there was a wholeclassification of occupations that were undoubtedly men- tioned in the Polish classifica- tion of occupations that would present just as great a problem as the one mentioned by Mr. Witkowski:\"What if, for exam- ple, the Polish Supreme Court were to allow establishing a forensic expert in the area of fortune-telling, astrology, bio- energy therapy, or similar spe- cialization on the same grounds as other forensic experts?\"I am referring to the classification of religious officials, such as min- ister, priest, rabbi, etc. I assume there is some such classification or classifications in the Polish government's document. Certainly an opinion ex- pressed in a Polish court by one of these \"holy men\" is subject to the same problems as the opin- ions of clairvoyants. I only pointthis out as perhaps an additional problem with the construction of the Polish gov ern ment's classifi- cation that Mr. Witkowski per- haps saw but did not mention. Donald Havis San Mateo, California Tri-Country Evolution Poll I was truly depressed by the re- sults of the evolution poll (News and Comment, SI, No- vember/December 2010). Only 35 percent of people in the United States believe that human beings evolved from less advanced life-forms over mil- lions of years\u2014and even worse, in my native South, only 27percent believe it. More than any other cause, I think you have to assign blame to the school systems and the peo- ple who end up teaching our children. Colleges of Education attract students with the lowest SAT examination results, and they become the \"science educa-tors.\" We would have betterteachers if we recruited more stu- dents with science degrees. The best science teachers I ever had were my college professors, not one of whom had ever sat through an education course. Marilyn Williams Finkemfinke1@verizon.net Human beings evolved from less advanced life-forms? Who's to say what's \"advanced\"? Someextremophiles\u2014who might re- semble our ancestors!\u2014thrive at temperatures of over 70\u00b0C. Wecan't do that. This isn't the first time this issue has come up, and pollsters ought to phrase their questions differently if they want to accurately gauge the ac- ceptance of evolution. Howard J. WilkPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania The Misunderstood Placebo Steven Novella may indeed be knowledgeable, but he is a bit disingenuous in his column \"The Poor, MisunderstoodPlacebo\" in the November/De-cember 2010 issue.He relegatesplacebos to their role in clinical trials, but of course placebos have been around since the dawn of medicine. In fact, up until the mid -twentieth century, placebos were likely the mosteffective remedies in a doctor's kit. Before antibiotics came on the scene in the 1930s, there were few effective remedies for disease, and doctors depended on their own calming presence and a variety of questionable or worthless pills and nostrums to provide the patient with a feel- ing that he or she was being treated. Then they relied onLETTERS TO THE EDITOR]SI Mar Apr 11 (PL) _SI new design masters 1/21/11 11:00 AM Page 6364 Volume 35 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirertime and the quite marvelous healing power of the human body to do the rest. It wasn't a whole lot different than a shaman shaking a rattle and doing the spiritual two-step to chase away demons. They were selling belief, and belief works. It calms the patient, reducing the fear and the stress-related influx of cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, which in- hibit the immune system. It im- proves the body's ability to use its innate self-healing power. The truth is that doctors still depend on the placebo effect. They turned penicillin and other antibiotics into placebos by treat- ing them as panaceas and pre- scribing them for every sort of patient complaint, including viral diseases for which they could have no effect. Many a person has collected an antibiotic pre- scription for a troublesome rhi- novirus. The over-prescribing ofantibiotics is so prevalent that many pathogenic microorgan- isms have evolved to be multi - resistant. The tendency of doc- tors to hand out prescriptions with little regard to their efficacy is precisely why pharmaceutical companies include in their ad- vertising, \"Ask your doctor ifXYZ is right for you.\" They know that doctors who will denya patient a drug request are fewand far between. A great many medical treat- ments are basically placebos.Arthroscopic surgery to repair the meniscus was revealed to be \"no better than a placebo\" in a study released in 2008 (Alexan- dra Kirkley et al., \"A Ran - domized Trial of Arthroscopic Surgery for Osteoarthritis of the Knee,\" New England Journal of Medicine 359(11): 1097- 107). (This was actually the sec- ond such study to deliver that result; see Bruce Moseley et al., \"A Controlled Trial of Arthro- scopic Sur gery for Osteoarthri- tis of the Knee,\" New England Journal of Medicine 347(2): 81- 88.) Yet these operations con- tinue today. Low back surgery is often simply a placebo. Some claim that is also true of manyhysterectomies, prostate re- movals, and coronary-bypass surgeries. The truth is that pa- tients often have symptoms that are ambiguous or for which there is no recognized effica- cious treatment. Doctors can't send these patients away with nothing, so they prescribe a placebo treatment or perform a placebo procedure and trust that the power of the white coat and time will help the patient recover. When it comes to hocus-pocus, doctors can match any shaman. And when they latch onto a high-visibility ap- parent panacea\u2014like penicillin was in the '30s or statins are today\u2014they don't hesitate to use it for its placebo effect. Robert Veitch Minneapolis, Minnesota I was enlightened by Dr. Steven Novella's dissection of the con- stituent parts of the placebo ef- fect, although I must confess I gained no real insight into the nature of this strange phenome- non. And we were left with the curious conclusion: \"On close in- spection, placebo effects are not a justification for substituting hocus-pocus for real medicine.\" Novella is careful to effects\" of \"nonspecific ben- efits,\" such as surges of endorphins and increase in elaboration of dopamine, eitherof which may produce a salutary effect in treating a disease. Does Novella contend that \"warmth, attention, and confi- dence\" do not have a physiologi- cal correlate? The mechanism of action of many contemporary, al- lopathic remedies describesmerely epiphenomena for some and is simply unknown for many others. I believe that a 60 percent salutary effect of \"sham acupunc- ture with enhanced interaction\" represents a remarkably effica- cious result, and I would not dis- miss it lightly\u2014even though we don't understand it. William Harveywharvey1@me.comA synopsis of a paper in the October 19 Annals of Internal Medicine appears on Science Daily (see www.sciencedaily. com/rleases/2010/10/10101817 4335.htm). The purpose of the article is to see if paper authorshave published the contents of placebo pills or potions used in their studies. The authors of the October paper contend thatthere is no placebo that is not physiologically active. There- fore, the makeup is very impor- tant to know if it can affect the trial results significantly. Fewer than 10 percent of papers re- viewed listed placebo ingredi- ents. James Reagan Cary, North Carolina Steven Novella, MD, replies: While I agree with many of the facts to which Mr. Veitch refers, he is not actually responding to any- thing I wrote in my article. Prior to science-based medicine, medical practice was indeed mostly placebomedicine. Yet this did not add measurably to the human life ex - pectancy, so it is hardly something to be touted or yearned for. That some physicians today rely upon placebo effects is true (although overstated by Veitch), but this is also not relevant to any point made in my article. The calming and reassuring effects of the ther- apeutic interaction are legitimate parts of medical practice, but they are not sufficient in and of them- selves to justify a specific interven- tion that does not itself carry spe- cific efficacy. William Harvey misses the point of my article. My objection to relying on placebo effects has noth-ing to do with whether or not we understand mechanisms of action. Rather, the evidence shows that much of what we measure as placebo effects is illusory and arti- factual, and any real benefits are modest and subjective. Further he misunderstands the notion of \"ef- ficacy\"\u2014if acupuncture plus a therapeutic interaction has thesame effect as the therapeutic inter- action itself, then the acupuncture isn't adding any efficacy. Thetreatment is therefore unnecessary and arguably unethical; further- more, the lack of specific efficacy mitigates any need to speculate about possible mechanisms of the acupuncture itself. James Reagan brings up an interesting study that was pub- lished after I had submitted my article, but I did write about it at http://theness.com/neurologica- blog/?p=2415. I agree that trans- parency in clinical trial methods is essential, and the authors point to the need to more uniformly disclose precise placebo contents.

John James Cahill Alexandria, Virginia Joe Nickell replies: Point taken, but now it is I who quibble: Constantine didn't treat Christianity as just one among many religions.

Thanks for the correction. Mechanical Automatons Go Way Back Great piece by Massimo Poli- doro (\"How to Make a Mon- ster! The of Creating Artificial Life: From the Golem to Pinocchio,\" SI, Novem - ber/December 2010), but there is one slight error (on pp. 22- 23). Polidoro writes, \"It was in the Middle Ages that technol- ogy allowed people to not only imagine but to build the first mechanical automatons.\" This buys into a recent nar- rative that the ancient worldlacked the technology of the Middle Ages, but that narrativeis entirely false. Actual robotswere already being built and op- erated in the fourth century BCE, and Aristotle (who uses them as an analogy in On the Motion of Animals ) imagined the possibility of using robots to eliminate the need for slavesand menial labor ( Politics). Both reports probably predate any Jewish legend of the golem. Manuals on how to build actual robots were written atleast as early as the third cen- tury BCE(On Building Automa- tonsby Philo of Byzantium). We even have one such manual, On Automata, by the Roman engineer Hero of Alexandria (from the first century CE), who said he was updating Philo's work. These robots did the same things medieval robotsdid, acting out entire plays and scenes (including not just per- forming dramatic encountersbut engaging in battles, working hammers and saws, rigging androwing ships, flying through the air, lighting fires, opening and closing doors, and playing mu- sical instruments). They wereprogrammed using a system ofcogs, lines, and wheels, which were set in motion (like a game of Mouse Trap) using a static weight. Some public religiousprocessions even featured elab- orate floats on which robotsacted the part of the god, and some even boasted displays ofrobotic cars (although theyprobably were powered by men concealed within). Actual industrial robots were developed and used by theGreeks and Romans as well: notonly the water mill (which auto-mated the grinding of grain) but water-powered saws (for cutting wood and stone), hammers (for crushing ore), and other forms of automation. Richard Carrierwww.richardcarrier.info Massimo Polidoro writes: \"In 'Sandman' (1815), writer E.T.A. Hoffmann told the story of a love between a man and a me-chanical doll. The Steam Man of the Prairies(1815), a dime novel by Edward S. Ellis, is about a big mechanical steam man used to carry coaches across prairies,\" and \"Luis Senarens ... in 1885 imagined the first mechanicalman activated by electricity in his book Frank Reade and His Electric Man. The following year, Frenchman Mathias Vil- liers de l'Isle-Adam first used the word android in a novel.\" There are several significant errors here. Hoffmann's \"The Sandman\" is usually dated 1816 or 1817; it was first published in Nachst\u00fccke herausgegeben von dem Ver gasser der Fantasiest\u00fccke in Callots Manier, the first volume of which appeared in 1816. Although it had received earlier publication, the work generally considered to be the first dime novel was the 1860 edition of Mrs. Ann Stephens's Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter.Edward S. Ellis's The Steam Man of the Prairies was not published until 1868. Minimal research would show Polidoro that the wordandroidhad been used\u2014in English\u2014in 1727. Richard Bleilerrichardbleiler@yahoo.comMassimo Polidoro replies: I thank Richard Carrier for his very interesting letter, and I'd liketo thank Richard Bleiler for tak- ing the time to correct my dates. Living in Italy, I did not have a chance to locate the original novel, so I got my information on those books from Wikipedia. That in- formation turned out to be wrong(I have checked now, and the dates have been corrected online as well). As for the word android, I only said \"the first time it was used in a novel,\" not the first time it was used in anything at all. A Climate of Irony David Morrison, in his review of three climate-science books (SI,November/Decem ber 2010), notes that Jim Hansen's fame as a climate scientist is ironic \"given Hansen's midwestern roots, his careful approach to science, and his conservative, shy personality.\" Perhaps it is ironic that a shy person became a famous climate scientist, but I fail to see how the other factors enter into the irony equation. I hope he is not sug- gesting that fame comes only to those scientists who are extro- verted liberals with a carelessapproach to science and who hail from anywhere but the midwestern United States.
