Seasonal Winter Are you looking for a cold-weather pick-me-up that supports your health \u2014 through an energetic approach? If so, Tune Up! Seasonal Winter is just the thing for you! It's a blend of Aetherea Health's signature Myco-Matrix, Three Kings imprints, and more for enhanced wellness during life's most health-threatening seasons. Wondering what imprints are all about? Using a process similar to homeopathy, imprints are essentially a way to bottle a certain plant or earth material, which enables the body's ability to heal itself. The process used for aetherea products is called Coherent Energy Transduction. It's the precise anthroposophical potentizing (focusing on physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing). It's a very gentle and soothing way to create balance in the body, whether for prevention or maintenance. And what better time of the year does the body need balance than during the winter season? When the sun goes into hiding, our bodies become especially prone to falling out of balance and picking up a cold-weather condition. Protect your health and wellbeing in a holistic way! Here's a look at what this charming blend contains: - Myco-Matrix: A blend of maitake mushrooms are added to promote homeostasis in the body to help support a healthy immune system as well as gut function* - Three Kings: Imprints of frankincense, myrrh, and the oil of gold are just some of the ingredients that set Tune Up! Seasonal Winter apart from other cold-season-busting supplements out there. The timeless trio holds precious significance for full-body health and beyond. Frankincense (Boswellia) offers 'grounding' benefits while supporting joint, cell, digestive, and immune health. - Ruby Crystal & Lactoferrin: The imprint of ruby crystal enhances the energetic alchemy of Three Kings. Its fiery red essence resembles that of the sun, while lactoferrin (a natural form of iron) delivers the sun's warmth into the blood, helping stimulate active immune health.* - Thymosin & Thymulin: The imprints of these thymus-secreted hormones are helpful in immune cell health and modulation as well as in promoting antibody production. Inter-Alpha helps regulate immune system response* When you're looking for the perfect wellness-boost that combines ancient medicine with aetheric medicine, Tune Up! Seasonal Winter is just the thing. The balancing support supplies your body with the energetic information it needs to thrive. Suggested Use: Take once per day, with or without food. May be taken up to four times per day. Cautions: Keep out of the reach of children.
