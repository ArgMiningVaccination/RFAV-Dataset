Acupuncture enhances and regulates your body's own restorative abilities by accessing your neuro-muscular and fascial systems. It has been shown to improve circulation, decrease pain, reduce inflammation, and relax the nervous system. In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a review of clinical trials of acupuncture, [Acupuncture: Review and Analysis of Reports on Controlled Clinical Trials](http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/pdf/s4926e/s4926e.pdf). As a result of this publication, the WHO recognizes 28 diseases, symptoms, or conditions for which acupuncture has been proven to be an effective form of treatment.

Acupuncture has been shown to improve circulation, reduce swelling, and relax the nervous system. Furthermore, it decreases pain by stimulating the release of beta-endorphins. For a more in depth view on how Acupuncture works, please [see this infographic.](https://gnvacupuncture.com/electroacupuncture/) Chinese herbal formulas are specially formulated combinations of traditional herbs that are intended to compliment acupuncture treatments for most conditions. The herbs are sourced from state of the art GMP (Good Manufacturing Process) certified facilities that follow strict quality control and make sure products are free of pesticides, heavy metals, and bacteria. During your visit, a thorough intake is performed consisting of assessment of chief complaints, review of health history, and pulse diagnosis. This will be followed by the development and implementation of a customized treatment plan. Usually it takes about 60 mins for new patients, and 50 mins for returning patients. There are shorter treatment options if only desiring to receive cupping therapy or B12 therapy. In general, patients should start to feel the benefits from Acupuncture in 2-3 treatments. Total number of visits are determined based on the condition (duration, severity, etc) as well as the patient's overall health. Frequency and duration of treatment greatly depends on the condition to be treated. For something like a recent bout of sciatica, usually two to four treatments are enough. Chronic conditions however, often require more visits. Acupuncture needles are rarely described as painful, and can be quickly adjusted if the patient experiences discomfort. We want your experience to be a positive one both in terms of results as well as the overall feel of the treatment.
