Mindfulness involves present moment awareness through attention, with acceptance and nonjudgment. By bringing intentional awareness to our bodies, minds, and automatic reactions through meditative practice, we prepare ourselves to respond thoughtfully and cope more effectively with uncertainty and distress. Numerous studies have demonstrated the physical and mental health benefits of regular meditative practice for reducing stress and promoting resiliency, especially for those in healthcare professions. Meditation involves learning about ourselves and how to work with our thoughts and feelings, which can facilitate awareness and compassion for ourselves and others. If you are new to mindfulness or guided meditation practice, or wish to broaden your current practice, please consider these resources. What is Mindfulness? How do I Meditate?
