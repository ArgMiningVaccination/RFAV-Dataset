Recently, when I was invited to participate in a new baby blessing \u2014 a fire ceremony \u2014 I was intrigued. These experiences offer a moment of reflection, bonding, and sharing of community. Gathering in a circle around a fire promotes a spiritual healing when exploring intentions of release, curiosity of knowing, and authentically receiving energy.

Indigenous Australians acknowledged ancestors through [smoking ceremonies using Emu Bush](https://brewminate.com/the-ancient-practice-of-fire-rituals-for-healing-and-purification/). Sacred stories describe how [Teotihuacanos conducted a New Fire Ceremony](https://kcts9.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/teotihuacan-fire-ceremony/teotihuacan-fire-ceremony/) at certain times to renew the sun, the single most important event on the Aztec calendar. Through fire ritual, we are able to evoke and communicate with our higher being and the beings that surround us. As I stepped into the circle of friends and family for this new baby blessing ceremony, I saw a brilliantly burning, controlled fire, outdoors around a fire pit. The parents invited us to sit in a group, write on individual cards a blessing for their soon-to-be welcomed child, and offer declarations as we placed the cards into the fire. Smoke rose to the spirit world and took our blessings with it. The entire ritual was truly moving and something stirred within me. I felt connected to myself but also to this group as a whole. Our energies joined together forming a single sacred baby blessing. We can all learn from unique moments and events new or unknown to us. For those of us who have not had the fortune of attending a fire ceremony, the experience awaits. The baby blessing inspired me to create and offer a ceremonial fire kit that might inspire you to heal and cleanse. You might connect with the spiritual world in your own home with family and friends for a special event, or make it a regular ritual for your life. We partnered with California's own Spiritual Kindling, to experience Esalen in your own home this holiday season.

And oh yeah, coming to Esalen.\" -David B. \"Hmm, this is a tough one! I guess I take care of my heart through fostering relationships with people I feel connected to. Spending quality time with them (whether we're on the phone, through messages/letters, on Zoom, or in-person).

I get out into nature, hike, camp, river kayak, fly fish, garden, I create, I dance (not enough!), and I remain grateful for each day, each breath, each moment. Being in the moment, awake, and remembering the gift of life and my feeling of gratitude for all of creation.\" -Steven \"My physical heart by limiting stress and eating a heart-healthy diet. My emotional heart by staying in love with the world and by knowing that all disappointment and loss will pass.\" -David Z.
