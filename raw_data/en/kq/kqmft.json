A summary of the CARES Act is available here, and an overview of the major components C ongresswoman Escobar fought to include for El Paso's hard -working families is available here. The CARES Act builds on top of the swift action that House Democrats have alread y taken to move two critical pieces of coronavirus response legislation into law. On March 4, Congresswoman Escobar and House Democrats took a first step by passing an $8.3 b illion emergency response supplemental package , which included funding for vaccine development, support for state and local governments, and assistance for affected small businesses. This legislation was followed up by H.R. 6201, the bipartisan Families First Coronavirus Response Act , which the President also signed into law, which guaranteed free coronavirus testing, established paid leave, enhanced Unemployment Insurance, ex panded food security initiatives, and increased federal Medicaid funding. In anticipation of future packages, Congresswoman Escobar has spent hours talking with local stakeholders to hear what they believe should be included to help our community. 6 These conversations have included a tele -townhall where Congresswoman Escobar was able to update thousands of El Pasoans on the unfolding crisis and took down their questions and concerns.
