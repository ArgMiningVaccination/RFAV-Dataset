Politzer Sandy Gamliel Marc L. Rivo Aug 31, 2023 Aug 24, 2023 Back to The Milbank Quarterly National commissions, medical philanthropies, scholars, and policy analysts agree that the key to improved health care access and cost containment is a physician workforce built on a generalist foundation. They propose a national system to allocate a specific and limited number of graduate medical education (GME) positions. The Council on Graduate Medical Education recommended that training positions be limited to 110 percent of the graduates of U.S. allopathic and osteopathic medical schools and that the system graduate 50 percent into primary care practice (50/50-110 proposal). The 50/50-110 option would significantly modify GME training: surgical and support specialty positions would be reduced, and increased numbers of medical and pediatric residents would enter general practice. This workforce composition would facilitate provision of universal health care access and help control costs-the basic tenets of reform. Author(s): Fitzhugh Mullan; Robert M.
