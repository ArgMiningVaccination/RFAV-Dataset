Energy Healing is a form of holistic medicine that promotes integration, balance, and harmony. Holistic Medicine is a form of healing that considers the whole person (mind, body, spirit, and emotions) in the quest for optimal health and wellness. Energy Medicine is based upon the premise that the human body is composed of an extraordinarily complex network of energy systems. The type of healing is a powerfully transformative approach to mental, physical, and spiritual health. By clearing blockages and restoring the flow of energy, overall quality of life is improved and vitality restored, promoting a sense of wholeness and well-being. Some Energy Healing practices focus on the energy centers (or chakras) within our bodies and seek to release anything blocking the flow of energy within these energetic portals. Other healing methods, like acupuncture and Emotional Freedom Technique, focus more on the long currents of energy (or meridians) flowing through our bodies. All Energy Methods involve harmonizing the mind, body, and spirit to allow for the free flow of healing energy along the \"energy superhighway.\" This promotes resonance, balance, and ease of flow. The Segal System of Energy Healing Dr. Angela uses a number of techniques when working with clients, depending on what their specific energy calls for. After intensive training and expert guidance by several extraordinarily gifted energy healers, including Dietrich Klinghardt MD PhD, Donna Eden, Amy B. Scher, and renowned Shamans, Dr. Angela crafted The Segal System of Energy Healing, which bears her own \"energetic\" signature. Her system includes, but is not limited to, The Release, Self-Loving Blocked Energy, Self-Loving Infusion Install, Emotional Freedom Technique, 5 Element Affirmations. Some of these techniques may include tapping and/or holding on various acupressure points, sound healing or tonal sounds to clear blockages and unlock underlying beliefs and emotions, and other methods to heal a variety of mental, physical, and spiritual ailments. Underpinning Angela's work with clients is a balance between intuition and Muscle testing (applied kinesiology). Whether her clients are blocked from self-loving, needing a release, or simply desiring to POWER UP, Angela creates an experience that leaves them feeling refreshed, lighter, inspired and more connected to self and others. Angela teaches you the techniques that she utilizes so that you can actively participate in POWERING UP your healing process in tandem with her and on your own.
