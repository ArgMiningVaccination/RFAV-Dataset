To be exempted from quarantine, travellers must have had two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, take a Covid-19 test on arrival, and show proof of a negative Covid-19 test result, said officials. The test must be taken within 72 hours of the scheduled departure time of your flight and antigen tests are not accepted. Before arrival, travellers must enter all Covid-19 related information into the government's ArriveCAN app and have a suitable quarantine plan in case entry requirements aren't met. Currently, Canada recognises four vaccines including Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson. No exceptions are made for partially vaccinated travellers. The possibility of easing quarantine restrictions was first announced earlier this month on June 9 as many Canadian provinces hit key vaccination targets. Canada has reported a total of 1.41 million Covid-19 cases as of June 22, with 11,029 active cases and 1.3 million recovered cases. According to Google's Covid-19 vaccine statistics, 32.2 million vaccine doses have been given in Canada, with 7 million people (18.8 per cent of the population) fully vaccinated in the country. However, tourists hoping to see the Canadian Rockies may have to wait a bit longer as non-Canadian citizens and residents are still not allowed into the country. \"The requirement to stay in a government hotel is being lifted for people who currently have the right of entry to Canada,\" said Health Minister Patty Hajdu, \"Categories approved for entry will remain the same.\" Hong Kong is home to one of the largest Canadian communities abroad, with an estimated 300,000 Canadians currently living in the city, according to the Canadian government. While the quarantine rules won't be lifted in time for Canada Day, home-sick Hong Kong-Canadians will soon be able to reunite with their beloved Timbits in no time.
