It also has a Master of Arts specialization in each of four programmatic areas: Health and Well-Being, Humans and the Environment, International Development and Globalization, and Professional Methods and Techniques. Students may develop a research project or professional program in these programmatic areas, or in any area related to our faculty's research interests. Health and Well-Being\u2014studies the ways that human health and wellness are influenced by past and present sociocultural, environmental, biological, and biocultural forces, by drawing from broad and holistic perspectives on human well-being. Humans and the Environment \u2014investigates how past and present human activities influence the environment; the ways ecological and other processes affect human evolution and the human condition today; and the resilience of social and ecological systems. International Development and Globalization\u2014examines how local societies respond to global influences; the extent to which cultural meanings, beliefs, institutions, structures of inequality, and social relations between genders and among kin are changing as a result; and how processes of economic and community development can improve basic aspects of human welfare. Professional Methods and Techniques\u2014develops skills in a wide range of methods and techniques used by professionals in applied anthropology, federal and state natural resource agencies, and other arenas of social, historical, biological and spatial research about humans. These include qualitative research and interview protocols, quantitative analysis, GIS and remote sensing, archaeological eld survey, historic archaeological methods, culture and heritage resource management, and paleoanthropological methods.
