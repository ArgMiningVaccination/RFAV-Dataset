This page is intended to all of you that cannot acquire one of our healing Oil Blends but would like to be able to work through emotional, mental and/or spiritual issues through the healing power of Essential Oils mixed with Meditation. Essential Oil Safety Before starting to make your own blend, please read the [\"Essential Oils Safety\"](https://www.theempoweryourselfproject.com/healing-essential-oils-safety-guide) page. Essential Oils for Healing Essential oils are very powerful healing tools as they act within the Limbic System in the brain, the area that controls, behaviour, memory and mood. Essential Oils can effectively help us change damaging behaviour patterns, let go of painful memories, heal overall and create new more positive memories that will assist us in out healing journey. Essential Oils are also very concentrated oils and extremely strong so my advice is always \"Less is More\" when working with them. Also be aware of using them around small animals as they can be extremely toxic and even kill a small animal if caution is not used. Essential oils are powerful natural medicines and just like when using any medicine, care, knowledge and mindfulness are fundamental. Essential Oils can be used for physical, mental, emotional and spiritual healing. Because in my practice with my clients my main focus is the mental, emotional and spiritual realm, the recipes I'm sharing with you are meant to work on those areas. However, essential oils are holistic in nature which means that the oils you'll chose to use will work on all aspects of yourself, including the physical aspect.
