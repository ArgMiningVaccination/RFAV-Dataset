BELOW ARE IMPORTANT NOTES relevant to the interpretation of data displayed in this bulletin: Episode dates are defined by dates of illness onset. When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also unavailable, then public health care report date is used. Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode - based tallies for recent weeks are expected to increase as case data, in particular onset dates, are more complete. The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, if unavailable then report date) inc ludes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission and death dates. When unavailable, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, per capita rates/incidences for year 2 020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,147,71 2 for BC overall) and for ye ar 2021 are based on PEOPLE 2021 estimates (n= 5,19 4,137 for BC overall). Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests) and non-MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: health authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data, PHSA Provincial Immunization Registry (PI R), and hospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS)). Case data were extracted on November 01, 2021 , laboratory data on October 29, 2021 , PIR vaccine coverage date on October 29, 2021, and PCMS hospitalization data on November 01, 2021. Some figures are displayed by vaccination status. \"Unvaccinated\" refers to individuals who did not receive a vaccine or <3 weeks has passed since the fi rst dose was administered. \"Vaccinated\" refers to fully vaccinated individuals with 2 weeks after receipt of 2nd dose.

Incidence by episode da te decreased in all HAs in week 42 compared to prior weeks of Wave 4 : Since week 38, Fraser Health (from 99 to 77 per 100K). Since wee k 34, Vancouver Coastal (from 69 to 32 per 100K). Since week 33, Interior Health (from 22 3 to 66 per 100K). Since week 37, Island Health (from 67 to 42 per 100K). Since we ek 38, Northern Health (from 306 to 207 per 100K). Age-specific incidences decreased in all age groups from week 41 to 42, except for the 10 -19 and the 80+ year -olds that have shown slight increases. Incidence rates in children <10 of age have continued to decline between we eks 38 and 42. The 80+ year -old incidence has been steadily increasing since week 31 . Among those who were fully vaccinated, incidence has been relatively stable in all age groups across recent weeks. The highest incidence rate among the unvaccinated in weeks 35 to 42 has been in the 80+ year -olds ( 1,379 per 100K in week 42 ). By week 42 , the single -dose vaccination coverage in the e ligible 12+ year -olds reached 90 % and 85% were fully vaccinated. Testing of MSP -funded specimens remains high but has decre ased since the peak in week 39, from ~80,500K to ~64,000K in week 42. Positivity started to increase slightly in week 41 reaching 6.7% in week 42. The number of hospital admissions was stable in weeks 36 to 42 at an average of 295 hospitalizations per week. Trends for ICU admission and deaths have also been stable from week 36 to 41. In week 42 , ICU admissions increased to 83 and deaths decreased to 43 deaths . The rate of hospital and ICU admissions was higher in unvaccinated as compared to fully vaccinated people in the last year. By case of earliest onset date, 5 new outbreaks were reported i n healthcare settings in week 42 . BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 42 Page 2 of 9 A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s Up to week 42 , 2021, there have been 203,401 cases for a cumulative incidence of 3,910 per 100K ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ). The provincial incidence by episode date was 66 p er 100K ( 3,434 cases) in week 42 , which decreased from the peak of Wave 4 (week 38) at 102 per 100K. Incidence by episode date may increase as data become more complete in recent weeks. As shown in Figure 2 , incidence has decreased in every Health Authority (HA) compared to prior weeks of Wave 4 . Incidence in Interior Health (IH) decreased from 223 per 100K in week 33 to 66 per 100K in week 42. From weeks 38 to 42, Northern Health (NH) and Fraser Health (FH ) decreased from 306 per 100K to 207 per 100K, and from 99 per 100K to 77 per 100K , respectively. Incidence in Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) decreased from 69 per 100K in week 34 to 32 per 1 00K in week 42 . Island Health (VIHA ) decreased from 67 per 100K in week 37 to 42 per 100K in week 42. These rates may increase as data become more complete. Table 1.

Test rates and percent positive As shown by the darker -colored bars in Figure 3 , testing of MSP -funded specimens are elevated but have continued to decrease since the peak in week 39, from ~80,500K to ~64,000 K in week 42 . The positivity of MSP -funded specimens ha d decreas ed from week 36 to week 40 , from 9.7% to 6.0% . Positivity then started to increase slightly reaching 6.7% in week 42. As shown in Figure 4 , the per capita testing rates (Panel A) declined or were stable in week 42 in all HAs compared to week 41. MSP testing rates in FHA remained highest at 1, 469 per 100K followed by NHA at 1,283 per 100K. Percent positivity (Panel B) for MSP -only specimen s was highest in NHA at 22.5 %, increasing since week 38 from 16.6% . Percent positivity in FHA increa sed slightly from weeks 40 to 42, from 5.2% to 6.3 %, and in VCH , from 3. 5% to 4.0% . VIHA percent positivity also recently increased from week 41 to 42 , from 4.9% to 6.5%. IH is the only HA with decreasing percent positivity since week 36 (15.2%) to week 42 (7.3%). Figure 3.

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown by the bars in Figure 5 , the testing rates have stabilized or decrea sed in all age groups in week 42 compared to week 41 except for the 80+ age group . After reaching the highest weekly testing rate of any age group since the start of the pandemic, testing rates in the 5 -9 year olds decreased from 3,933 per 100K in we ek 39 to 1,990 per 100K in week 42 . A decrease was also observed in 10 -14 year olds, from 2,902 per 100K to 1, 441 per 100K. As shown by the black dots in Figure 5 , the percent positivity in week 42 has in creased or stabilized in all age groups , compared to week 41 . The biggest increases were seen in the 10 -14 (from 6.9% to 8.9% ), 15 -19 (from 3.7% 40 olds (from 7.3% to 8.1%). The highest percent positivity in week 42 was observed in the 10 -14 yea r-olds. Case distribution and weekly incidence by age group As shown in Figure 6, age-specific incidences decrease d in all age groups from week 41 to 42, except for the 10 -19 and the 80+ year -olds that have shown slight increases . After a steep increase, the incidence rates in children <10 of age have continued to decline between weeks 38 and 42, from 189 to 101 per 100K . The 80+ year -olds have been steadily increasing since week 31 , from 11 to 59 per 100K in week 42 . Age-specific incidences may increase as data become more complete. As shown in Figure 7, incidence is much higher in unvaccinated than in fully vaccinated people in all age groups across time. Compared to week 41, incidence in the unvaccinated group has decreased in all age groups except for the 12 -19 and the 80+ year -olds. The highest incidence rate among th e unvaccinated in weeks 35 to 42 has been in people aged 80+ years, with an incidence of 1,379 per 100K in week 42 . This is 28 times higher than in fully vaccinated 80+ year -olds for the same week . Among those who are fully vaccinated, incidence has been relatively stable in all age groups across recent weeks. The highest incidence rate among fully vaccinated people was in those aged 40 -49 years, at 49.1 per 100,000 in week 42, which is 6 times lower than in unvaccinated people of the same age.

Weekly age -specific COVID -19 incidence per 100K population by epidemiological week , BC Jan 3, 2021 (week 1) - Oct 23, 2021 (week 42) (N= 203,370) a The peak in week 11 among 12 to 19 -year -olds was caused by one case among a small number of vaccinated individuals . Vaccine coverage and weekly cases by age group Vaccine roll -out in the community (i.e. individuals not residing in healthcare facilities, not healthcare workers and not clinically extremely vulnerable) was phased by age groups. The 70+ year -olds were eligible between weeks 10 and 14, the 40 to 69 year - olds started in weeks 15 -19, the 20 to 39 year -olds started in weeks 19 -20, and children 12 -19 years of age started in week 20. As vaccination coverage increases, an impact on case cou nts is expected a few weeks later (Figure 8 ). By week 42, 90 % of eligible 12+ year -olds had received a single dose of vaccine and 85 % were fully vaccinated. The single -dose coverage for age groups 50+ years ranged from 87 -97%, and two -dose covera ge ranged from 83 -94%, with 1,02 4 cases reported for those age groups combined. Single -dose coverage in th e 20 -49 year -olds was between 87 -89% and two-dose coverage ranged between 80 -84%, with 1 ,495 cases reported for those age groups co mbined. Single -dose coverage in th e 12 -19 year -olds was 88% and 80% were fully vaccinated, with 2 63 cases report ed for that age group in week 42 . Figure 8.

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The number of hospital admissions has been stable in week s 36 to 42 at an average of 295 hospitalizations per week . ICU admissions have also been relatively stable in week s 36 to 41, with an average of 69 ICU admissions per week , with a more recent increase in week 42 , at 83 ICU admissions (Table 2 , Figure 9 ). Death counts ha d been increasing slowly from 31 deaths in week 36 to 48 deaths in week 41 . In week 42 , deaths slightly decreased (43 deaths). As shown in Figure 10 , the rate of hospital and ICU admission was higher in unvaccinated as compared to fully vaccinated people throughout 2021. In week 42 , the hospital admission rate was 19 per 100K among those who were unvaccinated as compared to 2 per 100K among those who were fully vaccinated. The ICU admission rate among unvaccinated people was 6 per 100K, as compared to 0 per 100K among the fully vaccinated. Cumula tively, there have been 19 confirmed cases of Multi -system Infl ammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (MIS - C) in BC since January 1, 2020. There have been no new confirmed cases of MIS -C since the last report. The median age of all cases is 9 (range 1 -15) years. Table 2.

Cases with unknown outcome are included in the denominators (i.e. assumed not to have the specified severe outcome). b. Data source: health authority case line lists only. Data may be incomplete and subject to change c. As of October 26th, IH has changed the primary source of COVID -19 hospitalization surveillance data to PHSA's Provincial COVID -19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS). This change in data source has led to a one -time increase in the number of ever and currently reported COVID -19 hospitalizations. This change is retrospective to the beginning of the pandemic though primarily affects cases reported since August 2021. There has been n o change to the overal l COVID -19 case counts or to the case man agement of patients in hospital. Figure 9 .

Age profile, severe outcomes Table 3 displays the distribution of cases and severe outcomes. In week 42 , median age of hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths was 59 years , 60 years and 74 years, respectively, based on health authority case line lists only (data not shown). Since week 38 , there was a weekly average of 4 death s in age groups <50 years of age, 4 in age groups 50 -59 years of age, 6 deaths in the 60 -69 year old age group, 10 deaths in the 70 -79 year -olds, and 20 deaths in the 80+ year -olds. The number of deaths may increase over time as data becomes more complete.
