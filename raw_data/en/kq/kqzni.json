Contac t Medical Control for further orders when necessary. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Treatment Protocols - Trauma Emergencies Traumatic Brain Injury 11.8 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 This protocol applies to adult and pediatric patients with a suspected brain injury due to blunt or penetrating trauma. The goal of prehospital TBI management is limiting disability and mortality from head injury by promoting adequate oxygenation and cerebral perfusion while limiting the development of increased intracranial pressure and secondary brain injury. ALL PROVIDER LEVELS 1. Initiate General Assessment and Universal Patient Care Protocol . Ensure continuous pulse oximetry monitoring. Perform frequent (approximately every 5 minutes) systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements. Perform initial assessment of GCS and pupil size as soon as possible during the primary assessment. Reassess GCS and pupil size frequ ently (approximately every 5 minutes) and with any change in mentation or before administering any sedative medications. If available, apply continuous waveform ETCO 2 in moderate/severe head injury. If signs of altered mental status are present, check bloo d glucose level and treat per hypoglycemia protocol. 2. Ensure that spinal motion restriction is performed. For moderate/severe TBI, elevate the head of the stretcher 30 degrees to reduce intracranial pressure. 3. If the patient has a patent airway and is brea thing adequately, administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving a SpO 2 of > 94%. Hypoxia significantly increases mortality in TBI and should be avoided. 4. If the patient does not have a patent airway, is not breathing adequately, or has altere d mental status initiate airway management procedure per Airway Management and Oxygen Therapy Protocol. 5. If a patient with suspected TBI is comatose (unconscious and unresponsive) AND one or more of the following signs of brain herniation is present, hyper ventilate the patient at a rate of: Adult Pediatric 20 breaths per min . 25 breaths per min . DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Treatment Protocols - Trauma Emergencies Traumatic Brain Injury 11.8 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 Signs of brain herniation: oSeizure activity. oUnilateral or bilateral \"blown\" pupil (fixed, dilated, and unreactive to light). oAsymmetric pupils (unequal > 1mm oAbnormal oHypertension and bradycardia (Cushing's response). oIntermittent apnea (periodic breathing) or abnormal respiratory pattern. 6. Control scalp bleeding with direc t pressure if no suspected open skull injury. 7. Apply a moist sterile dressi ng to any potential open skull wound. 8. Immediately transport to the closest open trauma center. Transport patients < 15 years old to Children's National Hospital (H2). ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT PROVIDERS 1.Place the patient on continuous EKG moni toring. If a dysrhythmia is present, proceed to the appropriate protocol. 2.Establish IV/IO access. Do not del ay transport; perform en route to the trauma center. 3. Oral endotracheal intubation or s upraglottic airway insertion may be performed if BVM ventilation is not effective in maintaining oxygenation or if it is needed to protect or maintain an open airway. See Medication Facilitated Intubation Protocol and Post Advanced AirwayManagement Protocol. 4. Apply continuous quantitative waveform capnography (ETCO 2). If the patient has no signs of brain herniation, then target a normal ETCO 2 of 35-45 mmHg. 5. If a patient with suspected TB I is comatose (unconscious and unresponsive) AND one or more of the above signs of brain herniation is present, hyperventilate to a target ETCO 2 of 30-35 mmHg. 6. Stop hyperventilation and resume norm al age-appropriate ventilation rates if the pupils normalize. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Treatment Protocols - Trauma Emergencies Traumatic Brain Injury 11.8 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 3 7.Administer normal saline fluid bolus to maintain the following blood pressure goals. Hypotension significantly increases mortality in TBI and should be avoided. Adult (age > 10 years old): maintain SBP greater than or equal to 110 mmHg Pediatric: Maintain oLess than 70mmHg o1-10 years old: greater than 70 + 2X age in years 8.If the patient experiences active seizure activity, treat per seizure protocol. MEDICAL CONTROL OPTIONS 1. Contact Medical Control for further orders when necessary General no tes: The presence of hypoxia or hypotension has been associated with a 2 - to 4- fold increase in death and or severe disability for patients with severe TBI. The presence of both hypoxia and hypotension together has a synergistic negative effect, increasing mortality by three or mor times than either alone. Treat hypoxia and hypotension aggressively. Shock / hypote nsion is not usually due to isolated head injuries. If the patient is in shock, consider another cause for the hypotension such as blood loss. Restl essness and combativeness can be due to hypoxia and shock, not just head injury. Patie nts can suffer significant brain injury without losing consciousness or experiencing loss of memory on the scene. Always assume coexisting cervical spine injury in patients with moderate to severe head injury. Utilize the Spinal Motion Restriction protocol. Early s igns of neurologic deterioration after head injury includeAdult Pediatric 250 ml as needed to maintain blood pressure goal. Maximum total of 2000 ml 20 ml/kg as needed to maintain blood pressure goal. Maximum of 3 boluses DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Treatment Protocols - Trauma Emergencies Traumatic Brain Injury 11.8 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 4 oConfusion oAgitatio n oDrowsin or AVPU GCS 9 -12 or AVPU = (V) oSevere TBI : GCS 3 -8 or AVPU = (P) or (U) Do NOT hyperventilate unless there are active signs of brain herniation. In the past, aggressive hyperventilation was often performed to reduce ICP in patients with T BI. However, hyperventilation is known to cause cerebral vasoconstriction with an associated decrease in cerebral blood flow, resulting in worsened neurologic outcomes and greaterlikelihood of moderate to severe disability. Thus, hyperventilation should be avoided unless the patient is actively herniating. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Treatment Protocols - Trauma Emergencies Spinal Motion Restriction 11.9 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Long backboards have historically been used to limit undesired motion of the spine after a traum atic mechanism of injury. However, numerous studies conclude that they do not provide true immobilization of the spine. For this reason, the term \"spinal motion restriction\" (SMR) has gained favor over \"spinal immobilization.\" SMR can be achieved by use of an ambulance cot, scoop stretcher, vacuum splint, or other similar device upon which a patient is safely secured during EMS transport. SMR without the use of a long backboard avoids the unintended but well documented patient injury and complications associated with use of this device during transport. The long backboard may still have a role in facilitating the extrication and rapi d transfer of patients to the ambulance cot for transport. 1.Asses s the scene to determine the mechanism of injury. Mechanism alone should NOT determine if a patient requires SMR; however,mechanisms that have been associated with a higher risk of spinal injury include moderate to high speed motor vehicle crashes, axial loading injuries to the spine(diving into shallow water) and falls greater than 10 feet. 2. Asse ss the patient in the position found for findings associated with a spine injury: Abnormal m ental status Spinal pain or tenderness Neurologic deficits Evidence of alcohol or drug intoxication Other severe injuries, particularly associated torso injuries 3.Indi cations for SMR following blunt trauma include any of the following: Acutely altered level of consciousness (e.g., GCS < 15, evidence of intoxication) Midline neck or back pain and/or tenderness to palpation Anatomic deformity of the spine Torticollis in children (i.e., involuntary neck muscle contractions that cause the head to tilt or turn sideways) Focal neurologic signs and/or symptoms (e.g., numbness or motor weakness) Distracting circumstances or injury that impairs the patient's ability to contribute to areliable examination (e.g., long bone fracture, crush injury, large burns, emotional distress, communication barrier, etc.) 4.There is no indication for SMR following penetrating trauma to the head, neck or torso . Such procedures delay rapid transport and have been associated with increased patient mortality. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Treatment Protocols - Trauma Emergencies Spinal Motion Restriction 11.9 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 5.SMR when indicated should be applied to the entire spine and consists of the following ste ps: a.Place an appropriately sized cervical collar to limit movement of the cervical spine . i. If the patient does not fit into a cervical collar or cannot tolerate a cervical collar (e.g. , elderly patient with severe curvature of the spine) they should be immobilized in a position of comfort using towel rolls or sandbags. b.Keep t he head, neck, and torso in alignment as much as possible during extrication, transfer and transport . c. If the patient is ambulatory on scene or can safely self -extricate: i. Assist the patient in moving to the ambulance cot with minimal spinal motion into a seated position. ii.Once on the ambulance cot, lay the patient back gently into the supine position. d. If t he patient is not ambulatory on scene or extrication is required: i.Pay attention to minimizing spinal motion during patient transfer from one surfa ce to another including, for example, ground to ambulance cot. ii.Utilize a scoop stretcher or a long backboard to assist with patient extrication and transfer to the ambulance cot. iii.If utilizing a long backboard for transfer from the ground to the ambulance cot, use the lift and slide technique, rather than a logroll , to place the patient on the long backboard. e.Once a patient is safely positioned on an ambulance cot, the rigid transfer device (e.g., long backboard, scoop stretcher, etc.) shall be removed. Do not transportpatients on rigid long backboards unless removal interferes with critical patienttreatments or interventions. An example of this may be facilitation of immobilization of multiple extremity injuries or an unstable patient where removal ofa board will delay other treatment priorities. Removal of the transfer device should occur in all but the rarest of situations. f.Aft er removal of the extrication or transfer device, maintain SMR by ensuring that the patient remains secured in the supine position, directly on the ambulance cot, with acervical collar in place. g. The pr eferred position for SMR is flat and supine. H owever, there are three circumstances under which raising the head of the stretcher to 30 degrees should be considered: i.Respiratory distress ii.Suspected severe brain injury DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Treatment Protocols - Trauma Emergencies Spinal Motion Restriction 11.9 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 3 iii.Promotion of patient compliance h. I n an uncooperative patient, avoid interventions that may promote increased spinal movement. i.As pa rt of the patient care report to the receiving trauma facility, transporting personnel shall inform hospital staff that a patient is in SM R on the ambulance cot. The use of a slider board or s imilar device is necessary to safely transfer the patient from the ambulance cot to the hospital stretcher . 6.Pedi atric considerations a.Young children pose communication barriers, but this should not mandate SMR purely based on age. b. When pos sible, infants and toddlers already strapped into a car seat with a built-in harness should be extricated while still strapped into the car seat and secured to the ambulance cot. c.Chil dren are abdominal breathers, so when possible, immobilization straps should go across the chest and pelvis and not across the abdomen. d. Chil dren have disproportionately larger heads than adults. Additional padding under the shoulders and body is often necessary to avoid excessive cervical spine flexionduring SMR.

Technology-assisted children refer to those children who depend on medical devices to support bodily function. In all cases utilize the caregiver to assist or perform necessary troubleshooting measures because they are often trained in performing those functions. Emergencies in Children with Ventilators 1. Chil dren on mechanical ventilation may exhibit sudden or gradual deterioration, cardiac arrest, increased oxygen demand, increased respiratory rate, retractions, andchange in mental status. 2. Examine the child quickly for possible causes of distress which may be eas ily correctable (e.g. detached oxygen source) the caretakers will often have done this butdouble check. 3. Medications the child is presently taking may be the cause of deterioration. 4. Try to establish the child's baseline; the child may not look age appropri ate. 5. If on a ventilator, remove the child from the ventilator and manually ventilate the child with a secure oxygen source; if the child improves there may be a problem with the ventilator or oxygen source. 6. Suction the child as accumulation of debris is a common cause of obstruction; if the tracheostomy tube has a cannula, remove it; if it is the cause of obstruction, thereshould be immediate improvement. 7. If still no improvement provide immediate transport to the closest appropriate facility. 8.Initiate appropriate resuscitation as needed. 1. If t here is no improvement the tube should be removed; attempt bag- valve mask ventilation; if another tube is available insert into the stoma and resume ventilation (a standard endotracheal tube may be used or the used tracheostomy tube after beingcleaned). 2. If there is no improvement, immediately transport to the nearest appropriate medical facility and initiate appropriate resuscitation as needed.

Children may have central lines in several locations and some complications are due to location; some central lines are located under the skin and can be felt but not seen. 2. The most common emergencies with central lines include blockage of the line, complete or partial accidental removal, or complete or partial laceration of the line. 3. Always evaluate a child for cardiovascular stability, as some complications may be life threatening. 4. Children may be experiencing complications from their underlying medical condition; ask caretakers about the child's condition. 5. If the line is blocked, do not attempt to force the catheter open. Transport to a facility capable of managing central lines. 6. For complete removal, do not attempt to reinsert; transport to the nearest emergency department. 7. Infections are a common complication; don't try to push a line back in, even if it is only slightly out. 8. For complete removal, maintain pressure on site until bleeding has stopped; transport child and catheter to nearest emergency department (p art of the catheter may have broken off). 9. Always bring the line with you to the hospital. 10. For partial or complete laceration of the line, clamp proximally to laceration and transport child and catheter to the closest appropriate facility. 11. For children with sudden deterioration begin resuscitation and transport to the closest appropriate facility (child may have pneumothorax or internal bleeding). Emergencies in Children with Gastrostomy Tubes 1. Children with gastrostomy tubes may have complications of obstruction or dislodgment; obstruction is usually not an emergency but the child may require transport; dislodgment is not life threatening but the tube should be replaced as soon as possible. Both conditions are easily recognized. 2. The child should be examined for any other possible problems.

Do not initiate the report in front of the patient, parent, or caregiver. DO NOT CONFRONT OR BECOME HOSTILE TO THE PARENT OR CAREGIVER . Phy sical Assessment Suggestive of Abuse: 1. Fractures in children under 2 years of age. 2.Repeated fractures not explained well. 3. Injuries in various stages of healing. 4. Frequent injuries.5. Bruises or burns in patterns (e.g. iron or cigarette burns, cord marks, bite or pinch marks, and bruised to head, neck, back or buttocks). 6. Widespread injuries over the body.7. Obvious physical neglect (malnutrition, lack of cleanliness).8. Inappropriate dress (e.g. very little clothes in winter). His tory Suggestive of Abuse: 1. The history does not match with the nature or severity of injury. 2. The parents' and/or caregivers' account is vague or changes.3. The \"accident\" is beyond the capabilities of the patient (e.g. a 12 month old that burns self by turning on the hot water in the bath tub). 4.There is a delay in seeking help. 5. The parent and/or caregiver may be inappropriately unconcerned about the patient's injury. Cha racteristics of the Abused: 1. If less than 5 years old, is likely to be passive. 2. If over 5 years of age, is likely to be aggressive. 3. Does not look to the abuser for support, comfort, or reassurance.4. May cry without any expectation of receiving help. 5. May be quiet and withdrawn. 6.May be fearful of the abuser. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Special Care Protocols Suspected Child/Elder Abuse 12.2 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 Characteristics of the Abuser: 1. Crosses all religious, ethnic, occupational, educational, and socioeconomic boundaries. 2.May resent or reject the child. 3. May have feelings of worthlessness about self or about the child. 4. May have unrealistic expectations of what the child is capable of doing.5.May be very critical of the child. 6.Oftentimes the abuser is repeating what was learned as a child (the abuser was morethan likely abused as a child). 7. May be overly defensive rather than concerned. Presen tation: The patient may present with patterned burns or injuries suggesting intentional infliction, such as, injuries in varying stages of healing, injuries scattered over multiple areas of the body, fractures or injuries inconsistent with stated cause of injury. The patient, parent, or caregiver may respond inappropriately to the situation. Malnutrition or extreme lack of cleanliness of the patient or environment may indicate neglect. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (bulging fontanel and altered mental status in an infant may suggest Shaken Baby Syndrome) may also be seen. Pat ient Management: 1.Treat and stabilize injuries according to the appropriate Patient Care Protocol(s). 2.If sex ual abuse is suspected, document the reasons for concern. 3. Document the following information on the Patient Care Report (PCR): All verbatim statements made by the patient, the parent or caregiver(s) shall beplaced in quotation marks, including statements about how the injury may haveoccurred. Any abnormal behavior of the patient, parent(s), or caregiver(s) must be documented. Document the condition of the environment and other residents that are present.

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Special Care Protocols Personal Protective Equipment Exposure Control 12.3 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Type and Use of Personal Protective Equipment Gloves - For any patient contact, and when cleaning/disinfecting contaminated equipment. Puncture resistant gloves will be worn in situations where sharp orrough edges are likely to be encountered, i.e., auto extrication. Face Mask & Eye Protection - Facial protection will be used in any situationwhere splash contact with the face is possible. This protection may be afforded byusing both a face mask and eye protection, or by using a full- face shield. When treating a patient with a suspected or known airborne transmissible disease, N95Respirators should be used. For respiratory illnesses (TB, SARS) it is beneficial tomask the patient with a surgical mask Coverall/fluid resistant gowns - Designed to protect clothing from splashes,gowns may interfere with, or present a hazard to, the member in somecircumstances. Structural firefighting gear also protects clothing from splashesand is preferable in fire, rescue, or vehicle extrication activities. Shoe/Head Coverings - Fluid barrier protection will be used if suspectedcontamination is possible. Gen eral Precautions against disease If it's wet, it's infectious - use gloves If it could splash onto your face, use eye shields and mask or full face shield. If it's airborne, mask yourself with N95 Respirator and the patient with surgicalmask. If it can splash on your clothes, use a gown or structural firefighting gear. If it could splash on your head or feet, use appropriate barrier protection. Post Exposure Management Provide first aid. Secure area to prevent further contamination. (Stop bleeding with direct pressure). Remove contaminated clothing and flush. Wash the contaminated area well with soap and water, or waterless hand cleanser,and apply and antiseptic. If the eyes, nose, or mouth are involved, flush them well with large amounts ofwater.

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Special Care Protocols Electrical Control Device Removal 12.4 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Local law enforcement agencies have implemented the use of an Electrical Control Device (ECD) into their response to control a violent, potentially violent, or actively resisting patient. The Electrical Control Device uses a compressed nitrogen gas canister to discharge from a distance two electrode-tipped barbs. This protocol addresses under which conditions DC FEMS providers should remove these ECD darts. FEMS providers should not ask police to remove these darts. 1. Consi der scene safety and measures to protect oneself and other rescuers from a potentially violent patient in situations in which an ECD has been used. 2.The patient will continue to be in police custody during your assessment and this procedure. If indicated, ask the police to restrain or secure the patient. 3. Medically assess and treat the patient for any emergent condition (e.g., excited delirium) during this time. 4. Wear PPE with gloves and eye protection - consider mask and gown if obvious blood is present. 5. Have police remove TASER cartridge from gun before removing the dart. Do not cut the wires. 6. Grasp the dart itself firmly with one hand and pull to remove one dart at a time. Place the other hand on the patient's skin at least four inches away from the puncture. Do not scrapeyourself with the dart's barb upon removal. Do not remove by pulling on the wire. Carefully observe the end of the dart to confirm that the barb is present. If barb is not visible, the darthas not been fully removed. (See below.) Return the dart, wires, etc., to the police. 7. DO N OT REMOVE darts and instead transport to the hospital for removal if any of the following apply: oPatient is not under control. oHead, eye, face, neck, breast, hands, feet, genitalia or groin is involved. NOTE : Darts are a sharp hazard potentially contaminated with blood- borne pathogens . Treat darts as a contaminated needle and place in the ECD cartridge and return to the police. 8. Reassess the patient. Consider underlying causes of the patient's agitated behavior, e.g., drug or alcohol intoxication, trauma, psychiatric disease, or exc ited delirium.

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment P rotocols Major Incident Operations Mass Casualty Incident - SALT triage 13.1 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Purpose: To provi de structure to the triage and treatment of persons involved in a multiple or mass casualty incident or a multiple patient scene. This guideline works in conjunction with EMS Operations Bulletin 1, Mass Casualty Incidents , which defines the other processes at an MCI outside patient treatment and triage. Consider contacting the DC Hospital Coalition Notification Center early in the incident for MCI's at (877) 323-4262 or via TAC Channel 0H- 3 NOTIFY. Responsibility: All personnel are responsible for the information set forth in the following procedures. During an MCI primary care givers will be overwhelmed and all additional personnel will be expected to assist in the triage and treatment of patients. Definitions: A multiple or mass casualty incide nt is an emergency scene that creates a number of patients sufficient to significantly overwhelm available resources. Multiple Casualty Incident : <9 patients (does not need to be declared) Mass Casualty Incident : 9 or more patients (needs to be declared) Triage : The process of sorting and categorizing patients based on the severity of their symptoms. Patients will be categorized into the five following groups. Each group has a color designation to assist in the rapid sorting of triaged patients. Proce dure: DCFEMS Immediate Lifesaving Interventions Control of major hemorrhage Opening the airway (for pediatric patient provide two rescue breaths) Application of occlusive dressings (i.e., chest seals) Chest decompression Auto -injector antidotes DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment P rotocols Major Incident Operations Mass Casualty Incident - SALT triage 13.1 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 1.Patients will be categorized int o one of the five categories. RED (Immediate) Critically injured patients who must be transported as soon as resources allow. YELLOW (Delayed) Injured patients who must be evaluated and treated quickly due to the risk of deterioration but may not need immediate transport. GREEN (Minor) Those patients with minor injuries who do not need immediate treatment or transport. \"Walking wounded\" should be encouraged to congregate in a designated location/ casualty collection point. GRAY (Expectant) Patients who not deceased but are unlikely to survive given the available resources . Reevaluated/re - categorized as resources become available. BLACK (Deceased) Patients who are not breathing. Life-saving interventions can be considered , e.g., patients with no respiratory effort should be triaged in the black (deceased) category following an attempt to open the airway. Patients who are categorized as black shall be left in place as found. 2.Afte r initial triage and lif esaving interventions, attach a colored ribbon (if available) that correlates to the appropriate triage category of the patient. 3.Ree valuation of the patient and further interventions will take place after all patients have been triaged or more resources become available. The process of revaluation and re- categorization will be on -going. 4.The a pplication of Disaster Tags to patients can be attempted but is secondary to the above actions.

These chemicals are among the most toxic currently used in pesticides. Both classes of compounds have similar pharmacological actions, in that they both inhibit the effects of acetylcholinesterase, which is an enzyme that degrades acetylcholine at nerve terminals. When acetylcholinesterase is inhibited, acetylcholine accumulates at the synapses, resulting in the characteristic S/S of organophosphate and carbamate poisoning. Examp les TEPP / Dipter ex / Chlorthion / Di- Syston / Co- ral / Phosdrin/ Methylparathion Systex / EPN / Diazinon / Guthion / Trithion. The antidote kits are to be used in incidents of exposure to a nerve agent or organophosphate material. Auto-injectors contain Atropine Sulfate and Pralidoxime Chloride. Specific criteria will trigger this medical protocol. The decision to utilize the antidote should be based on clinical evaluation. Use of the antidote kit is to be based on signs and symptoms of the patient.Suspicion or the sim ple presence of a nerve agent is not sufficient reason to administer these medications. Use of antidotes will not protect responders from anticipated exposures. Symp toms of a Nerve Agent, Organophosphate, and Carbamate Poisoning: When a nerve agent is present, it interferes with the normal instructions of chemical transmitters that direct the muscle or gland to return to an unstimulated, relaxed state. The action of toxic nerve agents is to overstimulate the nerve endings and central nervous system. Overstimulation of the nervous system causes muscles and certain glands to overreact and cause predictable symptoms. The symptoms of the poisoned patient have been characterized by an acronym: M miosis (pinpoint pupils) S salivation (excessive drooling) Mild L lacrimation (tearing) Severe U urination (lose control of urine) D defecation / diarrhea G GI upset (cramps) E emesis (vomiting) M muscle (twitching, spasm, \"bag of worms\") C convulsion DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Major Incident Operations Organophosphate , Pesticide , Nerve Agent Poisoning 13.2 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 plus RES PIRATION - difficulty breathing / distress (short of breath, wheezing). plus AGIT ATION + CNS SIGNS - confusion, agitation, seizures, coma. 1.Evacu ation and decontamination procedures should be undertaken as soon as possible. Providers should be keenly aware of the possibility of cross- contamination and appropriate PPE should be employed. 2.Support the airway and provide supplemental Oxygen per the Airwa y Maintenance and Supplemental Oxygen protocol.

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Major Incident Operations Biological and Radiological Weapons 13.3 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Anthrax Poisoning Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore- forming bacterium Bacillus Anthracis. The serious forms of human anthrax are inhalation, cutaneous, and intestinal. Direct person -to-person spread of anthrax is extremely unlikely, if it occurs at all. There is no need to immunize or treat contacts of persons ill with anthrax. No treatment for household contacts No treatment for friends No treatment for coworkers, unless they also were exposed to the s ame source of infection Provide supportive patient care and decontamination as needed. Ricin Poisoning Ricin is a very potent protein toxin made from mash left over after processing castor beans for oil. Ricin is considered a threat as a biological weapon primarily because it is widely available; it is a category B agent/disease with a high fatality. It is water -soluble, odorless, tasteless and not inactivated by heat. Ricin inhibits protein synthesis. It is very toxic to cells. The toxin may be inhaled, ingested, or in some instances directly introduced into the body by injection. It is not transmissible by person to person. Ricin should be particularly suspected when severe pulmonary distress occurs in previously healthy individuals. Signs, symptoms and pathology manifestations of ricin toxicity vary with dose and route of exposure. Symptoms may mimic pneumonia or food poisoning depending on the route of transmission: Fever Cough/congestion Wheezing/shortness of breath Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea Hypotension (severe cases) Pulmonary Edema/Failure (severe cases) Provide supportive patient care and decontamination as needed. Acut e Radiation Syndrome During victim prioritization, first responders can use available radiation detection equipment to determine the presence of significant amounts of contamination on an individual. The monitoring equipment may also be used to qualitatively compare the amount of contamination on one victim to the contamination on other victims. This may aid in prioritizing victims for decontamination. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Major Incident Operations Biological and Radiological Weapons 13.3 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 At the post-decontamination monitoring point, first responders may use detection equipment to grossly assess the progress made in decontaminating victims. If operationally feasible, individuals who remain significantly contaminated following decontamination procedures should be subjected to additional decontamination. This will typically involve the victim returning to the contaminant removal/shower station for additional washing. Decontamination efforts should be reevaluated or suspended i f contamination levels are not being significantly reduced. The E nvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that no more than two additional decontamination attempts be performed for individuals with significant contamination remaining following the first decontamination attempt. An inability to reduce the measured radiation levels to near-background levels may suggest that the remaining contamination is internal. Alt hough lukewarm soapy water solution is considered ideal for most radiological decontamination scenarios, its use may not be practical or even r ecommended in certain cases. Unless soapy water is readily available or easy to make, it may not be practical to use it as a decontaminant. The incident commander should consider using alternative decontaminants or techniques in light of operational constraints. Foll owing decontamination, if practical, check each victim for remaining Contamination, using appropriate meter. If considerable contamination remains on a victim, the victim should return to the shower station for additional washing; however, d econtamination efforts for that individual should be reevaluated or suspended if contamination levels are not being significantly reduced. Multiple decontamination attempts are not generally recommended, since they are usually neither practical nor warran ted. After decontamination, victims can be released to the clean area for drying with clean towels, redressing with clean replacement clothing or blankets, and medical evaluation. If possible, privacy and modesty should be preserved throughout the decontamination process - from undressing to redressing. Provi de supportive patient care as need ed. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Major Incident Operations Pandemic Influenza 13.4 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Pandemic Influenza There is a continuous stream of information regarding the approaches to an outbreak of severe viral respiratory diseases, especially Pandemic Influenza. This disease outbreak would require significant operational changes in Fire and EMS operations, in conjunction with Public Health programs. There would be a variety of programs that would allow Fire and EMS providers to receive appropriate vaccination, prophylaxis, or treatment as the threat of the dis ease evolves. Discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this handbook, and would be accomplished at the time of the event in conjunction with the District's public health leaders, the Department's leadership and medical control, and local infectious disease experts. DC Fire and EMS Pre-Hospital Treatment Protocols Major Incident Operations Viral Pandemic Triage 13.5 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to pers on. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized COVID- 19 as a pandemic, and locally a State of Emergency and Public Health Emergency was declared in the District of Columbia. On March 13, 2020 the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. Wit h anticipated unprecedented patient volumes for DCFEMS and local emergency departments, it is necessary to implement a protocol that assists EMS clinicians in easily identifying NTL - eligible patients that may be appropriate to care for themselves safely at home, without transport to an emergency department. Does the patient have a suspected viral syndrome with at least two (2) of the following symptoms: fever higher than 100.0F, cough, body aches, or sore throat? If YES , pr oceed to the checklist below; if NO, use the appropriate DC FEMS protocol. Yes No Criteria Patient age is between 18 and 60 years old . Patient is immunosuppressed (e.g., HIV), or is taking medications that suppress the immune system (chemotherapy, organ transplant medications, etc.) Uncontrolled Diabetes (glucose > 200) Heart disease COPD or lung disease excluding stable asthma Any respiratory d istress Patient has a heart rate between 50-100 bpm Patient has a systolic blood pressure between 100-200 mmHg Respiratory rate between 12-20 breaths per minute Oxygen saturation (SpO2) > 93% Ambulatory oxygen saturation (SpO2) remains above 92% (see note 6) Clear lung sounds Patient can ambulate with only minimal assistance Nurse Triage Line agrees the patient is appropriate for home self-care DC Fire and EMS Pre-Hospital Treatment Protocols Major Incident Operations Viral Pandemic Triage 13.5 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 ANY CHECKS in a shaded box indicate that patient transport should be initiated. If ALL CHECKS are in non-shaded boxes, the patient should provide self- care at home. Call the Nurse Triage Line. The triage nurse will provide self- care instructions to the patient. Any patient may be transported at the EMT or Paramedic or Nurse Triage Line's discretion . This emergency protocol was issued by DCFEMS Office of the Medical Director, after approval by DC Health, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the declaration of a public health emergency in the District of Columbia . Notes: 1. Duri ng the patient assessment, p roviders shall use the appropriate PPE according to Appendix F, 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID- 19), of the Infection Control Program Policy and Procedures (N-95 or higher-level respirator, eye protection, gloves, gown, head and shoe covers). 2. As s oon as possible during the patient assessment, providers shall place a surgical mask on the patient unless otherwise not tolerated by the patient. 3.If poss ible, providers shall limit patient contact to only one provider. 4. All providers should attempt to maintain a distance of 6 feet or more from the patient when feasible and when it does not interfere with indicated patient care. 5. When l eaving the patient at home, the patient should demonstrate normal mental status, meet all inclusion criteria in the above protocol, have access to food and other necessities, and be left with self -care instructions from the Triage Nurse. 6. Mea sure SpO2 continuously while the patient walks 30 feet in the home or up 10 steps. May walk the patient in circles. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Major Incident Operations Viral Pandemic Care Modifications 13.6 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 In the setting of a worldwide COVID -19 p andemic, it is necessary for EMS to make modifications to specific practices and standards of care to help prevent the spread of the virus to healthcare providers and bystanders. Because the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted between people who are in close contact with one another through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, providers shall make the following modifications when providing respiratory care to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. 1. Provi ders who will directly care for or who will be within 6 feet of a patient with possible COVID-19 shall utilize full PPE as outlined in appendix F, 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID -19), of the Infection Control Program Policy and Procedures (N -95 or higher- level respirator, eye protection, gloves, gown, head and shoe covers). 2.Pro viders shall place a surgical mask on the patient as soon as possible and always before placing the patient in the transport unit unless it is not clinically feasible. 3. All providers shall avoid touching their head/face while working until after appropriate deco ntamination has occurred. 4.Minimiz e oropharyngeal suctioning as much as possible while maintaining a patent airway. 5. When providing oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula or non- rebreather mask , the lowest liter per minute flow necessary to maintain an O2 saturation of > 90% shall be used. 6. When pr oviding oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula or non -rebreather mask, place a surgical mask over the oxygen delivery device to further reduce the risk of spreading aerosolizedinfectious droplets. 7. Nebul ized bronchodilators increase the risk of aerosolizing infectious droplets. Thus, providers shall restrict the use of nebulized medications ( Albuterol and Atrovent , etc.) to only patients with truly severe life- threatening respiratory distress. Patients with only minimal to moderate respiratory distress shall not receive nebulized therapies in the prehospital setting. These treatments will be deferred to the hospital when the patient is in anappropriate isolation room. If avai lable, Metered Dose Inhaler Albutero l using a spacer can be used for a patient in respiratory distress with a history of asthma/COPD or who has wheezing onphysical exam . DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Major Incident Operations Viral Pandemic Care Modifications 13.6 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 Adult Pediatric Metered Dose Inhaler Albuterol BLS or ALS : 8 \"puffs\" with a spacer. May repeat once in 5 minutes . Metered Dose Inhaler Albuterol BLS or ALS : 4 \"puffs\" with a spacer . Contact medical control for a repeat dose. If the patient is in respiratory extremis with a history of asthma /COPD or has wheezing on physical exam, all providers shall consider early administration of epinephrine IM in the lateral aspect of the patient's thigh (before resorting to nebulized medication) . Adult Pediatric Epinephrine 1:1,000 BLS or ALS : 0.3 0.3-0.5 mg IM (ALS) Epinephrine 1:1,000 BLS or ALS : < 3y.o. 0.15 mg IM via EpiPen Jr. ALS: 0.01 mg/kg IM up to a maximum single dose 0.5 mg If the patient has a history of asthma/COPD or has wheezing on physical exam, ALS Providers shall consider early administration of Magnesium Sulfate IV (before resorting to nebulized medication). Adult Pediatric Magnesium Sulfate 2 gm slow IV Infusion . Mix 2 gm in 100 ml of Normal Saline. Utilize a 10 gtts set and infuse at 50 gtts/min over 20 minutes. Contact Medical Control 8. CPA P increases the risk of aerosolizing infectious droplets. Thus, providers shall restrict the use of CPAP to only patients with truly severe life- threatening respiratory distress. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Major Incident Operations Viral Pandemic Care Modifications 13.6 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 3 Patients with minimal to moderate respiratory distress shall be maintained in the prehospital setting on a non- rebreather mask or with a nasal cannula placed under surgical mask . 9.If a ne bulized bronchodilator and/ or CPAP is required in the prehospital setting due to truly severe life-threatening respiratory distress : Prov iders shall notify the receiving facility of this therapy as soon as possible before arrival. This allows the ED staff to make appropriate preparations. Upon ar rival at the hospital, stop the nebulized medication. Do NOT enter the ED actively nebulizing medication. Upon ar rival at the hospital, if possible, also stop CPAP and place a non- rebreather mask on the patient. If the patient's level of respiratory distress prevents the remova l of CPA P, notify the receiving facility as soon as possible before entering the ED. This allows the ED staff to make appropriate arrangements and provide further patient and facility -specific direction. 10. Provi ders shall use extreme caution when providing bag valve mask ventilation, placing a supraglottic airway, and when performing endotracheal intubation. These are aerosol- generating procedures, and full PPE for all providers is mandatory. These artificia l ventilation procedures should be deferred to the hospital whenever possible. They sh all only be performed in severe life-threatening situations. 11. Medi cation facilitated intubation shall not be performed in the prehospital setting on a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. M edication facilitated intubation of these patients should be performed by hospital staff utilizing advanced infection control techniques and advanced airway procedures not available in the prehospital setting. 12. For pa tients in respiratory or cardiac arrest during a viral pandemic, all providers shall be in full PPE . (N-95 or higher-level respirator, eye protection, gloves, gown, head and shoe covers). 13.For pat ients in respiratory or cardiac arrest during a viral pandemic, placement of a supraglottic airway is associated with less droplet production and less provider droplet exposure than with BVM or intubation via direct laryngoscopy. 14. When us ing a BVM, CPAP, or nebulizing medication, providers shall use a viral filter when available.

Continuous Quantitative Waveform Capnography (ETCO 2) should be considered for use on treated with CPAP, Epinephrine, Morphine and Midazolam. Proced ure: 1. Attach capnography to a patient or endotracheal tube. 2. Note ETCO2 level and waveform changes. These should be documented on each respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or respiratory distress patient. 3. The capnometer should remain in place with the airway and be monitored throughout the pre- hospital care and transport. 4. Any loss of ETCO2 detection or waveform indicates a potential airway problem and should be corrected. 5. The capnogram should be monitored as procedures are performed to verify or correct the airway problem. 6. In a perfusing patient, end-tidal ETCO2 levels of 35-45 mmHg are considered normal. 7. The numerical value can aid in assessing hypoventilation (increased ETCO 2), or hyperventilation (decreased ETCO 2) in perfusing patients. 8. Hyperventilation shall be avoided in patients in cardiac arrest or those with head injuries without signs / symptoms of herniation. 9.

Clinical indication for MFI Use of preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation Position for intubation Equipment used (blade and tube size, bougie, dose of medications etc.) Number of attempts If an attempt was unsuccessful , must document why Waveform capnography confirmation Notes : GCS < 8 is NOT a definitive indication for intubation. Paramedics must use their critical thinking skills to evaluate the patient's GCS, airway patency, cause of decreased GCS , and transport time to help guide the decision to intubate in the prehospital setting . Ide ntification and treatment of physiologic abnormalities (e.g., hypotension, hypoxia etc.) prior to intubation, when possible, is critically important to improving patient outcomes by preventing peri-intubation hemodynamic collapse and cardiac a rrest. An int ubation attempt is defined as any time that any laryngoscopy blade is inserted into the patients mouth. Each attempt at intubation significantly increase s patient mortality and morbidity ; thus, if the first intubation attempt fails , the par amedic must diagnose what went wrong in the first attempt before rushing to perform a second attempt. Always remember that theultimate patient- centered goal is airway maintenance with adequate oxygenation and ventilation, not the specific placement of an endotracheal tube. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management Medication Facilitated Intubation 14.1.5 Revision Date: March 1, Pg. 5 anes thetic that provides analgesia, anesthesia, and amnesia with minimal to no effect on the patient's respiratory drive while also preserving airway reflexes. Thus ketamine shall be used for MFI instead of etomidate or midazolam. Init ial and continuous ETT confirmation with waveform capnography (ETCO 2) is mandatory. Reliance on only clinical methods of tube confirmation (visualizing cords, lung sounds, absence of gastric sounds) is NOT reliable and results in unacceptably high rates of missed esophageal intubations. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management I-gel Supraglottic Airway 14.1.6 Revision Date: Ma y 1, 2021 Pg. 1 This procedure describes the indications for and procedural steps to place an i- gel\u00ae supraglottic airway in both adult and pediatric patients. The i-gel\u00ae is a latex free, single patient use device. It is designed to provide effective oxygenation and ventilation via a non- inflatable, anatomical seal of the pharyngeal, laryngeal and perilaryngeal structures. The i -gel\u00ae is approved for use by both BLS and ALS providers. Clinic al Indications: Primary advanced airway management device: oThe i -gel\u00ae may be placed as the initial airway device in certain cardiac arrest situations. (e.g., patient is difficult to BVM, limited number or only BLS personnel on- scene, special rescue operations , etc.) Alternative advanced airway management device: i.e., when intubation was unsuccessful oAfter any two unsuccessful intubation attempts . oAfter any one unsuccessful intubation attempt and it is felt that a second intubation attempt will also be unsuccessful. oAfter any one unsuccessful medication facilitated intubation attempt and the patient is experiencing critical oxygen desaturatio n. Cont raindications: Patient is conscious or semi -conscious or has an intact gag reflex . Patient has a valid MOST form or other actionable end-of- life medical order (e.g., POLST Form, DNR order, or Advanced Directive) that states the patient does not want advanced airway interventions. Unable to successfully place the device due to airway obstruction, trismus, or limited mouth opening, etc. Cautio ns: Do not use excessive force to insert the device or nasogastric tube. Inadequate levels of pain control and sedation (e.g., post ROSC) may lead to coughing, bucking, excessive salivation, vomiting, or laryngospasm. The i -gel\u00ae is not a definitive airway and thus does not prevent aspiration. Use with caution in patients at high risk for vomiting and aspiration.

Impor tant Note: While s ize selection on a weight basis should be applicable to most patients, individual anatomical variations mean the weight guidance provided should always be considered in conjunction with a clinical assessment of the patient's anatomy. Patients with cylindrical necks or wide thyroid/cricoid cartilages may require a larger size i -gel \u00ae than would normally be recommended on a weight basis. Equally, patients with a broad or stocky neck or smaller thyroid/cricoid cartilage may require a smaller size i- gel \u00ae than would normally be recommended on a weight basis. Patients with central obesity, where the main weight distribution is around the abdomen and hips, might in practice require an i- gel\u00ae of a size consistent with the ideal body weight for their height rather than their actual body weight.

Remove dentures or removable plates from the mouth before attempting i- gel\u00ae insertion. 5. Open t he i-gel\u00ae package and take out the protective cradle containing the device. Remove the i-gel\u00ae and transfer it to the palm of the same hand that is holding the protective cradle, supporting the device between the thumb and index finger. 6.Open the sachet of water -based lubricant and place a small bolus onto the middle of the smooth surface of the protective cradle in preparation for lubrication. Do NOT use silicone -based lubricants. 7.Gras p the i-gel\u00ae with the opposite (free) hand along the integral bite block and lubricate the back, sides, and front of the cuff with a thin layer of lubricant. 8.If the patient is not ready for immediate i- gel\u00ae insertion, place the lubricated device back into the protective cradle until ready for insertion . 9. When r eady for i- gel\u00ae insertion, r emove the lubricated i-gel\u00ae from the protective cradle. Grasp the i -gel\u00ae firmly along the integral bite block. Position the device so that the i- gel\u00ae is facing towards the chin of the patient. The patient should be in the \"sniffing position\" with head extended and neck flexed. The chin should be gently pressed down before proceeding. Introduce the leading soft tip of the i- gel\u00ae into the mouth of the patient in a direction towards the hard palate. The i -gel's tip must follow the curvature of the patient's hard palate upon insertion. Impor tant Note: it is not necessary to insert fingers or thumbs into the patient's mouth during the process of inserting the device. Impor tant Note: if there is early resistance during insertion, a \"jaw thrust\" or \"insertion with Impor tant Note: the i- gel\u00ae is supplied in a protective cradle or cage pack to ensure the device is retained in the correct flexion prior to use. The i- gel\u00ae must always be separated from the cradle prior to insertion. The cradle is NOT an introducer and must never be inserted into the patient's mouth. 10. Gli de the device downwards and backwards along the hard palate with a continuous but gentle push until a definiti ve resistance is felt. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management I-gel Supraglottic Airway 14.1.6 Revision Date: Ma y 1, 2021 Pg. 5 When properly placed, the teeth should rest at a level on the i- gel\u00ae between the logo and the size number. A horizontal line (adult sizes 3, 4, and 5 only) at the middle of the integral bite -block represents the correct position of the teeth. Impor tant Note: sometimes a feel of \"give -away\" is felt before the end point resistance is met. This is due to the passage of the bowl of the i- gel\u00ae through the faucial pillars. It is important to continue to insert the device until a definitiveresistance is felt. 11. As s oon as insertion has been completed, hold the i- gel\u00ae in the correct position until and while the device is being secured in place. 12. Att ach BVM to the 15-mm connector and begin appropriate ventilation rate and volume per patient age and clinical condition. Be sure to keep the passive oxygenation port capped when providing BVMventilation through the 15-mm connector. 13. Confi rm proper position by auscultation, chest movement and verification of continuous quantitative waveform capnography (ETCO 2). 14.Secur e the i -gel\u00ae. For size 3,4, and 5 utilize the airway support strap provided in the Resus Pack . The wide central band of the strap should be located directly under the neck of the patient . Ensure there is sufficient tension to hold the i- gel\u00ae securely in place but not excessive tension that may cause trauma to the patient's neck or face or that may cause unwanted downward pressure on the i- gel\u00ae. For sizes 1,1.5, and 2 the i- gel\u00ae should be taped in place \" maxilla to maxilla \" (upper jaw to upper jaw). See figure below. Impor tant Note: intubating through the i- gel\u00ae by blindly passing a gum-elastic bougi e has been described. This technique is extremely challenging in the prehospital setting and results in unacceptabl y high rates of intubation failure and complication . Thus, blind intubation attempts through the i- gel\u00ae shall not be performed by FEMS personnel. 13.If avai lable, insert the appropriate size nasogastric tube down the gastric channel to decompress the stomach, decrease the risk of vomiting and aspiration, and to improveoxygenation and ventilation. After insertion of the NG tube through the i- gel \u00ae gastric channel into the stomach, hook up the NG tube to portable or on-board suction. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management I-gel Supraglottic Airway 14.1.6 Revision Date: Ma y 1, 2021 Pg. 6 14. Document the procedure in the ePCR. Genera l notes: The i -gel\u00ae is a truly anatomical device, achieving a mirrored impression of the pharyngeal, laryngeal and perilaryngeal structures, without causing compression or displacement trauma to the tissues and structures in the vicinity. Do not r euse or attempt to reprocess t he i-gel\u00ae. The i-gel\u00ae is easy to use, insertion can normally be achieved in less than 5 seconds, by a proficient user. No at tempt should be made to use i- gel\u00ae as a conduit for intubation in the prehospital setting. This shall only be performed with fiber optic guidance in the hospital setting. Exces sive air leak , around the bowl or through the gastric channel, during manual ventilation is most likely due to the i- gel\u00ae not being placed deep enough against the laryngeal and pharyngeal tissues. In such ins tances, remove the device and reinsert with a gentle jaw thrust appl ied by an assistant or a deep rotation to achieve an optimum depth of insertion. The anatomical design and soft material of the i- gel\u00ae are less likely to cause adverse outcomes when compared with other supraglottic devices. The clinical evidence currentlyavailable suggests i -gel \u00ae may cause fewer secretions in the pharynx and hypopharynx than some other supraglottic airways. If there is failure to achieve comp lete insertion after utilizing the standard insertion technique an d a jaw thrust or deep rot ation maneuver , the device can be inserted under direct vision by laryngoscopy or one a size smaller i -gel\u00ae should be used.

Occ lusion of the catheter and re-expansion of the tension pneumothorax may occur. Providers must frequently reassess for the need to repeat needle chest decompression. Repeat needle chest decompression as indicated. Leave the previous catheter(s) in place. Genera l notes: Non-tension (simple) pneumothorax is not immediately life threatening and should NOT be decompressed in the prehospital setting . Posi tive pressure ventilation (e.g., BVM, supraglottic airway, intubation) may lead to the development of a pneumothorax and or rapid progression from simple pneumothorax to tension pneumothorax. Studi es have shown improved success in reaching the thoracic cavity in adult patients when the 4th or 5th intercostal space in the anterior axillary or mid axillary line is used instead of the 2nd intercostal space in the mid clavicular line. ATLS now reco mmends this location for needle decompression in adult patients. The location for chest decompression in children remains unchanged, and the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line should still be used. Laan DV et al.

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management Video Laryngoscopy 14.1.10 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Background: Current scientific literature on the use of video laryngoscopy (VL) in the prehospital setting is favorable. Multiple studies have shown that the use of VL by paramedics markedly increases both the overall likelihood of intubation success as well as the first attempt success rate compared to standard direct laryngoscopy. The use of Video Laryngoscopy is strongly preferred for all intubations by the DCFEMS Office of the Medical Director . The V L device currently utilized by DCFEMS is the Glide Scope Go. This device offers both a disposable standard geometry and hyperangulated laryngoscope blade. The standard geometry blade mirro rs the shape and size of a traditional direct laryngoscope Macintosh blade. The hyperangulated blade has an extreme anterior curve. This difference is important as outlined in the procedure below. Clinic al Indications The i ndications for performing VL are the same as for all techniques of oral intubation. See Orotracheal Intubation Protocol and Medication Facilitated Intubation Protocol. Cont radictions The contraindications for performing VL are the same as for all techniques of oral intubation. See Orotracheal Intubation Protocol and Medication Facilitated Intubation Protocol. Proced ure for using Standard Geometry VL: 1. Follow the steps outlined in the Orotracheal Intubation Protocol. 2.Utilize the same insertion , blade manipulation , and tube passage techniques as traditional direct laryngoscopy. 3. Vis ually confirm successful placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) through the vocal cords on the video screen in addition to verifying tube placement via continuous waveform capnography. ALS DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management Video Laryngoscopy 14.1.10 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 Proced ure for using Hyperangulated Geometry VL : 1. Follow the steps outlined in the Orotracheal Intubation Protocol making the following adjustments for the extreme anterior curve of the hyperangulated blade: Lead with suction. Suction the oropharynx and posterior pharynx prior to inserting the VL blade. Inse rt the hyperangulated blade directly in the midline of the mouth slowly curling around the base of the tongue. Sweeping the tongue to the left is NOT necessary when using a hyperangulated VL device. Duri ng blade insertion, keep the tip of the hyperangulated blade pressed close against the tongue to avoid contaminating the camera with pooled secretions in the posteriorpharynx. Tip of the hyperangulated blade should be inserted into the vallecula and a gentle rocking motion used to expose the larynx. Over inserting the hyperangulated VL blade too deep resulting in a very up- close view of the glottic opening down into the trachea should be avoided. This up-close view of the glottic opening makes endotracheal tube delivery very difficult and sometimesimpossible. The ideal screen view for intubation is with the epiglottis and glottic opening only seen in the top half of the video screen thus maximizing the visual field for tube manipulation and decreasing the angle for tube delivery. The s tylet and ETT should be shaped to match the curvature of the hyperangulated blade. Once the desired view of the glottic opening is obtained on the video screen, the ETT is inserted into the mouth under direct observation to avoid upper airway trauma. Thismeans taking attention away from the video screen for a brief period to safely insert thetube into the mouth. Once the tube passes the vocal cords and enters the trachea, the highly curved stylet may get caught on the anterior tracheal wall. If this occurs, the stylet should be partially withdrawn by the operator or assistant so the tip of the tube will straighten out and bemore easily passed down the trachea. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management Video Laryngoscopy 14.1.10 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 3 2. Visually confirm successful placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) through the vocal cor ds on the video screen in addition to verifying tube confirmation via continuous waveform capnography. 3. If bl ood or secretions obstruct the camera at any point during the intubation, you must remove the blade, deploy suction, wipe off the camera lens and initiate an additional attempt. You can NOT perform direct laryngoscopy with a hyperangulated blade. Note s: W hen using standard direct laryngoscopy, the goal is to compress and displace the upper airway tissues so that a direct line of sight can be achieved between the operator's eye and the glottic opening. In contrast, when using VL, an indirect view of the glottic opening is obtained, i.e. , by placing a camera on the end of the laryngoscope blade an \"eye\" is placed down in the airway so that the operator can look around obstructing tissues rather than relying on their displacement. In c omparison to direct laryngoscopy, the advantages of video laryngoscopy include: oNo longer needing a direct line of sight to the glottic opening thus facilitatingeasier identification of the necessary airway anatomy oMagnif ies the view of the airway oRequires less strength/force to intubate oAllow s colleagues and assistants to visualize and help with the procedure oAllow s instructors and preceptors to more easily supervise the procedure when performed by trainees oAllow s for video recording of intubations which can be used for procedural documentation, provider education and training. All ETT's placed by VL must be confirmed as correctly placed in the trachea on the video screen AND with continuous waveform capnography (ETCO 2). It i s up to the paramedic performing the intubation whether to use the standard geometry or hyperangulated blade. However, the following situations are frequently best managed utilizing the hyperangulated blade: oFailure of the standard geometry blade due to a high anterior airway oLimited neck mobility (e.g., due to age, surgery, or spinal motion restriction) oInability to get in a standard intubating position oVery short neck oLimited mouth opening and or large tongue (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management Endotracheal Tube Introducer Bougie 14.1.11 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Clinical Indications : Difficult intubation with a restricted view of the glottic opening. This may occur due to: oShort, thick (bull) above the glottic patient appropriately (e.g. entrapment, confinedspace). Cont raindications : Pediatric patients under the age of 14. Proced ure: Hyperventilate the patient with 100% oxygen for at least one minute prior to eachintubation attempt. Note, however, that this step should be omitted whenventilation (demonstrated by rise and fall of the chest) proves impossible. Prepare the ET tube and other intubation equipment (minimum 6.0 mm ET tube). Curve the bougie and ensure the distal tip is formed into a \"J\" shape; Perform a laryngoscopy, obtaining the best possible view of the glottic opening. Advance the bougie, continually observing its distal tip, with the concavity facinganteriorly; Visualize the tip of the bougie passing the vocal cords. Once the tip of the bougie has passed the epiglottis, continue to advance it in themid-line so that it passes behind the epiglottis but in an anterior direction. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management Endotracheal Tube Introducer Bougie 14.1.11 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 As t he tip of the bougie ent ers the glottic opening you will either feel 'clicks' as it passes over the tracheal rings or the tip will arrest against the wall of the airways ('hold -up'). This suggests correct insertion, although cannot be relied upon to indicate correc t positioning with 100% accuracy. HOWEVER, FAILURE TO ELICIT CLICKS OR HOLD -UP IS INDICATIVE OF ESOPHAGEAL PLACEMENT . If hold -up is felt, the bougie should then be withdrawn approximately 5 cm to avoid the ET tube impacting against the carina. Hold the bougie firmly in place and MAINTAIN LARYNGOSCOPY. oInstruct your colleague to pass the endotracheal tube over the proximal end of thebougie. oAs the proximal tip of the bougie is re-exposed, the assistant should carefully grasp it,assuming control of the bougie and passing control of the ET tube to the intubator. oThe ET tube should then be carefully advanced ('rail-roaded') along the bougie andhence through the glottic opening, taking care to avoid movement of the bougie. oSUCCESSFUL INTUBATION MAY BE CONSIDERABLY ENHANCED BYROTATING THE ET TUBE 90\u00ba, SO THAT THE BEVEL FACESPOSTERIORLY . In so doing the bougie may also rotate along the same plane but should not be allowed to move up or down the trachea. Once the ET tube is fully in place hold it securely as your colleague withdraws thebougie. Withdraw the laryngoscope. Inflate the cuff. Then verify correct positioning of the ET tube using auscultation of thelung fields and epigastrium and observing for chest wall movement. Secure the ET tube. The tip of the ET tube can move up to 6.0 cm once placed and this iscertainly sufficient to dislodge it from the trachea. Document the procedure and results on the patient care report (PCR).

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management Stoma Airway Maintenance 14.1.13 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Background : Tr ache ostomy patients with an In-Dwelling Tube or Stoma. Most patients with a permanent tracheostomy (with tube or stoma) can adequately breathe through the opening. Some of these patients have complete surgical reconstruction of the airway andbreathe only through the tube or stoma, while other patients may have the openingto the mouth and can breathe through the tracheostomy tube, stoma, nose, ormouth. If air escaping is felt or heard at the nose or mouth when ventilating a partial neckbreather, the nose and mouth must be sealed (pinching the nose closed and closingthe mouth using a jaw lift) prior to ventilating the patient. Tracheostomy patients requiring ventilatory assistance require specializedtechniques be employed in order to be properly ventilated. oEMS personnel must identify the tracheostomy site and tube (if present). oCheck the tracheostomy tube or stoma for any blockage. oLook, listen, and feel for breathing at the tube or stoma site. oAssess for breathing and adequacy of respirations. Clinic al Indications : Respiratory arrest. Cardiac arrest. Hypoventilation. Severe respiratory distress due to an obstructed tracheostomy tube. Proced ures: If a tracheostomy tube has the standard 15 mm adapter and the patient can be ventilated through the tube : 1.Attach a BVM to the adapter. 2.Ventilate with a bag -valve mask and 100% oxygen. 3.Assess for adequacy of ventilations and check for leaks. 4.

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management PEEP Valve 14.1.14 Revision Date: January 1, 2022 Pg. 1 This procedure describes the indications for and clinical use of a P ositive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) Valve attached to a BVM. ALL PROVIDER LEVELS Clinic al Indications : All patients receiving assisted positive pressure ventilation via BVM , supraglottic airway, or endotracheal tube should have the PEEP valve attached to the bag valve and utilized as clinical condition dictates. Cont raindications: None Caut ions: Cardiac Arrest Pneumothorax Age adjusted (SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 60 mmHg in adults) Comp lications: PEEP increases intrathoracic pressure which can result in decreased venous blood return to the heart (decreased preload) and thus decreased cardiac output and hypotension. PEEP increases intrathoracic pressure which can contribute to a simple pneumothorax developing into a tension pneumothorax. Proced ure: 1. Support airway and provide supplemental oxygen per Airway Maintenance and Supplemental Oxygen Protocol . 2. Rem ove the BVM exhalation port cover and attach the PEEP valve. 3.Set PEEP to 5 cm H 2O. 4.For patients NOT in cardiac arrest, increase PEEP by 5 cm H2O every 3 -5 minutes as needed to improve hypoxia and achieve the clinically indicated SpO 2. Most patients will only require 5-10 cm H 2O of PEEP to maintain goal SpO 2. PEEP of > 10 cm H 2O should rarely be required and increases the likelihood of the patient experiencing one of the complications listed above. Consult with medical control if > 15 cm H 2O is required. Maximum PEEP is 20 cm H 2O. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Airway Management PEEP Valve 14.1.14 Revision Date: January 1, 2022 Pg. 2 5.If the patient has increase d difficulty breathing, worsening respiratory failure, or increased resistance to positive pressure ventilation, then assess for a tension pneumothorax and treat as indicated. See Needle Thoracostomy Procedure. 6.If th e patient is hypotensive prior to or becomes hypotensive with the use of PEEP, treat the hypotension accordingly (e.g., IV fluids) and utilize the lowest amount of PEEP possible while still maintaining an appropriate SpO 2. 7.If clinically indicated, administer medications for treatment of asthma, COPD, or pulmonary edema per appropriate protocol concurrent with positive pressure ventilation with PEEP . 8.Special Circumstance: ***U se of PEEP valve during cardiac arrest *** Be sure to keep the PEEP valve set at 5 cm H 2O or less during cardiac arrest to maximize venous return and cardiac preload. Do NOT increase PEEP above 5 cm H2O during chest compressions. Once return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved, titrate the PEEP as necessary to maintain desired SpO 2. MEDICAL CONTROL OPTIONS 1. C ons ult with medical control if > 15 cm H 2O is required to maintain goal SpO 2. Genera l notes: PEEP refers to the application of additional pressure at the end of expiration to maintainpressure in the alveoli above that of atmospheric pressure. PEE P improves oxygenation in patients with pulmonary edema or other fluids in the lungs (such as pneumonia) by preventing collapse of the alveoli at end expiration and reopeningalready collapsed alveoli so they can participate in gas exchange. PEEP also helps prevent repeated opening and closing of the alveoli which is thought to cause lung injury. If transporting a patient from one medical facility to another ( e.g., from a nursing home to an emergency department) and PEEP has already been established and the patient is toleratingit, continue the PEEP at the previously established level. PEE P decreases preload and in patients who are hypovolemic, hypotensive, or experiencing heart failure, PEEP can have significant negative effects on the patient's hemodynamicstatus.

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Cardiac Management Transcutaneous Cardiac Pacing 14.2.7 Revision Date: September 24, 202 2 Pg. 3 Start at 30 mA. Increase outp ut every 10 seconds until there is ECG evidence of electrical capture. 11. Once both electrical and mechanical capture is achieved , increase pacer output 10% above threshold to maintain capture . Electrical capture is determined by the presence of a pacing spike followed by a widened QRS complex, the loss of any underlying intrinsic rhythm, and the appearance of an extended, and sometimes enlarged T wave. Mechanical capture is assessed by palpation of a peripheral pulse that c orresponds to each electrically paced complex on t he monitor. Important Note: the ideal pacer current is the lowest value that maintains both electrical and mechanical capture - it is usually about 10% above threshold. Typical threshold currents range from 40 -80 mA. Important Note: to avoid mistaking muscular respons e to pacing stimuli for arterial pulsations, check for a pulse using ONLY a femoral artery or the right brachial or radial artery. Do NOT use the carotid pulse to assess for capture. Important Note: changing the ECG lead being viewed on the monitor and increasing the size can sometimes be helpful in determining electrical capture. 12. After electrical and mechanical capture is obtained , reassess vital signs, skin color, and capillary refill for improved perfusion. 13. Document the response to external pacing in the patient care report (PCR).

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/EMS Procedures Broselow Pediatric Emergency Tape 14.4.1 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Background : The B rose low Pediatric Emergency Tape is designed to be used as a quick reference to drug dosing and equipment sizing on pediatric patients. The Broselow tape is calibrated in different colors according to different lengths. The color that corresponds to the patient's length is used. If the Broselow bag is also used, the color on the tape can be matched with the color on the pouch that contains the appropriately sized equipment and drugs. Proced ure: 1. Place the patient in a supine position. 2.Remove tape from package and unfold. 3. Place tape next to patient, ensuring that the multicolored side is facing up.4. Place red end of tape even with the top of the patient's head.5. Place the edge on one hand on the red end of the tape.6. Starting from the head, run the edge of your free hand down the tape.7. Stop hand even with the heel of the patient's foot (if patient is larger than tape, stop here and use appropriate adult technique). 8. Verbalize the color block (on edge of tape) and weight range where your free hand has stopped. If patient falls on the line, go to the next higher section. 9. Use color block (on edge of tape) to identify the weight range of the patient.10. Use weight range to determine appropriate sized of equipment and approximate dosages for medications. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/EMS Procedures Helmet Removal 14.4.2 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Background : The he lmet removal procedure is a guideline designed in two parts. Part I is for those patients wearing a motorcycle, bicycle, or other non-football type head protective device. Part II is designed for those patients wearing a football helmet. Non-Fo otball Helmets 1.Perform a Primary Survey if possible. Also, if the situation permits, ascertain if thevictim has the ability to move their extremities. If unable to perform a primarysurvey, go to step 2. 2.The in -charge rescuer should designa te a trained rescuer (Rescuer II) to manually control the cervical spine. The in-charge rescuer should kneel beside the patient andremove the chin strap device. A third rescuer should prepare padding for use to keepthe spine in a neutral position. 3.The in -charge rescuer should then take control of the cervical spine from a side position to the patient. Rescuer II should then relinquish control of the cervical spineto the in -charge rescuer. 4. Rescuer II should remove the helmet by spreading the sides of the helmet and removing the helmet using caution not to manipulate the cervical spine. The in- charge rescuer should be prepared to hold the head, as when the helmet is removed there willbe an increase in weight. 5. A pad may need to be inserted under the patient's head to maintain position of the c- spine. Cervical spine control should then be maintained by rescuer II. 6.The in -charge rescuer should then resume the primary survey, further assessment and interventions. Foo tball Helmets 1.Perform a Primary Survey. Als o, if the situation permits, ascertain if the victim has the ability to move all extremities. 2.If the football helmet fits and the airway is maintainable with the helmet in place, donot remove the helmet. Immobilize manually and complete the primary survey. Iftransportation is necessary, the cervical spine should be immobilized with the helmetand shoulder pads in place. A CID, towels, or blanket rolls may be used toimmobilize the head on a back board. The face mask may be removed. 3.If the football helmet does not fit correctly or the airway is not maintainable with thehelmet in place, then the helmet needs to be removed.

The in -charge rescuer should kneel beside the patient and remove the chin strap, ear pads, and remove the face mask retainers. (If not already done) A third rescuer should prepare padding for use to keep the spine in a neutral position. 5.The in -charge rescuer should then take control of the cervical spine from a side position to the patent. Rescuer II should then relinquish control of the cervical spine to the in- charge rescuer. 6. Rescuer II should remove the helmet by spreading the sides of the helmet and removing it from the head without moving the cervical spine. The in -charge rescuer should be prepared to hold the head, as when the helmet is removed there will be an increase in weight. Paddingmay need to be inserted under the patient's head to maintain neutral position. Cervical spinecontrol should then be maintaine d by rescuer II. 7. If shoulder pads need to be removed, the helmet should be removed prior to the shoulder pads. When removing shoulder pads remove the straps and lift on side of the pads prior tolog-rolling. Then after rolling the patient on their side, finish removing the shoulder pads. Acervical immobilization device (CID) pad or a 1\" pad may be sufficient to maintain neutralalignment of the cervical spine. 8. Immobilize on a long backboard using a cervical collar, straps, and a cervical immobilization device. Continue the assessment. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/EMS Procedures Physical Restraints 14.4.3 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Combative Patient Restraint - Adult & Pediatric : There are many reasons why a patient may be combative - mental illness, drug/alcohol ingestion, post-ictal state, hypoxia, traumatic head injuries or from an unknown etiology. The priority when caring for medical patients who present with combative behavior is to identify and treat the underlying cause. Note: Prior to restraining a patient, the EMS provider must assess the patient's mental status and determine whether the patient presents a potential or definite life threat to themselves or others. Pat ient Management : If patient has an altered mental status: Ensure adequate assistance is available to restrain the patient. All personnel should be instructed as to how the patient will be restrained. Thiswill ensure the safety of the patient as well as emergency personnel. Restrain the patient. Document. Assess the patient continuously to prevent complications until turned over to EDpersonnel. Rest raint procedure: 1.Soft medical restraints only are secured to each extremity. 2. Place patient supine on a long backboard (LBB). 3.Both lower extremities are secured to the LBB. 4. Left arm is secured to the LBB beside the patient's body.5. Right arm is flexed above the patient's head and secured to the LBB by the wrist.6. Patient's body is secured to the LBB using straps.7.Perform a complete assessment on the patient and reassess every 5 minutes. 8. Notify the receiving facility of transport. 9.Consider the use of chemical restraint (See Behavioral / Psychological Emergencies Protocol). 10. The use of medication mandates continuous observation by the paramedic, to prevent respiratory arrest, insufficiency, or aspiration. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/EMS Procedures Physical Restraints 14.4.3 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 Suici dal patient who is alert and oriented as normal and refusing transport : 1.Attempt to convince the patient to allow transport, use family and/or friends to assist. However, family/friends may agitate the patient and need to be distanced. 2.Request the assistance of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). 3. All personnel should be instructed as to how the patient will be restrained. This will ensure the safety of the patient as well as emergency personnel. 4.Restrain the patient. 5.Perform a complete assessment on the patient and reassess every 5 minutes. 6. Notify the receiving facility of transport and ask for security personnel to be available upon arrival, if needed. Docu menting a Restraint Procedure: 1.Reason(s) why restraint was necessary. 2. Any assessment findings obtained through observation (injuries, behavior, mental status, etc.) prior to restraining. 3.Describe the pos ition in which the patient was restrained. 4.Time the patient was restrained. 5.

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/EMS Procedures Tourniquet Use 14.4.4 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Clinic al Indications : A tourniquet may be used to control hemorrhage in extremities that is severe, potentially life or limb threatening, and unable to be controlled by direct pressure. For any traumatic total or partial amputation, a tourniquet should be applied as proximal- high on the limb - as possible above the amputation, regardless of current hemorrhage. Cont raindications: Non-extremity sites of hemorrhage such as the head, neck, or torso. Precau tions: A tourniquet applied incorrectly can increase blood loss and be generally ineffective. Tourniquets currently approved for use are meant for use on extremities but are not effective on axillary or groin vascular injuries. In axillary or pressure, wound packing, hemostatic agent, and compression bandage use. A commercially made tourniquet is the preferred tourniquet. If none is available, a bloodpressure cuff inflated to a pressure sufficient to stop bleeding can be tried only until acommercially made tourniquet is available. If utilizing this type of improvisedtourniquet, the EMS provider must ensure the effectiveness of the improvised device.Blood pressure cuffs will gradually lose pressure and need re -inflation or the Velcro closure may come loose. Severe pain may occur with tourniquet application. Analgesics are usually needed. Procedure: Use of our own department issued tourniquets is preferred if immediately available. Att empt to control hemorrhage via direct pressure (at the site of the bleeding as well as pulse points) while preparing tourniquet. Kneel on extremity at pulse points such as the brachial artery or femoral artery. ALS - BLS DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/EMS Procedures Tourniquet Use 14.4.4 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 2 Apply tourniquet according to manufacturer specifications and using the steps below: oIf able to fully expose and evaluate wound, apply tourniquet directly over the skin and not over clothing. Always apply tourniquets as proximal - high on the limb aspossible. oThe following circumstances may create time or resource limitations that requireapplying the tourniquet over clothing: (1) Hemorrhage is severe enough that loss of life or limb is imminent. (2) An active threat environment restricts provider actions.(3) Patient volume and acuity exceeds available resources. oDo not apply a tourniquet over a joint. oTighten tourniquet until bleeding stops and pulses distal to tourniquet are no longer palpable. oMark the time of each tourniquet application. oEnsure tourniquet is not obscured by dressings or clothing. oReassess tourniquet efficacy after moving patient, and at least every 15 minutes thereafter. If it is noted at any time that a tourniquet has become ineffective asevidenced by continued bleeding or palpable distal pulses, identify cause of failure(e.g. tourniquet over clothing, improper application, faulty device, blood pressure cuffhas lost pressure). Consider tightening tourniquet. DO NOT remove tourniquet. oIf tourniquet is still ineffective, locate a suitable site for application of a secondtourniquet, preferably proximal to the first tourniquet. oKeep tourniquet on throughout all care phases - a correctly applied tourniquet should only be removed by the receiving hospital. oProvide pain management as per our protocols.

DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/EMS Procedures Hemostatic Agents 14.4.6 Revision Date: March 1, 2021 Pg. 1 Clinic al Indications : Serious hemorrhage. Consider use especially in areas in which mechanical tourniquets cannot be physically applied (e.g. groin, axilla, torso, neck, or head) Used in concert with other hemorrhage control procedures (e.g. direct pressure,compression bandage, tourniquets), especially when one procedure alone is noteffective. Cont raindications: Wounds involving open thoracic cavity pleura), eyeball,exposed brain tissue/meninges. Minor hemorrhage Hemorrhage controlled by direct pressure and/or the application of a tourniquet Precau tions: EMS providers must ensure wound is packed tightly with hemostatic gauze andpacked fully, with all space in the wound cavity occupied by hemostatic gauze and/or non- hemostatic rolled gauze. Hemostatic gauze does not replace direct pressure. It must be used in conjunctionwith direct pressure. Procedure: 1.Pack the interior of the wound cavity with the hemostatic gauze. Then pack with non-hemo static rolled gauze, until packing material is building a small mound out of the wound opening. 2.The goal is to have the hemostatic agent in contact with the disrupted vasculatureinside the wound cavity prior to packing and compressing the wound. 3.In the ab sence of hemostatic gauze providers are to utilize non -hemostatic rolled gauze alone for wound packing. This can still be effective at promoting clotting. 4.After wound packing, apply direct pressure for up to 3 minutes followed by acompression/pressure dressing.

This protocol is for use during clinical or logistical situations that are unmanageable utilizing the typical pain management strategies described in the Pain Management protocol . Inclusion Criteria: Patient presen ts with a life or limb threatening condition that requires a prehospital procedure that wi ll result in severe or otherwise unmanageable pain and or anxiety . Examples may include: o Field amputation by a trauma center surgical strike team. o Extrication or disentanglement from a traumatic incident. o CPR induced consciousness during cardiac arrest. o Percutaneous cricothyrotomy . o Transcutaneous pacing. o Synchronized cardioversion . OR Patient presents with a life or limb threatening condition that is so severely painful, the patient requires dissociation to comply with treatment and transport. Examples may include: o Severe traumatic injury requiring movement and stabilization (e.g., partial extremity amputation, hip dislocation, major impaled object, etc.) o Severe large surface area burns without indication for endotracheal intubation. Exclusion Criteria: Presenting condition can be managed utilizing the Pain Management protocol . Patient has indications for medication facilitated intubation an d it is logistically feasible to perform the intubation. See Medication Facilitated Intubation protocol. and Post Invasive Advanced Airway Management protocol. Behavioral emergencies such as h yperactive or excited delirium. See Behavioral Psychological Emergencies protocol. Important Note: ketamine shall NOT be used to control or sedate patients with acute behavioral emergencies.

Dissociative sedation: patients undergoing dissociative sedation with ketamine often have their eyes open throughout the procedure b ut do not feel pain, are unable to follow commands , and have inconsistent responses to touch and voice. Amnesia typically occurs during dissociative sedation. Amnesia: the inability to remember events f rom a period of time . Surgical strike team: a team of hospital -based clinicians , led by a n attending trauma surgeon , that is on -call at a local trauma center to respond to entrapments and entanglements that require advanced surgical procedures to extricate or resuscitate a patient (e.g., field amputation, REBOA catheter placement, etc.) Treatment and Interventions: 1. Initiate General Assessment and Universal Patient Care for medical patient or General Trauma Management protocol for injured patient. Unless the pati ent is unable to communicate, i dentify the patient 's allergies to medications prior to administration of any medication . 2. Support airway and provide supplemental oxygen per Airway Maintenance and Supplemental Oxygen protocol. If logistically feasible, place patient on supplemental oxygen (minimum 6 L via nasal cannula) prior to initiating procedural dissociation to help prevent the development of hypoxia. 3. If the clinical and logistical presentation allows, explain to the patient both the procedure to be performed and the need to perform procedural dis sociation. Obtain verbal consent from the patient if clinically and logistically feasible. 4. Place patient on continuous EKG monitoring. If dysrhythmia is present, proceed to the appropriate protocol. 5. Place patient on continuous ETCO 2 and pulse oximetry m onitoring . Increases in ETCO 2 can be a subtle indicator of hypoventilation and over -sedation. Important note: during a confined space/technical rescue , clinical monitoring may not be logistically possible while performing a procedural dissociation for extrication /disentanglement . These situations are rare, and every effort shall be made to place the patient on continuous monitoring equipment as soon as possible during the rescue operation .

Two sites of venous access may be beneficial but is not required. 7. Continue injury or illness specific treatment per applicable protocol. 8. Measure and document level of pain during initial assessment , before , and after any intervention per Pain Management protocol. 9. If patient is nauseated or vomiting, treat per Nausea and Vomiting protocol. 10. Administer ketamine for procedural dissociation as clinically and logistically indicated: Ketamine edural Dissociation/Sedation IM Repeat IM Dose IV/IO Repeat IV/IO Dose Adult 4 mg/kg IM May repeat 2 mg/kg IM every 5-10 min as needed . 1 mg/kg IV/IO slow push over 1-2 min.

IM procedural dissociation shall only be performed if obtaining IV/IO access is clinically or logistically impossible. Onset of dissociation with intramuscular administration is more unpredictable and will be delayed in comparison to IV/IO . Duration of dissociation is approximately 20 -30 minutes by IV/IO route and 30 -45 minutes by IM route. During confined space/technical rescue operations, obtaining IV/IO access may not be possible. IM procedural dissociation may be required. In these rare circumstances, the maximum volume per single IM injection is 5 ml (as opposed to 3 ml for all other IM injections). DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Medication Administration Procedural Dissociation 14.5.6 Revision Date: September 24, 202 2 Pg. 4 Important Note: in general, the safest approach is to choose the l owest level of sedation that is sufficient to perform the necessary procedure or treatment . Important Note: use caution in elderly patients as they are at higher risk for complications during procedural dissociation . They often require smaller sedative doses and the duration of action of sedatives is often prolonged in the elderly. Important Note: patients previously receiving fentanyl, versed, or ketamine are NOT excluded from receiving procedur al dissociation with ketamine if clinically indicated . However, providers should be aware that these situations warrant additional caution in preventing airway and hemodynamic complications . 11. Frequently reassess and monitor the patient's airway, breathing and sedation status during and after procedural sedation . 12. Be prepared to perform rescue airway interventions (e.g., jaw thrust, BVM ventilation, etc.) as needed to prevent and treat any complications or adverse events that occur during the procedur al dissociation. 13. All patients receiving procedural dissociation are priority 1 and shall be transported ALS with a minimum of two providers in the rear patient compartment of the transport unit . (The two providers m ay be two paramedics or 1 paramedic and 1 EMT .) Notify the receiving emergency department by radio/phone as soon as possible of the patient's status, preferably prior to leaving the scene. 14. If a patient recovering from ketamine procedural dissociation develops recovery agitation /emergence delirium: Provide supportive care: i nitiate verbal de -escalation , provide reassurance, and attempt to limit environmental stimuli . This agitation is typically short lived and requires only supportive management. In the rare instance that supportive care is not sufficient to calm a patient experiencing severe recover y agitation/ emergen ce delirium, administer versed : DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Medication Administration Procedural Dissociation 14.5.6 Revision Date: September 24, 202 2 Pg. 5 (Emergence delirium after Procedural Dissociation) Intranasal Intramuscular IV/IO Repea t Dose Adult 5 mg IN 5 mg IM 2-5 mg IV/IO May repeat every 5 -10 min as needed.

Administration of versed for recovery agitation/emergence delirium should only occur after attempts at supportive management have been unsuccessful. IV/IO administration of versed for recovery agitation/emergenc e delirium is always preferred . 1. Contact Medical Control for additional dosing as needed based on the patient's level of pain and or anxiety. 2. If a surgical strike team from a local trauma center is on scene to assist with disentanglement of an entrapped patient, paramedics may utilize the attending trauma surgeon for on scene Medical Control orders for procedural dissociation . General Notes: Untreated pain can lead to long -term increases in pain symptoms and other negative physiological effects. The need for pain control, compliance with a procedure, and lack of memory must be balanced against the patient's risk of an adverse event. DC Fire and EMS Pre -Hospital Treatment Protocols Medical Procedures/Medication Administration Procedural Dissociation 14.5.6 Revision Date: September 24, 202 2 Pg. 6 The SNOR ES bundle of care should be initiated for all patients undergoing procedural dissociation unless logistically not possible due to confined space/technical rescue operations . o S - SpO2 monitoring o N - Nasal ETCO 2 monitoring o O - Oxygen at a minimum of 6 L via nasal cannula o R - Reassess airway status and vital signs frequently o E - ECG 3 lead monitoring o S - Sugar/glucose check The longer the procedure requiring sedation, the higher the risk for an adverse event as there is more time for such events to occur.
