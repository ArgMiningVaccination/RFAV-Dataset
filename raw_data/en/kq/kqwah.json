Over time, however, your joints can become stiff and painful from inflammation, injury or disease, or from the natural effects of aging. Joint replacement is a surgical procedure that involves removing the arthritic or damaged joint and replacing it with a metal, plastic or ceramic device designed to replicate the movement of a normal, healthy joint. At Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, our [orthopedic surgeons](https://www.vmfh.org/find-a-doctor/m/franciscan-medical-group%257cvirginia-mason-medical-center/joint-replacement-surgery) have decades of experience performing successful joint replacement surgeries across Washington state. Are you ready to start being active again? Our dedicated [joint replacement team specialists](https://www.vmfh.org/find-a-doctor/m/franciscan-medical-group%257cvirginia-mason-medical-center/joint-replacement-surgery) take a patient-centered, collaborative approach to joint replacement that uses the latest methods to manage pain. For knee replacement surgery, this includes a continuous nerve block technique called the adductor canal catheter that not only reduces pain, but also maintains muscle strength in the leg, which is critical to recovery. The anesthesia delivered to people undergoing joint replacements is also designed to promote a faster recovery with fewer complications. Our orthopedic specialists are highly skilled in the following joint replacement surgeries: Virginia Mason Franciscan Health is proud to offer robotic arm-assisted total knee, partial knee and total hip replacement at St. Anne Hospital and St. Clare Hospital. Robotic arm-assisted surgery uses a CT scan and software to generate a 3D virtual model of your unique anatomy to help your surgeon provide more accurate placement and alignment of your implant.
