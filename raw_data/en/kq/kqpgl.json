PSC'S Request 1 Page 2 of 2 1.The Board voted in 2018 and the union agreed to change the employee health insurance from a \"Cadillac\" plan to a high deductible health plan. This resulted in estimated cost savings of $313,000 annually. 2.New ways for members to pay their electric bill have been introduced through our mobile app and website, controlling manning needs in our member service areas. 3.Two employees in our Meter Department retired and we opted not to fill those positions. This created an annual savings of approximately $195,000. 4.Prepaid Metering Program was implemented in 2021. The use of remote collars allowed for better staff efficiency, saving on both staff time and transportation costs. Estimated annual savings are $209,000. 5.Taylor County was approved for a Sample Meter Testing Program in 2021. The potential savings over an eight year period should be $691,707. 6.Taylor County applied for the SBA/PPP Loan in 2020 in the amount of $882,873.52. The loan was forgiven enabling the cooperative to recover up to 8 weeks of payroll costs including benefits. 7.Overall, Taylor County operates on a lean workforce for both inside and outside.AT TACHMENTS ARE EXCEL SPREADSHEETS AND UPLOADED SEPARATELY PSC 's Request 2 Page 1 of 1 TAYLOR COUNTY RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE CORPORATION PSC CASE NO. 202 3-00147 RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION PSC'S REQUEST FOR INFORMATION DATED 5/11/23 REQUEST 2 RESPONSIBLE PARTY: Patsy Walters Request 2.

Also, RUS's reporting requirements are codified in 7 CFR Parts 1710 and 1717. 2.REPORTS 2.1 The preparation of a monthly financial and statistical report aids a borrower's management in effectively operating and controlling the business. 2.2 As an aid to borrowers in developing and submitting operating information on a uniform basis, RUS furnishes a prescribed report form to be used by electric distribution borrowers. An original and one copy of RUS Form 7, pages 1 through 5, and Form 7a, Pages 1 and 2, should be submitted to RUS annually by March 1 for the period ending December 31. Quarterly reports (RUS Form 7, pages 1 and 2) are requested when a deficit exists in the prior year's operations. In addition, individual borrowers may be requested by RUS to submit RUS Form 7 (pages 1 and 2) monthly. 2.3 If after the filing of RUS Form 7 and 7a for December 31, major adjustments in the accounts are made which significantly affect the operating statement for the year, the balance sheet, or key financial ratios, revised report s reflecting these adjustments should be submitted to RUS promptly. 2.4 Sample copies of the revised report forms are attached to this guide. A supply of these forms will be furnished to borrowers not using the Data Collection System (DCS) system, upon request . 2.5 Distribution borrowers having generating facilities shall continue to submit reports on the operation of such facilities in accordance with the current instructions set forth in RUS Bulletin 1717B-3, in addition to the RUS Form 7 and 7a. 2.6 Timely reporting not only permits RUS to fulfill its reporting obligations, but helps the borrower have data promptly for effective management. It is strongly urged that attention be given to organizing your operations so that required reports will be submitted on time. 3.GENERAL The \"Financial and Statistical Report\" makes available to RUS information for analyses in connection with the security of Government loan funds. It is believed that this report, when supplemented by such additional information as may be desired by an individual borrower, will also be of great assistance to boards of directors and managers of the system in successfully coping with various management problems. PSC Request 1-4 Attachment Page 5 of 48 Witness: Patsy WaltersBulletin 1717B -2 Page 5 The report provides RUS with sufficient information to prepare an annual financial and statistical report of all RUS borrowers' electric operations. RUS provides the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with a copy of the RUS statistical report. Thus, most borrowers are not required to submit individual reports to FERC. The reports prepared by borrowers must accurately reflect the financial data as shown by the books of account, and should be prepared in accordance with the detailed instructions contained in this manual. Maximum benefits can be derived from the monthly and annual report only when they are correctly prepared. Careful preparation of the report also eliminates additional correspondence. After the report has been prepared and typed, it should be carefully reviewed and verified for both clerical and/or typographical errors. Accounts referenced: RUS Uniform System of Accounts - Electric (7 CFR 1767, subpart B, and RUS Bulletin 1767B- 1). These instructions and report forms do not apply to power supply borrowers. 4.SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS 4.1 The \"Financial and Statistical Repo rt,\" RUS Form 7, Pages 1 through 5, and Form 7a, \"Investments, Loan Guarantees and Loans - Distribution,\" are composed as follows: Form 7 Part A. Statement of Operations Part B. Data on Transmission and Distribution Plant Part C. Balance Sheet Part D. Notes to Financial Statements Part E. Changes in Utility Plant Part F. Materials and Supplies Part G. Service Interruptions Part H. Employee - Hour and Payroll Statistics Part I. Patronage Capital Part J. Due From Consumers for Electric Service Part K. kWh Purchased and Total Cost Part L. Long -Term Leases Part M. Annual Meeting and Board Data Part N. Long -Term Debt and Debt Service Requirements Part O. Power Requirements Data Base - Annual Summary PSC Request 1-4 Attachment Page 6 of 48 Witness: Patsy WaltersBulletin 1717B -2 Page 6 Form 7a Part I. Investments Part II. Loan Guarantees Part III. Ratio Part IV. Loans 4.2 The following system is used in this guide for reference to items reported on RUS Forms 7 and 7a: A capital letter designates the part, a number designates the item or line number, and a lower case letter designates the column. Example: A15d indicates Part A, Item 15, Column d. 4.3 \"Red\" (or negative) figures on the report should be indicated by enclosing the amount in parentheses ( --). Do not use parentheses to indicate that an amount is to be deducted when the format provides for the deduction to be made. Example: The entry for Form 7 - C4 should not be enclosed with parentheses as Net Utility Plant is to be determined by subtracting line 4 from line 3. 4.4 A column for \"Budget\" has been provided on RUS Form 7, Page 1, Part A, \"Statement of Operations,\" for the convenience of borrowers. When used, this should consist of the cumulative monthly figures taken from the previously prepared annual budget. A budget is a plan for future guidance of the business in which probable revenue and expense is estimated and allocated. If there is a substantial difference between the budget item and the actual, it would be appropriate to make an analysis of operations to determine if remedial action is needed. While reporting of the \"Budget\" information is optional, RUS may require borrowers to report budget information on a case -by-case basis. 4.5 Much care should be exercised in the insertion of the statistical data required by the report, particularly that which cannot be verified on the report. 4.6 Borrowers should report all amounts to the \"nearest dollar\" and eliminate the cents. All totals and subtotals should be the sums of the rounded figures used.

PSC Request 1-4 Attachment Page 18 of 48 Witness: Patsy WaltersBulletin 1717B -2 Exhibit A Page 18 Column (continued) b Additions This column should show the additions to plant during the year including any corrections for additions for the current or preceding year for each item. The amount of the additions should be net cost (gross cost less contributions in aid of construction credited to the plant accounts). Include in this column transfers involving Account 103, \"Experimental Electri c Plant Unclassified,\" Account 106, \"Completed Construction Not Classified - Electric,\" and Account 107,\"Construction Work in Progress - Electric,\" made to close the record for items in these accounts. A credit will be shown in this column for Accounts 103, 106, and 107 if the \"Balance End of Year\" in either Accounts 103, 106, or 107 is less than \"Balance Beginning of Year.\" Any amount paid for electric plant purchased during the year should be shown in Column b. c Retirements This column should show the value of physical retirements for each item of plant made during the year including any corrections for retirements for the current or preceding year. Any amount received during the year for electric plant sold should be shown in Column c. Do not include contributions in aid of construction in this account. See instructions for Column b above. d Adjustments and Transfers Include in this column: 1. Transfers between utility plant purchased or sold and the utility plant in service accounts. 2. Transfers between utility plant in service accounts and utility plant leased to others. 3. Transfers between utility plant in service accounts and utility plant held for future use. 4. Reclassifications or transfers within the utility plant in service accounts. Do not include corrections of additions and retirements for the current or preceding year in this column.

(These are to be shown in Column b.) Ordinarily, this column should total to zero. However, when utility plant purchased is transferred to the utility plant in service accounts, a difference will occur because of the accumulated provision for depreciation. When the utility plant in service accounts are credited with utility plant sold, a difference will develop. This is because of the adjustment to the accumulated provision for depreciation and the gain or loss. PSC Request 1-4 Attachment Page 19 of 48 Witness: Patsy WaltersBulletin 1717B -2 Exhibit A Page 19 Column (continued) e Balance End of Year These balances should be determined at year -end directly from the accounts.

Executive Summary A. Purpose, Results and General Basis of Study This report documents the system engineering analysis and proposed construction for Taylor County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation's (TCRECC) electric distribution system for the four- year period of January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2026. The proposed construction program i s to be financed by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and/or a supplemental lender. This report provides engineering support in the form of descriptions, costs, and the justification of required new facilities, as required for an RUS loan application. Upon construction completion of the proposed facilities, the TCRECC distribution system can provide adequate and dependable service to approximately 27, 948 consumers with the residential consumers using an average of 1,100 kWh per month. The 2026 projected nu mber of consumers and total peak system load were taken directly from the Cooperative's 2020 Load Forecast Report (LF) as approved by RUS. The 10% probability winter extreme highest kW demand was used for the loading conditions for the next four years. This loading level was agreed to by TCRECC management and the RUS General Field Representative (GFR). A review of TCRECC's 2011 Long Range System Study (LRSS), finds the load projections and recommendations to be adequate for the four -year planning period. One new delivery point (Contown Substation) was added during the previous Construction Work Plan (CWP) period. A one ownership (or substation justification) study was completed and approved for this project, and East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EK PC) completed the construction. No new delivery points are required during this new four -year construction work plan. The cooperative's Operations and Maintenance Survey, was compl eted on March 8, 20 22. Sev eral maintenance items were identified for improvements, but no items were marked as needing corrective action. An analysis of thermal loading, voltage drops, physical conditions and reliability, has been performed on all substations, distribution lines, and major equipment of the existing system. The existing base system model has been grown to the projected winter 2026/27 loading to develop a future system model. The basis of the system analysis is the RUS guidelines and TCRECC's system design guidelines. The analyses indicated above utilized the WindMil \u00a9 software package by Milsoft Utility Solutions \u00a9, and the results were used as the basis for determining the capital needs for TCRECC's electric distribution system. B. Service Area, Distribution System and Power Supply The corporate office of TCRECC is located in Campbellsville, Kentucky. The cooperative provides electric service to a portion of the central most part of Kentucky. The service area encompasses generally the rural areas around the small towns of Campbellsvi lle, Columbia, and Greensburg. TCRECC provides electric service to rural homes, farms, and small commercial and industrial consumers in Adair, Casey, Green and Taylor counties. The area generally consists of rolling hills, some rocky, rough terrain and grazing lands along small streams and tributaries. The chief sources of income are from general farming, timber and paper products, dairy operations, nurseries and varied small industries. Steady growth is being experienced around the small cities and towns w ith modest growth in the remaining rural areas.

The engineering analysis reveals that no new delivery points will be required during this CWP period. TCRECC's power supplier is EKPC, an RUS financed generation and transmission c ooperative. EKPC's main office is in Winchester, Kentucky. As power supplier, EKPC accommodates all the generation, transmission, and substation requirements of TCRECC and other cooperatives located in the central and eastern half of Kentucky. TCRECC takes delivery from EKPC at the distribution voltage of 7,200/12,470 volts. C. System Organization and Operation TCRECC's main office is located near the geographic center of the system. All engineering and management decisions come through this office. The system is operated and maintained under the leadership of an engineer and construction superintendent. Additional support staff of technicians, administrators, and aides compliments the system operations. TCRECC utilizes contractor construction crews for large system improvement projects. TCRECC's service territory is firmly established by Kentucky statutes. Consumers locating within TCRECC's territorial boundaries are set to be served by TCRECC. D. Status of Previous Work Plan Projects The current status of the previous work plan site -specific projects is presented in Exhibit C. The status of each project is identified as follows: CO M - Complete; CPC - Complete Pending Closeout; DEL - Deleted; NP - No Progress; IP - In Progress. E. Summary of Construction Program and Costs The costs of the recommended construction program over the next four years have been projected as follows : 2023 - $6,707,668 2024 - $6,538,920 Request 1-5 Attachment Page 8 of 48 Witness: Patsy Walters @ patterson & dewar engineers 2023 - 2026 Construction Work Plan Taylor County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation Powered by Experience Since 1947 Page 3 of 9 (770) 453 -1410 | pdengineers.com The annual totals for distribution plant additions and replacements during the four previous years are as follows: 2018 - $3,662,034 2019 - $3,402,956 2020 - $4,451,528 2021 - $4,541,211 Total - $ 16,057,729 This data noted above was taken from TCRECC's f our previous year- end RUS Form 7 's. Capital expenditures projected for this CWP have increased over past plant expenditures due to material price increases and system improvement increases; however, they remain reasonable. A further breakdown of the construction program cost is summarized as follows: 2023 total am ount above is eligible for RUS loan funds. Each capital item recommended herein was reviewed with engineering and management staff prior to inclusion in this CWP . Approximately 55% of the total capital is for new construction, leaving approximately 45 % for system improvements. II.Basis of Study and Proposed Construction A. Design and Operational Criteria Exhibit L presents TCRECC's System Design Guidelines (SDG). On July 12, 2022, the Kentucky RUS GFR reviewed and concurred with TCRECC's criteria. The proposed construction as outlined in this 2023 -2026 CWP is necessary for meeting the minimum standards set forth in the SDG. The criteria presented are for use in design and operations only. System conditions may result in a breach of a specific criterion. Such occurrences are considered only temporary and not for long term operations. B. Historical Line and E quipment Costs Exhibit B presents the historical and projected unit cost averages for new services and new construction. The cost calculations utilize data encompassing a 24 -month period ending December 31, 2021. Line construction projects are grouped by p roject type, and the averages are expressed on a cost per mile basis. Several of the projected costs do not have a historical cost to reference. These estimates are tabulated, but the cost utilized is based on other system experiences.

The EKP C staff developed the LF database and forecasting models and produced the final report. The LF projected kilowatt- hour sales as well as non -coincident peak kW demands for the period 20 20-2040. The projected winter peak for the winter of 26 /27 at the 20% pr obability was 1 69.0 MW (18 2 MW if Saloma was included). The system load factor is expected to change very little during the CWP period. In recent years the annual load factor has ranged from approximately 44% to 54% and is driven primarily by weather conditions in a given year. The load forecast offers various projection scenarios for planning purposes and they are as follows: Peaks Mild Normal Extreme* *With projections of 20%, 10% and 3% proba bility of occurrence. Generally, the normal and mild weather LF scenarios mentioned above are used in the preparation of rate studies and financial forecasts to determine realistic revenue projections. The extreme weather scenarios are used for system capacity planning. This is to assure that adequate capital expenditures are identified for system capacity in order to provide reliable and quality service to the customer. The extreme winter scenario with a 20% probability of occurrence was used in this work plan for the future sy stem loading conditions. In discussion with the RUS GFR and TCRECC, it was decided to use 174,000 kW (excluding Saloma) as the design load for this CWP. This represents the 10% probability extreme loading scenario. 2.2011 Long Range System Study (LRSS) Patterson & Dewar Engineers, Inc. completed a LRSS for Taylor County RECC's distribution system in February 2011. The system configuration and the loads for January 2010 form the basis for the LRSS. The LRSS used a projected load of 250 MW for the winter of 2035/36 in order to stress the system. The preferred plan included the possibility of six new substations. Due to load growth in the area around Phil Substation in Casey County, one new substation (Contown Substation) was energized during the previous CWP period. Based on current load projections, no other new substations are required for this CWP period. Because of the abundance of 69 kV transmission line and the reasonable costs to build new delivery points, TCRECC service voltage will remain 7.2 / 12.47 kV over the study period. The LRSS also recommended TCRECC standardize on three -phase line construction using primarily 1/0 ACSR, 336 kcmil and 477 kcmil ACSR conductor sizes. Exhibit N provides a summary of the Economical Conductor Analysis that agrees w ith the recommendations of the LRSS.

Several maintenance items were identified for improvements but no recommendations requiring capital funds were listed, and no items were marked as needing corrective action. A recommendation for the cooperative was made to continue to monitor issues related to joint use with telephone and cable TV companies. D. Historical and Projected System Data 1.Annual Consumer, Load and Losses Data Exhibit A tabulates the annual system data for consumers, system peak demand, losses, and annual load factor. The exhibit provides both data and graphs for the actual conditions for 20 12 through 20 21 and for the projected years of 20 22 through 203 1. The projected an d historical customer count and kW demand comes from the most recent EKPC LF for TCRECC. The projected net distribution plant is estimated based on historic expenditures and cost estimates for the coming years. The 20 20 LF states that over the last 20 yea rs the cooperatives sales have grown at a rate of approximately 2. 5% per year, and the next 20 years is forecasted to grow at approximately 1.3% per year. The next 5 years are projected to grow at a rate of approximately 1.9% per year, and the 4-year CWP is included in this time frame. The system is experiencing an annual 0.6 percent growth in consumers. There were 25, 728 consumers in 20 12, increasing to 2 7,254 in 20 21. The projection for 202 6 is 27,948 total consumers. This growth rate is expected to continue for the duration of the study period . The highest total non -coincidence peak was 166 MW in the 2014/15 winter season. This included the Saloma Substation, which is an EKPC direct served load. The peak at that same time without Saloma was 158.1 MW , which represents the true distribution system peak. TCRECC's load factor varies significantly from year to year and is very dependent on weather conditions. The distribution system load factor has ranged from a low of 35.3 percent to a high of 54.5 perc ent over the last 10 years, depending on the severity of the summer and winter peaks. A load factor of approximately 39.6 percent was used in the load forecast in 2026 to approximate the future probable loads at normal weather conditions. The annual system distribution losses over the last 5 years have ranged from 5. 61% to 5. 90%. The 20 20 LF projects losses of 5.6 percent for the TCRECC system for the next few years. 2.Special Loads Care was taken to account for the unique loading conditions at Phil Substation. Tarter Industries is the predominant load in the area, resulting in one feeder that carries most of the load. Loading in this area was based on field measurements from TCRECC. 3.Substation Load Data Exhibit O summarizes the substation loading and capacities for both existing and projected system peak conditions, with and without improvements. The exhibit identifies each substation, its voltage levels, winding capacity, percent of full load, percent power factor, and total peak demand. The loading is given in percent of full load rating of the substation transformer as provided by EKPC. All substations are owned and operated by EKPC.

This criterion also matches EKPC's policy. Currently none of TCRECC's substations are loaded over this level. 4.Circuit Loading and Voltage Conditions The January 20 22 non-coinci dent winter distribution peak for TCRECC was 1 35,756 kW. The corresponding peak kWh consumer billing data was used to develop the base system model for the winter 2021/22 conditions. During January 20 22 the system served approximately 2 7,254 consumers. Map 1 is a circuit diagram of TCRECC's primary electric system illustrating the loading and voltage conditions of the January 2022 system. The map also displays the CWP system recommended improvements. Map 2 is a circuit diagram of the system configuration after the completion of work presented in this CWP. Through the use of line voltage regulators and capacitors, adequate system voltages are being maintained for current system conditions. In anticipation of future system loading conditions, some line voltage regulator and capacitor changes will be necessary to maintain adequate voltage. See Exhibits H and I for a full listing of voltage regulator and capacitor recommendations. 5.System Outages and Reliability TCRECC maintains daily outage reports and prepares monthly and annual summaries. A periodic review of those summaries reveals areas requiring system changes or right -of-way maintenance. Exhibit M presents a summary of the consumer outage hours for the five previous years. The five year consumer outage average is 122.84 minutes per consumer per year which is below RUS's guideline of not exceeding 200 minutes per consumer per year. III. Required Construction Items A. Service to New Consumers During the 24 month period ending December 31, 2021, TCRECC added 200 underground services and 716 overhead services for new consumers . The average line extension cost in 2021 for each new service was approximately $5, 923 for underground and $ 4,246 for overhead services . It is estimated that 460 new underground and 1,400 new overhead services will be built over the next four years. Using projected per unit costs for this period, it is estimated that over the next four years $ 9,801,400 (or $2, 450,350 per year) in capital will be required to construct these new lines. Exhibit B summarizes the historical data used in projecting the required capital for the new services. Transformer, meter, and security light quantities and costs are also given in this exhibit. E xhibit D summarizes the costs on an annual basis. Approximately 31 percent of the capital required for this work plan is estimated to be for new consumer services. B. Service Changes to Existing Customers For the 24 month period ending December 31, 2021, TCRECC increased the service wire capacity of 37 consumers. TCRECC is expected to upgrade 100 services during the next four years. The average cost for each service upgrade is approximately $1, 407. The capital requirement for the CWP period is approximately $1 40,725 .

Excessive load curr ent is an undesirable situation normally corrected by the same methods used for excessive voltage drop; however, system improvement projects may also be recommended to assure proper coordination of line reclosers or sectionalizing devices. Right -of-way cle aring often results in improved service reliability. However, if specific line components are causing outages, then priority is given to rebuilding the line to replace old and worn -out equipment. Rebuilding a line may include conductor, pole or crossarm replacement, replacing defective insulators, etc. Also, the construction of tie lines may improve service reliability. Tie lines shorten the circuit feed distance thereby reducing line exposure and providing loop feed capability. The loop feed capability is beneficial during outages and line maintenance. The four year CWP distribution line construction estimate for Code 300 items is $5,616,720 inclu ding line conversions and changes. No tie -lines are recommended or required. Each recommendation of the CWP has been carefully reviewed with the TCRECC engineering staff prior to inclusion in this report. Exhibit F presents a summary of the distribution line construction recommendations. Please note the following explanation for the construction RUS reference nu mbers: XYY.ZZ = Construction Item Number X = RUS Reference Prefix (2 for tie lines; 3 for line conversions) YY = TCRECC Substation Number ZZ = Consecutive Number Under Each Substation Construction justification codes are presented for each recommen dation. Exhibit Q further details the justification for each project. D. Subst ation and Meter Point Additions and Changes The System Design Guidelines establish that a substation's projected future loading condition is not to exceed 95 percent of its full nameplate KVA capacity without plans for upgrade . This criterion also agrees with EKPC's loading policy. E. Capacitor Equi pment - Additions and Changes Exhibit I presents the capacitor recommendations for this CWP. They are also included in Map 1 and 2. Recommendations are included to comply with EKPC power factor policy of no less than 90 percent at peak for each cooperative delivery point. Recommendations have been included to maintain approximately 95% or higher during the peak conditions. TCRECC is encouraged to enforce their power factor penalty clause in their C&I service contract, to further encourage C&I to install both fixed and switched capacitor banks. If, however, this effort is unsuccessful, TCRECC PSC Request 1-5 Attachment Page 13 of 48 Witness: Patsy Walters @ patterson & dewar engineers 2023 - 2026 Construction Work Plan Taylor County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation Powered by Experience Since 1947 Page 8 of 9 (770) 453 -1410 | pdengineers.com should install capacitors on their system to eliminate the penalty charges from EKPC. The dollars received from penalizing the C&I customers should be adequate to cover the cost for the capacitor installations. EKPC furnishes capacitors to TCRECC and other member cooperatives at no cost t o the cooperatives. The cost to TCRECC is insignificant , therefore, no costs are included in the CWP for capacitor costs for TCRECC. All capacitor recommendations are based on engineering modeling and input from the engineering staff at TCRECC. Capacitor locations and kVAR bank size recommendations were based on circuit loading, minimizing line loss, and improving voltage. F. Sectionalizing Equipment - Additions and Changes A thorough sectionalizing and coordination study was conducted in 2019. A sectionalizing review will be conducted for protective devices in 2023 . The review includes an evaluation of device ratings against available load current and fault current and general sectionalizing recommendations. EKPC provided TCRECC low -side source impedance data so that available fault currents at each substation and delivery point can be determined. Also, any device overload conditions and line configuration changes resulting fro m the system improvements and revisions included in the work plan are to be included in the review . The preliminary estimate for RUS Code 603, sectionalizing equipment, is $ 400,000 for the CWP period. This is based on historical data and estimates from TCRECC. G. Line Regulators - Additions and Changes Exhibit H and Maps 1 and 2 present the line voltage regulator recommendations . The cost of line regulators is categorized by RUS reference Code 604. Exhibit H presents the location of the new regulators, a nd TCRECC is encouraged to add the regulators only as system problems are field measured and verified. The cost estimate for voltage regulators is $ 202,500 over the four year CWP period (average annual cost of $ 50,625). H.Pole Replacements The physical condition of TCRECC's electric plant is satisfactory according to work order inspections by Patterson & Dewar Engineers, Inc. Many system improvements have been made in recent years. However, following the experience of severe storms, persistent efforts to locate and replace old and depreciated poles is recommended. Taylor County's distribution system consists of approximately 64,000 wood poles systemwide (3,228 m iles of overhead line at approximately 20 poles per mile average). RUS recommends an annual inspection of at least 10 percent of a system's total poles. Taylor County should therefore have a pole inspection program that includes approximately 6,400 poles annually. Current estimates for pole replacements can be found in Exhibit B. The projected number of pole replacements for the CWP period is 1,648 for a total cost of $ 3,839,428 . The average cost per pole over the next 4 years is estimated to be $ 2,330. I. Other Distribution Items TCRECC currently has approximately 76 miles of single phase and 10 miles of three phase old copper conductor on their system. There are also small amounts of old, deteriorated 4 ACSR on the system. This work plan recommends replacing 20 miles of deteriorated lines over the CWP period. Exhibit K summarizes the plan for PSC Request 1-5 Attachment Page 14 of 48 Witness: Patsy Walters @ patterson & dewar engineers 2023 - 2026 Construction Work Plan Taylor County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation Powered by Experience Since 1947 Page 9 of 9 (770) 453 -1410 | pdengineers.com deteriorated line replacement. A total of $ 1,160,000 has been allocated in this CWP under code 608 for the old conductor change -out. This represents approximately $ 58,000 per mile of line. TCRECC plans to undertake an AMI replace ment project that is expected to begin in 2025 and take approximately four years to complete. Half of the total estimated expense for the project has been included in this CWP. $2,8 00,000 has been included under code 601 for meter replacement and an additional $1, 200,000 has been included in code 705 for necessary AMI equipment. TCRECC included a pre -pay metering project within the last CWP. Further pre -pay meters will be required during the next four years. This CWP includes a total of $ 200,000 under code 601 for pre -pay meters. The GIS project, which includes the field inventory, hardware and software , is shown under Code 707. This will include gathering detailed GIS data for the entire TCRECC system. It is estimated that data for approximately 100,000 points will be collected. The entire cost for the software and hardware is being included in the CWP; however, only 75% of the field inventory is being included for financing purposes. 75% of the field inventory cost is estimated at $700,000. Therefore, a total of $ 700,000 will be shown in Code 707 in this CWP. IV. Conclusion The recommendations set forth in this construction work plan will enable Taylor County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation to serve the projected 2026 -2027 peak winter conditions. The construction recommendations are in accordance with RUS prescribed guidelines and other economic criteria established by TCRECC's Long Range System Study, and related power supply studies.

Construction proposed in this construction work plan is required to meet the following minimum standards of adequacy for voltages, thermal loading, safety, and reliability on the system. 1)The maximum voltage drop from the substation on primary distribution lines is not to exceed 8 voltsunregulated, 16 volts with one set of line voltage regulators, and 24 volts with two sets of line voltage regulators. Ordinarily, lines will be limited to one bank of line regulators. 2)The following equipment will be flagged for review if thermal loading exceeds the percentage shown below of the nameplate rating. Power Transformers: 95% summer rating / 95% winter rating Voltage at 10% buck or boost; 160% at Circuit Reclosers: 100% Line Fuses: 80% 3)Primary conductors are considered for replacement when loaded to 65% of the thermal rating. 4)Poles and crossarms are to be replaced if found to be physically deteriorated by inspection. 5)Conductors are to be replaced as needed. 6)New lines and line conversions are to be built according to the standard primary voltage l evels as recommended in the Long Range System Study. 7)New primary conductor sizes are to be determined on a case by case basis using the EconomicConductor sizing computer program. A minimum of 1/0 ACSR is to be used on main lines, and aminimum of 4 ACSR i s to be used on tap lines. 8)All new primary construction is to be overhead except where underground is required to comply withgovernmental or environmental regulations, local restrictions, or favorable economics. 9)All new distribution lines are to be design ed and built according to RUS standard construction specifications and guidelines. 10)A single -phase tap will be considered for multi -phasing if any of the following conditions are present: a)Serves more than 60 customers, b)Load current over 35 amps, c)Serves an area that is growing.

ARTICLE II PREAMBLE Statement of Principles and Union Responsibilities The Union recognizes its responsibilities as the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees covered by this Agreement, and realizes that in order to provide maximum opportunities for continuing employment, good working conditions and good wages, the Cooperative must be in a strong marketing position, which means that it must produce quality services and products and be able to sell them at the lowest possible costs and otherwise be able to operate its business efficiently, economically and competitively. The Union therefore agrees that it will support the Cooperative's efforts to assure a fair day's work by the employees for a fair day's pay. The Union will support the Cooperative in its efforts to improve services, preserve equipment, prevent accidents and strengthen good will between the Cooperative and its employees, as well as with its suppliers and customers. The Union further recognizes that the Cooperative has certain definite and stringent obligations and responsibilities to its customers, suppliers, Public Service Commission and Rural Utilities Service (\"RUS\") and the Union agrees that it will fully cooperate with the Cooperative in the performance and discharge of these obligations and responsibilities. - 1 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 6 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersARTICLE III Recognition The Cooperative recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative for all constrnction and maintenance employees employed from and at its Campbellsville, Kentucky, location, including mechanics, tree trimmers, laborers, linemen, instrument men, staking engineer helper, servicemen, groundmen, maintenance men, right-of-way helpers, warehousemen, truck drivers and tractor drivers, but excluding all office clerical employees, professional employees, guards and supervisors as defined in the Act, as amended. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement shall be as established by the National Labor Relations Board in its \"Certification of Representative\" dated November 14, 1978, in Case No. 9-RC-12607, and this Article is included herein solely for the purpose of discharging the Cooperative' s obligation under the law to recognize the Union. In the event the Cooperative is sold to a private investor notice of such sale will be given to the Union not later than the day of the closing of such sale. ARTICLE IV Management Prerogatives The operation, control and management of the Cooperative' s facilities and operations, and all business and activities of the Cooperative in connection therewith which are covered or affected by this Agreement, and the supervision and direction of the working forces at such facilities, operations and business are and shall continue to be solely and exclusively the functions and prerogatives of the management of the Cooperative. All of the rights, functions and prerogatives of management which the Cooperative had prior to entering into this Agreement with the Union are reserved and retained exclusively to the -2 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 7 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersCooperative, unless changed or modified by one or more explicit provisions of this Agreement. Specifically but without limiting or affecting the generality of the foregoing, it is distinctly understood and agreed that the Cooperative has the sole right to: Determine the nature and extent of the business to be carried on by the Cooperative, determine the suppliers and customers with whom it will deal, and the prices at which and terms upon which its materials, equipment and supplies will be purchased, leased or otherwise acquired and its services and products will be sold; determine the size and composition of the working force covered by this Agreement, and assignment of work, and policies affecting the hiring of new employees; layoff, discipline and discharge employees for cause; and determine the qualifications of employees, including the right to terminate the services of employees without limitation during their probationary period; establish and enforce quality, production, construction, and service standards for its employees, services and products; establish new departments; discontinue existing departments; introduce new and improved equipment, facilities and service methods; change, combine, establish or discontinue jobs or operations; determine when and if vacancies in the working force shall be filled; determine the means and methods by which production and services will be made; determine the hours of operation, discontinue temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, any operations of the business of the Cooperative covered or affected by this Agreement. The Cooperative shall also have the right from time to time to make and enforce such reasonable rules, procedures and regulations applicable to employees covered by this Agreement for the purpose of maintaining order, safety, effective operations and control; to enforce, change, abolish or modify such existing rules, procedures and regulations applicable to employees covered by this Agreement, as it may from time to time deem necessary or advisable, after advance notice thereof to the Union and employees, which shall be subject to the grievance and -3 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 8 of 121 Witness: Patsy Waltersarbitration procedure of this Agreement. The Cooperative shall also have the right to require compliance with such rules, procedures and regulations by employees until an Arbitrator sets aside the rule, procedure or regulation as a result of the grievance and arbitration procedure or the parties mutually agree to set aside the rule, regulation or procedure without arbitration. ARTICLEV Subcontracting It is understood by the Cooperative and the Union that for the Cooperative to satisfy the demands of its customers and to successfully operate the business, contracting and/or subcontracting of work is necessary from time to time. It is therefore agreed by the Union that the Cooperative may, within its exclusive discretion, engage contractors for all construction, manufacturing, service and operations functions, and any and all other functions which it, in its exclusive discretion, deems necessary and desirable. The Cooperative will not subcontract work under this provision that would cause the layoff of employees. ARTICLE VI Supervisory and Other Excluded Personnel Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement, there shall be no limitation or restriction upon the nature, extent and kind of work which Supervisory and Management personnel may perform, nor shall there be any limitation or restriction as to the times or occasions on which Supervisory and Management personnel may perform such work. The Cooperative will not utilize this Article in such a way as to displace any employee covered by this Agreement. - 4 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 9 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersARTICLE VII Discipline and Discharge SECTION 1. The Cooperative shall have the right to discharge employees during their probationary period without cause and without recourse by the Union or by such probationary employee to the grievance procedure of this Agreement. SECTION 2. The Cooperative shall have the right to discipline or discharge employees for \"just cause\". While it is the policy of the Cooperative to warn employees for minor infractions before taking disciplinary action or discharging them, it is distinctly understood and agreed that certain offenses, such as, but not by any means limited to the following, shall be considered \"just cause\" and cause for immediate discharge, without warning: Dishonesty; insubordination; fighting while on the Cooperative's premises or on duty; smoking in fuel pump areas; failure or refusal to wear or utilize any safety equipment provided and required by the Cooperative or to follow any safety procedure prescribed by the Cooperative; horseplay of such a nature as to be capable of causing personal injury or property damage; drinking alcoholic beverages or being under the influence of alcoholic beverages while on the Cooperative' s premises or on duty; being in possession of or using or being under the influence of narcotics (unless prescribed by the employee's physician and the employee is following the physician's directions on dosages, etc.), marijuana or hallucinatory drugs; proven falsification of the Cooperative's records or reports; willful damage to tools, equipment or other Cooperative property; failure to immediately report involvement in an accident while on duty or on the Cooperative's premises; or participation in any activity prohibited by the Article of this Agreement entitled \"No Strike No Lockout\". - 5 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 10 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersSECTION 3. It is understood and agreed that employees have a responsibility to be regular and punctual in their work attendance and that habitual or repeated tardiness or absenteeism or failure to report to work promptly, and other minor offenses will be cause for disciplinary action, including discharge. The procedure will be as follows: (I) first offense: verbal warning; (2) second offense: written warning; (3) third offense: three (3) day suspension; and (4) fourth offense: subject to discharge. It is expressly agreed (a) that the Cooperative, in its discretion, may decide not to discharge an employee for the fourth ( 4th) offense, and (b) that the Cooperative' s failure in any case or cases to strictly enforce the above procedure, shall not be a precedent and shall not constitute a waiver of the Cooperative' s right to enforce such procedure in any other case. SECTION 4. It is agreed that in the event an employee is given any disciplinary action, including a warning notice, a copy of the warning notice will be given to the employee, one (I) copy to the Union and one (I) copy will be retained in the employee's personnel file. A warning notice or notices for any cause may constitute a basis for discharge for any subsequent infraction and it is understood and recognized by the parties hereto that the infractions specified in Section 2 of this Article shall be cause for immediate discharge without warning. It is further understood and recognized that in any event it shall be cause for discharge if an employee is given four (4) warning notices for any cause or combination of causes within a \"rolling\" twelve (12) month period. Disciplinary warnings outside this \"rolling\" twelve (12) month period will not be used for disciplinary purposes. All disciplinary warnings and discharges shall be subject to the grievance procedure. -6 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 11 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersARTICLE VIII Union Security and Checkoff SECTION 1. Union Security. It is recognized by the parties that the Commonwealth of Kentucky law prohibits union membership as a condition of employment. The Cooperative and the Union agree, in the event future legislation during the term of this Agreement provides for permitting a Union Shop in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, to negotiate with respect to inclusion of some form of a Union Security provision. SECTION 2. Checkoff. The Cooperative agrees to deduct each month, from the paychecks of all employees who are covered by this Agreement, all periodic dues and initiation fees owing to the Union by the employees, provided, however, that such employees shall have signed and submitted a written authorization for such action on the part of the Cooperative; such written authorization shall conform to and be in accordance with all applicable Federal and State laws. All monies deducted by the Cooperative shall be forwarded to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union. It is understood and agreed that any monies collected by the Cooperative for the Union will be taken out of the paycheck for the first pay period of the month and remitted to the Union before the 30th day of the same month. The Cooperative will recognize authorizations for deductions from wages, if in compliance with State and Federal law, to be transmitted to the Union. No such authorization shall be recognized if in violation of State or Federal law. No deduction shall be made which is -7 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 12 of 121 Witness: Patsy Waltersprohibited by applicable law. This provision is subject to whatever shop rule is promulgated by the Cooperative with respect to garnishments or other wage deductions. SECTION 3. In consideration of the adoption by the Cooperative of the Checkoff provisions, the Union agrees to indemnify and hold the Cooperative harmless from and against any and all liability or loss as a result of any action brought by any employee or employees on account of claimed illegal payments, suspension or discharge under the provisions of Article VIII of this Agreement, above described, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs. SECTION 4. If for any reason an employee does not work during the first pay period of any month in which the checkoff is made, the Cooperative shall make deductions for the above purpose from such employee's wages out of the next succeeding pay period in which he works. ARTICLE IX No Strike-No Lockout The Union agrees that during the term of this Agreement neither the Union, its officers, agents or members shall authorize, instigate, aid, condone or engage in any work stoppage, strike of any kind or description, including so-called sympathy strikes, or otherwise interrupt, impede or restrict services of the Cooperative or engage in any activity which would tend to cause an interruption or delay in the accomplishment of the work and business of the Cooperative. The Union further agrees that during the term of this Agreement the Union, its officers, agents or members will not honor or recognize any picket line or picketing in any form, - 8 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 13 of 121 Witness: Patsy Waltersincluding recognition of picket lines or picketing out of so-called sympathy, by any union at the Cooperative, or any facility or operation of the Cooperative, regardless of where it is located. Any employee who engages in any conduct prohibited by this Article, or who fails or refuses to comply with any provision of this Article, shall be subject to appropriate discipline, including discharge, without warning, by the Cooperative. In the event an employee is discharged for violation of the provisions of this Article, he may resort to the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth herein. The arbitrator shall, however, be limited to determining the single issue of whether or not the employee did, in fact, participate in or promote such action and the employee(s) affected will have the burden of conclusively showing his (their) non\u00ad participation in and not having promoted such actions. Further, the Cooperative shall be under no obligation to bargain with the Union concerning employees who are on strike or concerning the subject of any strike so long as the strike continues. Neither the violation of any provision of this Agreement nor the commission of any act constituting an unfair labor practice or otherwise made unlawful by any federal, state or local law shall excuse the Union, its officers, agents or members from their obligations in the provisions of this Article. The provisions of this Article shall not be appealable to the grievance procedure either for the purpose of assessing damages or securing a specific performance, such matters of law being determinable and enforceable only in the courts. The Cooperative shall not lock out members of the Union during the term of this Agreement. -9 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 14 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersARTICLEX Probationary Employees All new or rehired employees shall be placed on probation and shall be classified as temporary help during the first one hundred twenty ( 120) actual work days of their employment with the Cooperative. During such one hundred twenty (120) actual work day probationary period the Cooperative may discharge or otherwise discipline, lay off, transfer or assign such employees with or without cause, and such actions shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. Probationary employees who complete their probationary period will be classed as regular employees and their date of hire shall be from the first day of hiring. ARTICLE XI Rates for New Job Classifications Recognizing that during the term of this Agreement the Cooperative may install new equipment or change work methods resulting in the creation of new job classifications, the Cooperative shall establish rates for such new classifications in line with the Cooperative' s wage scale for like work and notify the Union's representative in writing. If after ten (10) days neither party questions the rate established for the new classification, it shall become the established rate for the job; otherwise, the establishment of such rate shall be a matter for negotiation. If the parties negotiate and are unable to reach an agreement, the rate as established by the Cooperative shall stand until this Agreement expires if less than twelve (12) months until this Agreement expires and then shall be subject for renegotiation. If more than twelve (12) months from the expiration of this Agreement, then the dispute shall be subject to the Grievance-Arbitration Procedure set out elsewhere in this Agreement. -10 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 15 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersARTICLE XII Hours of Work and Overtime\u00b7 SECTION 1. An employee's regular work week shall be forty (40) hours and shall start at the beginning of his shift on Monday, subject to change by the Cooperative when requirements dictate, but shall not be less than eight (8) hours, excluding a one (1) hour lunch break. In addition, employees shall receive two (2) ten (10) minute breaks during a full eight (8) hour shift. The work week shall begin at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and end at Midnight the following Saturday. SECTION 2. When overtime is required, the employees in the classification or who are assigned on the job where the overtime exists shall be required to work the overtime assigned. SECTION 3. Overtime at the rate of time and one-half (I-1/2) shall be paid for all hours actually worked in excess of forty ( 40) hours in any one work week. Time off for sick leave, actual hours served on Jury Duty under Article XVIII, and Holidays as set forth in Article XX, only shall be considered hours worked (8 hours per day) for purposes of this provision. Overtime under this Section shall be computed on a weekly basis. SECTION 4. No premium or overtime pay set out in this Agreement shall be pyramided. -11 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 16 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersSECTION 5. An employee required; on a temporary basis, to report to a work place other than his regularly required work place, will not be required to travel on his own time for a period longer than the travel time to his regular reporting work place. SECTION 1. ARTICLE XIII Reporting and Call-Out Pay When an employee reports for work at his regular starting time on a scheduled work day, he will be guaranteed eight (8) hours straight time pay at his regular hourly rate of pay, provided, however, that this provision shall not apply in case of strikes or other work stoppages, disciplinary suspension of an employee, acts of God or any other cause beyond the Cooperative's control. SECTION 2. When an employee has completed his regular shift and left the Cooperative's premises, but is called in to work more than two (2) hours prior to the beginning of his next regularly scheduled shift, he will be guaranteed three (3) hours work at his regular straight-time hourly rate of pay. This guarantee shall only apply once each work day (24-hour period). Other hours actually worked on additional \"call-outs\" will be compensated at the employee's regular straight\u00ad time hourly rate. Call-Out is mandatory and will be performed in the following way: One Serviceman will be on-call (the \"On-Call Serviceman\") for service calls from 12:01 a.m. Monday through Midnight Sunday (the \"on-call week\") for all counties in the Cooperative's service area. The -12 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 17 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersServicemen will serve as the On-Call Serviceman on a rotating basis based on seniority, beginning with the most senior Serviceman. The Cooperative will provide a dispatching service for purposes of call-out. The dispatcher will follow the steps below: Step 1 -The dispatching service will call the Serviceman in the county where the outage or service is required. If the dispatcher cannot get in contact with that Serviceman immediately, then go to Step 2. Step 2 -The dispatching service will contact the On-Call Serviceman for that on-call week. If the On-Call Serviceman can get another Serviceman or First Class Lineman who is closer to the outage or in the county where the outage exists, then that Serviceman or First Class Lineman will perform the work involved with the on-call lineman, as set out below or with a qualified employee. The On-Call Serviceman cannot use more than thirty (30) minutes in an effort to find such person who is closer or in the county where the outage exists. Step 3 -If the outage is not covered by either Step 1 or Step 2, the On-Call Serviceman must perform the work himself with the on-call lineman or a qualified employee. On all call-outs the On-Call Serviceman will be accompanied by a lineman or a qualified employee. Initially, the Cooperative will post a notice for linemen to volunteer to be called out. So long as there are no fewer than six (6) linemen on the volunteer list, this system will remain on a volunteer basis. The linemen on the volunteer list will be called on a rotation basis, with the lineman serving a full week beginning at 12:01 a.m. on Monday and ending at midnight on Sunday. Call-out for the linemen for the on-call week is mandatory. -13 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 18 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersIf at any time the volunteer list for linemen to be called out falls below six ( 6), then all linemen in all classifications will be subject to call-out on a rotation basis and such call-out shall be mandatory. The linemen call-out procedures set forth above will remain in effect unless the total number oflinemen employed by the Cooperative is less than ten (10). If there are fewer than ten (10) linemen, then the application of the mandatory rotation of linemen shall end. Only the On-Call Serviceman and On-Call lineman for each week will receive one (1) hour of pay at time and one-half (1-\u00bd) for each day served during the on-call week. If the On\u00ad Call Serviceman and On-Call lineman who are called to perform the work as set forth in Step 2, then the Serviceman or First Class Lineman and the On-Call lineman or a qualified employee who perform the work only, will receive the \"guaranteed\" three (3) hours straight time set forth above, unless the time to perform the work actually exceeds three (3) hours. The On-Call Serviceman can trade his on-call week with another Serviceman and, in such case, the On-Call Serviceman must advise his immediate Supervisor or, in his absence, the Manager, of the replacement Serviceman at least one (I) regularly scheduled work day before the on-call week begins, except in the case of an emergency as determined by the Superintendent or, in his absence, the Manager on a particular day during the on-call week, less than such notice will be sufficient. The On-Call lineman can trade his on-call week with another lineman and, in such case the On-Call lineman must advise his immediate supervisor or in his absence, the Manager of the replacement lineman at least one (1) regularly scheduled work day before the on-call week begins, except in the case of an emergency as determined by the Superintendent. No employee shall be required to take time off to avoid the payment of overtime. -14 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 19 of 121 Witness: Patsy Walters SECTION 3. An employee on vacation who is \"called-out\" to work shall have the right to refuse such \"call-out\". If the employee on vacation reports for work, he shall be paid time and one-half (1- 1/2) the regular hourly rate for hours actually worked in addition to his regular vacation pay. SECTION 4. If a Serviceman is on vacation and a First Class Lineman is called-out to replace him under Article XIII, Section 2, then such First Class Lineman will receive the Serviceman's hourly rate as set forth in Article XXVI, Section 4, or his \"red circle\" rate, whichever is higher. The call-out will be under the same terms and conditions as are set forth in Article XIII, Section 2. ARTICLE XIV Grievance Procedure SECTION 1. A grievance as referred to in this Agreement is a dispute arising from the interpretation or application of one or more specific provisions of this Agreement. Grievances shall be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth below. STEP I. The aggrieved employee shall present his grievance to his Supervisor within three (3) days after the cause of such grievance becomes known or could reasonably be expected to have been known. If he has been prevented from presenting the grievance within this time limit because of an excused absence, the days of excused absence shall be excluded in computing the time limit. The aggrieved employee may be accompanied by his Union Steward. -15 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 20 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersSTEP2. If the grievance is not settled in Step 1, it may be appealed by presenting the grievance in writing within five (5) days to the Superintendent, who shall meet with the aggrieved employee. The aggrieved employee may be accompanied by his Union Steward. STEP 3. If the grievance is not settled in Step 2, it may be appealed by the Union within ten (10) days to the Manager (or the person acting in his capacity in the event of his absence) who shall arrange to meet with the Union's Assistant to the President and the aggrieved employee and his Union Steward. STEP4. If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled in Step 3 and if the grievance is otherwise arbitrable under this Agreement, it may be referred to arbitration in strict accordance with the provisions of this Agreement pertaining to arbitration, provided that if the Union fails to notify the Cooperative in writing by Registered Mail within ten (I 0) days after the Cooperative gives its answer in writing to a grievance at Step 3 of the grievance procedure of the Union's desire to arbitrate the grievance, then the Union shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the Cooperative's answer and said grievance shall not thereafter be arbitrable. SECTION 2. The grievance procedure is subject to the following rules and conditions: (a) A settlement satisfactory to the Union at any step in the gnevance procedure shall be binding on it and the employee or employees making the complaint. (b) Saturdays, Sundays and holidays are excluded in computing the time limits specified in this Article. ( c) All meetings conducted pursuant to the provisions of Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 and Step 4 of this Article, unless otherwise mutually agreed, shall be conducted at times when the aggrieved employee and others, including the Steward, are not regularly scheduled to work. -16 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 21 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersFor employees in the Construction and Maintenance Unit, such meetings may also take\u00b7 place beginning at 4:30 p.m. or during the last one-half (1/2) hour of their shift, whichever is applicable. Neither parry shall have more than a total of three (3) persons present, including the aggrieved employee, except, by mutual consent, the parties may agree to a greater number. ( d) Employees will not leave their work to investigate, present or discuss grievances without prior permission from their supervisor. ( e) This grievance procedure constitutes the sole and exclusive means of resolving controversies. Pending the raising, processing and/or settlement of a grievance, all employees will continue to work in a normal manner, and there shall be no slowdown, stoppage or other interference with work or plant operation as discussed and set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. (t) Infrequently, due to the nature of the subject matter, the Cooperative or the Union may request that early steps of the grievance procedure be waived. In such cases certain steps of the grievance procedure may be waived provided there is mutual agreement by the Cooperative and the Union to do so. (g) Any time the Cooperative offers a settlement with regard to any grievance, there will be a Union Official present. \"Union Official\" shall mean the employee's Steward or the Union's Assistant to the President. A settlement reached with the Steward will not set a precedent, unless the Union's Assistant to the President is aware of the settlement. (h) Any grievance of any kind which has been presented under the grievance procedure set forth herein which is not appealed to the next step within the applicable time specified above and any grievance which has not been presented under the grievance procedure -17 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 22 of 121 Witness: Patsy Waltersset forth herein within the time period for presentation of grievances shall be considered settled and shall not be subject to further discussion or appeal. SECTION 3. The Cooperative shall not be required or obligated under the terms of this Agreement or otherwise to submit to arbitration any claim or cause of action which it may have or assert on account of any alleged violation of this Agreement by the Union or any employee or employees covered by this Agreement. The Cooperative shall have the right to sue at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, Federal or state, to enforce this Agreement and to recover for any breach or violation thereof. SECTION 4. No grievance shall be arbitrable unless it involves an allegation of the type set out in Section 1, which allegation shall be designated in writing by the Union to the Cooperative no later than the time such grievance is appealed to Step 2 of the grievance procedure set forth herein. No grievance may be filed or considered which is based in whole or in part on an occurrence happening prior to or after the term of this Agreement. SECTION 5. The provisions of this Agreement covermg grievance procedure and arbitration are completely unrelated to and independent of the provisions of the Article of this Agreement entitled \"No Strike-No Lockout\" clause. In the event the Cooperative claims that a grievance filed hereunder is not arbitrable, whether or not such claim be ultimately sustained, such claim shall not in any way affect or excuse the Union or any employee or employees covered by this -18 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 23 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersAgreement from the provisions of the Article entitled \"No Strike-No Lockout\" and their respective obligations and duties thereunder. SECTION 6. In the event any gnevance which is otherwise arbitrable under the terms of this Agreement shall be arbitrated, selection of an arbitrator shall first be attempted by the Union and the Cooperative attempting to agree on an arbitrator, and, if they cannot agree upon a selection, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall be asked to furnish a panel consisting of at least seven (7) names of arbitrators. The Union and the Cooperative shall select a single arbitrator from the panel by alternately striking a name until such time as only one ( 1) name remains. The Cooperative and the Union will alternate in striking the first name from the list. The Cooperative will strike the first name in the first arbitration case and the Union will strike the first name in the second arbitration case, etc. SECTION 7. No more than one gnevance shall be submitted to any one arbitrator unless the Cooperative and the Union agree otherwise in writing. The Arbitrators selected shall have power to receive relevant testimony from the parties to the dispute and hear such witnesses as they may desire to present. The parties may, if they so desire, be represented by counsel in all proceedings held before the Arbitrator. The Cooperative shall bear the costs of preparing and presenting its case to the Arbitrator and the Union shall bear the costs of preparing and presenting its case to the Arbitrator. All other expenses of arbitration, such as, but not limited to the Arbitrator's fee, and the hiring of a space in which the arbitration proceedings are held, shall be divided equally between the Cooperative and the Union. -19 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 24 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersSECTION 8. The function of the Arbitrator shall be of a judicial, rather than a legislative, nature. The Arbitrator shall not have authority to add to, ignore or modify any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement. The Arbitrator shall not substitute his judgment for the Cooperative's judgment and where matters of judgment are involved he shall be limited to deciding whether or not the Cooperative acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith. The Arbitrator shall not decide issues which are not directly involved in the case submitted to him. In any discharge or disciplinary suspension case where the Arbitrator decides that the aggrieved employee should be awarded any back pay, the Cooperative shall be entitled to full credit on such awards for the employee's gross interim earnings, unemployment compensation benefits, worker's compensation benefits received or receivable and any other compensation he receives from any form of employment during the period he was not working for the Cooperative. Subject to the foregoing qualifications and limitations, the Arbitrator's award shall be final and binding upon the Cooperative, the Union and the aggrieved employee or employees. SECTION 9. Only the Union shall have the right to prosecute grievances under this Agreement and only the Union shall have the right to take to arbitration any grievance which is otherwise arbitrable under this Agreement. If the Union fails, refuses or declines to prosecute a grievance on behalf of an employee, or on behalf of a group of employees hereunder, such employee or employees who filed such grievance or on whose behalf it has been filed shall be conclusively bound thereby and both the Union and the aggrieved employee or employees shall thereafter be prohibited from reviving or further prosecuting said grievance. -20 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 25 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersARTICLE XV Access to Facilities and Properties of the Cooperative An authorized officer or agent of the Union, the name of whom shall be furnished to the Cooperative in writing, shall have access to the Cooperative' s establishment during working hours for the purpose of investigating grievances and for any other legitimate purpose in connection with the administration of this Agreement, provided he notifies the Manager of the Cooperative beforehand. The Union hereby agrees that its agents and representatives will not cause any interruption of the Cooperative' s working schedule or interfere with the work of employees or otherwise abuse these visitation privileges when on its premises. In the event of a change of agents, the Cooperative will be immediately notified in writing. ARTICLE XVI Seniority SECTION 1. Seniority of employees covered by this Agreement shall be determined by the Cooperative on the basis of length of continuous service with the Cooperative from the last date of hire. SECTION 2. An employee's seniority, qualifications, physical condition, ability, skill and adaptability to perform the work involved, as determined by the Cooperative, shall apply in the case of layoff, recall from layoff, and promotions. It is agreed that in the case of layoff no employee, regardless of his seniority, may displace any other employee unless he is at that time able to satisfactorily perform the work of the employee being displaced. An employee who displaces -21 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 26 of 121 Witness: Patsy Waltersanother employee pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be paid at the hourly rate of pay for that job classification. When the working force is being increased after a layoff the Cooperative will apply the same standards as it originally applied for layoff when the employees are being recalled. SECTION 3. In the case of layoff, all probationary, seasonal, part-time and casual employees shall be laid off before any employees who have established seniority are affected. SECTION 4. The Cooperative will give employees one (I) week notice prior to layoff. SECTION 5. Seniority, qualifications, physical condition, ability, skill, adaptability to perform the work involved, as determined by the Cooperative, shall be the controlling factors in promotion of employees, and where in the Cooperative' s judgment, these factors are relatively equal between two (2) or more employees, seniority will control. SECTION 6. All job vacancies in jobs which the Cooperative decides to fill will be posted for bid at least three (3) full working days, at all three (3) locations. Until the Cooperative has selected an employee to permanently fill such job vacancy the vacant job may be filled in any manner the Cooperative sees fit.

Employees shall be permitted to bid only on jobs which are higher than the job classification which they are in at the time and a successful job bidder shall not bid again for any posted job for six ( 6) months. If no employee in the unit -22-PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 27 of 121 Witness: Patsy Walterswho bids on the job is selected, using the criteria set out in this Section 6, then the Cooperative may hire a new employee from outside the work force.

(d) If an employee is absent from work for two (2) days without reporting to the supervisor. ( e) If an employee is retired. SECTION 8. Seasonal, temporary, part-time and casual employees are excluded from the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement and are not entitled to any of the benefits and privileges provided for in this Agreement. The Cooperative will give the Union notice when such employees are hired, but shall be under no further obligation with respect to the Union for these employees. SECTION 9.

The seniority list shall be brought up-to-date on November I of each year thereafter. SECTION 11. In the event an employee becomes physically disabled from a work-related injury and can no longer perform the work in his classification ( certified as such by his attending physician, and subject to confirmation by a physician selected by the Cooperative) he may request a transfer, if an opening exists at that time, to a lower classification of work, provided he is at that time able to satisfactorily perform the work of the lower classification. The employee will be paid at the rate of the classification to which he transfers. This provision shall only apply to employees with five (5) or more years of service with the Cooperative and only one (1) such transfer may be made. In the event an employee is injured on the job and is eligible for workers compensation benefits, such employee must return to work and perform \"light duty\" as determined by the -25 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 30 of 121 Witness: Patsy WaltersCooperative, in accordance with work restrictions placed on such employee by the attending physician.

ARTICLEV Subcontracting It is understood by the Cooperative and the Union that for the Cooperative to satisfy the demands of its customers and to successfully operate the business, contracting and/or subcontracting of work is necessary from time to time. It is therefore agreed by the Union that the Cooperative may, within its exclusive discretion, engage contractors for all construction, manufacturing, service and operations functions, and any and all other functions which it, in its exclusive discretion, deems necessary and desirable.

It is expressly agreed (a) that the Cooperative, in its discretion, may decide not to discharge an employee for the fourth (4th) offense, and (b) that the Cooperative's failure in any case or cases to strictly enforce the above procedure, shall not be a precedent and shall not constitute a waiver of the Cooperative's right to enforce such procedure in any other case. SECTION 4.

It is further understood and recognized that in any event it shall be cause for discharge if an employee is given four ( 4) warning notices for any cause or combination of causes within a \"rolling\" twelve (12) month period. Disciplinary warnings outside this \"rolling\" twelve (12) month period will not be used for disciplinary purposes. All disciplinary warnings and discharges shall be subject to the grievance procedure. -6-PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 63 of 121 Witness: Patsy Walters ARTICLE VIII Union Security and Checkoff SECTION 1.

The Cooperative will recognize authorizations for deductions from wages, if in compliance with State and Federal law, to be transmitted to the Union. No such authorization shall be recognized if in violation of State or Federal law. No deduction shall be made which is - 7 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 64 of 121 Witness: Patsy Walters prohibited by applicable law.

In consideration of the adoption by the Cooperative of the Checkoff provisions, the Union agrees to indemnify and hold the Cooperative harmless from and against any and all liability or loss as a result of any action brought by any employee or employees on account of claimed illegal payments, suspension or discharge under the provisions of Article VIII of this Agreement, above described, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs. \u00b7 SECTION 4.

In the event an employee is discharged for violation of the provisions of this Article, he may resort to the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth herein. The arbitrator shall, however, be limited to determining the single issue of whether or not the employee did, in fact, participate in or promote such action and the employee(s) affected will have the burden of conclusively showing his (their) non\u00ad participation in and not having promoted such actions. Further, the Cooperative shall be under no obligation to bargain with the Union concerning employees who are on strike or concerning the subject of any strike so long as the strike continues. Neither the violation of any provision of this Agreement nor the commission of any act constituting an unfair labor practice or otherwise made unlawful by any federal, state or local law shall excuse the Union, its officers, agents or members from their obligations in the provisions of this Article. The provisions of this Article shall not be appealable to the grievance procedure either for the purpose of assessing damages or securing a specific performance, such matters of law being determinable and enforceable only in the courts. The Cooperative shall not lock out members of the Union during the term of this Agreement.

If after ten (10) days neither party questions the rate established for the new classification, it shall become the established rate for the job; otherwise, the establishment of such rate shall be a matter for negotiation. If the parties negotiate and are unable to reach an agreement, the rate as established by the Cooperative shall stand until this Agreement expires if less than twelve (12) months until this Agreement expires and then shall be subject for renegotiation. If more than twelve (12) months from the expiration of this Agreement, then the dispute shall be subject to the Grievance-Arbitration Procedure set out elsewhere in this Agreement. ARTICLE XII Hours of Work and Overtime SECTION 1. An employee's regular work week shall be forty (40) hours and shall start at the beginning of his shift on Monday, subject to change by the Cooperative when requirements -10 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 67 of 121 Witness: Patsy Walters . dictate, but shall not be less than eight (8) hours, excluding a one (I) hour lunch break.

STEP 4. If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled in Step 3 and if the grievance is otherwise arbitrable under this Agreement, it may be referred to arbitration in strict accordance with the provisions of this Agreement pertaining to arbitration, provided that if the Union fails to notify the Cooperative in writing by Registered Mail within ten (10) days after the Cooperative gives its answer in writing to a grievance at Step 3 of the grievance procedure of the Union's desire to arbitrate the grievance, then the Union shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the Cooperative's answer and said grievance shall not thereafter be arbitrable. SECTION 2. The grievance procedure is subject to the following rules and conditions: (a) A settlement satisfactory to the Union at any step in the grievance procedure shall be binding on it and the employee or employees making the complaint. -13 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 70 of 121 Witness: Patsy Walters (b) Saturdays, Sundays and holidays .are excluded m computing the time limits specjfied in this Article.

(g) Any time the Cooperative offers a settlement with regard to any grievance, there will be a Union Official present. \"Union Official\" shall mean the employee's Steward or the Union's Assistant to the President. A settlement reached with the Steward will not set a precedent, unless the Union's Assistant to the President is aware of the settlement. -14 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 71 of 121 Witness: Patsy Walters (h) Any grievance of any kind which has been presented under the grievance procedure set forth herein which is not appealed to the\u00b7 next step within the applicable time specified above and any grievance which has not been presented under the grievance procedure set forth herein within the time period for presentation of grievances shall be considered settled and shall not be subject to further discussion or appeal.

SECTION 6. In the event any gnevance which is otherwise arbitrable under the terms of this Agreement shall be arbitrated, selection of an arbitrator shall first be attempted by the Union and the Cooperative attempting to agree on an arbitrator, and, if they cannot agree upon a selection, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall be asked to furnish a panel consisting of at least seven (7) names of arbitrators. The Union and the Cooperative shall select a single arbitrator from the panel by alternately striking a name until such time as only one (1) name remains.

The Arbitrator shall not decide issues which are not directly involved in the case submitted to him. In any discharge or disciplinary suspension case where the Arbitrator decides that the aggrieved employee should be awarded any back pay, the Cooperative shall be entitled to full credit on such awards for the employee's gross interim earnings, unemployment compensation benefits, worker's compensation benefits received or receivable and any other compensation he receives from any form of employment during the period he was not working for the Cooperative.

In the event of layoff, the least senior, least qualified employee in the unit will be laid off. If the job opening created is to be filled and the layoff was created by elimination of a job of a more senior, qualified employee, then that employee will fill the job of the employee laid off. If the employee is not able to satisfactorily perform the work of the employee being displaced within the two (2) week period, then that employee will be laid off. If more than one (I) job opening is created and they are to be filled, then the same procedure applies with the most senior, qualified employee having first selection, the second most senior, qualified employee having second selection, etc. An employee who displaces another employee pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be paid at the hourly rate of pay for that job classification. When the working force is being increased after a layoff the Cooperativ e will apply the same standards as it originally applied for layoff when employees are being recalled. SECTION 3.

The Cooperative will give employees one (1) week of notice prior to layoff. SECTION 5. Seniority, qualifications, ability, skill and adaptability to perform the work involved, as determined by the Cooperative shall be the controlling factors in promotion of employees, and where in the Cooperative's judgment, these factors are relatively equal between two (2) or more employees, seniority will control. -19 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 75 of 121 Witness: P atsy WaltersPSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 76 of 121 Witness: Patsy Walters SECTION 6. All job vacancies in jobs which the Cooperative decides to fill will be posted for bid at least three (3) full working days.

Employees shall be permitted to bid only on jobs which are higher than the job classification which they are in at the time and a successful job bidder shall not bid again for any posted job for six (6) months. If no employee in the unit who bids on the job is selected using the criteria set out in this Section, then the Cooperative may hire a new employee from outside the work force. An employee who bids on and is awarded a job and who, within ten (10) working days, voluntarily decides they do not desire to stay in that job shall be disqualified from bidding on another job for twelve (12) months.

The Cooperative will give the Union notice when such employees are hired, but shall be under no further obligation with respect to the Union for these employees. SECTION 9. If, and when, employees in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement are promoted or transferred to jobs outside the bargaining unit they will retain and accumulate seniority for a period of twelve (12) months, during which period such employees will have the right to return to a job in the bargaining unit, provided they have the seniority therefor. At the end of said twelve (12) month period, if the employee remains in the job outside of the bargaining unit he will lose all seniority rights under this Agreement. SECTION 10. The seniority list shall be made up by the Cooperative within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement. A copy shall be furnished to the Assistant Business Agent or his representative and a copy posted on the Bulletin Board. This list shall be open for correction for a period of thirty (30) days thereafter and if an employee does not make a protest in writing to the Cooperative, with a copy to the Union within such thirty (30) day period after posting of such list, his seniority shall be as shown on the list. The seniority list shall be brought up-to-date on November 1 of each year thereafter. -21 -PSC Request 1-24 Attachment Page 78 of 121 Witness: Patsy Walters SECTION 11.

No oral interpretations can change this Plan. The Plan described is designed to protect plan participants against certain catastrophic health expenses. Terms which have special meanings when used in this Plan will be italicized. For a list of these terms and their meanings, please see the Defined Terms section of the summary plan description. The failure of a term to appear in italics does not waive the special meaning given to that term, unless the context requires otherwise. The employer fully intends to maintain this Plan indefinitely. However, it reserves the right to terminate, suspend, discontinue, or amend the Plan at any time and for any reason. Changes in the Plan may occur in any or all parts of the Plan including benefit coverage, deductibles , maximums, co- payments , exclusions, limitations, defined terms, eligibility, and the like. This Plan is not a 'grandfathered health plan' under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) , also known as Health Care Reform. Questions regarding the Plan's status can be directed to the Plan Administrator . You may also contact the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor at 1-866-444-3272, or visit www.dol.gov/ebsa/healthreform . Failure to follow the eligibility or enrollment requirements of this Plan may result in delay of coverage or no coverage at all. Reimbursement from the Plan can be reduced or denied because of certain provisions in the Plan, such as coordination of benefits, subrogation, exclusions, timeliness of Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (COBRA) elections, utilization review or other cost management requirements, lack of medical necessity , lack of timely filing of claims, or lack of coverage. These provisions are explained in summary fashion in this document. Additional information is available from the Plan Administrator at no extra cost. Read your benefit materials carefully. Before you receive any services, you need to understand what is covered and excluded under your benefit Plan, your cost sharing obligations, and the steps you can take to minimize your out-of- pocket costs. For complete terms of the Plan and information about benefits which are not outlined in this summary plan description, refer to your Plan's wrap document, which can be obtained from your Human Resources representative. If there is any conflict between this summary plan description and the Plan's wrap document, this plan document will control, unless otherwise specified. This plan document does not determine rights under the Plan; the collective bargaining agreement always will remain the final authority. In the case of a dispute, the information in the union plan documents or collective bargaining agreement will control to the extent permitted by law. If you are a union employee covered under a collective bargaining agreement that provides benefits with the employer , you should contact your local Human Resources Representative to obtain a copy of the summary plan description that applies to you. Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) forms, other claim related information, and available claims history. Notify the Third Party Administrator of any discrepancies or inconsistencies between amounts shown and amounts you actually paid. The Plan will pay benefits only for the expenses incurred while this coverage is in force. No benefits are payable for expenses incurred before coverage began or after coverage terminates. An expense for a service or supply is incurred on the date the service or supply is furnished. No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover under any section of this Plan until the appeal rights provided have been exercised and the Plan benefits requested in such appeals have been denied in whole or in part. If the Plan is terminated or amended, or if benefits are eliminated, the rights of plan participants are limited to covered charges incurred before termination, amendment, or elimination. A plan participant should contact the Plan Administrator to obtain additional information, free of charge, about Plan coverage of a specific benefit, particular drug, treatment, test, or any other aspect of Plan benefits or requirements.

To determine when coverage will end for a qualified dependent who reaches the applicable limiting age, please refer to the When Dependent Coverage Terminates subsection. Any child of a plan participant who is an alternate recipient under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) or National Medical Support Notice shall be considered as having a right to dependent coverage under this Plan. A participant of this Plan may obtain, without charge, a copy of the procedures governing QMCSO determinations from the Plan Administrator . The Plan Administrator may require documentation proving eligibility for dependent coverage, including birth certificates, tax records, or initiation of legal proceedings severing parental rights. 4. a covered dependent child or covered qualified dependent who reaches the limiting age and is totally disabled , incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of mental or physical disability, primarily dependent upon the covered employee for support and maintenance, and is unmarried The Plan Administrator may require, at reasonable intervals, continuing proof of the total disability and dependency. The Plan Administrator reserves the right to have such dependent examined by a physician of the Plan Administrator's choice, at the Plan's expense, to determine the existence of such incapacity. Effective Date of Dependent Coverage A dependent's coverage will take effect on the day that the eligibility requirements are met, the employee is covered under the Plan, and all enrollment requirements are met. Ineligible Dependent(s) Unless otherwise provided in this plan document, the following are not considered eligible dependents : 1. other individuals living in the covered employee's home, but who are not eligible as defined 2. the legally separated or divorced former spouse of the employee 3. any person who is on active duty in any military service of any country 4. a person who is covered as an employee under the Plan 5. any other person not defined above in the subsection entitled Eligible Classes of Dependents Restrictions on Elections If a plan participant changes status from employee to dependent or dependent to employee , and the person is covered continuously under this Plan before, during, and after the change in status, credit will be given for deductibles, and all amounts will be applied to maximums.

Accumulators will transfer if a dependent changes from coverage under one (1) parent employee to coverage under another parent employee . Eligibility Requirements for Dependent Coverage A dependent of an employee will become eligible for dependent coverage on the first day that the employee is eligible for employee coverage and the family member satisfies the requirements for dependent coverage. At any time, the Plan may require proof that a spouse, qualified dependent, or a child qualifies or continues to qualify as a dependent as defined by this Plan. B. Enrollment Enrollment Requirements An employee must enroll for coverage for themselves and/or their dependents by completing the enrollment process along with the appropriate payroll deduction authorization. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 13 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters8 Enrollment Requirements for Newborn Children A newborn child will be automatically enrolled for thirty (30) days from birth. In order for coverage to continue, a covered employee must complete an enrollment application as shown in the Qualifying Events Chart subsection. If the newborn child is not enrolled in this Plan on a timely basis, there will be no payment from the Plan beyond the initial thirty (30) days from birth. The covered parent will be responsible for all further costs and will have to wait until the next open enrollment period to add the child as a dependent . C. Timely Enrollment The enrollment will be timely if the completed form is received by the Plan Administrator no later than thirty (30) days after the person initially becomes eligible for coverage, or as shown in the Qualifying Events Chart subsection for each type of special enrollment period. Late Enrollment An enrollment is late if it is not made on a timely basis or during a special enrollment period. Late enrollees and their dependents who are not eligible to join the Plan during the special enrollment period may join only during the open enrollment period . The time between the date a late enrollee first becomes eligible for enrollment under the Plan and the first day of coverage is not treated as a waiting period . Coverage begins January 1. D. Special Enrollment Rights Federal law provides special enrollment provisions under some circumstances. If an employee is declining enrollment for themselves or their dependents (including a spouse) because of other health insurance or group health plan coverage, there may be a right to enroll in this Plan if there is a loss of eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops contributing towards the other coverage). However, a request for enrollment must be made as shown in the Qualifying Events Chart subsection after the coverage ends (or after the employer stops contributing towards the other coverage). In addition, in the case of a birth, marriage, adoption, or placement for adoption, there may be a right to enroll in this Plan. However, a request for enrollment must be made as shown in the Qualifying Events Chart subsection. The special enrollment rules are described in more detail below. To request special enrollment or obtain more detailed information of these portability provisions, contact the Plan Administrator as outlined in the Quick Reference Information Chart. E. Special Enrollment Periods The enrollment date for anyone who enrolls under a special enrollment period is the first date of coverage. Thus, the time between the date a special enrollee first becomes eligible for enrollment under the Plan and the first day of coverage is not treated as a waiting period . Individuals Losing Other Coverage, Creating a Special Enrollment Right An employee or dependent who is eligible, but not enrolled in this Plan, may enroll if loss of eligibility for coverage meets any of the following conditions: 1. The employee or dependent was covered under a group health plan or had health insurance coverage at the time coverage under this Plan was previously offered to the individual. 2. If required by the Plan Administrator , the employee stated in writing at the time that coverage was offered that the other health coverage was the reason for declining enrollment. 3. The coverage of the employee or dependent who had lost the coverage was under COBRA and the COBRA coverage was exhausted or was not under COBRA and either the coverage was terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for the coverage or because employer contributions towards the coverage were terminated. 4. The employee or dependent requests enrollment in this Plan no later than as shown in the Qualifying Events Chart subsection after the date of exhaustion of COBRA coverage or the termination of non-COBRA coverage due to loss of eligibility or termination of employer contributions, described above. For purposes of these rules, a loss of eligibility occurs if one (1) of the following occurs: PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 14 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters9 1. The employee or dependent has a loss of eligibility due to the Plan no longer offering any benefits to a class of similarly situated individuals (e.g., part-time employees ). 2. The employee or dependent has a loss of eligibility as a result of legal separation, divorce, cessation of dependent status (such as attaining the maximum age to be eligible as a dependent child under the Plan), death, termination of employment, reduction in the number of hours of employment, or contributions towards the coverage were terminated. Covered employees or dependents will not have a special enrollment right if the loss of other coverage results from either: 1. the employee's failure to pay premiums or required contributions 2. the employee or dependent making a fraudulent claim or an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact in connection with the Plan Dependent Beneficiaries If a dependent becomes eligible to enroll and the employee is not enrolled, the employee must enroll in order for the dependent to enroll. If both of the following conditions are met, then the dependent (and if not otherwise enrolled, the employee and other eligible dependents ) may be enrolled under this Plan: 1. The employee is a plan participant under this Plan (or has met the waiting period applicable to becoming a plan participant under this Plan and is eligible to be enrolled under this Plan but for a failure to enroll during a previous enrollment period). 2. A person becomes a dependent of the employee through marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. In the case of the birth or adoption of a child, the spouse of the covered employee may be enrolled as a dependent of the covered employee if the spouse is otherwise eligible for coverage. If the employee is not enrolled at the time of the event, the employee must enroll under this special enrollment period in order for their eligible dependents to enroll. The dependent special enrollment period is as shown in the Qualifying Events Chart subsection. To be eligible for this special enrollment, the dependent and/or employee must request enrollment during the timeframe specified as shown in the Qualifying Events Chart subsection. F.

The employer or Plan may either void coverage for the employee and/or covered dependents for the period of time coverage was in effect, may terminate coverage as of a date to be determined at the Plan's discretion, or may immediately terminate coverage. If coverage is to be terminated or voided retroactively for fraud or misrepresentation, the Plan will provide at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice of such action. When Employee Coverage Terminates Employee coverage will terminate on the earliest of these dates (except in certain circumstances, a covered employee may be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage): 1. the date the Plan is terminatedPSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 16 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters11 2. the last day of the calendar month in which the covered employee ceases to be in one (1) of the eligible classes This includes termination of active employment of the covered employee , an employee on disability, leave of absence, or other leave of absence , unless the Plan specifically provides for continuation during these periods. 3. the date of the covered employee's death 4. the end of the period for which the required contribution has been paid if the charge for the next period is not paid when due For a complete explanation of when COBRA continuation coverage is available, what conditions apply, and how to select it, see the section entitled Continuation Coverage Rights Under COBRA .

H. Continuation During Periods of Employer-Certified Disability, Leave of Absence, or Layoff A person may remain eligible for a limited time if active, full-time work ceases due to disability, leave of absence, or layoff. This continuance will end as follows: 1. for disability leave only: the date the employer ends the continuance 2. for leave of absence or layoff only: the date the employer ends the continuance While continued, coverage will be that which was in force on the last day worked as an active employee . However, if benefits are reduced for others in the class, they will also be reduced for the continued person. I. Continuation During Family and Medical Leave Regardless of the established leave policies mentioned above, this Plan shall at all times comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) as promulgated in regulations issued by the Department of Labor. During any leave taken under FMLA, the employer will maintain coverage under this Plan on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if the covered employee had been continuously employed during the entire leave period. If Plan coverage terminates during the FMLA leave, coverage will be reinstated for the employee and their covered dependents if the employee returns to work in accordance with the terms of the FMLA leave . Coverage will be reinstated only if the person(s) had coverage under this Plan when the FMLA leave started and will be reinstated to the same extent that it was in force when that coverage terminated. J. Rehiring a Terminated Employee If your employment ends and you are rehired by the employer within ninety (90) days following termination, your coverage will take effect on the rehire date . PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 17 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters12 If you were not covered under the Plan on the date of your termination or you are rehired by the employer more than ninety (90) days after your termination date, you will be treated as a new employee and will be required to satisfy the waiting period . K. Open Enrollment Every year during the annual open enrollment period , covered employees and their covered dependents will be able to change some of their benefit decisions based on which benefits and coverages are right for them. Every year during the annual open enrollment period , employees and their dependents who are late enrollees will be able to enroll in the Plan. Benefit choices made during the open enrollment period will become effective January 1 and remain in effect until the next January 1 unless there is a special enrollment event or change in family status during the year (birth, death, marriage, divorce, adoption) or loss of coverage due to loss of a spouse's employment. To the extent previously satisfied, coverage waiting periods will be considered satisfied when changing from one benefit option under the Plan to another benefit option under the Plan. Benefit choices for late enrollees made during the open enrollment period will become effective January 1. A plan participant who fails to make an election during an active open enrollment period will no longer be covered under this Plan. A plan participant will automatically retain their present coverages during a passive open enrollment period. However, if an employee is enrolled in an FSA, they are required to actively elect these benefits during the open enrollment period each year in order to retain their present coverage. Plan participants will receive detailed information regarding open enrollment from their employer . PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 18 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters13 SECTION III\u2014CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 2021 AND TRANSPARENCY IN COVERAGE REGULATIONS The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CAA) is a federal law that includes the No Surprises Billing Act. In addition, the Transparency in Coverage (TIC) regulations contain transparency requirements. Portions of the CAA and TIC are described briefly below. Enforcement dates, standards for implementation, coordination with other entities, legal developments, and updates offered by federal and/or state entities directly impact actions and availability of the items described. In addition, some plan types are not subject to the CAA and/or TIC, or certain provisions of either. A. Surprise Billing Claims Surprise billing claims are claims that are subject to the No Surprises Billing Act requirements. These are: 1.emergency services provided by non-network providers or facility 2. covered services provided by a non-network provider at a network facility 3.non-network air ambulance services The section below contains further information about how these claim categories apply to your Plan. B. No Surprises Billing Act Requirements Emergency Services As required by the CAA, emergency services are covered under your Plan: 1. without the need for pre-certification 2. whether the provider is network or non-network If the emergency services you receive are provided by a non-network provider or facility, covered services will be processed at the network benefit level in accordance with the CAA. Note that if you receive emergency services from a non-network provider or facility, your out-of-pocket costs will be limited to amounts that would apply if the covered services had been furnished by a network provider or facility. However, non-network cost-sharing amounts (i.e., co-payments , deductibles, and/or co-insurance ) will apply to your claim if the treating non-network provider or facility determines you are stable and the non-network provider satisfies all of the following requirements: 1. determines that you are able to travel to a network facility by non-emergency or non-medical transport to an available network provider or facility within a reasonable distance based on your condition 2. complies with the notice and consent requirement 3. determines that you are in condition to receive the information and provide informed consent If you continue to receive services from the non-network provider after you are stabilized, you will be responsible for the non-network cost-sharing amounts , and the non-network provider will also be able to charge you any difference between the maximum allowable amount and the non-network provider's billed charges. Non-Network Services Provided at a Network Facility When you receive covered services from a non-network provider at a network facility, your claims will be paid at the non-network benefit level if the non-network provider gives you proper notice of its charges, and you give written consent to such charges. This means you will be responsible for non-network cost-sharing amounts for those services and the non-network provider can also charge you any difference between the maximum allowable amount and the non-network provider's billed charges. This requirement does not apply to ancillary services. Ancillary services are defined as: 1. items and services related to emergency medicine, anesthesiology, pathology, radiology, and neonatology, whether provided by a physician or non-physician practitioner 2. items and services provided by assistant surgeons, hospitalists, and intensivists 3. diagnostic services, including radiology and laboratory servicesPSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 19 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters14 4. items and services provided by a non-participating provider if there is no participating provider who can furnish such item or service at such facility This notice and consent exception also does not apply if the covered services furnished by a non-network provider result from unforeseen and urgent medical needs arising at the time of service. Non-network providers satisfy the notice and consent requirement by one (1) of the following: 1. by obtaining your consent and offering the required notice not later than seventy-two (72) hours prior to the delivery of services 2. the notice is given and consent is obtained on the date of the service, if you make an appointment within seventy-two (72) hours of the services being delivered To help you determine whether a provider is non-network , the network is required to confirm the list of network providers in its provider directory every ninety (90) days. If you can show that you received inaccurate information from the network that a provider was in-network on a particular claim, then you will only be liable for network cost sharing amounts (i.e., co-payments , deductibles , and/or co-insurance ) for that claim. Your network cost-sharing amount will be calculated based upon the maximum allowed amount . In addition to your network cost-share, the non- network provider can also charge you for the difference between the maximum allowed amount and their billed charges. C. How Cost-Shares Are Calculated Your cost sharing amounts for emergency services or for covered services received by a non-network provider at a network facility will be calculated as defined by the CAA, such as the median plan network contract rate that we pay network providers for the geographic area where the covered service is provided if other calculation criteria does not apply. Any out-of-pocket cost you pay to a non-network provider for either emergency services or for covered services provided by a non-network provider at a network facility will be applied to your network out-of-pocket limit . D. Appeals If you receive emergency services from a non-network provider or covered services from a non-network provider at a network facility and believe those services are covered by the No Surprise Billing Act, you have the right to appeal that claim. If your appeal of a surprise billing claim is denied, then you have a right to appeal the adverse decision to an independent review organization as set out in the Claims and Appeals section of this summary plan description. A provider can dispute the payment they received from the Plan by utilizing a process set up the CAA, or if applicable, state law. The CAA process includes Open Negotiation, and if unresolved, Independent Dispute Resolution. Importantly, this process does not include the plan participant , and you are not required to participate. To learn more about the CAA, you can visit https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises . E. Transparency Requirements Under your Plan, the following are provided as required by the CAA and TIC. Depending on how the Plan interacts with other entities, these may be provided from the Third Party Administrator , the network, Pharmacy Benefit Manager, and/or other stakeholders (ex. Customer Care or Member Services): 1. protections with respect to surprise billing claims by providers 2. estimates on what non-network providers may charge for a particular service 3. information on contacting state and federal agencies in case you believe a provider has violated the No Surprise Billing Act's requirements When asked, a paper copy of the type of information you request from the above list can be provided. Through the price comparison/shoppable services tool(s) associated with your Plan or through Member Services at the phone number on the back of your ID card, you can receive the following: 1. cost sharing information that you would be responsible for, for a service from a specific network provider 2. a list of all network providers 3. cost sharing information on a non-network provider's services based on the network's reasonable estimate based on what the network would pay a non-network provider for the servicePSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 20 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters15 As applicable, under machine readable requirements from the TIC, the network, Pharmacy Benefit Manager, Third Party Administrator , and/or entities associated with your Plan will provide access through separate publicly accessible websites that contain the following information: 1.network negotiated rates 2. historical non-network allowed amounts 3. drug pricing information F. Continuity of Care If a network provider leaves the network for any reason other than termination for failure to meet applicable quality standards, fraud, or otherwise defined by the CAA, you may be able to continue seeing that provider for a limited period of time and still receive network benefits. The CAA permits you to request and decide to continue to have benefits provided under the same terms and conditions as you would have had under the plan document had the provider not moved to non-network status. If authorized, continuity of care ends ninety (90) days after you are notified by the Plan or its delegate of the right to request continuity of care or the date you are no longer under care of the provider, whichever of these is earlier. Continuity of care under the CAA is permitted for a plan participant who, with respect to a provider, qualifies based on any of the following circumstances: 1. is undergoing a course of treatment for a serious and complex condition from the provider or facility 2. is undergoing a course of institutional or inpatient care from the provider or facility 3. is scheduled to undergo nonelective surgery from the provider, including receipt of postoperative care from such provider or facility with respect to such a surgery 4. is pregnant and undergoing a course of treatment for the pregnancy from the provider or facility 5. is or was determined to be terminally ill (as determined under section 1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act) and is receiving treatment for such illness from such provider or facility Under the CAA, the term 'serious and complex condition' means, with respect to a participant , beneficiary, or enrollee under a group health plan or group or individual health insurance coverage, one (1) of the following: 1. in the case of an acute illness, a condition that is serious enough to require specialized medical treatment to avoid the reasonable possibility of death or permanent harm 2. in the case of a chronic illness or condition, a condition that satisfies both of the following criteria: a. is life-threatening, degenerative, potentially disabling, or congenital b. requires specialized medical care over a prolonged period of time If you wish to continue seeing the same provider/facility and you believe continuity of care under the CAA applies, you or your provider/facility should contact the entity responsible for Member Services on back of your card for how to apply for continuity of care. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 21 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters16 SECTION IV\u2014MEDICAL NETWORK INFORMATION A. Network and Non-Network Services Network Provider Information The Plan has entered into an agreement with a medical network that maintains contractual agreements with certain hospitals , physicians , and other health care providers which are called network providers. Because these network providers have agreed to charge reduced fees to persons covered under the Plan, the Plan can afford to reimburse a higher percentage of their fees. Therefore, when a plan participant uses a network provider, that plan participant will receive better benefits from the Plan than when a non-network provider is used. It is the plan participant's choice as to which provider to use. Non-Network Provider Information Non-network providers have no agreements with the Plan or the Plan's medical network and are generally free to set their own charges for the services or supplies they provide. The Plan will reimburse for the allowable charges for any medically necessary services or supplies, subject to the Plan's deductibles , co-insurance , co-payments , limitations, and exclusions. Plan participants must submit proof of claim before any such reimbursement will be made. Before you obtain services or supplies from a non-network provider, you can find out whether the Plan will provide network or non-network benefits for those services or supplies by contacting the Third Party Administrator as outlined in the Quick Reference Information Chart. Refer to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and Transparency in Coverage Regulations section for additional provisions pertaining to non-network services and billing. Provider Non-Discrimination To the extent that an item or service is a covered charge under the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall be applied in a manner that does not discriminate against a health care provider who is acting within the scope of the provider's license or other required credentials under applicable state law. This provision does not preclude the Plan from setting limits on benefits, including cost sharing provisions, frequency limits, or restrictions on the methods or settings in which treatments are provided, and does not require the Plan to accept all types of providers as a network provider. B. Choosing a Physician - Patient Protection Notice The Plan does not require you to select a primary care physician (PCP) to coordinate your care, and you do not have to obtain a referral to see a specialist. You do not need prior authorization from the Plan or Third Party Administrator , or from any other person (including your PCP) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in the network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care provider, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining pre-certification for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. C. Special Reimbursement Provisions Under the following circumstances, the higher network payment will be made for certain non-network services: 1.Medical Emergency. In a medical emergency , a plan participant should try to access a network provider for treatment. However, if immediate treatment is required and this is not possible, the services of non-network providers will be covered until the plan participant's condition has stabilized to the extent that they can be safely transferred to a network provider's care. At that point, if the transfer does not take place, non-network services will be covered at non-network benefit levels. Charges that meet this definition will be paid based on the maximum allowable charges . The plan participant will be responsible for notifying the Third Party Administrator for a review of any claim that meets this definition. 2.No Choice of Provider. If, while receiving treatment at a network facility and provider (other than from a surgeon in a non-emergency situation), a plan participant receives ancillary services or supplies from a non- network provider in a situation in which they have no control over provider selection (such as in the selection of an ambulance, emergency room physician , anesthesiologist, assistant surgeon, or a provider for diagnostic services), such non-network services or supplies will be covered at network benefit levels. Charges that meetPSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 22 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters17 this definition will be paid based on the maximum allowable charges . The plan participant will be responsible for notifying the Third Party Administrator for a review of any claim that meets this definition. 3.Providers Outside of Network Area. If non-network primary care physicians or specialists are used because the necessary service is not in the network or is not reasonably accessible to the plan participant due to geographic constraints [over thirty (30) miles from home or work], such non-network care will be covered at network benefit levels. Charges that meet this definition will be paid based on the maximum allowable charges. The plan participant will be responsible for notifying the Third Party Administrator for a review of any claim that meets this definition. Additional information about this option, as well as a list of network providers, will be given to plan participants , at no cost, and updated as needed. This list will include providers who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology. Refer to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and Transparency in Coverage Regulations section for additional provisions pertaining to non-network services and billing. D.

Verification of Eligibility: 1-844-209-0071 Call this number to verify eligibility for Plan benefits before charges are incurred . Please note that oral or written communications with the Third Party Administrator regarding a plan participant's or beneficiary's eligibility or coverage under the Plan are not claims for benefits, and the information provided by the Third Party Administrator or other Plan representative in such communications does not constitute a certification of benefits or a guarantee that any particular claim will be paid. Benefits are determined by the Plan at the time a formal claim for benefits is submitted according to the procedures outlined within the Claims and Appeals section of this plan document. B. Schedule of Benefits All benefits described in the Schedule of Benefits are subject to the exclusions and limitations described more fully herein, including, but not limited to, the Plan Administrator's determination that care and treatment is medically necessary ; those charges are in accordance with the maximum allowable charge ; and that services, supplies, and care are not experimental /investigational . This document is intended to describe the benefits provided under the Plan, but due to the number and wide variety of different medical procedures and rapid changes in treatment standards, it is impossible to describe all covered charges and/or exclusions with specificity. If you have questions about specific supplies, treatments, or procedures, please contact the Plan Administrator as outlined in the Quick Reference Information Chart. The Plan Administrator retains the right to audit claims to identify treatment(s) that are, or were, not medically necessary , experimental , investigational , or not in accordance with the maximum allowable charges . Pre-Certification The following services must be pre-certified, or reimbursement from the Plan will be reduced: 1.inpatient pre-admission certification and continued stay reviews (all ages, all diagnoses) a. surgical and non-surgical (excluding routine vaginal or cesarean deliveries) b. long term acute care facility (LTAC), not custodial care c.skilled nursing facility /rehabilitation facility d.inpatient mental health /substance use disorder treatment (includes residential treatment facility services) The attending physician does not have to obtain pre-certification from the Plan for prescribing a maternity length of stay that is forty-eight (48) hours or less for a vaginal delivery or ninety-six (96) hours or less for a cesarean delivery. 2.inpatient and outpatient surgery, including surgical pain management injections Pre-certification is not required for office surgeries, all colonoscopies/sigmoidoscopies (screening and diagnostic), and intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections. 3.adoptive cell therapy 4. cardiac catheterization 5. chemotherapy drugs/infusions and radiation treatments for oncology diagnoses 6. clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life- threatening disease or condition This Plan does not cover clinical trials related to other diseases or conditions.

MRI/MRA d. nuclear cardiology e. nuclear medicine (including SPECT scans) f. PET scans 14. outpatient rehabilitation/ habilitation services (physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy) in excess of ten (10) visits per calendar year per therapy type 15. specialty infusion/injectable medications over $3,000 per infusion/injection which are covered under the medical benefits and not obtained through the Prescription Drug Benefits (i.e. provided in an outpatient facility, physician's office, or home infusion) Pre-certification is not required for intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections. 16. transplant (other than cornea), including, but not limited to, kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, and bone marrow replacement to stem cell transfer after high-dose chemotherapy Services rendered in an emergency room or urgent care setting do not require pre-certification . Please see the Health Care Management Program section in this document for details. C. Deductible Amount Deductibles are dollar amounts that the plan participant must pay before the Plan pays. Before benefits can be paid in a calendar year, a plan participant must meet the deductible shown in the applicable Schedule of Medical Benefits. This amount will accrue toward the 100% maximum out-of-pocket limit . D. Common Accident Deductible When two (2) or more plan participants who are covered under the same benefit plan are involved in an accident, only the individual deductible amount will be required to be met before benefits will be paid for covered charges that directly result from the accident when the following conditions are met: 1. at least two (2) of the plan participants involved in the accident receive covered charges directly resulting from the accident 2. the combined allowed amount for all covered charges for all plan participants involved in the accident is equal to or greater than the individual deductible amount Claims will be credited to the deductible of the employee during the calendar year in which the accident occurred. E. Benefit Payment Each calendar year , benefits will be paid for the covered charges of a plan participant that are in excess of the deductible , any co-payments, and any amounts paid for the same services. Payment will be made at the rate shown under the reimbursement rate in the applicable Schedule of Medical Benefits. No benefits will be paid in excess of the maximum benefit amount or any listed limit of the Plan. Services rendered may have professional, facility, and other components for which physicians and facilities may bill separately. F. Out-of-Pocket Limit Covered charges are payable at the percentages shown each calendar year until the out-of-pocket limit shown in the applicable Schedule of Medical Benefits is reached. Then, covered charges incurred by a plan participant will be payable at 100% (except for the charges excluded) for the remainder of the calendar year . PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 26 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters21 The out-of-pocket limit includes applicable amounts paid for deductibles , co-payments , and co-insurance . G. Diagnosis Related Grouping (DRG) Diagnosis related grouping (DRG) is a method for reimbursing hospitals for inpatient services. This is when a provider bills for services that go together in a group, or bundle, instead of the individual services that make up the group separately. The provider has agreed to a set DRG rate with the network. When a service is rendered, regardless of what the provider bills, the DRG amount has already been set for that specific group of services. A DRG amount can be higher or lower than the actual billed charge because it is based on an average cost for the services rendered. In the case where the DRG amount on an eligible claim is higher than the actual billed charges, the following will determine how each party's cost sharing will be determined: 1. the Plan will base their portion of the charge on the network allowed amount 2. the plan participant's portion of the charge will be based on the billed charges 3. the difference in the network allowed amount versus the actual billed charges will be the responsibility of the Plan H. Co-Insurance For covered charges incurred with a network provider, the Plan pays a specified percentage of the negotiated rate. This percentage varies, depending on the type of covered charge , and is specified in the applicable Schedule of Medical Benefits. You are responsible for the difference between the percentage the Plan pays and 100% of the negotiated rate. For covered charges incurred with a non-network provider, the Plan pays a specified percentage of covered charges at the maximum allowable charge . In those circumstances, you are responsible for the difference between the percentage the Plan pays and 100% of the billed amount, unless your claim is a surprise billing claim . These amounts for which you are responsible are known as co-insurance . Unless noted otherwise in the Special Comments column of the applicable Schedule of Medical Benefits, your co-insurance applies towards satisfaction of the out-of-pocket limit . I. Co-Payments In certain cases, instead of paying co-insurance , you must pay a specific dollar amount, as specified in the applicable Schedule of Medical Benefits. This amount for which you are responsible is known as a co-payment and is typically payable to the health care provider at the time services or supplies are rendered. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Schedule of Medical Benefits, co-payments are applied per provider per day. Unless noted otherwise in the Special Comments column of the applicable Schedule of Medical Benefits, your co- payments apply toward satisfaction of the out-of-pocket limit . J. Balance Bill The balance bill refers to the amount you may be charged for the difference between a non-network provider's billed charges and the allowable charge . Network providers will accept the allowable charge for covered charges . They will not charge you for the difference between their billed charges and the allowable charge . Non-network providers have no obligation to accept the allowable charge . You are responsible to pay a non-network provider's billed charges, even though reimbursement is based on the allowable charge . Depending on what billing arrangements you make with a non-network provider, the provider may charge you for full billed charges at the time of service or seek to balance bill you for the difference between billed charges and the amount that is reimbursed on a claim. Any amounts paid for balance bills do not count toward the deductible , co-insurance , or out-of-pocket limit . Refer to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and Transparency in Coverage Regulations section for additional provisions pertaining to balance billing/surprise billing .

High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) A qualified high deductible health plan (HDHP) with a health savings account (HSA) provides comprehensive coverage for high-cost medical events and a tax-advantaged way to help build savings for future medical expenses. The Plan gives you greater control over how health care benefits are used. An HDHP satisfies certain statutory requirements with respect to minimum deductibles and out-of-pocket limits for both individual and family coverage. These minimum deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket limits are set forth by the U.S. Department of Treasury and will be indexed for inflation in the future. How This Plan Works This Plan features higher annual deductibles and out-of-pocket limits than other traditional health plans. With the exception of preventive care , you must meet the annual deductible before the Plan pays benefits. It is called a high deductible health plan or HDHP. It is paired with a health savings account (HSA). You may elect to make pre-tax contributions from your paycheck to your HSA each pay period. The HDHP provides medical and prescription drug coverage, and the HSA provides a tax-free way to help you save for health expenses in retirement. The HDHP gives you flexibility and discretion to determine how to use your health care benefits. You can pay your deductible with funds from your HSA, or you can choose to pay your deductible out-of-pocket, allowing your health savings account to grow. Preventive care services are not subject to the deductible . These benefits are paid at 100%. Applying Expenses to the Deductible If you have not met your deductible , you will be responsible for 100% of the allowed amount for your health care expenses. If you use a network provider, the provider will submit the claim to the Third Party Administrator on your behalf. If you use a non-network provider, your physician may ask you to pay for the services provided before you leave the office. In that case, you must submit your claim to the Third Party Administrator to ensure your expenses are applied to the deductible . You will subsequently receive an Explanation of Benefits from the Third Party Administrator stating how much the negotiated payment amount is and the amount for which you are responsible. L. Requirements for a Health Savings Account (HSA) To be eligible for enrollment in a health saving account , you must: 1. be enrolled in a qualified HDHP 2. in general, not have any other non- HDHP medical coverage including coverage under a health flexible spending account or health reimbursement account You are allowed to have auto, dental, vision, disability, and long-term care insurance at the same time as an HDHP. 3. not be enrolled in a general purpose health care flexible spending account (and your spouse may not be enrolled in a general purpose flexible spending account) 4. not be enrolled in Medicare 5. not be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return Qualified Medical Expenses A partial list is provided in IRS Publication 502, available at www.irs.gov . PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 28 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters23 M. Schedule of Medical Benefits - HDHP Option NETWORK PROVIDERS NON-NETWORK PROVIDERS Deductible, per Calendar Year The deductible includes prescription drugs . The network and non-network deductible amounts do not accumulate towards each other. Co-insurance does not apply to the deductible . When applicable, claims for a common accident will be credited to the covered employee and their deductible . Individual Plan $1,500 $3,000 Per family unit $3,000 $6,000 Family Unit - Non-Embedded Deductible If you are enrolled in the family option on the high deductible health plan , there is not an individual deductible embedded in the family unit deductible . Before your Plan helps you pay for any of your medical bills, the entire amount of the family unit deductible must be met first. It can be met by one (1) family member or a combination of family members; however, there are no benefits (except for preventive care ) until expenses equaling the family unit deductible amount have been incurred . For example, if you, your spouse, and child are on a family plan with a $3,000 family unit non-embedded deductible and the individual deductible is $1,500, and your child incurs $1,500 in medical bills, your Plan will NOT help pay subsequent medical bills until the family unit deductible of $3,000 has been met yet. Co-Insurance Out-of-Pocket Limit, per Calendar Year This out-of-pocket limit includes co-insurance . Per plan participant $2,000 $4,000 Per family unit $4,000 $8,000 Overall Maximum Out-of-Pocket Limit, per Calendar Year The overall out-of-pocket limit includes co-payments, co-insurance, deductibles, and covered prescription drug charges. The network and non-network out-of-pocket limits do not accumulate towards each other. Per plan participant $3,500 $7,000 Per family unit $7,000 $14,000 Family Unit - Embedded Out-of-Pocket Limit If you are enrolled in the family unit option, your Plan contains two (2) components: an individual out-of-pocket limit and a family unit out-of-pocket limit . Having two (2) components to the out-of-pocket limit allows each member of your family unit the opportunity to have their covered charges be payable at 100% (except for the charges excluded) prior to the entire dollar amount of the family unit out-of-pocket limit being met. The individual out-of-pocket limit is embedded in the family unit out-of-pocket limit . The Plan will pay the designated percentage of covered charges until out-of-pocket limits are reached at which time the Plan will pay 100% of the remainder of covered charges for the rest of the calendar year unless stated otherwise. NOTE: The following charges do not apply toward the out-of-pocket limit amount and are generally not paid by the Plan: 1. cost containment penalties 2. amounts over maximum allowable charges 3. charges not covered under the Plan 4.balanced billed chargesPSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 29 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters24 Benefits shown as co-insurance are listed for the percentage the Plan will pay.

Introduction The health care management program consists of several components to assist plan participants in staying well: providing optimal management of chronic conditions, provisions of support, and service coordination during times of acute or new onset of a medical condition. The scope of the health care management program consists of the following components (each of which will be further discussed in this section): 1. utilization review 2. concurrent review and discharge planning 3. case management B. Utilization Review The utilization review program is designed to help ensure all plan participants receive medically necessary and appropriate health care while avoiding unnecessary expenses. The purpose of the program is to determine what services are medically necessary and eligible for payment by the Plan. This program is not designed to be the practice of medicine or to be a substitute for the medical judgment of the attending physician or other health care provider. If a particular course of treatment or medical service is not pre-certified , it means that either the Plan will not pay for the charges, or the Plan will not consider that course of treatment as medically necessary and appropriate for the maximum reimbursement under the Plan. The patient is urged to review why there is a discrepancy between what was requested and what was certified before incurring charges. Your employer has contracted with the Medical Management Administrator in order to assist you in determining whether or not proposed services are appropriate for reimbursement under the Plan. The program is not intended to diagnose or treat medical conditions, guarantee benefits, or validate eligibility. Elements of the Utilization Review Program The program consists of: 1.Pre-Certification. Review of the medical necessity for non-emergency services before medical and/or surgical services are provided. 2.Retrospective Review. Review of the medical necessity of the health care services provided on an emergency basis, after they have been provided. 3.Concurrent Review. Ongoing assessment of the health care as it is being provided, especially, but not limited to, inpatient confinement in a hospital or covered medical care facility (based on the admitting diagnosis and the listed services requested by the attending physician ). 4.Discharge Planning. Certification of services and planning for discharge from a medical care facility or cessation of medical treatment. What Services Must Be Pre-Certified (Approved Before they are Provided) The provider, patient, or family member must call the Medical Management Administrator to receive certification of certain health care management services. This call must be made at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of services being rendered or within forty-eight (48) hours after an emergency . Any reduced reimbursement due to failure to follow cost management procedures will not accrue toward the out- of-pocket limit. The following services must be pre-certified before the services are provided: 1.inpatient pre-admission certification and continued stay reviews (all ages, all diagnoses) a. surgical and non-surgical (excluding routine vaginal or cesarean deliveries) b. long term acute care facility (LTAC), not custodial care c.skilled nursing facility / rehabilitation facility PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 51 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters46 d.inpatient mental health/substance use disorder treatment (includes residential treatment facility services) The attending physician does not have to obtain pre-certification from the Plan for prescribing a maternity length of stay that is forty-eight (48) hours or less for a vaginal delivery or ninety-six (96) hours or less for a cesarean delivery. 2.Inpatient and outpatient surgery , including surgical pain management injections Pre-certification is not required for office surgeries , all colonoscopies/sigmoidoscopies (screening and diagnostic), and intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections. 3.adoptive cell therapy 4. cardiac catheterization 5. chemotherapy drugs/infusions and radiation treatments for oncology diagnoses 6. clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life- threatening disease or condition This Plan does not cover clinical trials related to other diseases or conditions.

PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 52 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters47 In order to maximize Plan reimbursements, please read the following provisions carefully. How to Request Pre-Certification Before a plan participant enters a medical care facility on a non-emergency basis or receives other listed medical services, the Medical Management Administrator will, in conjunction with the attending physician, certify the care as medically necessary for Plan reimbursement. A non-emergency stay in a medical care facility is one that can be scheduled in advance. The medical management program is set in motion by a telephone call from, or on behalf of, the plan participant . Contact the Medical Management Administrator at least forty-eight (48) hours before services are scheduled to be rendered with the following information: 1. the name of the plan participant and relationship to the covered employee 2. the name, employee identification number, and address of the covered employee 3. the name of the employer 4. the name and telephone number of the attending physician 5. the name of the medical care facility 6. the proposed medical services 7. the proposed date(s) of services 8. the proposed length of stay If there is an emergency admission to the medical care facility , the patient, patient's family member, medical care facility, or attending physician must contact the Medical Management Administrator within forty-eight (48) hours of the first business day after the admission. Refer to the Quick Reference Information Chart for contact information. The Medical Management Administrator will determine the number of days of medical care facility confinement or use of other listed medical services authorized for payment. Failure to follow this procedure will reduce reimbursement received from the Plan. Warning: Obtaining pre-certification of particular services does not guarantee that they will be reimbursed by the Plan. Benefits are determined by the Plan at the time a formal claim for benefits is submitted according to the procedures outlined within the Claims and Appeals section of this plan document. NOTE: If your admission or service is determined to not be medically necessary , you may pursue an appeal by following the provisions described in the Claims and Appeals section (First Level Appeal of a Pre-Service Claim subsection) of this document. The plan participant and provider will be informed of any denial or non-certification in writing. Appeals of a Denial of Pre-Certification from the Medical Management Administrator Pre-certification decisions are considered claims decisions that are subject to appeal. Refer to the Claims and Appeals section (Other Pre-Service Claims subsection) for details on how to appeal and the timeframes for appealing a pre- service claim decision. C. Concurrent Review and Discharge Planning How Concurrent Review Works Concurrent review of a course of treatment and discharge planning from a medical care facility are part of the medical management program. The Medical Management Administrator will monitor the plan participant's medical care facility stay or use of other medical services and coordinate with the attending physician , medical care facilities , and plan participant either the scheduled release or an extension of the medical care facility stay or extension or cessation of the use of other medical services. If the attending physician feels that it is medically necessary for a plan participant to receive additional services or to stay in the medical care facility for a greater length of time than has been pre-certified , the attending physician must request the additional services or days. How to File a Concurrent Claim for Benefits under this Plan PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 53 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters48 Refer to the Claims and Appeals section (Concurrent Care Claims subsection) for details on how to appeal a denial of a concurrent review. No benefits will be paid for any charges related to days of confinement to a hospital or other health care facility that have not been determined to be medically necessary by the Medical Management Administrator . D. Case Management Case management is designed to help manage the care of patients who have special or extended care illnesses or injuries. Case management is a collaborative process that assesses, plans, implements, coordinates, monitors, and evaluates the options and services required to meet a plan participant's health needs, using communication and available resources to promote quality, cost-effective outcomes. The primary objective of case management is to identify and coordinate cost-effective medical care, which meets accepted standards of medical practice. Case management also monitors the care of the patient, offers emotional support to the family, and coordinates communications among health care providers, patients, and others. Cases are identified for possible case management involvement based on a request for review or the presence of a number of parameters, such as, but not limited to: 1. admissions that exceed the recommended or approved length of stay 2. utilization of health care services that generates ongoing and/or excessively high costs 3. conditions that are known to require extensive and/or long-term follow-up care and/or treatment The Plan may elect, at its sole discretion, when acting on a basis that precludes individual selection, to provide alternative benefits that are otherwise excluded under the Plan. The alternative benefits shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, and the Plan's determination to provide the benefits in one (1) instance shall not obligate the Plan to provide the same or similar alternative benefits for the same or any other plan participant , nor shall it be deemed to waive the right of the Plan to strictly enforce the provisions of the Plan. The case manager will coordinate and implement the case management program by providing guidance and information on available resources and suggesting the most appropriate treatment plan. The Plan Administrator , attending physician, patient, and patient's family must all agree to the alternate treatment plan. Once agreement has been reached, the Plan Administrator will direct the Plan to reimburse for medically necessary expenses as stated in the treatment plan, even if these expenses normally would not be paid by the Plan. Unless specifically provided to the contrary in the Plan Administrator's instructions, reimbursement for expenses incurred in connection with the treatment plan shall be subject to all Plan limits and cost sharing provisions. Benefits under case management may be provided if the Medical Management Administrator determines that the services are medically necessary , appropriate, cost-effective, and feasible. All decisions made by case management are based on the individual circumstances of that plan participant's case. Each case is reviewed on its own merits, and any benefits provided are under individual consideration. All case management is a voluntary service. There are no reductions of benefits or penalties assessed if the patient and family choose not to participate. Each treatment plan is individually tailored to a specific patient and should not be seen as appropriate or recommended for any other patient, even one with the same diagnosis. E.Courtesy Reviews The Medical Management Administrator may perform courtesy reviews . Courtesy reviews are a pre-service assessment of medical necessity only and are not a guarantee of benefits. Courtesy reviews will be made as soon as possible after the request has been submitted, but no later than thirty (30) days. Completion of a courtesy review is not a requirement of the Plan and should not be a cause for delay in treatment of medically necessary care. Contact the Medical Management Administrator for any questions by phone at 1-800-786-7930 or by fax at 1-208-955-1541. Refer to the Claims and Appeals section for timeframes and other information regarding filing claims. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 54 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters49 SECTION IX\u2014PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS A. About Your Prescription Benefits The prescription drug benefits are separate from the medical benefits and are administered by Navitus and Pillar Rx (PBM Vendor). This program allows you to use your ID card at a nationwide network of participating pharmacies to purchase your prescriptions. When purchasing prescription drugs at retail pharmacies or through mail order, using your ID card at participating pharmacies provides you with the best economic benefit. Claims for reimbursement of prescription drugs are to be submitted to Navitus and Pillar Rx at: Navitus Health Solutions, LLC PO Box 999 Attn: Claims Appleton, WI 54912 B. Co-Payments The co-payment is applied to each covered pharmacy drug or mail order drug charge and is shown in the applicable Schedule of Prescription Drug Benefits. The co-payment amount is not a covered charge under the Medical Plan. C. Co-Insurance Once you have met the Medical Plan's calendar year deductible , your co-insurance is applied to each covered pharmacy drug or mail order drug charge and is shown in the applicable Schedule of Prescription Drug Benefits. D. Manufacturer Coupons Any amounts in the form of manufacturer coupons or drug savings discount cards used for brand name drugs when there is a generic equivalent available, unless the brand name is medically necessary, do not apply to the deductible or out-of-pocket limit . E. Mail Order Drug Benefit Option The mail order drug benefit option is available for maintenance medications (those that are taken for long periods of time, such as drugs sometimes prescribed for heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, etc.). Because of volume buying, , the mail order pharmacy , may be able to offer plan participants significant savings on their prescriptions. F. Tablet Splitting The tablet splitting program, which is optional for plan participants , has identified medications which are taken once daily. The price for a low or high dose tablet is on average the same. Because of this flat pricing of dosage strengths, splitting a tablet of a higher strength to get the desired dose lowers the cost of the medication by up to 50%. Tablet splitting is only available for certain medications under RxCents through Navitus. For more information visit www.navitus.com. G. Specialty Pharmacy Program Lumicera is a specialty pharmacy program offered through a partnership with a specialty pharmacy experience in handling specialty drugs.

Prior Authorization Prescriptions for specialty drug medications or circumstances require clinical approval before they can be filled, even with a valid prescription. Prescriptions may be limited to quantity, frequency, dosage, or may have age restrictions. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 55 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters50 The authorization process may be initiated by the plan participant , the local pharmacy , or the physician by calling Navitus and Pillar Rx at 1-866-378-4755. I. Step Therapy Program Step therapy is a program where you first try a proven, cost-effective medication (called a 'prerequisite drug' in this document) before moving to a more costly drug treatment option. With this program, trying one (1) or more prerequisite drugs is required before a certain prescription medication will be covered under your pharmacy benefits plan. Prerequisite drugs are FDA-approved and treat the same condition as the corresponding step therapy drugs. Step therapy promotes the appropriate use of equally effective but lower-cost drugs first. You, your physician , or the person you appoint to manage your care can ask for an exception if it is medically necessary for you to use a more expensive drug on the step therapy list. If the request is approved, Navitus and Pillar Rx will notify you or your physician . The medication will then be covered at the applicable co-insurance/co-payment under your Plan. You will also be notified of approvals where states require it. If the request is denied, Navitus and Pillar Rx will notify you and your physician . For information on which drugs are part of the step therapy program under your Plan call the Navitus and Pillar Rx customer service number on your ID card. J. Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans for Medicare Eligible Participants Plan participants enrolled in either Part A or Part B of Medicare are also eligible for Medicare Part D Prescription Drug benefits. It has been determined that the prescription drug coverage provided in this Plan is generally better than the standard Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits. Because this Plan's prescription drug coverage is considered creditable coverage, you do not need to enroll in Medicare Part D to avoid a late penalty under Medicare . If you enroll in Medicare Part D while covered under this Plan, payment under this Plan may coordinate benefit payment with Medicare .

Introduction This section contains the claims and appeals procedures and requirements for the Kentucky Rural Electric Cooperative Employers Benefit Plan. TIME LIMIT FOR FILING CLAIMS All claims must be received by the Plan within fifteen (15) months from the date of incurring the expense, or in accordance with applicable federal government regulations. The Plan will accept network adjustments of claims that are within the network's established guidelines. The Plan's representatives will follow administrative processes and safeguards designed to ensure and to verify that benefit claim determinations are made in accordance with governing plan documents and that where appropriate the Plan provisions have been applied consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants . The following types of claims are covered by the procedures in this section: 1. Pre-Service Claim. Some Plan benefits are payable without a financial penalty only if the Plan approves services before services are rendered. These benefits are referred to as pre-service claims (also known as pre- certification or prior authorization). The services that require pre-certification are listed in the Health Care Management Program section of this document. 2. Urgent Care Claim. An urgent care claim is a claim (request) for medical care or treatment in which: a. applying the time periods for pre-certification could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the individual or the ability of the individual to regain maximum function b. in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of the individual's medical condition, would subject the individual to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the claim c. the claim involves urgent care 3. Concurrent Care Claim. A concurrent care claim refers to a Plan decision to reduce or terminate a pre- approved ongoing course of treatment before the end of the approved treatment. A concurrent care claim also refers to a request by you to extend a pre-approved course of treatment. Individuals will be given the opportunity to argue in favor of uninterrupted continuity of care before treatment is cut short. 4. Post-Service Claim. Post-service claims are claims that involve only the payment or reimbursement of the cost of the care that has already been provided. A standard claim and an electronic bill, submitted for payment after services have been provided, are examples of post-service claims. A claim regarding rescission of coverage will be treated as post-service claim . Following is a description of how the Plan processes claims for benefits and reviews the appeal of any claim that is denied. If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, or if Plan coverage is rescinded retroactively for fraud or misrepresentation, the denial is known as an adverse benefit determination . A claimant has the right to request a review of an adverse benefit determination . This request is an appeal. If the claim is denied at the end of the appeal process, as described later in this section, the Plan's final decision is known as a final internal adverse benefit determination . If the claimant receives notice of a final internal adverse benefit determination , or if the Plan does not follow the appeal procedures properly, the claimant then has the right to request an independent external review . The external review procedures are also described later in this section. Both the claims and the appeal procedures are intended to provide a full and fair review. This means, among other things, that claims and appeals will be decided in a manner designed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the persons involved in making these decisions. A claimant must follow all claims and appeals procedures, both internal and external, before they can file a lawsuit. However, this rule may not apply if the Plan Administrator has not complied with the procedures described in this section. If a lawsuit is brought, it must be filed within two (2) years after the final determination of an appeal. Any of the authority and responsibilities of the Plan Administrator under the claims and appeals procedures or the external review process, including the discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the Plan, may be delegated to a third party. If you have any questions regarding these procedures, please contact the Plan Administrator as outlined in the Quick Reference Information Chart.

Urgent Care Claims Any pre-service claim for medical care or treatment which, if subject to the normal timeframes for Plan determination, could seriously jeopardize the claimant's life, health, or ability to regain maximum function or which, in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of the claimant's medical condition, would subject the claimant to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the claim. Whether a claim is an urgent care claim will be determined by an individual acting on behalf of the Plan applying the judgment of a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine. However, any claim that a physician, with knowledge of the claimant's medical condition, determines is an urgent care claim (as described herein) shall be treated as an urgent care claim under the Plan.

A concurrent care claim that involves urgent care will be processed according to the initial review and appeals procedures and timeframes noted under the Urgent Care Claims subsection (above). 4. If a concurrent care claim does not involve urgent care, the request may be treated as a new benefit claim and decided within the timeframe appropriate to the type of claim (i.e., as a pre-service claim or a post-service claim). Such claims will be processed according to the initial review and appeals procedures and timeframes applicable to the claim-type, as noted under the Other Pre-Service Claims subsection (below) or the Post- Service Claims subsection listed later in this section. 5. If the concurrent care claim is approved, you will be notified orally followed by written (or electronic, as applicable) notice provided after the oral notice no later than the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes F. Other Pre-Service Claims Claims that require Plan approval prior to obtaining medical care for the claimant to receive full benefits under the Plan are considered other pre-service claims (e.g. a request for pre-certification under the health care management program). Refer to the Heath Care Management Program section to review the list of services that require pre- certification. How to File Other Pre-Service Claims Typically, other pre-service claims are made on a claimant's behalf by the treating physician . However, it is the claimant's responsibility to ensure that the other pre-service claim has been filed. The claimant can accomplish this by having their health care provider contact the Medical Management Administrator to file the other pre-service claim on behalf of the claimant . Other pre-service claims must include the following information: 1. the name of this Plan 2. the identity of the claimant (name, address, and date of birth) 3. the proposed date(s) of service 4. the name and credentials of the health care provider 5. an order or request from the health care provider for the requested service 6. the proposed place of service 7. a specific diagnosis 8. a specific proposed service code for which approval or payment is requested [current Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) format] 9. clinical information for this Plan to make a medical necessity determination Under certain circumstances provided by federal law, if you or your authorized representative fail to follow the Plan's procedures for filing other pre-service claims , the Plan will provide notice of the failure and the proper procedures to be followed. This notification will be provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than five (5) days after receipt of the claim. You will then have up to forty-five (45) days from receipt of the notice to follow the proper procedures. Notification of Benefit Determination of Other Pre-Service Claims Notice of a benefit determination (whether adverse or not) will be provided in writing within a reasonable period appropriate to the medical circumstances, but no later than the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes after receipt of the claim. However, this period may be extended one (1) time by the Plan for up to the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes if the Plan both determines that such an extension is necessary due to matters beyond its control and provides you written notice, prior to the end of the original time period, of the circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan expects to render a decision. Refer to the Incomplete Claims subsection if such an extension is necessary due to your failure to submit the information necessary to decide the claim.

The IRO does not have to give deference to any earlier claims and appeals decisions, but it must observe the written terms of the plan document. In other words, the IRO is not bound by any previous decision made on your claim. The ultimate decision of the IRO will be binding on you, the Third Party Administrator , and the Plan. M. External Review of Claims The external review process is available only where the final internal adverse benefit determination is denied on the basis of any of the following: 1. a medical judgment (which includes but is not limited to Plan requirements for medical necessity , appropriateness, health care setting, level of care, or effectiveness of a covered benefit)PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 71 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters66 2. a determination that a treatment is experimental or investigational 3. a rescission of coverage If your appeal is denied, you or your authorized representative may request further review by an independent review organization (IRO) .

This external review is mandatory; i.e., you are required to undertake this external review before you may pursue civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. The Plan will complete a preliminary review of the request within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes following the date of receipt of the external review request to determine whether: 1. the claimant is or was covered under the Plan at the time the health care item or service was requested or, in the case of a retrospective review, was covered under the Plan at the time the health care item or service was provided 2. the adverse benefit determination or the final internal adverse benefit determination does not relate to the claimant's failure to meet the requirements for eligibility under the terms of the group health plan (e.g., worker classification or similar determination) 3. the claimant has exhausted the Plan's internal appeal process 4. the claimant has provided all the information and forms required to process an external review The Plan will notify the claimant within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes following completion of its preliminary review if either: 1. the request is complete but not eligible for external review , in which case the notice will include the reasons for its ineligibility, and contact information for the Employee Benefits Security Administration [toll-free number 1-866-444-EBSA (3272)] 2. the request is not complete, in which case the notice will describe the information or materials needed to make the request complete, and allow the claimant to perfect the request for external review within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes or within the forty-eight (48) hour period following receipt of the notification , whichever is later NOTE: If the adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination relates to a plan participant's or beneficiary's failure to meet the requirements for eligibility under the terms of the Plan, it is not within the scope of the external review process, and no external review may be taken. If the request is complete and eligible, the Plan Administrator or its designee will assign the request to an IRO. Once that assignment is made, the following procedure will apply: 1. The assigned IRO will utilize legal experts where appropriate to make coverage determinations under the Plan. 2. The assigned IRO will timely notify the claimant in writing of the request's eligibility and acceptance for external review . This notice will include a statement that the claimant may submit in writing to the assigned IRO, within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes following the date of receipt of the notice, additional information that the IRO must consider when conducting the external review . The IRO is not required to, but may, accept and consider additional information submitted after ten (10) business days. 3. Within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes after the date of assignment of the IRO, the Plan must provide to the assigned IRO the documents and any information considered in making the adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination . Failure by the Plan to timely provide the documents and information must not delay the conduct of the external review . If the Plan fails to timely provide the documents and information, the assigned IRO may terminate the external review and make a decision to the adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination . The IRO must notify the claimant and the Plan within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes after making the decision. 4. Upon receipt of any information submitted by the claimant , the assigned IRO must forward the information to the Plan within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes. Upon receipt of any such information, the Plan may reconsider its adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination that is the subject of the external review . Reconsideration by the Plan must not delay the external review . The external review may be terminated as a result of the reconsideration only if the Plan decides, upon completion of its reconsideration, to reverse its adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination and provide coverage or payment. The Plan must provide written notice of itsPSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 72 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters67 decision to the claimant and the assigned IRO within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes. The assigned IRO must terminate the external review upon receipt of the notice from the Plan. 5. The IRO will review all of the information and documents timely received. In reaching a decision, the assigned IRO will review the claim de novo and not be bound by any decisions or conclusions reached during the Plan's internal claims and appeals process. In addition to the documents and information provided, the assigned IRO, to the extent the information or documents are available and the IRO considers them appropriate, will consider the following in reaching a decision: a. the claimant's medical records b. the attending health care professional's recommendation c. reports from appropriate health care professionals and other documents submitted by the Plan, claimant , or the claimant's treating provider d. the terms of the claimant's Plan to ensure that the IRO's decision is not contrary to the terms of the Plan, unless the terms are inconsistent with applicable law e. appropriate practice guidelines, which must include applicable evidence-based standards and may include any other practice guidelines developed by the federal government, national or professional medical societies, boards, and associations f. any applicable clinical review criteria developed and used by the Plan, unless the criteria are inconsistent with the terms of the Plan or with applicable law g. the opinion of the IRO's clinical reviewer or reviewers after considering the information described in this notice to the extent the information or documents are available 6. The assigned IRO must provide written notice of the final external review decision within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes after the IRO receives the request for the external review . The IRO must deliver the notice of final external review decision to the claimant and the Plan. 7. The assigned IRO's decision notice will contain: a. a general description of the reason for the request for external review , including information sufficient to identify the claim [including the date or dates of service, the health care provider, the claim amount (if applicable), the diagnosis code and its corresponding meaning, the treatment code and its corresponding meaning, and the reason for the previous denial] b. the date the IRO received the assignment to conduct the external review and the date of the IRO decision c. the references to the evidence or documentation, including the specific coverage provisions and evidence-based standards, considered in reaching its decision d. a discussion of the principal reason(s) for its decision, including the rationale for its decision and any evidence-based standards that were relied on in making its decision e. a statement that the determination is binding except to the extent that other remedies may be available under state or federal law to either the group health Plan or to the claimant f. a statement that judicial review may be available to the claimant g. current contact information, including phone number, for any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman If you remain dissatisfied with the outcome of the external review , you may pursue civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. Generally, a claimant must exhaust the Plan's claims and appeals procedures in order to be eligible for the external review process. However, in some cases the Plan provides for an expedited external review if either: 1. The claimant receives an adverse benefit determination that involves a medical condition for which the time for completion of the Plan's internal claims and appeals procedures would seriously jeopardize the claimant's life, health, or ability to regain maximum function, and the claimant has filed a request for an expedited internal review. 2. The claimant receives a final internal adverse benefit determination that involves a medical condition where the time for completion of a standard external review process would seriously jeopardize the claimant's life or health or the claimant's ability to regain maximum function, or if the final internal adverse benefitPSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 73 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters68 determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care item or service for which the claimant received emergency services , but has not been discharged from a facility. Immediately upon receipt of a request for expedited external review , the Plan must determine and notify the claimant whether the request satisfies the requirements for expedited review, including the eligibility requirements for external review listed above. If the request qualifies for expedited review, it will be assigned to an IRO. The IRO must make its determination and provide a notice of the decision as expeditiously as the claimant's medical condition or circumstances require, but in no event more than the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes after the IRO receives the request for an expedited external review . If the original notice of its decision is not in writing, the IRO must provide written confirmation of the decision within the timeframe shown in the Timeframes for Claim and Appeal Processes to both the claimant and the Plan. N. Designation of Authorized Representative A plan participant is permitted to appoint an authorized representative to act on behalf of the plan participant with respect to a benefit claim or appeal of a denial. In connection with a claim involving urgent care, the Plan will permit a health care professional with knowledge of the plan participant's medical condition to act as the plan participant's authorized representative . In the event a plan participant designates an authorized representative , all future communications from the Plan will be with the representative, rather than the plan participant , unless the plan participant directs the Plan Administrator , in writing, to the contrary. If you wish to change/alter your authorized representative, or the time frame, you will need to submit these changes in writing. O. Physical Examinations The Plan reserves the right to have a physician of its own choosing examine any plan participant whose condition, illness, or injury is the basis of a claim. All such examinations shall be at the expense of the Plan. This right may be exercised when and as often as the Plan may reasonably require during the pendency of a claim. The plan participant must comply with this requirement as a necessary condition to coverage. P. Autopsy The Plan reserves the right to have an autopsy performed upon any deceased plan participant whose condition, illness, or injury is the basis of a claim. This right may be exercised only where not prohibited by law. Q. Payment of Benefits All benefits under this Plan are payable, in U.S. dollars, to the plan participant whose illness or injury, or whose covered dependent's illness or injury, is the basis of a claim. In the event of the death or incapacity of a plan participant , and in the absence of written evidence to this Plan of the qualification of a guardian for their estate, this Plan may, in its sole discretion, make any and all such payments to the individual or institution which, in the opinion of this Plan, is or was providing the care and support of such employee . R. Assignments Benefits for medical expenses covered under this Plan may be assigned by a plan participant to the provider as consideration in full for services rendered; however, if those benefits are paid directly to the employee , the Plan shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations with respect to such benefits. The Plan will not be responsible for determining whether any such assignment is valid. Payment of benefits which have been assigned will be made directly to the assignee unless a written request not to honor the assignment, signed by the plan participant and the assignee, has been received before the proof of loss is submitted. No plan participant shall at any time, either during the time in which they are a plan participant in the Plan, or following their termination as a plan participant , in any manner, have any right to assign their right to sue to recover benefits under the Plan, to enforce rights due under the Plan, or to any other causes of action which they may have against the Plan or its fiduciaries. A provider which accepts an assignment of benefits , in accordance with this Plan as consideration in full for services rendered, is bound by the rules and provisions set forth within the terms of this document. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 74 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters69 S. Recovery of Payments Occasionally, benefits are paid more than once; are paid based upon improper billing or a misstatement in a proof of loss or enrollment information; are not paid according to the Plan's terms, conditions, limitations, or exclusions; or should otherwise not have been paid by the Plan. As such, this Plan may pay benefits that are later found to be greater than the maximum allowable charge . In this case, this Plan may recover the amount of the overpayment from the source to which it was paid, primary payers, or from the party on whose behalf the charge(s) were paid. As such, whenever the Plan pays benefits exceeding the amount of benefits payable under the terms of the Plan, the Plan Administrator has the right to recover any such erroneous payment directly from the person or entity who received such payment and/or from other payers and/or the plan participant or dependent on whose behalf such payment was made. A plan participant , dependent , provider, another benefit plan, insurer, or any other person or entity who receives a payment exceeding the amount of benefits payable under the terms of the Plan or on whose behalf such payment was made, shall return or refund the amount of such erroneous payment to the Plan within thirty (30) days of discovery or demand. The Plan Administrator shall have no obligation to secure payment for the expense for which the erroneous payment was made or to which it was applied. The person or entity receiving an erroneous payment may not apply such payment to another expense. The Plan Administrator shall have the sole discretion to choose who will repay the Plan for an erroneous payment and whether such payment shall be reimbursed in a lump sum. When a plan participant or other entity does not comply with the provisions of this section, the Plan Administrator shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to deny payment of any claims for benefits by the plan participant and to deny or reduce future benefits payable (including payment of future benefits for other injuries or illnesses ) under the Plan by the amount due as reimbursement to the Plan. The Plan Administrator may also, in its sole discretion, deny or reduce future benefits (including future benefits for other injuries or illnesses ) under any other group benefits plan maintained by the Plan Sponsor . The reductions will equal the amount of the required reimbursement. Providers and any other person or entity accepting payment from the Plan or to whom a right to benefits has been assigned, in consideration of services rendered, payments, and/or rights, agrees to be bound by the terms of this Plan and agree to submit claims for reimbursement in strict accordance with their state's health care practice acts, ICD-10 or CPT standards, Medicare guidelines, HCPCS standards, or other standards approved by the Plan Administrator or insurer. Any payments made on claims for reimbursement not in accordance with the above provisions shall be repaid to the Plan within thirty (30) days of discovery or demand or incur prejudgment interest of 1.5% per month. If the Plan must bring an action against a plan participant , provider, or other person or entity to enforce the provisions of this section, then that plan participant , provider, or other person or entity agrees to pay the Plan's attorneys' fees and costs, regardless of the action's outcome. Further, plan participants and/or their dependents , beneficiaries, estate, heirs, guardian, personal representative, or assigns ( plan participant ) shall assign or be deemed to have assigned to the Plan their right to recover said payments made by the Plan, from any other party and/or recovery for which the plan participant(s) are entitled, for or in relation to facility-acquired condition(s), provider error(s), or damages arising from another party's act or omission for which the Plan has not already been refunded. The Plan reserves the right to deduct from any benefits properly payable under this Plan the amount of any payment which has been made: 1. in error 2. pursuant to a misstatement contained in a proof of loss or a fraudulent act 3. pursuant to a misstatement made to obtain coverage under this Plan within two (2) years after the date such coverage commences 4. with respect to an ineligible person 5. in anticipation of obtaining a recovery if a plan participant fails to comply with the Plan's Reimbursement AndRecovery Provisions 6. pursuant to a claim for which benefits are recoverable under any policy or act of law providing for coverage for occupational injury or disease to the extent that such benefits are recovered This provision (6) shall not be deemed to require the Plan to pay benefits under this Plan in any such instance. The deduction may be made against any claim for benefits under this Plan by a plan participant or by any of their covered dependents if such payment is made with respect to the plan participant or any person covered or asserting coverage as a dependent of the plan participant . PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 75 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters70 If the Plan seeks to recoup funds from a provider due to a claim being made in error, a claim being fraudulent on the part of the provider, and/or a claim that is the result of the provider's misstatement, said provider shall, as part of its assignment of benefits from the Plan, abstain from billing the plan participant for any outstanding amount. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 76 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters71 SECTION XII\u2014COORDINATION OF BENEFITS A. Coordination of the Benefit Plans Coordination of benefits sets out rules for the order of payment of covered charges when two (2) or more plans, including Medicare , are paying. When a plan participant is covered by this Plan and another plan, or the plan participant's spouse is covered by this Plan and by another plan, or the couple's covered children are covered under two (2) or more plans, the plans will coordinate benefits when a claim is received. Standard Coordination of Benefits (COB) The plan that pays first according to the rules will pay as if there were no other plan involved. The secondary and subsequent plans will pay the balance due up to 100% of the total allowable charges . Example: Assume all deductibles are met, billed services are considered covered charges under both plans, the primary plan pays 80% of the allowable amount , and the secondary plan pays 90% of the allowable amount. A plan participant incurs a claim with a network provider in which the allowable amount is $1,000. Primary Plan $800 Secondary Plan $200 Patient Responsibility $0 Total Amount Paid $1,000 PPO Plan Option: When this Plan is secondary to other insurance, the resulting claims will have the deducible waived for all covered services. Once a coordination of benefits form is received by the Claims Administrator , the plan participant will receive a $600 credit. B. Excess Insurance If at the time of injury, illness, disease, or disability there is available, or potentially available, any coverage (including, but not limited to, coverage resulting from a judgment at law or settlements), the benefits under this Plan shall apply only as an excess over such other sources of coverage. The Plan's benefits will be excess to, whenever possible: 1. any primary payer besides the Plan 2. any first-party insurance through medical payment coverage, personal injury protection, no-fault auto insurance coverage, uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage 3. any policy of insurance from any insurance company or guarantor of a third party 4. workers' compensation or other liability insurance company 5. any other source, including, but not limited to, crime victim restitution funds, medical, disability, school insurance coverage, or other benefit payment C. Allowable Charge For a charge to be allowable it must be within the Plan's maximum amount and at least part of it must be covered under this Plan. In the case of HMO (health maintenance organization) or other network only plans, this Plan will not consider any charges in excess of what an HMO or network provider has agreed to accept as payment in full. Also, when an HMO or network plan is primary and the plan participant does not use an HMO or network provider, this Plan will not consider as an allowable charge any charge that would have been covered by the HMO or network plan had the plan participant used the services of an HMO or network provider. In the case of service type plans where services are provided as benefits, the reasonable cash value of each service will be the allowable charge . PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 77 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters72 D. General Limitations When medical payments are available under any other insurance source, the Plan shall always be considered the secondary carrier. E. Application to Benefit Determinations The Plan shall be secondary in coverage to any medical payments provision, no-fault automobile insurance policy, or personal injury protection policy regardless of any election made by anyone to the contrary. The Plan shall also be secondary to any excess insurance policy, including, but not limited to, school and/or athletic policies. This provision applies notwithstanding any coordination of benefits term to the contrary. F. Benefit Plan Payment Order When two (2) or more plans provide benefits for the same allowable charge , benefit payment will adhere to these rules in the following order: 1. Plans that do not have a coordination provision, or one like this, will pay first. Plans with such a provision will be considered after those without one. 2. Plans with a coordination provision will pay their benefits up to the allowable charge : a. The benefits of the plan which covers the person directly (that is, as an employee , member, or subscriber) are determined before those of the plan which covers the person as a dependent . b. The benefits of a benefit plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired are determined before those of a benefit plan which covers that person as a laid-off or retired employee . The benefits of a benefit plan which covers a person as a dependent of an employee who is neither laid off nor retired are determined before those of a benefit plan which covers a person as a dependent of a laid off or retired employee . If the other benefit plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. c. The benefits of a benefit plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired or a dependent of an employee who is neither laid off nor retired are determined before those of a plan which covers the person as a COBRA beneficiary. d. When a child is covered as a dependent and the parents are not separated or divorced, these rules will apply: i. The benefits of the benefit plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the benefit plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year. ii. If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the benefit plan which has covered the patient for the longer time are determined before those of the benefit plan which covers the other parent. e. When a child's parents are divorced or legally separated, these rules will apply: i. This rule applies when the parent with custody of the child has not remarried. The benefit plan of the parent with custody will be considered before the benefit plan of the parent without custody. ii. This rule applies when the parent with custody of the child has remarried. The benefit plan of the parent with custody will be considered first. The benefit plan of the stepparent that covers the child as a dependent will be considered next. The benefit plan of the parent without custody will be considered last. iii. This rule will be in place of items (i.) and (ii.) immediately above when it applies. A court decree may state which parent is financially responsible for medical and dental benefits of the child. In this case, the benefit plan of that parent will be considered before other plans that cover the child as a dependent . iv. If the specific terms of the court decree state that the parents shall share joint custody, without stating that one (1) of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering the child shall follow the order of benefit determination rulesPSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 78 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters73 outlined above when a child is covered as a dependent and the parents are not separated or divorced. v. For parents who were never married to each other, the rules apply as set out above, as long as paternity has been established. f. If there is still a conflict after these rules have been applied, the benefit plan which has covered the patient for the longer time will be considered first. When there is a conflict in coordination of benefit rules, the Plan will never pay more than 50% of allowable charges when paying secondary. g. When a married dependent child is covered as a dependent on both a spouse's plan and a parent's plan, and the policies are both effective on the same day, the benefits of the policy holder whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the policy holder whose birthday falls later in that year. 3.Medicare will pay primary, secondary, or last to the extent stated in federal law. Refer to the Medicare publication Your Guide to Who Pays First at https://www.medicare.gov/supplements-other-insurance/how- medicare-works-with-other-insurance/which-insurance-pays-first . When Medicare would be the primary payer if the person had enrolled in Medicare , this Plan will base its payment upon benefits that would have been paid by Medicare under Parts A and B, regardless of whether or not the person was enrolled under any of these parts. The Plan reserves the right to coordinate benefits with respect to Medicare Part D. The Plan Administrator will make this determination based on the information available through Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). If CMS does not provide sufficient information to determine the amount Medicare would pay, the Plan Administrator will make reasonable assumptions based on published Medicare fee schedules. 4. If a plan participant is under a disability extension from a previous benefit plan, that benefit plan will pay first, and this Plan will pay second. 5. When an adult dependent is covered by their spouse's plan and is also covered by a parent's plan, the benefits of the benefit plan which has covered the patient for the longest time are determined before those of the other plan. 6. When an adult dependent is covered by multiple parents' plans, the benefits of the benefit plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the year are determined before those of the benefit plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year. Should both/all parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the benefit plan which has covered the patient the longest shall be determined first. 7. The Plan will pay primary to Tricare and a state Children's Health Insurance Plan to the extent required by federal law. G. Coordination with Government Programs 1.Medicaid/IHS. If a plan participant is covered by both this Plan and Medicaid or Indian Health Services (IHS), this Plan pays first and Medicaid or IHS pays second. 2.Veterans Affairs or Military Medical Facility Services. If a plan participant receives services in a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital or Military Medical Facility on account of a military-service-related illness or injury, benefits are not covered by this Plan. If a plan participant receives services in a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital or Military Medical Facility on account of any other condition that is not a military-service-related illness or injury, benefits are covered by the Plan to the extent those services are medically necessary and the charges are within this Plan's maximum allowable charge . 3.Other Coverage Provided by State or Federal Law. If you are covered by both this Plan and any other coverage (not already mentioned above) that is provided by any other state or federal law, the coverage provided by any other state or federal law pays first and this Plan pays second, unless applicable law dictates otherwise. H. Claims Determination Period Benefits will be coordinated on a calendar year basis. This is called the claims determination period. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 79 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters74 I. Right to Receive or Release Necessary Information For the purpose of determining the applicability of and implementing the terms of this provision or any provision of similar purpose of any other plan , this Plan may, without the consent of or notice to any person, release to or obtain from any insurance company, or other organization or individual, any information with respect to any person, which the Plan deems to be necessary for such purposes. Any person claiming benefits under this Plan shall furnish to the Plan such information as may be necessary to implement this provision. J. Facility of Payment Whenever payments which should have been made under this Plan in accordance with this provision have been made under any other plans , the Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion, pay any organizations making such other payments any amounts it shall determine to be warranted in order to satisfy the intent of this provision, and amounts so paid shall be deemed to be benefits paid under this Plan and, to the extent of such payments, this Plan shall be fully discharged from liability. This Plan may repay other plans for benefits paid that the Plan Administrator determines it should have paid. That repayment will count as a valid payment under this Plan. K. Right of Recovery In accordance with the Claims and Appeals section, Recovery of Payments subsection, whenever payments have been made by this Plan with respect to allowable charges in a total amount, at any time, in excess of the maximum amount of payment necessary at that time to satisfy the intent of this article, the Plan shall have the right to recover such payments, to the extent of such excess, from any one (1) or more of the following as this Plan shall determine: any person to or with respect to whom such payments were made, or such person's legal representative, any insurance companies, or any other individuals or organizations which the Plan determines are responsible for payment of such allowable charges , and any future benefits payable to the plan participant or their dependents . Please see the Recovery of Payments subsection for more details. L. Exception to Medicaid In accordance with ERISA, the Plan shall not take into consideration the fact that an individual is eligible for or is provided medical assistance through Medicaid when enrolling an individual in the Plan or making a determination about the payments for benefits received by a plan participant under the Plan. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 80 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters75 SECTION XIII\u2014MEDICARE A. Application to Active Employees and Their Spouses An active employee and their spouse (when eligible for Medicare ) may, at the option of such employee , elect or reject coverage under this Plan. If such employee elects coverage under this Plan, the benefits of this Plan shall be determined before any benefits provided by Medicare . If coverage under this Plan is rejected by such employee , benefits listed herein will not be payable even as secondary coverage to Medicare . B. Applicable to All Other Participants Eligible for Medicare Benefits To the extent required by federal regulations, this Plan will pay before any Medicare benefits. There are some circumstances under which Medicare would be required to pay its benefits first. In these cases, benefits under this Plan would be calculated as the secondary payer (as described under the section entitled Coordination of Benefits ). The plan participant will be assumed to have full Medicare coverage (that is, both Parts A & B) whether or not the plan participant has enrolled for the full coverage. If the provider accepts assignment with Medicare , covered charges will not exceed the Medicare approved expenses. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 81 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters76 SECTION XIV\u2014SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT PROVISIONS These Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions apply when the Plan pays benefits as a result of injuries or illnesses the plan participant sustained, and the plan participant has a right to a recovery or have received a recovery from any source. A.Definitions As used in these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions , 'plan participant' includes anyone on whose behalf the Plan pays benefits. These Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions apply to all current or former plan participants and Plan beneficiaries. The provisions also apply to the parents, guardian, or other representative of a dependent child who incurs claims and is or has been covered by the Plan. The Plan's rights under these provisions shall also apply to the personal representative or administrator of the plan participant's estate, the plan participant's heirs or beneficiaries, minors, and legally incompetent or disabled persons. If the covered person is a minor, any amount recovered by the minor, the minor's trustee, guardian, parent, or other representative shall be subject to these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions . Likewise, if the covered person's relatives, heirs, and/or assignees make any recovery because of injuries sustained by the covered person, or because of the death of the covered person, that recovery shall be subject to this provision, regardless of how any recovery is allocated or characterized. As used in these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions , 'recovery' includes, but is not limited to, monies received from any person or party; any person's or party's liability insurance coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, personal umbrella coverage, workers' compensation insurance or fund, premises medical payments coverage, restitution, or \"no-fault\" or personal injury protection insurance and/or automobile medical payments coverage; or any other first- or third-party insurance coverage, whether by lawsuit, settlement, or otherwise. Regardless of how the plan participant or the plan participant's representative or any agreements allocate or characterize the money the plan participant receives as a recovery, it shall be subject to these provisions. B.Subrogation Immediately upon paying or providing any benefit under the Plan, the Plan shall be subrogated to, or stand in the place of, all of the plan participant's rights of recovery with respect to any claim or potential claim against any party, due to an injury, illness, or condition to the full extent of benefits provided or to be provided by the Plan. The Plan has the right to recover payments it makes on the plan participant's behalf from any party or insurer responsible for compensating the plan participant for the plan participant's illnesses or injuries. The Plan has the right to take whatever legal action it sees fit against any person, party, or entity to recover the benefits paid under the Plan. The Plan may assert a claim or file suit in the plan participant's name and take appropriate action to assert its subrogation claim, with or without the plan participant's consent. The Plan is not required to pay the plan participant part of any recovery it may obtain, even if it files suit in the plan participant's name. C.Reimbursement If the plan participant receives any payment as a result of an injury, illness, or condition, the plan participant agrees to reimburse the Plan first from such payment for all amounts the Plan has paid and will pay as a result of that injury, illness, or condition, up to and including the full amount of the plan participant's recovery. If the plan participant obtains a recovery and the Plan has not been repaid for the benefits the Plan paid on the plan participant's behalf, the Plan shall have a right to be repaid from the recovery in the amount of the benefits paid on the plan participant's behalf. The plan participant must promptly reimburse the Plan from any recovery to the extent of benefits the Plan paid on the plan participant's behalf regardless of whether the payments the plan participant receives makes the plan participant whole for the plan participant's losses, illnesses, and/or injuries. D. Secondary to Other Coverage The Plan shall be secondary in coverage to any medical payments provision, no-fault automobile insurance policy, or personal injury protection policy regardless of any election made by the plan participant to the contrary. The Plan shall also be secondary to any excess insurance policy, including, but not limited to, school and/or athletic policies. This provision applies notwithstanding any coordination of benefits term to the contrary. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 82 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters77 E.Assignment In order to secure the Plan's rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions , The plan participant agrees to assign to the Plan any benefits or claims or rights of recovery the plan participant has under any automobile policy or other coverage, to the full extent of the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement claims. This assignment allows the Plan to pursue any claim the plan participant may have regardless of whether the plan participant chooses to pursue the claim. F. Applicability to All Settlements and Judgments Notwithstanding any allocation or designation of the plan participant's recovery made in any settlement agreement, judgment, verdict, release, or court order, the Plan shall have a right of full recovery, in first priority, against any recovery the plan participant makes. Furthermore, the Plan's rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions will not be reduced due to the plan participant's own negligence. The terms of these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions shall apply and the Plan is entitled to full recovery regardless of whether any liability for payment is admitted and regardless of whether the terms of any settlement, judgment, or verdict pertaining to the plan participant's recovery identify the medical benefits the Plan provided or purport to allocate any portion of such recovery to payment of expenses other than medical expenses. The Plan is entitled to recover from any recovery, even those designated as being for pain and suffering, non-economic damages, and/or general damages only. G.Constructive Trust By accepting benefits from the Plan, the plan participant agrees that if the plan participant receives any payment as a result of an injury, illness, or condition, the plan participant will serve as a constructive trustee over those funds. The plan participant and the plan participant's legal representative must hold in trust for the Plan the full amount of the recovery to be paid to the Plan immediately upon receipt. Failure to hold such funds in trust will be deemed a breach of the plan participant's fiduciary duty to the Plan. Any recovery the plan participant obtains must not be dissipated or disbursed until such time as the Plan has been repaid in accordance with these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions . H.Lien Rights The Plan will automatically have a lien to the extent of benefits paid by the Plan for the treatment of the plan participant's illness, injury, or condition upon any recovery related to treatment for any illness, injury, or condition for which the Plan paid benefits. The lien may be enforced against any party who possesses funds or proceeds from the plan participant's recovery including, but not limited to, the plan participant , the plan participant's representative or agent, and/or any other source possessing funds from the plan participant's recovery. The plan participant and the plan participant's legal representative acknowledge that the portion of the recovery to which the Plan's equitable lien applies is a Plan asset. The Plan shall be entitled to equitable relief, including without limitation restitution, the imposition of a constructive trust or an injunction, to the extent necessary to enforce the Plan's lien and/or to obtain (or preclude the transfer, dissipation, or disbursement of) such portion of any recovery in which the Plan may have a right or interest. I.First-Priority Claim By accepting benefits from the Plan, the plan participant acknowledges the Plan's rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions are a first-priority claim and are to be repaid to the Plan before the plan participant receives any recovery for the plan participant's damages. The Plan shall be entitled to full reimbursement on a first- dollar basis from any recovery, even if such payment to the Plan will result in a recovery which is insufficient to make the plan participant whole or to compensate the plan participant in part or in whole for the losses, injuries, or illnesses the plan participant sustained. The \"made-whole\" rule does not apply. To the extent that the total assets from which a recovery is available are insufficient to satisfy in full the Plan's subrogation claim and any claim held by the plan participant , the Plan's subrogation claim shall be first satisfied before any part of a recovery is applied to the plan participant's claim, the plan participant's attorney fees, other expenses or costs. The Plan is not responsible for any attorney fees, attorney liens, other expenses, or costs the plan participant incurs. The common fund doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney the plan participant hires regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by the Plan . PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 83 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters78 J.Cooperation The plan participant agrees to cooperate fully with the Plan's efforts to recover benefits paid. The duty to cooperate includes, but is not limited, to the following: 1. The plan participant must promptly notify the Plan of how, when, and where an accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to the plan participant occurred, all information regarding the parties involved, and any other information requested by the Plan. 2. The plan participant must notify the Plan within thirty (30) days of the date when any notice is given to any party, including an insurance company or attorney, of the plan participant's intention to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to the plan participant's injury, illness, or condition. 3. The plan participant must cooperate with the Plan in the investigation, settlement, and protection of the Plan's rights. In the event that the plan participant or the plan participant's legal representative fails to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise its subrogation or reimbursement rights, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the Plan paid from any future benefits under the Plan. 4. The plan participant and the plan participant's agents shall provide all information requested by the Plan, the Claims Administrator, or its representative, including, but not limited to, completing and submitting any applications or other forms or statements as the Plan may reasonably request and all documents related to or filed in personal injury litigation. 5. The plan participant recognizes that to the extent that the Plan paid or will pay benefits under a capitated agreement, the value of those benefits for purposes of these provisions will be the reasonable value of those payments or the actual paid amount, whichever is higher. 6. The plan participant must not do anything to prejudice the Plan's rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions . This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the Plan. 7. The plan participant must send the Plan copies of all police reports, notices, or other papers received in connection with the accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to the plan participant . 8. The plan participant must promptly notify the Plan if the plan participant retains an attorney or if a lawsuit is filed on the plan participant's behalf. 9. The plan participant must immediately notify the Plan if a trial is commenced, if a settlement occurs, or if potentially dispositive motions are filed in a case. In the event that the plan participant or the plan participant's legal representative fails to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise its rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions , the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the Plan paid from any future benefits under the Plan. If the plan participant fails to repay the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct any of the unsatisfied portion of the amount of benefits the Plan has paid or the amount of the plan participant's recovery, whichever is less, from any future benefit under the Plan if either of the following apply: 1. The amount the Plan paid on the plan participant's behalf is not repaid or otherwise recovered by the Plan. 2. The plan participant fails to cooperate. In the event the plan participant fails to disclose the amount of the plan participant's settlement to the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount of the Plan's lien from any future benefit under the Plan. The Plan shall also be entitled to recover any of the unsatisfied portion of the amount the Plan has paid or the amount of the plan participant's recovery, whichever is less, directly from the providers to whom the Plan has made payments on the plan participant's behalf. In such a circumstance, it may then be the plan participant's obligation to pay the provider the full billed amount, and the Plan will not have any obligation to pay the provider or reimburse the plan participant . The plan participant acknowledges the Plan has the right to conduct an investigation regarding the injury, illness, or condition to identify potential sources of recovery. The Plan reserves the right to notify all parties and their agents of its lien. Agents include, but are not limited to, insurance companies and attorneys. The plan participant acknowledges the Plan has notified the plan participant that it has the right pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\"), 42 U.S.C. Section 1301 et seq, to share the plan participant's personal health information in exercising these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions . The Plan is entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs incurred in enforcing its rights under these Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions . PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 84 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters79 K.Discretion The Plan Administrator has sole discretion to interpret the terms of the Subrogation and Reimbursement Provisions of this Plan in its entirety and reserves the right to make changes as it deems necessary. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 85 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters80 SECTION XV\u2014CONTINUATION COVERAGE RIGHTS UNDER COBRA Under federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), as Amended, certain employees and their families covered under the Kentucky Rural Electric Cooperative Employers Benefit Plan ( Plan) will be entitled to the opportunity to elect a temporary extension of health coverage (called COBRA continuation coverage) where coverage under the Plan would otherwise end. This notice is intended to inform plan participants and beneficiaries, in summary fashion, of their rights and obligations under the continuation coverage provisions of COBRA, as amended and reflected in final and proposed regulations published by the Department of the Treasury. This notice is intended to reflect the law and does not grant or take away any rights under the law. Refer to the Quick Reference Information Chart for the COBRA Administrator's contact information. Complete instructions on COBRA, as well as election forms and other information, will be provided by the Plan Administrator or its designee to plan participants who become qualified beneficiaries under COBRA. There may be other options available when you lose group health coverage. For example, you may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, you may qualify for a thirty (30) day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse's plan), even if that plan generally doesn't accept late enrollees . A. COBRA Continuation Coverage COBRA continuation coverage is the temporary extension of group health plan coverage that must be offered to certain plan participants and their eligible family members (called qualified beneficiaries) at group rates. The right to COBRA continuation coverage is triggered by the occurrence of a life event that results in the loss of coverage under the terms of the Plan (the qualifying event). The coverage must be identical to the Plan coverage that the qualified beneficiary had immediately before the qualifying event, or if the coverage has been changed, the coverage must be identical to the coverage provided to similarly situated active employees who have not experienced a qualifying event (in other words, similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries). COBRA continuation coverage does not run concurrent with the coverage under the terms of the Plan. B. Qualified Beneficiary In general, a qualified beneficiary can be: 1. Any individual who, on the day before a qualifying event, is covered under a Plan by virtue of being on that day either a covered employee , the spouse of a covered employee , or a dependent child of a covered employee . If, however, an individual who otherwise qualifies as a qualified beneficiary is denied or not offered coverage under the Plan under circumstances in which the denial or failure to offer constitutes a violation of applicable law, then the individual will be considered to have had the Plan coverage and will be considered a qualified beneficiary if that individual experiences a qualifying event. 2. Any child who is born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage, and any individual who is covered by the Plan as an alternate recipient under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order . If, however, an individual who otherwise qualifies as a qualified beneficiary is denied or not offered coverage under the Plan under circumstances in which the denial or failure to offer constitutes a violation of applicable law, then the individual will be considered to have had the Plan coverage and will be considered a qualified beneficiary if that individual experiences a qualifying event. 3. A covered employee who retired on or before the date of substantial elimination of Plan coverage which is the result of a bankruptcy proceeding under Title 11 of the U.S. Code with respect to the employer , as is the spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent child of such a covered employee if, on the day before the bankruptcy qualifying event, the spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent child was a beneficiary under the Plan. The term 'covered employee ' includes any individual who is provided coverage under the Plan due to their performance of services for the employer sponsoring the Plan, self-employed individuals, independent contractor, or corporate director. However, this provision does not establish eligibility of these individuals. Eligibility for Plan coverage shall be determined in accordance with Plan's Eligibility, Effective Date, and Termination Provisions section. An individual is not a qualified beneficiary if the individual's status as a covered employee is attributable to a period in which the individual was a nonresident alien who received from the individual's employer no earned income that constituted income from sources within the United States. If, on account of the preceding reason, an individual is not a PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 86 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters81 qualified beneficiary, then a spouse or dependent child of the individual will also not be considered a qualified beneficiary by virtue of the relationship to the individual. Each qualified beneficiary (including a child who is born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage) must be offered the opportunity to make an independent election to receive COBRA continuation coverage. C. Qualifying Event The following are considered to be qualifying events if they would cause the plan participant to lose coverage (i.e., cease to be covered under the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately before the qualifying event) in the absence of COBRA continuation coverage: 1. the death of a covered employee 2. the termination (other than by reason of the employee's gross misconduct), or reduction of hours, of a covered employee's employment 3. the divorce or legal separation of a covered employee from the employee's spouse If the employee reduces or eliminates the employee's spouse's Plan coverage in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation, and a divorce or legal separation later occurs, then the divorce or legal separation may be considered a qualifying event even though the spouse's coverage was reduced or eliminated before the divorce or legal separation. 4. a covered employee's enrollment in any part of the Medicare program 5. a dependent child's ceasing to satisfy the Plan's requirements for a dependent child (for example, attainment of the maximum age for dependency under the Plan) 6. a proceeding in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the U.S. Code with respect to an employer from whose employment a covered employee retired at any time. If the qualifying event causes the covered employee , or the covered spouse or a dependent child of the covered employee , to cease to be covered under the Plan under the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately before the qualifying event [or in the case of the bankruptcy of the employer , any substantial elimination of coverage under the Plan occurring within twelve (12) months before or after the date the bankruptcy proceeding commences], the persons losing such coverage become qualified beneficiaries under COBRA if all the other conditions of the COBRA are also met. For example, any increase in contribution that must be paid by a covered employee , the spouse, or a dependent child of the covered employee , for coverage under the Plan that results from the occurrence of one (1) of the events listed above is a loss of coverage. The taking of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) does not constitute a qualifying event. A qualifying event will occur, however, if an employee does not return to employment at the end of the FMLA leave and all other COBRA continuation coverage conditions are present. If a qualifying event occurs, it occurs on the last day of FMLA leave, and the applicable maximum coverage period is measured from this date (unless coverage is lost at a later date and the Plan provides for the extension of the required periods, in which case the maximum coverage date is measured from the date when the coverage is lost). Note that the covered employee and family members will be entitled to COBRA continuation coverage even if they failed to pay the employee portion of premiums for coverage under the Plan during the FMLA leave . D. Notice of Unavailability of Continuation Coverage The Plan may sometimes deny a request for COBRA coverage, including an extension of coverage, when the Plan Administrator determines the plan participant is not entitled to receive it. When a Plan Administrator makes the decision to deny a request for COBRA coverage from a plan participant , the Plan must give the plan participant a notice of unavailability of COBRA coverage. The notice must be provided within fourteen (14) days after the request is received relating to a qualifying event, second qualifying event, or determination of disability by the Social Security Administration, and the notice must explain the reason for denying the request. E. Factors to Consider in Electing COBRA Continuation Coverage When considering options for health coverage, qualified beneficiaries should consider: PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 87 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters82 1.Premiums. This Plan can charge up to 102% of total plan premiums for COBRA coverage. Other options, like coverage on a spouse's plan or through the marketplace, may be less expensive. Qualified beneficiaries have special enrollment rights under federal law (HIPAA). They have the right to request special enrollment in another group health plan for which they are otherwise eligible (such as a plan sponsored by a spouse's employer ) within thirty (30) days after Plan coverage ends due to one (1) of the qualifying events listed above. 2.Provider Networks. If a qualified beneficiary is currently getting care or treatment for a condition, a change in health coverage may affect access to a particular health care provider. You may want to check to see if your current health care providers participate in a network in considering options for health coverage. 3.Drug Formularies. For qualified beneficiaries taking medication, a change in health coverage may affect costs for medication\u2014and in some cases, the medication may not be covered by another plan. Qualified beneficiaries should check to see if current medications are listed in drug formularies for other health coverage. 4.Severance Payments. If COBRA rights arise because the employee has lost their job and there is a severance package available from the employer , the former employer may have offered to pay some or all of the employee's COBRA payments for a period of time. This can affect the timing of coverage available in the marketplace. In this scenario, the employee may want to contact the Department of Labor at 1-866-444-3272 to discuss options. 5.Service Areas. If benefits under the Plan are limited to specific service or coverage areas, benefits may not be available to a qualified beneficiary who moves out of the area. 6.Other Cost-Sharing. In addition to premiums or contributions for health coverage, the Plan requires participants to pay co-payments , deductibles , co-insurance , or other amounts as benefits are used. Qualified beneficiaries should check to see what the cost-sharing requirements are for other health coverage options. For example, one option may have much lower monthly premiums, but a much higher deductible and higher co- payments . Other Coverage Options Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for qualified beneficiaries through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a special enrollment period. Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov . F. Procedure for Obtaining COBRA Continuation Coverage The Plan has conditioned the availability of COBRA continuation coverage upon the timely election of such coverage. An election is timely if it is made during the election period. G. The Election Period The election period is the timeframe within which the qualified beneficiary must elect COBRA continuation coverage under the Plan. The election period must begin no later than the date the qualified beneficiary would lose coverage on account of the qualifying event and ends sixty (60) days after the later of the date the qualified beneficiary would lose coverage on account of the qualifying event or the date notice is provided to the qualified beneficiary of their right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. If coverage is not elected within the sixty (60) day period, all rights to elect COBRA continuation coverage are forfeited. NOTE: If a covered employee who has been terminated or experienced a reduction of hours qualifies for a trade readjustment allowance or alternative trade adjustment assistance under a federal law called the Trade Act of 2002, as extended by the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, and the employee and their covered dependents have not elected COBRA coverage within the normal election period, a second opportunity to elect COBRA coverage will be made available for themselves and certain family members, but only within a limited period of sixty (60) days or less and only during the six (6) months immediately after their group health plan coverage ended. Any person who qualifies or thinks that they and/or their family members may qualify for assistance under this special provision should contact the Plan Administrator for further information about the special second election period. If continuation coverage is elected under this extension, it will not become effective prior to the beginning of this special second election period. Refer to the Quick Reference Information Chart for the Plan Administrator's contact information. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 88 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters83 H. Responsibility for Informing the Plan Administrator of the Occurrence of a Qualifying Event The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator or its designee has been timely notified that a qualifying event has occurred. The employer (if the employer is not the Plan Administrator ) will notify the Plan Administrator of the qualifying event within thirty (30) days following the date coverage ends when the qualifying event is any of the following: 1. the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment 2. death of the employee 3. commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer 4. enrollment of the employee in any part of Medicare IMPORTANT: For the other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you or someone on your behalf must notify the Plan Administrator or its designee in writing within sixty (60) days after the qualifying event occurs, using the procedures specified below. If these procedures are not followed, or if the notice is not provided in writing to the Plan Administrator or its designee during the sixty (60) day notice period, any spouse or dependent child who loses coverage will not be offered the option to elect continuation coverage. You must send this notice to the Plan Sponsor. Notice Procedures Any notice that you provide must be in writing. Oral notice, including notice by telephone, is not acceptable. You must mail, fax, or hand-deliver your notice to the person, department, or firm listed below, at the following address: Kentucky Rural Electric Cooperative 4775 Lexington Road Winchester, KY 40391 1-859-745-9672 If mailed, your notice must be postmarked no later than the last day of the required notice period. Any notice you provide must state all of the following: 1. the name of the plan or plans under which you lost or are losing coverage 2. the name and address of the employee covered under the Plan 3. the name(s) and address(es) of the qualified beneficiary(ies) 4. the qualifying event and the date it happened If the qualifying event is a divorce or legal separation , your notice must include a copy of the divorce decree or the legal separation agreement. Be aware that there are other notice requirements in other contexts, for example, in order to qualify for a disability extension. Once the Plan Administrator or its designee receives timely notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage for their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. For each qualified beneficiary who elects COBRA continuation coverage, COBRA continuation coverage will begin on the date that Plan coverage would otherwise have been lost. If you or your spouse or dependent children do not elect continuation coverage within the sixty (60) day election period described above, the right to elect continuation coverage will be lost. I. Waiver Before the End of the Election Period If, during the election period, a qualified beneficiary waives COBRA continuation coverage, the waiver can be revoked at any time before the end of the election period. Revocation of the waiver is an election of COBRA continuation coverage. However, if a waiver is later revoked, coverage need not be provided retroactively (that is, from the date of the loss of coverage until the waiver is revoked). Waivers and revocations of waivers are considered made on the date they are sent to the Plan Administrator or its designee, as applicable. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 89 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters84 J. If a Qualified Beneficiary Has Other Group Health Plan Coverage or Medicare Qualified beneficiaries who are entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage may do so even if they are covered under another group health plan or are entitled to Medicare benefits on or before the date on which COBRA is elected. However, a qualified beneficiary's COBRA coverage will terminate automatically if, after electing COBRA, they become entitled to Medicare or become covered under other group health plan coverage. K. When a Qualified Beneficiary's COBRA Continuation Coverage Can be Terminated During the election period, a qualified beneficiary may waive COBRA continuation coverage. Except for an interruption of coverage in connection with a waiver, COBRA continuation coverage that has been elected for a qualified beneficiary must extend for at least the period beginning on the date of the qualifying event and ending not before the earliest of the following dates: 1. the last day of the applicable maximum coverage period 2. the first day for which timely payment is not made to the Plan with respect to the qualified beneficiary 3. the date upon which the employer ceases to provide any group health plan (including a successor plan) to any employee 4. the date, after the date of the election, that the qualified beneficiary first becomes covered under any other plan 5. the date, after the date of the election, that the qualified beneficiary first enrolls in the Medicare program (either Part A or Part B, whichever occurs earlier) 6. in the case of a qualified beneficiary entitled to a disability extension, the later of: a. twenty-nine (29) months after the date of the qualifying event b. the first day of the month that is more than thirty (30) days after the date of a final determination under Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act that the disabled qualified beneficiary whose disability resulted in the qualified beneficiary's entitlement to the disability extension is no longer disabled, whichever is earlier c. the end of the maximum coverage period that applies to the qualified beneficiary without regard to the disability extension The Plan can terminate for cause the coverage of a qualified beneficiary on the same basis that the Plan terminates for cause the coverage of similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries, for example, for the submission of a fraudulent claim. In the case of an individual who is not a qualified beneficiary and who is receiving coverage under the Plan solely because of the individual's relationship to a qualified beneficiary, if the Plan's obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the qualified beneficiary ceases, the Plan is not obligated to make coverage available to the individual who is not a qualified beneficiary. When the Plan terminates COBRA coverage early for any of the reasons listed above, the Plan Administrator must give the qualified beneficiary a notice of early termination. The notice must be given as soon as practicable after the decision is made, and it must describe all of the following: 1. the date of termination of COBRA coverage 2. the reason for termination 3. any rights the qualified beneficiary may have under the plan or applicable law to elect alternative group or individual coverage, such as a right to convert to an individual policy L. Maximum Coverage Periods for COBRA Continuation Coverage The maximum coverage periods are based on the type of the qualifying event and the status of the qualified beneficiary, as shown below. 1. In the case of a qualifying event that is a termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment, the maximum coverage period ends either: a. eighteen (18) months after the qualifying event if there is not a disability extensionPSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 90 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters85 b. twenty-nine (29) months after the qualifying event if there is a disability extension 2. In the case of a covered employee's enrollment in the Medicare program before experiencing a qualifying event that is a termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment, the maximum coverage period for qualified beneficiaries other than the covered employee ends on the later of: a. thirty-six (36) months after the date the covered employee becomes enrolled in the Medicare program b. eighteen (18) months [or twenty-nine (29) months, if there is a disability extension] after the date of the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment 3. In the case of a qualified beneficiary who is a child born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage, the maximum coverage period is the maximum coverage period applicable to the qualifying event giving rise to the period of COBRA continuation coverage during which the child was born or placed for adoption. 4. In the case of any other qualifying event than that described above, the maximum coverage period ends thirty- six (36) months after the qualifying event. M. Circumstances in Which the Maximum Coverage Period Can Be Expanded If a qualifying event that gives rise to an eighteen (18) month or twenty-nine (29) month maximum coverage period is followed, within that eighteen (18) or twenty-nine (29) month period, by a second qualifying event that gives rise to a thirty-six (36) months maximum coverage period, the original period is expanded to thirty-six (36) months, but only for individuals who are qualified beneficiaries at the time of and with respect to both qualifying events. In no circumstance can the COBRA maximum coverage period be expanded to more than thirty-six (36) months after the date of the first qualifying event. The Plan Administrator must be notified of the second qualifying event within sixty (60) days of the second qualifying event. This notice must be sent to the Plan Sponsor in accordance with the procedures above. N. How a Qualified Beneficiary Becomes Entitled to a Disability Extension A disability extension will be granted if an individual (whether or not the covered employee ) who is a qualified beneficiary in connection with the qualifying event that is a termination or reduction of hours of a covered employee's employment, is determined under Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act to have been disabled at any time during the first sixty (60) days of COBRA continuation coverage. To qualify for the disability extension, the qualified beneficiary must also provide the Plan Administrator with notice of the disability determination on a date that is both within sixty (60) days of the date of the determination and before the end of the original eighteen (18) month maximum coverage. Said notice shall be provided to the Plan Administrator , in writing, and should be sent to the Plan Sponsor in accordance with the procedures above. O. Payment for COBRA Continuation Coverage For any period of COBRA continuation coverage under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. Qualified beneficiaries will pay up to 102% of the applicable premium and up to 150% of the applicable premium for any expanded period of COBRA continuation coverage covering a disabled qualified beneficiary due to a disability extension. The Plan will terminate a qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage as of the first day of any period for which timely payment is not made. The Plan must allow payment for COBRA continuation coverage to be made in monthly installments. The Plan is also permitted to allow for payment at other intervals. P. Timely Payment for COBRA Continuation Coverage Timely payment means a payment made no later than thirty (30) days after the first day of the coverage period. Payment that is made to the Plan by a later date is also considered timely payment if either under the terms of the Plan, covered employees or qualified beneficiaries are allowed until that later date to pay for their coverage for the period, or under the terms of an arrangement between the employer and the entity that provides Plan benefits on the employer's behalf, the employer is allowed until that later date to pay for coverage of similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries for the period. Notwithstanding the above paragraph, the Plan does not require payment for any period of COBRA continuation coverage for a qualified beneficiary earlier than forty-five (45) days after the date on which the election of COBRA PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 91 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters86 continuation coverage is made for that qualified beneficiary. Payment is considered made on the date on which it is postmarked to the Plan. If timely payment is made to the Plan in an amount that is not significantly less than the amount the Plan requires to be paid for a period of coverage, then the amount paid will be deemed to satisfy the Plan's requirement for the amount to be paid, unless the Plan notifies the qualified beneficiary of the amount of the deficiency and grants a reasonable period of time for payment of the deficiency to be made. A reasonable period of time is thirty (30) days after the notice is provided. A shortfall in a timely payment is not significant if it is no greater than the lesser of $50 or 10% of the required amount. Q. Right to Enroll in a Conversion Health Plan at the End of the Maximum Coverage Period for COBRA Continuation Coverage If a qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage under a group health plan ends as a result of the expiration of the applicable maximum coverage period, the Plan will, during the one hundred eighty (180) day period that ends on that expiration date, provide the qualified beneficiary with the option of enrolling under a conversion health plan if such an option is otherwise generally available to similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries under the Plan. R. If You Have Questions If you have questions about your COBRA continuation coverage, you should contact the Plan Sponsor . For more information about your rights under ERISA, including COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest regional or district office of the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA). Addresses and phone numbers of regional and district EBSA offices are available through EBSA's website at www.dol.gov/ebsa . S. Keep Your Plan Administrator Informed of Address Changes In order to protect your family's rights, you should keep the Plan Administrator informed of any changes in the addresses of family members. You should also keep a copy, for your records, of any notices you send to the Plan Administrator . T. If You Wish to Appeal In general, COBRA -related claims are not governed by ERISA and the related federal regulations. In an effort to provide all qualified beneficiaries with a fair and thorough review process for COBRA related claims, all determinations regarding COBRA eligibility and coverage will be made in accordance with the Continuation Coverage Rights Under COBRA section of this governing plan document. Accordingly, if a qualified beneficiary wishes to appeal a COBRA eligibility or coverage determination made by the Plan, such claims must be submitted consistent with the appeals procedure set forth in the Claims and Appeals section of this document. The Plan will respond to all complete appeals in accordance with the appeals procedure set forth in the Claims and Appeals section of this document. A qualified beneficiary who files an appeal with the Plan must exhaust the administrative remedies afforded by the Plan prior to pursuing civil action in federal court under COBRA. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 92 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters87 SECTION XVI\u2014FUNDING THE PLAN AND PAYMENT OF BENEFITS The cost of the Plan is funded as follows: A. For Employee and Dependent Coverage Funding is derived from the funds of the employer and contributions made by the covered employees . The level of any employee contributions will be set by the Plan Administrator . These employee contributions will be used in funding the cost of the Plan as soon as practicable after they have been received from the employee or withheld from the employee's pay through payroll deduction. Benefits are paid directly from the Plan through the Third Party Administrator . Payment for Coverage The specific amount you must pay for coverage is announced each calendar year . You pay your contributions for medical coverage on a before-tax basis. This means that your payments for these coverages come from your pay before federal, and in most cases, state taxes are withheld. That way, you should pay less in taxes. The amount and frequency of that contribution is determined by Kentucky Rural Electric Cooperative (within permissible government guidelines) and announced on an annual basis. B. Clerical Error Any clerical error by the Plan Administrator or an agent of the Plan Administrator in keeping pertinent records, or a delay in making any changes, will not invalidate coverage otherwise validly in force or continue coverage validly terminated. An equitable adjustment of contributions will be made when the error or delay is discovered. If an overpayment occurs in a Plan reimbursement amount, the Plan retains a contractual right to the overpayment. The person or institution receiving the overpayment will be required to return the amount paid in error. In the case of a plan participant , the amount of overpayment may be deducted from future benefits payable. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 93 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters88 SECTION XVII\u2014CERTAIN PLAN PARTICIPANTS' RIGHTS UNDER ERISA A. Introduction Plan participants in this Plan are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA specifies that all plan participants shall be entitled to: 1. examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office, all plan documents and copies of all documents governing the Plan, including a copy of the latest annual report (form 5500 series) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration 2. obtain copies of all plan documents and other Plan information upon written request to the Plan Administrator The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. 3. continue health care coverage for a plan participant , spouse, or other dependents if there is a loss of coverage under the Plan as a result of a qualifying event Employees or dependents may have to pay for such coverage. 4. review this summary plan description and the documents governing the Plan or the rules governing COBRA continuation coverage rights B. Enforce Your Rights If a plan participant's claim for a benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, the plan participant has a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps a plan participant can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if a plan participant requests a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and does not receive them within thirty (30) days, the plan participant may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and to pay the plan participant up to $110 a day until they receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator . If the plan participant has a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, the plan participant may file suit in state or federal court. In addition, if a plan participant disagrees with the Plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a medical child support order , the plan participant may file suit in federal court. C. Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan participants , ERISA imposes obligations upon the individuals who are responsible for the operation of the Plan. The individuals who operate the Plan, called fiduciaries of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of the plan participants and their beneficiaries. No one, including the employer or any other person, may fire a plan participant or otherwise discriminate against a plan participant in any way to prevent the plan participant from obtaining benefits under the Plan or from exercising their rights under ERISA. If it should happen that the Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if a plan participant is discriminated against for asserting their rights, they may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If the plan participant is successful, the court may order the person sued to pay these costs and fees. If the plan participant loses, the court may order the plan participant to pay these costs and fees (for example, if it finds the claim or suit to be frivolous). D. Assistance with Your Questions If the plan participant has any questions about the Plan, they should contact the Plan Administrator as outlined in the Quick Reference Information Chart. If the plan participant has any questions about this statement or their rights under ERISA, including COBRA or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other laws affecting group health plans, that plan participant should contact either the nearest regional or district office of the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/ebsa . Addresses and phone numbers of regional and district EBSA offices are available through EBSA's website.

Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) An employee or dependent who is eligible, but not enrolled in this Plan, may enroll if: 1. The employee or dependent is covered under a Medicaid plan under Title XIX of the Social Security Act or a state children's health insurance program (CHIP) under Title XXI of such Act, and coverage of the employee or dependent is terminated due to loss of eligibility for such coverage, and the employee or dependent requests enrollment in this Plan within sixty (60) days after such Medicaid or CHIP coverage is terminated. 2. The employee or dependent becomes eligible for assistance with payment of employee contributions to this Plan through a Medicaid or CHIP plan (including any waiver or demonstration project conducted with respect to such plan), and the employee or dependent requests enrollment in this Plan within sixty (60) days after the date the employee or dependent is determined to be eligible for such assistance. If a dependent becomes eligible to enroll under this provision and the employee is not then enrolled, the employee must enroll in order for the dependent to enroll. B. Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) GINA generally prohibits discrimination in group premiums based on genetic information and the use of genetic information as a basis for determining eligibility or setting premiums, and places limitations on genetic testing and the collection of genetic information in group health plan coverage. GINA provides clarification with respect to the treatment of genetic information under privacy regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). C. Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 Regardless of any limitations on benefits for mental disorders/substance use disorder treatment otherwise specified in the Plan, any aggregate lifetime limit, annual limit, financial requirement, non-network exclusion, or treatment limitation on mental disorders/substance use disorder benefits imposed by the Plan shall comply with federal parity requirements, if applicable. D. Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996 (NMHPA) Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage generally may not do any of the following: 1. restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than forty-eight (48) hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than ninety-six (96) hours following a delivery by cesarean section 2. set the level of benefits or out-of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the forty-eight (48) or ninety-six (96) hours, as applicable, stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay 3. require that a physician or other health care provider obtain authorization for prescribing a length of stay of up to forty-eight (48) or ninety-six (96) hours, as applicable However, the plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay than forty-eight (48) hours following a vaginal delivery, or ninety-six (96) hours following a delivery by cesarean section if the attending provider (e.g., your physician , nurse midwife, or physician assistant), discharges the mother or newborn after consultation with the mother. E. Non-Discrimination Policy This Plan will not discriminate against any plan participant based on race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or age. This Plan will not establish rules for eligibility based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, evidence of insurability, genetic information , or disability. This Plan intends to be nondiscriminatory and to meet the requirements under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If the Plan Administrator determines before or during any plan year that this Plan may fail to PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 95 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters90 satisfy any non-discrimination requirement imposed by the Code or any limitation on benefits provided to highly compensated individuals, the Plan Administrator shall take such action as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate, under rules uniformly applicable to similarly situated covered employees , to assure compliance with such requirements or limitation. F. Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) Employees going into or returning from military service may elect to continue Plan coverage as mandated by the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) under the following circumstances. These rights apply only to employees and their dependents covered under the Plan immediately before leaving for military service. 1. The maximum period of coverage of a person and the person's dependents under such an election shall be the lesser of: a. the twenty-four (24) month period beginning on the date on which the person's absence begins b. the day after the date on which the person was required to apply for or return to a position of employment and fails to do so 2. A person who elects to continue health plan coverage must pay up to 102% of the full contribution under the Plan, except a person on active duty for thirty (30) days or less cannot be required to pay more than the employee's share, if any, for the coverage. 3. An exclusion or waiting period may not be imposed in connection with the reinstatement of coverage upon re- employment if one would not have been imposed had coverage not been terminated because of service. However, an exclusion or waiting period may be imposed for coverage of any illness or injury determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of uniformed service . If the employee wishes to elect this coverage or obtain more detailed information, contact the Plan Administrator as outlined in the Quick Reference Information Chart. The employee may also have continuation rights under USERRA. In general, the employee must meet the same requirements for electing USERRA coverage as are required under COBRA continuation coverage requirements. Coverage elected under these circumstances is concurrent, not cumulative. The employee may elect USERRA continuation coverage for the employee and their dependents . Only the employee has election rights. Dependents do not have any independent right to elect USERRA health plan continuation. G. Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA) The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA) requires that you be informed of your rights to surgery and prostheses following a covered mastectomy . The Plan will pay charges incurred for a plan participant who is receiving benefits in connection with a mastectomy and then elects breast reconstruction in connection with the mastectomy. Coverage will include: 1. reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed 2.surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance 3. prosthesis and treatment of physical complications of all stages of mastectomy , including lymphedemasPSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 96 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters91 SECTION XIX\u2014COMPLIANCE WITH HIPAA PRIVACY STANDARDS A.

Adoptive Cell Therapy A type of immunotherapy in which T cells (a type of immune cell) are given to a patient to help the body fight diseases, such as cancer. In cancer therapy, T cells are usually taken from the patient's own blood or tumor tissue, grown in large numbers in the laboratory, and then given back to the patient to help the immune system fight the cancer. Sometimes, the T cells are changed in the laboratory to make them better able to target the patient's cancer cells and kill them.

Whether a claim is an urgent care claim will be determined by an individual acting on behalf of the Plan applying the judgment of a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine. However, any claim that a physician with knowledge of the claimant's medical condition determines is an urgent care claim as described herein shall be treated as an urgent care claim under the Plan. Urgent care claims are a subset of pre-service claims . PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 117 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters112 Urgent Care Facility A free-standing facility, regardless of its name, at which a physician is in attendance at all times that the facility is open, that is engaged primarily in providing minor emergency and episodic medical care to a plan participant . Usual and Customary Charge Covered charges which are identified by the Plan Administrator , taking into consideration the fees which the provider most frequently charges (or accepts) for the majority of patients for the service or supply, the cost to the provider for providing the services, the prevailing range of fees charged in the same area by providers of similar training and experience for the service or supply, and the Medicare reimbursement rates. The term(s) 'same geographic locale' and/or 'area' shall be defined as a metropolitan area, county, or such greater area as is necessary to obtain a representative cross-section of providers, persons, or organizations rendering such treatment, services, or supplies for which a specific charge is made. To be usual and customary, fees must be in compliance with generally accepted billing practices for unbundling or multiple procedures. The term 'usual' refers to the amount of a charge made or accepted for medical services, care, or supplies, to the extent that the charge does not exceed the common level of charges made by other medical professionals with similar credentials, or health care facilities, pharmacies , or equipment suppliers of similar standing, which are located in the same geographic locale in which the charge was incurred . The term 'customary' refers to the form and substance of a service, supply, or treatment provided in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice to one (1) individual, which is appropriate for the care or treatment of an individual of the same sex, comparable age, and who has received such services or supplies within the same geographic locale. The term 'usual and customary' does not necessarily mean the actual charge made (or accepted), nor the specific service or supply furnished to a plan participant by a provider of services or supplies, such as a physician , therapist, nurse, hospital, or pharmacist. The Plan Administrator will determine the usual charge for any procedure, service, or supply, and whether a specific procedure, service, or supply is customary. Usual and customary charges may, at the Plan Administrator's discretion, alternatively be determined and established by the Plan using normative data such as, but not limited to, Medicare cost to charge ratios, average wholesale price (AWP) for prescriptions, and/or manufacturer's retail pricing (MRP) for supplies and devices. Waiting Period An interval of time during which the employee is in the continuous, active employment of their participating employer .

Network Non-Network Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the policy, the overall family deductible must be met before the plan begins to pay. Per participant: $1,500 $3,000 Per family: $3,000 $6,000 Are there services covered before you meet your deductible? Yes, for preventive care services when performed in network. This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met the deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/. Are there other deductibles for specific services? No. You don't have to meet deductibles for specific services. What is the out-of-pocket limit for this plan? Co-Insurance Out-of-Pocket Maximum The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of- pocket limits until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met. Network Non-Network Unlimited Per family: $7,000 Unlimited What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit? Premiums, balance-billed charges, health care this Plan doesn't cover, charges in excess of benefit maximums, charges in excess of maximum allowed amounts, pre -certification penalties, and Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out-of-pocket limit.

Only individuals who meet the eligibility requirements of the plan are eligible to maintain coverage . Providing incomplete, inaccurate, or untimely information may void, reduce, or increase premium, or terminate an individual's coverage or the plan coverage . The Plan Sponsor can subsidize different premium amounts for different classes of enrollees in a plan provided: 1) such classes are reasonable and based on objective business criteria, such as years of service, date of retirement, business location, job category, and nature of compensation (e.g., salaried vs. hourly), 2) the premium cannot vary for individuals within a given class of enrollees, and 3) the Plan Sponsor must pass through any direct subsidy payments received from CMS to reduce the amount that the beneficiary pays (or in those instances where the subscriber to or participant in the plan pays premiums on behalf of a Medicare eligible spouse or dependent, the amount the subscriber or participant pays). With regard to the Part D premium, different classes of enrollees cannot be based on eligibility for the Part D Low-Income Subsidy (LIS). If plan enrollees are entitled to a reduction of their premium as Part D LIS enrollees and Humana receives a Low-Income Premium Subsidy for such enrollees, Humana will pass the Low-Income Premium Subsidy amount through to the LIS enrollees to reduce their premiums. With regard to the Part D premium, the Plan Sponsor cannot charge an enrollee for prescription drug coverage provided under the PDP/MAPD plan more than the sum of his or her monthly beneficiary premium attributable to basic prescription drug coverage and 100% of the monthly beneficiary premium attributable to his or her non-Medicare Part D benefits (if any).

Coordination of Benefits Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") applies to This Plan when an Eligible Person has dental benefits under more than one plan. The objective of COB is to make sure the combined payments of the plans are no more than your actual dental bills. COB rules establish whether This Plan's Benefits are determined before or after another plan's benefits. You must submit all your claims to each plan. The primary plan must pay its full benefits as if you had no other coverage. If the primary plan denies your claim or does not pay the full claim, the secondary plan will then calculate any additional payment under these rules. Which Plan is Primary? This Plan is a Secondary Plan unless: the other plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of This Plan; and, both those rules and This Plan's rules make This Plan the Primary Plan. The primary plan is determined by the first of the following rules that applies: 1.Dependent or Non-dependent. PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 150 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters14 2013-003-DD The plan that covers the Eligible Person as other than a Dependent is always primary. 2.Children (parents who are not divorced or separated) and the Birthday Rule. The Plan of the parent with the first birthday in a calendar year is always primary for Children. If your birthday is in January and your spouse's birthday is in March, your plan will be primary for all of your Children. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that covers the Children for the longer period will be primary. 3.Children (Parents Divorced or Separated) . If a court decree makes one parent responsible for health care expenses, that parent's plan is primary. If a court decree states that the parents will share custody without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the Child's health care expenses, Delta Dental follows the birthday rule (see #2 above). If neither of these rules applies, the order will be determined as follows: First, the plan of the parent with custody of the Child. Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the Child. Next, the plan of the parent without custody of the Child; and, Last, the plan of the spouse of the parent without custody of the Child. If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of Benefits, this rule is ignored. 4.Active or Inactive Employee. The plan of the employee who is not laid off nor retired is Primary. 5.COBRA Continuation of Coverage. The plan of the Eligible Person that is not provided under a right of continuation pursuant to federal law (that is COBRA) or a similar state law is primary.6.Length of Coverage. The plan that has covered the Eligible Person for the longer time is primary. 7.None of the Above Applies. If none of the rules above determines the order of Benefits, the allowable expense will be shared equally between plans. How Delta Dental Pays as Primary Plan When This Plan is Primary, it will pay Benefits under This Plan as if you had no other coverage. How Delta Dental Pays a s Secondary Plan When This Plan is secondary, any difference between the amount we pay on a claim and the amount we would have paid if we had been Primary will be added to a Benefit Reserve under Kentucky law. At the end of a benefit year, we will reimburse the Covered Person for any non-reimbursed allowable expenses incurred during the previous year up to the total amount of your Benefit Reserve. At that time, your Benefit Reserve will be returned to zero and will start over for the next year. Examples of non-reimbursed expenses may include deductibles and copayments. Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Delta Dental needs certain facts to apply these COB rules, and it has the right to decide which facts it needs. We may get needed facts from, or give them to, any other organization or person. Delta Dental need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming Benefits under This Plan must give Delta Dental any facts it needs to pay the claim. Payment Made By Other Plans A payment made under another plan may include an amount that should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, Delta Dental may pay that amount to the organization that made the payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a Benefit paid under This Plan, and Delta Dental will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing Benefits in the form of PSC Request 1-25 Attachment Page 151 of 162 Witness: Patsy Walters15 2013-003-DD services, in which case \"payment made\" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. Right of Recovery If Delta Dental pays more than it should have paid under this COB provision, it may recover the excess from one or more of the following: The people it has paid or for whom it has paid; Insurance companies; or Other organizations. Payment includes the reasonable cash value of any Benefits provided in the form of services. 9.Claims Appeal Procedure If you receive notice of an Adverse Benefit Determination that you think is incorrect, you or your Dentist should contact us at (800)955-2030 or customerservice@deltadentalky.com .

PSC Request 1-48 Attachment Page 2 of 12 Witness: Patsy Walters July 20, 2022 Mr. Jeff Williams President & CEO Taylor County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation P.O. Box 100 625 West Main St. Campbellsville, KY 42718 Re: Engagement of Honaker Law Office, Mr. Williams : L. Allyson Honaker allyson@hloky.com (859)396-3172 VIA EMAIL I am pleased that you have asked Honaker Law Office, PLLC (the \"Firm\") to serve as your counsel. This letter will confirm my discussion with you regarding your engagement of the Firm and will describe the basis upon which the Firm will provide legal services to you. The engagement will be effective August 1, 2022. Accordingly, I submit for your approval the following provisions governing this engagement. If you are in agreement, please sign the enclosed copy of this letter in the space provided below. If you have any questions about these provisions, do not hesitate to call. Again, I am pleased to have the opportunity to serve you. Client: Scope of Reptesentation. The Firm's client in this matter will be Taylor County Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation (the \"Client\"). The Firm will be engaged to advise the Client in connection with matters arising before the Kentucky Public Service Commission (including a 2022 rate case), other general business matters and perform the general counsel duties for the Board of Directors. You may limit or expand the scope of the Firm's representation from time to time, provided that any substantial expansion must be agreed to by me. While I would be interested in assisting you in other matters, unless I am specifically engaged for some other future matter this will confirm that the Firm's representation of you is limited to the foregoing matters and will end when they are concluded . Fees. The Firm's fees are based primarily upon the time we expend on the engagement, including travel time which is charged at regular hourly rates. These hourly rates are normally $265 for L. Allyson Honaker. However, L. Allyson Honaker has agreed to charge an hourly rate of $250 until the rates for the 2022 rate increase are placed into effect. Immediately upon the new rates are established by the Kentucky Public Commission, L. Allyson Honaker's hourly rate will PSC Request 1-48 Attachment Page 3 of 12 Witness: Patsy Walters Mr. Jeff Williams July 20, 2022 Page 2 increase to the normal cooperative rate of $265 per hour. Our hourly rates are reviewed periodically and may be increased from time to time. Potential Conflicts. As we have discussed, you are aware that the Firm represents many other companies and individuals. This can create situations where work for one client on a matter might preclude us from assisting other clients on unrelated matters. It is possible that during the time that we are representing the Client, some of our present or future clients will have disputes or transactions with the Client. In order to avoid the potential for this kind of restriction on our practice, the Client <1grees thHt we may continue to represent or may undertake in the future to represent existing or new clients in any matter that is not substantially related to matters in which we have represented the Client, even if the interests of such clients in those other matters are directly adverse to yours. We do not intend, however, for you to waive your right to have the Firm maintain confidences or secrets that you transmit to the Firm, and we agree not to disclose them to any third party without your consent. We would, of course, take appropriate steps to insure that such information is kept confidential by us. As you are aware, the Firm also represents the Client's wholesale provider, East Kentucky Power Cooperative, Inc. (\"EKPC\"). In the event of a potential conflict in the representation of the Client and EKPC, the Firm will notify both the Client and EKPC of the potential conflict. No confidential information obtained from the representation of either the Client or EKPC will be divulged to the other. If it is determined that an actual conflict exists between the Client and EKPC, Client acknowledges and consents to the Firm's continued representation of EKPC. ABA Statement of Policy. We wish to inform the Client, and the Client acknowledges, that it is the Firm's policy to comply strictly with the terms of the ABA Statement of Policy Reer1roing Lawyers' Responses to Auditors' Requests for Information (December 1975) in any response that the Client requests we make to the Client's auditors regarding \"loss contingencies\" affecting the Client. Electronic Data Communication and 'tornge. In the interest of facilitating our services, we may communicate with you or others by email, facsimile transmission, send data over the Internet, store electronic data via computer software applications hosted remotely on the Internet, or allow access to data through third-party vendors' secured portals or clouds. Electronic data that is confidential to your case may be transmitted or stored using these methods. In using these data communication and storage methods, the Firm makes reasonable efforts to keep such communications and data access secure in accordance with our obligations under applicable laws and professional standards. You recognize and accept that we have no control over the unauthorized interception or breach of any communications or data once it has been sent or has been subject to unauthorized access, notwithstanding all reasonable security measures employed by us or our third-party vendors. You consent to the Firm's use of these electronic devices and applications and submission of confidential client information to third-party service providers during this engagement. E, penses. Expenses we incur on the engagement are charged to the Client's account. Expenses include such items as court costs, charges for computerized research services and hard PSC Request 1-48 Attachment Page 4 of 12 Witness: Patsy Walters Mr. Jeff Williams July 20, 2022 Page 3 copy document reproductions, long distance telephone, travel expenses, messenger service charges, overnight mail or delivery charges, extraordinary administrative support, filing fees, fees of court reporters and charges for depositions, fees for expert witnesses and other expenses we incur on your behalf. Our charges for these services reflect our actual out-of-pocket costs based on usage, and in some areas may a]so include our related administrative expenses. Monthlv Statements. Unless a different billing period is agreed upon with the Client, the Firm will render monthly statements indicating the current status of the account as to both fees and expenses. The statements shall be payable upon receipt. If statements are not paid in full within 30 days, we reserve the right to add a late charge of 1 % per month of the amount due. If it becomes necessary for the Firm to file suit or to engage a co1lection agency for the collection of fees or expenses, the Client shall pay all related costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Litigation Matters. If this engagement involves litigation, the Client may be required to pay the opposing party's trial costs. Such costs include filing fees, witness fees, and fees for depositions and documents used at trial. We will not settle litigated matters without the Client's express consent. We require the Client's active participation in all phases of the case. Insurance coverage. Unless we have been explicitly retained to address insurance coverage issues (as documented in this engagement letter), we have no responsibility or obligation to: (a) identify any potentially applicable insurance coverage; (b) provide notice to any carrier; or ( c) advise the Client on issues relating to insurance coverage at any point during our representation. N \u00b7 Guarantee of Success It is expressly acknowledged by you that the Firm has not made any warranties or representations to you, nor have we given you any assurances as to the favorable or successful resolution of your claim or defense of the action referred to above; nor as to the favorable outcome of any legal action that may be filed; nor as to the nature or amount of any awards or distributions of property, attorney fees, costs, or any other aspects of this matter. All of the Firm's expressions relative to your case are limited only to estimates based upon our experience and judgment and are only our opinion. Such expressions should not be considered as representations, promises, or guarantees of results, which might be obtainable, either by way of a negotiated settlement or in a contested trial. Termination. The Client has the right to terminate our representation at any time by notifying us of your intention to do so in writing. We will have the same right, subject to an obligation to give the Client reasonable notice to arrange alternative representation. In the event either party should elect to terminate our relationship, our fees and expenses incurred up to that point still will be due to us. Upon payment to us of any balance due for fees and expenses, we will return to the Client, or to whomever the Client directs, any property or papers of the Client in our possession. Withdrawal. Under the rules of professional conduct by which we are governed, we may withdraw from our representation of the Client in the event of, for example: nonpayment of our fees and expenses; misrepresentation or failure to disclose material facts concerning the PSC Request 1-48 Attachment Page 5 of 12 Witness: Patsy Walters Mr. Jeff Williams July 20, 2022 Page4 engagement; action taken by the Client contrary to our advice; and in situations involving a conflict of interest with another client. If such a situation occurs, which we do not expect, we will promptly give the Client written notice of our intention to withdraw. PostEngagement Services. The Client is engaging the Firm to provide legal services in connection with a specific matter. After completion of that matter, changes may occur in the applicable laws or regulations that could have an impact on the Client's future rights and liabilities. Unless the Client engages us after completion of the matter to provide additional advice on issues arising from the matter, the Firm has no contin11ine ohligation to advise the Client with respect to future legal developments. Retention and Disposition of Document s. At the Client's request, its documents and property will be returned to the Client upon conclusion of our representation in the matter described above, although the Firm reserves the right to retain copies of any such documents as it deems appropriate. Our own files pertaining to the matter will be retained by the Firm for a period of five (5) years after we close our file. These Firm files include, for example, Firm administrative records, time and expense reports, personnel and staffing materials, and credit and accounting records. At the expiration of the five-year period, we will destroy these files unless you notify us in writing that you wish to take possession of them. We reserve the right to charge administrative fees and costs associated with researching, retrieving, copying and delivering such files. Parenti .. ubsidiary/ Affiliate Relationship~. The Client may be a subsidiary of a parent organization or may itself have subsidiary or affiliated organizations . The Client agrees that the Firm's representation of the Client in this matter does not give rise to an attorney-client relationship between the Firm and any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Client (any of them being referred to as \"Affiliate\"). The Firm, during the course of its representation of the Client, will not be given any confidential information regarding any of the Client's Affiliates. Accordingly , representation of the Client in this matter will not give rise to any conflict of interest in the event other clients of the Firm are adverse to any of the CJient's Affiliates. Consultation with Counsel. From time to time, issues arise that raise questions as to our duties under the professional conduct rules that apply to lawyers. These might include conflict of interest issues, and could even include issues raised because of a dispute between us and a client over the handling of a matter. We believe that it is in our clients' interest, as well as the Firm's interest, that in the event that issues arise during a representation about our duties and obligations as lawyers, we receive expert analysis of our obligations. Accordingly, as part of our agreement concerning our representation, the Client agrees that ifwe determine in our own discretion during the course of the representation that it is either necessary or appropriate to consult with counsel, we have the Client's consent to do so and that our representation of the Client shall not, thereby, waive any attorney-client privilege that the Firm may have to protect the confidentiality of our communications with counsel. Authorization. By the Client's agreement to these terms of our representation, the Client authorizes us to take any and all action we deem advisable on the Client's behalf on this matter. PSC Request 1-48 Attachment Page 6 of 12 Witness: Patsy Walters Mr. Jeff Williams July 20, 2022 Page 5 We will, whenever possible, discuss with the Client in advance any significant actions we intend to take. We appreciate the opportunity to represent you. If these terms of our engagement are acceptable to you, please return a signed copy of this letter to me in the enclosed envelope. We look forward very much to working with you on this matter. Sincerely, cf~~~ L.

We will audit the financial statements of the Cooperative , which comprise the balance sheet as of May 31, 2021, and the related statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in members' equities, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes lo the financial statements. The auditor's report, report on compliance and internal control over financial reporting and management letter are being issued in order to enable the Coopera tive to comply with the provisions of Rus\u00b7s security instruments. Audit Objective The objective of our audit is the expression of an opinion about whether your financial statements are fairly presented in all material respects, in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our audit will be conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards for financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the reporting requirement of RUS set forth in CFR Chapter XVII, Part 1773-RUS Policy on Audits of Electric Borrowers, and will include tests of your accounting records and other procedures we consider necessary to enable us to express such an opinion. We will issue a wrinen report upon completion of our audit of the Cooperative's financial statement s. Our report will be addressed to The Board of Directors of the Cooperative. We cannot provide assurance that an unmodified opinion will be expressed. Circumstances may arise in which it is necessary for us to modify our opinion or add an emphasis-of-matter or other-matter paragraph. If our opinion on the financial statements is other than unmodified , we will discuss the reasons with management in advance. If, for any reason, we are unable to complete the audit or are unable to form or have not formed an opinion, we may decline to express an opinion or issue reports, or we may withdraw from this engagement. We will also provide a report (which does nol include an opinion) on internal control related to the financial statements and compliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements as required by Government Auditing Standards.

The paragraph will also state that the report is not suitable for any other purpose. If during our audit we become aware that the Cooperative is subject to an audit requirement that is not encompassed in the terms of this engagement , we will communicate to management and those charged with governance that an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards established by the Auditing Standards Board (United States) and the standards for financial audits contained in Governmen t Auditing Standards may not satisfy the relevant legal, regulatory, or contractual requirem ents. Audit Procedure s -General An audit includes examining. on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; therefore, our audit will involve judgment about the number of transactions to be examined and the areas to be tested. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriaten ess of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounti ng estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentatio n of the financial statement s. We will plan and pcrfonn the audit to obtain reasonable rather than absolute assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether from (I) errors, (2) fraudulent financial reporting, (3) misappropriatio n of assets, or (4) violations of law or governmental regulations that are attributab le to the Cooperative or to acts by management or employees acting on behalf of the Cooperat ive. Because the determination of abuse is subjective, Govemment Auditing Standards do not expect auditors to provide reasonable assurance of detecting abuse. Because of the inherent limitation s of an audit, combined with the inherent limitations of internal control. and because we will not perfonn a detailed examinatio n of all transactions, there is a risk that material misstatements may exist and not be detected by us, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards and Governmenl Auditing Standards. Tn addition, an audit is not designed to detect immaterial misstatements or violations of laws or governmental regulations that do not have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, we will inform the appropriate level of management of any material errors, fraudulent financial reporting, or misappropriation of assets that come to our attention . We will also inform the appropriate level of management of any violations of laws or governmental regulations that come to our attention, unless clearly inconsequential, and of any material abuse that comes to our attention. Our responsibility as auditors is limited to the period covered by our audit and does not extend to any later periods for which we are not engaged as auditors. We will disclose any fraud or illegal acts that come to our atlention in accordance with 7 CFR Chapter XYlJ, Parts 1773.9 and I 773.20(6). Our procedure s will include tests of documentary evidence supporting the transactions recorded in the accounts, tests of the physical existence of inventori es, and direct confinnation of receivables and certain assets and liabilities by correspondence with selected individuals, funding sources, creditors, and financial institutions. We will also request written representations from the Cooperat ive's attorneys as part of the engagement, and they may bill you for responding to this inquiry. At the conclusion of our audit, we will require certain written representations from you about your responsibilities for the financial statements; compliance with laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other responsibilities required by generally accepted auditing standards. Jones, Nnle & Mnningly PLC PSC Request 1-48 Attachment Page 9 of 12 Witness: Patsy Walters Audit Procedures -Internal Control Our audit will include obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment , including internal control, sufficient to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and to design the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedur es. Tests of controls may be performed to test the effectiveness of certain controls that we consider relevant to preventing and detecting errors and fraud that are material to the financial statements and to preventing and detecting misstatements resulting from illegal acts and other noncompliance matters that have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. Our tests, if performed, will be less in scope than would be necessary t.o render an opinion on internal control and, accordingly, no opinion will be expressed in our report on internal control issued pursuant to Govern111e11/ Auditing Standards. An audit is not designed to provide assurance on internal control or to identify significant deficiencies or material weakness. I lowever, during the audit, we will communicate to management and those charged with governance internal control related matters that are required to be communicated under AICPA professional standards and Government Auditing Standards . Audit Procedures -Compliance As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements arc free of material misstatement, we will perform tests of the Cooperative's compliance with the provision s of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, agreements, and grants. However, the objective of our audit will not be to provide an opinion on overall compliance and we will not express such an opinion in our report on compliance issued pursuant to Government Auditing Standards.
