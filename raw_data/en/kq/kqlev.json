This process has involved extensive outreach, engagement, and collaboration with state agencies and stakeholders, and there is still work to be done! As we begin the public review period of the draft content, we continue to refine and improve the model policies, data, and resources sections throughout the document. This is a public draft of the update to the General Plan Guidelines for the State of California. This comprehensive update seeks to create a suite of tools for planners, practitioners, and the general public to help update local general plans. This \"general plan guidelines package,\" once complete, will include: The general plan guidelines document (draft of text only presented here) updated with sections on visioning, community engagement, social equity, resilience, economic development, healthy communities, and climate change, as well as links to data, tools, resources, and model policies throughout The general plan guidelines GIS based data mapping tool , currently in beta (http://maps.gis.ca.gov/demos/opr/genplan/Landing.html ) being updated during this review, which will allow all users access to large amounts of free data, organized by elements and by themes, for creating their general plans The updated general plan guidelines website which will house the document, the data tool, and links to resources, examples, and other tools. The new website will be easily navigable, allowing the user to access the information they want without having to dig through hundreds of documents, but also directing them to related information and resources. We will be conducting extensive outreach during this revie w period to engage diverse community members on the guidelines and the tool. The guidelines, presented here, are text only, in order to solicit feedback on content alone. The final document will include graphics, additional model policies with links, and additional data suggestions with links. It will also be presented on a user friendly platform, allowing users the option to use the online format or download a pdf. The tool is being updated with additional data layers, informed by data experts across sec tors. Additionally, we will periodically create sample maps using the GPG mapping tool, to demonstrate new or existing functionality and uses. Please note, this draft has not incorporated any changes from legislation in the current cycle, such as SB 379. These changes will be incorporated prior to finalizing the draft. We welcome any comments, questions, or other feedback you may have on this draft . The public comment period will last 60 days, and end at 5PM on December 18th.

To assist l ocal governments in preparing general plans and the public in participating in that process, the Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR periodic ally revise s guidelines for the preparation and content of local general plans (Government Code \u00a765040.2 ). The 2015 edition of the General P lan Guidelines (GPG) contains significant changes. For mandatory and common optional elements of the general plan, the GPG sets out each statutory requirement in detail, provides OPR recommended policy language, and includes online links to city and count y general plans that have adopted similar policies. A sample selection of policies can be found directly in the text, and users can click the link provided for more detailed policies and plans. The GPG is searchable, and all model policy language NEW in the 2015 General Plan Guidelines suite of tools : GPG Online Mapping Tool , enabling free, easy access to helpful data for cities and counties Links to additional online tools and resources Recommended policies in cut and paste format, with examples of adopted policy language Reforma tted sections on the mandatory elements Expanded equity and environmental justice section Infill compendium Renewable energy compendium Model template for mitigation of agricultural land con version A new section on healthy communities An updated section on economic considerations in planning A new section on climate change Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 2 can be easily edited to serve the needs of local communities. The update includes new resources and templates for cities and counties to use in considering themes, structures, and policies for their general plans, including new compendiums on infill development , renewable energy , and mitigation of agricultural land conversion . As more resources become available, they will be added to these General Plan Guidelines. The new online platform will allow O PR to add updated text, links, and information to the GPG, and announce any additions through the GPG listserv and on the OPR website . The GPG is intended to be a resource for planners to use to accomplish their community's priorities and vision while meeting larger state goals. The process of adopting a general plan has become too time -consuming and costly for many jurisdictions. As of 2015, more than half of local jurisdictions have general plans that are over fifteen years old. In order to streamlin e the process and reduce the cost, t his first comprehensive update of OPR s General Plan Guidelines (GPG) since 2003 provides free online tools and resources , increase s use of online data, and includes templates and links. The GPG Online Mapping tool draws data sets from multiple sources , allowing users to incorporate local, regional, and state wide data into local general plan s without cost . These new resources will help facilitate bette r, faster, and efficient development of general plan updates for communities of all sizes throughout the state. The term \"element\" refers to the topics covered in the general plan. While statute mandates certain e lements in the plan, there is neither a mandatory structure nor a maximum number of topics that a general plan may address. The general plan is the perfect space for innovation, reflect ing the uniqu e character of each community. The format and content of general plans can and should vary between j urisdictions. Elements must be addressed, but general p lans can be organized by values (core concepts that the community wants to enhance or uphold), themes (overarching issues identified by the community as important), challenges or goals identified throu gh community engagement, as well as by the elements themselves. Cities and counties may create new models of organizing their general plans, based on the needs and priorities identified during public engagement. Riverside County , for example, included a healthy communities element in its general plan update. The City of Fullerton structured its general plan around four focus areas, identified through community engagement, and addressed all of the elements in those areas. Some cities and counties have focused on specific values or challenges that are important to them, and shaped their Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 3 plans around those issues. The City of Sacramento framed its general plan around sustainability and livable communities, and focused each of the required elements -as well as additional elements - around those goals. The GPG is designed to assist every city and county in accordance with the local jurisdiction's vision, using whatever structure achieves the goals of the community. Figure 1: Examples of General Plan Layout The 2015 GPG includes a free online mapping to ol. The tool is organized around the requirements for the mandatory elements as well as themes, and provides Geographic Information Systems (GIS) resources for use by city and county planners drafting a general plan. The tool provides access to data (va rying as available between county, city, and parcel level information ) to help inform decision making processes, on a platform Community identified values Element 1 How Element 1 will support values Element 2 How Element 2 will support values Thematic Theme 1 Policies to support theme 1 throughout elements Theme 2 policies to support theme 2 throughout elements Challenges & Goals Challenge 1 Policies to overcome challenge 1 and achieve goals across elements Challenge 2 policies to overcome challenge 2 and achieve goals across elements Other innovative Model Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 4 specifically designed for general plans as well as enhanced public participation in the process . Recommendations and Sample Lan guage OPR has included recommendations and sample policy language to provide cities and counties with information, data, examples, and ideas to consider in their general plan. These recommendations may not fit the needs of every city and county or every circumstance . Rather, they present a toolbox of options, allowing jurisdictions to utilize them as provided , modify them as appropriate within statutory requirements, or consider them as examples to inform their own, unique policies. According to state l aw, \"decisions involving the future growth of the state, most of which are made and will continue to be made at the local level, should be guided by an effective planning process, including the local general plan, and should proceed within the framework of officially approved statewide goals and policies directed to land use, population growth and distribution, development, open space, resource preservation and utilization, air and water quality, and other related physical, social and economic development factors.\"( Gov Code \u00a7 65030.1 ) The following is an excerpt from the Environmental Goals and Policy Report and the statutory State Planning Prioriti es, as they appear in Government Code \u00a765041.1 . The GPG is intended to implement the policies from both by recommending an approach for cities and counties to incorporate policies that achieve these goals at a local level. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 5 The state planning priorities, which are intended to promote equity, strengthen the economy, protect the environment, and promote public health and safety in the state, including in urban, suburban, and rural communities, shall be as follows: (a) To promote infill development and equity by rehabilitating, maintaining, and improving existing infrastructure that supports infill development and appropriate reuse and redevelopment of previously developed, underutilized land that is presently served by transit, streets, water, sewer, and other essential services, particularly in unde rserved areas, and to preserve cultural and historic resources. (b) To protect environmental and agricultural resources by protecting, preserving, and enh ancing the state's most valuable natural resources, including working landscapes such as farm, range, and forest lands, natural lands such as wetlands, watersheds, wildlife habitats, and other wildlands, recreation lands such as parks, trails, greenbelts, and other open space, and landscapes with locally unique features and areas identified by the state as deserving special protection. (c) To encourage efficient development patterns by ensuring that any infrastructure associated with development, other than infill development, supports new development that does all of the following: (1) Uses land efficiently. (2) Is built adjacent to existing developed areas to the extent consistent with the priorities specified pursuant to subdivision (b). (3) Is located in an area appropriately planned for growth. (4) Is served by adequate transportation and other essential utilities and services. (5) Minimizes ongoing costs to taxpayers. These General Plan Guidelines are advisory. Nevertheless , courts periodically refer to the GPG to interpret planning law. For this reason, the GPG closely adheres to statute and case law. It also relies upon commonly accepted principles of contemporary planning practice. The following words are used to indicate whether a particular subject in the GPG is mandatory, advisory, or permissive: (a) \"Must\" or \"shall\" identifies a manda tory element which all public agencies are required to follow. (b) \"Should\" identifies guidance provided by OPR based on policy considerations contained in California's planning laws. (c) \"May\" identifies a permissive element which is left fully to the d iscretion of the local governments involved. The GPG was updated in coordination with a number of other tool, policy , and program update efforts to ensure references to external tools support the intent of the GPG. Some examples of these concurrent update s include: General Plan Guidelines tool AB32 Scoping Plan Update Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 6 Safeguarding California Plan State Hazard Mitigation Plan Adaptation Planning Guide Cal-Adapt Cool California California State Ener gy Efficiency Collaborative GHG and climate tools California Coastal Commission Local Coastal Plan guidance California State Wellness Plan California Water Plan CEQA Update SB 743 Environmental Goals and Policy Report 732, 244, and other legislation advisories The GPG also includes new sections on healthy communities , equity , economic development , and climate change ; as well as compendiums on infill development , renewable energy , and agricultural land conservation . How to Use these Guidel ines: The General Plan Guidelines are intended to be user friendly and practical for planners, decision makers, and the general public. The GPG and the GPG mapping tool can be used to frame conversations around planning, evaluate data and identify priorities, research formats and policies from similar communities, and enhance capacity for fiscally constrained departments and organizations working to update general plans. Each chapter o f the GPG lays out the requirements contained in statute, connections to other requirements, additional considerations, and related data and policies to consider. Recognizing the vast diversity of California's communities in size, demographics, geography, economics, and resources, the GPG presents examples in various jurisdictions whenever possible. Statutory Requirements Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 7 Each statutory requirement includes a text box with the statutory language for each element , exactly as it appears in statute. The information following the statutory language contains OPR's recommendations for meeting the requirement. Each statut ory reference is hyperlinked to the full text of the government code for easy access. Requirement Description This section includes a descripti on of considerations, resources, data, and other information for develop ing general plan policies. Many elements are interrelated, so linkages between elements are noted in tables through each section . This section also includes a dditional information through h yperlinks , which lead to examples and resources. Recommended Data Each section also includes recommendations for data that jurisdictions may wish to use to examine and determine specific needs and policies. The data is identified in tables accordin g to the potential intent of analysis . Where links to the recommended data are available, they are provided in the table , leading directly to the GPG Online Mapping tool . Because t he same data may be useful for multiple analytical purposes, some data links to multiple sections of the guidelines. The recommended data is not exhaustive, and is meant to serve as a starting point to consider the specific needs of a community and the data t hat may help inform decisions around those needs. Recommended Policies The Govern ment Code directs OPR to provide land use policy advice. In order to do so, the GPG includes both general plan policy recommendations and links to external resources that provide policy guidance. Where possible, links are provided to external reports, case studies, and jurisdictions that have adopted the model policies . Many of the policy recommendations are based on adopted state programs described in the draft Environmental Goals and Policy Report \u2014an overview of the state's environmental goals and the key steps needed to achieve them . OPR also examined current academic publications and conducted extensive outreach to local g overnments, community , and advocacy groups in building policy recommendations . Cross-cutting recommendations include consideration of equity , health , and climate issues within jurisdictions , communities , Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 8 and regions. With thoughtful planning, the State of California will foster a future that has a strong economy, thriving built and natural environments, and a healthy, prosperous citizenry. GPG policy recommendations focus on four key themes. 1. Climate Change : In California, climate change has been the subject of multiple Executive Orders and legislation . It is a high priority subject for any general plan update. EO S-03- 05 established long term targets for 2020 and 2050 for emissions reductions in California , and EO S-13-08 establishe d climate change adaptation and resilience as a priority. Further State goals include reduction of petroleum use by up to 50 percent by 2030, and increase d percentage of renewable energy to 50 percent by 2030. The State of California has set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction requirements through numerous mechanisms including land use and transportation planning. (See AB 32 , SB 375, and SB 743 as examples). The AB32 Scoping Plan includes sections on local government and the importance of local action to help achieve statewide climate goals. Additionally, the Safeguarding California Plan, Cal -Adapt , Climate Change Handbook for Regional Water Planning, and the Adaptation Planning Guide provide guidance for resilience and adaptat ion efforts . OPR's GPG recommendations focus on how the general plan can achieve both GHG emission reductions and resiliency to climate change impacts and lead to healthier communities. 2. Economics : Policies th roughout all elements of the general plan greatly affect economic opportunity, development, and stability. Decisions regarding land use and circulation have direct and indirect fiscal implications, and in turn economies of urban and rural centers affect th e health, climate, and equity of communities. As with all general plan topics, even if addressed in a separate section, economic development must link and integrate with other elements in order to be successful 3. Healthy Communities : In 2012 the Governor issued Executive Order B -19-12 and created the Governor's Let's Get Healthy California Task Force . Chronic disease, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and asthma affect quality of life and productivity. Health and well-being are affected by many factors, including the social, economic, and environmental factors where people live, work, and play. Th e Task Force identified the creation and expansion of healthy communities to be one of three major focus areas for the promotion of overall health improvement at the population level. Because planning Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 9 offers one important way to improve the community's hea lth, OPR offers recommendations for jurisdictions interested in incorporating h ealth-supporting policies into their general plan. 4. Equitable Opportunities : Planning decisions affect the entire community, and the entire community must be allowed equal acces s to the public process ( Gov Code \u00a711135 ). From determining proximity to localized noise or air pollution, to providing healthy grocery options, to creating access to employment and education opportunity, planning and policy affect everyone. Incorporating equity in to all aspects of planning will ensure that resident s of a city or county benefits from reduced GHG emissions, climate change adaptati on policies, active transportation options, and healthy communities with access to economic opportunity for all. OPR's recommendations for equity incorporate statutory requirement s for Environmental Justice guidance (\u00a765040.12(c)) with an expanded focus on equity throughout the general plan. Additionally, based on statewide goals, the update includes model guides and best practices related to infill development , renewable energy , and mitigation of agricultural land conversion . Readers should note that the recommended policies are simply recommendations , intended to provide a startin g point from which local governments can craft unique policies reflecting the priorities and circumstances of their communities. The GPG aims to create a suite of tools for communities to utilize in updating their general plans. By providing informat ion, resources, and data on statutory requirements as well as non-statutory considerations relevant to planning, the GPG can help diverse community members work together towards a shared vision for their future growth. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 10 Chapter 2: A Vision for Long -Range Planning Designing Healthy, Equitable, Resilient, and Economically Vibrant Places \"A city is not gauged by its length and width, but by the broadness of its vision and the height of its dreams.\" --Herb Caen Local Genera l Plan s and State wide Goals California state law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan \"for the physical development of the county or city, and any land outside its boundaries which bears relation to its planning\" (\u00a765300 ).The general plan expresses the community s development goals and embodies public policy relative to the distribution of future land uses, both public and private . The California Supreme Court has called the general plan the \"constitution for future development.\" But the general plan extends far beyond land use. California's population is projected to reach 50 million residents by 2050. Accommodating this growth while protecting the state's environment, supporting equitable development and a stro ng economy, and preserving the S tate's natural and working landscapes -- all in the context of climate change -- will be critical in the coming decades. Cities and counties are key partners in achieving these goals. A local general plan should start with a community vision , to create a shared understanding that will help set priorities throughout the plann ing process, and inform decision makers about community values. Creating a community vision may include: Looking back to identify past challenges and accomplishments Examining current data and emerging data trends Considering future issues, challenges, and goals The City of Chula Vista held numerous community workshops to craft their vision statement, and used it to inform future goals and policies. The City of Chino utilized existing events to engage the community in d eveloping its vision statement, traveling to farmers markets, Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 11 events, and local groups before meeting with city officials to craft the fin al statement. Chino also used the vision statement to inform the land use diagram used in their general plan, ensuring the community's values were reflected in the future growth of the city. California's Planning Priorities Statewide planning priorities were first articulated in the 1978 Urban Strategy for California and were adopted in to law in 2002. Briefly, the priorities are to: 1. Promote infill development and rehabilitati on and utiliz ation of existing infrastructure, including water, sewer, and transportation. 2. To protect the state's natural and working lands, including agricultural land, lands of cultural and historic significance, wetlands, and wildlands. 3. To develop in an efficient manne r that limits sprawl and minimizes costs to taxpayers. These priorities are intended to inform planning and investment at all levels of government. As of this update, t he state is in the midst of a severe drought, continue s to lose agricultural lands du e to conversi on, and several regions in the state continue to face severe air quality challenges. However, one major difference between today and similar conditions in the 1970s is the robust suite of environmental goals and policies. These have helped im prove the quality of the state's environment and will continue to serve the state. Most importantly, the suite of policies that California has adopted to address climate change will touc h on nearly every facet of the state's development. California's Climate Change Policy and Local Communities Climate pollution and the effects of climate change pose great risks for Californians , including more frequent and more intense forest fires, air pollution and deadly heat waves, a significant reduction in the sn owpack and state water supplies, sea level rise and erosion along California's long coastline, and billions of dollars in damage to our agricultural, tourism, recreation, and other industries. These impacts have the potential to be hugely disruptive to how local governments operate. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 12 Executive Order S -03-05 established greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for the state. Subsequently, Assembly Bill (AB) 32 , known as the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, establishe d a comprehensive program to achieve quantifiable, cost - effective reductions of greenhouse gases on a scheduled basis. The 2014 revised AB32 scoping plan highlights the importance of local government in reducing emissions to achieve longer -term statewide goals. In order to achieve California's 2050 emissions goal of 8 0% below 1990 levels, emissions must decline several times faster than the rate needed to reach the 2020 emissions limit. California's Planning Priorities California Government Code: 65041 .1 The state planning priorities, which are intended to promote equity, strengthen the economy, protect the environment, and promote public health and safety in the state, including in urban suburban, and rural communities, shall be as follows: (a) To prom ote infill development and equity by rehabilitating, maintaining, and improving existing infrastructure that supports infill development and appropriate reuse and redevelopment of previously developed, underutilize d land that is presently served by transit , streets, water, sewer, and other essential services, particularly in underserved areas, and to preserving cultural and historic resources. (b) To protect environmental and agricultural resources by protecting, preserving, and enhancing the state's most v aluable natural resources, including working landscapes such as farm, range, and forest lands, natural lands such as wetlands, watersheds, wildlife habitats, and other wildlands, recreation lands such as parks, tra ils, greenbelts, and other open space, and landscapes with locally unique features and areas identified by the state as deserving special protection. (c) To encourage efficient development patterns by ensuring that any infrastructure associated with development, other than infill development, supp orts new development that does all of the following: (1) Uses land efficiently. (2) Is built adjacent to existing developed areas to the extent consistent with the priorities specified pursuant to subdivision (b). (3) Is located in an area appropriately pl anned for growth. (4) Is served by adequate transportation and other essential utilities and services. (5) Minimizes ongoing costs to taxpayers. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 13 Figure 2: GHG Emission reductions will need to occur at a faster rate to achieve the state's 2050 GHG emission reduction target (CARB) Transportation and electricity generation are the largest source s of the state's GHG emissions. State policies are focused on reducing transportation emissions through cleaner fuels and vehicles and promoting alternatives to driving (e.g., walking, biking, tran sit, and carpooling). The State's goals for renewable energy and energy efficiency will reduce emissions f rom electricity generation. Why the General Plan Matters While the goals discussed above have been established at a state level, cities and counties are critical partners in helping to achieve them. General plans reflect state and local goals and how they will b e achieved. In addition, they benefit local communities by promoting better projects and outco mes, streamlined processes, and improved access and use of Figure 3: GHG emissions in California are dominated by emissions from transportation and electricity generation (Data from: California Air Resources Board) Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 14 available resources. Studies show that l and use decisions affect transportation demand, and are also correlated with electricity and water demand . Furthermore, local policies affect building decisions, energy efficiency, and the development of infrastructure. Decisions made at the local level , for example, have a real impact on statewide greenhouse gas emissions, and also help to determine how vulnerable the community and the state will be in the face of a changing climate and alternatively, how resilient they can be by addressing their vulnerab ilities. In many cases, the impacts of these decisions can be measured. For instance, health, infrastructure, services and other costs associated with various land use patterns can be estimated using tools like Urban Footprint . Measuring impacts and outcomes will enable communities to weigh costs and benefits of new development and grow in a manner that is consistent with community values. Quantifying outcomes can provide meaningful contra sts for general plan development. For example, the graphs below show the aggregate impacts of development decisions on land consumption and infrastructure costs, statewide.1 Figure 4: Land consumption and infrastructure costs i ncrease with less dense development patterns 1 These results are from analysis prepared by Calthorpe Associates for the state as a whole. Similar results have been prepared at a city and county level. The land use assumptions are based on current density patterns (BAU) and under increasingly dense development. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 15 General Plan Basics The general plan is intended to guide most planning decisions. Under state law, subdivisions, capital improvements, development agreements, and many other land use actions must be cons istent with the adopted general plan. In counties and general law cities, zoning and specific plans are also required to conform to the general plan. In addition, preparing, adopting, implementing, and maintaining the general plan serves to: Identify the c ommunity's land use , circulation , environmental , economic , and social goals and policies as they relate to future growth and development. Provide a basis for local government decision - making, including decisions on development approvals and exactions. Provide citizens with opportunities to participate in th e planning and decision -making processes of their communities. Inform citizens, developers, decision -makers, and other cities and counties of the ground rules that guide development within a particular community. General Plan Elements The City of Fresno engaged in a robust four -year process to update its general pla n, which focuses on encouraging new development within the existing footprint of the city. Citing past mistakes that left some neighborhoods behind and hoping to reverse the patterns of sprawl, the City used Rapid Fire - the predecessor to Urban Footprint - to engage the entire community in the visioning and creation of their new plan for future growth. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 16 Placemaking and Urban Design While the General Plan Land Use Map is two dimensional, placemaking takes land use policies into a three -dimensional realm by focusing on what a place will actually look like when it is built. Great districts, corridors, and sites contribute to t he vitality and quality of life of a community from the placement of buildings, relationship of buildings to one another and public spaces, and the design and quality of sidewalks, open spaces, and other elements of the public realm. Many communities add ress placemaking and urban design through an optional element such as an Urban Design Element. However, these policies can also be incorporated into a Land Use Element as urban form is closely related to the location , densities, and intensities of land use s. Urban design considers the relationship between land use and the image or character of the built environment with the ultimate goal of attaining a strong sense of place. Placemaking re -envisions a community's assets, spaces, and surroundings and their r elationships to each other. Using extensive public participation, placemaking attempts to create public spaces that are useful, attractive, and utilized extensively by the community, who consequently feel ownership and pride in the space . This approach is applicable to many types of communities and can be especially meaningful in suburban contexts seeking to instill a stronger sense of place in sprawl environments and in areas focusing on infill development. Placemaking is also important to carefully plan f or the public realm. Several cities have taken varied approaches to incorporate urban design and placemaking into their general plans and land use elements. The City of Fullerton developed The Fullerton Vision to identify 12 distinct Focus Areas within which to concentrate potential change through community -led planning processes. The City of Sacramento's Land Use and Urban Design chapter focused on creating complete neighborhoods, distinct and memorable places, and excellence in the design of the city's form and structure through development standards and clear design dire ction. The City of Tracy used a Community Character Element in its General Plan to develop urban design principles including Human -Scale Design, Community Focal Points, and Visual Landmarks and Entryways. The City of Brea Community Development Element contains an Urban Design plan with policies for creating a sense of place and policies for creating connections. The pl an also include a Public Realm Urban Design Palette which establishes direction for City -sponsored improvements of public property, including, city gateways, landscape corridors, neighborhood linkages, and public plazas. In statute, the general plan is presented as a collection of seven \"elements,\" or topic categories (see \u00a765302 ). These topics and the issues embodied by each ar e briefly summarized below. Examples from cities and counties in the state are embedded in the GPG with links throughout the document. Land Use : designates the type, intensity, and general distribution of uses of land for housing, business, industry, open space, education, public buildings and grounds, waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses. Circulation : correlates with the land use element and identifies the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 17 Housing : comprehensive assessment of current and proj ected housing needs for all economic segments of the community. In addition, the housing element embodies policies for providing adequate housing and includes action programs for that purpose. By statute, the housing element must be updated every four, five or eight years. Conservation : addresses the conservation, development, and use of natural resources, including water, forests, soils, rivers, and mineral deposits. Open Space : details plans and measures for the long -range preservation and conservation of open -space lands, including open space for the preservation of natural resources, the managed production of resources , agriculture, outdoor recreation, and public health and safe ty. Noise : identifies and appraises noise problems within the community and forms the basis for land use distribution. Safety : establishes policies and programs to protect the community from risks associated with seismic, geologic, flood, and wildfire hazards , as well as other concerns such as drought . Air Quality : establishes policies and programs to reduce impacts to air quality in the San Joaquin Valle y Air Pollution Control District. Air quality is an optional element in other areas of the state. Other optional elements, identified by community : health , equity , community development , water, and resiliency are some examples of additional elements that can be added to general plans or used to frame general plans. The level of dis cussion given to each issue in the general plan depends upon local conditions and the relative local importance of that issue. When a city or county determines that an issue specified in the law is not locally relevant, the general plan may briefly discuss the reason for that decision but does not otherwise have to address that issue (\u00a765301 ). A jurisdiction may choose to combine elements if most a ppropriate for local context. A local general plan may also include other topics of local interest. In addition to the mandatory elements, a city or county may adopt any other elements that relate to its physical development (\u00a765303 ). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 18 Once adopted, these optional elements become an integral part of the general plan with the same force and effect as the mandatory elements. Ac cordingly, zoning, subdivisions, public works, specific plans, and other actions that must be consistent with the general plan must also be consistent with any optional elements. Likewise, the practice of developing stand-alone climate action, adaptation , or emissions reduction plans, if properly linked to the general plan, must also be internally consistent if used to support or augment policy, programs and implementation associated with the general plan. Common topics for optional elements include air quality , climate change , capital improvements , community design , healthy communities , economic development , energy , parks and recreation , water, and watershed planning . Depending upo n the format a jurisdiction decides to use for its general plan, these topics may also be cross cutting themes, addressing required and optional elements throughout each chosen section. An optional element may clarify how a local government exercises its p olice powers - and in some instances, can expand a local government's authority. In a more common situation, an optional element will indicate how a local government will apply its existing police power or other authority. For example, a historic preservati on element may lay the foundation for historic district regulations or participation in the California Main Street Program, or a strategic fire prevention planning el ement could identify wildfire hazard areas, control new development within those areas, and provide the basis for zoning, subdivision, and brush clearance ordinances intended to minimize fire hazards. In the statutory descriptions of the elements, a number of issues appear in more than one element. In order to minimize redundancies or internal conflicts in the general plan, combining elements or organizing the plan by issue often makes practical sense. This idea is explored further in Chapter 1 . There are a number of state and federal laws, such as AB 857 , the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act , the Endangered Species Act , and others, that can affect the content of the general plan. These are discussed in detail throughout these guidelines. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 19 Criteria for the General Plan General Plan criteria must include comprehensiveness, internal consistency, and long -term perspective, which are discussed below. Comprehensiveness Every city and county must adopt \"a comprehensive, long term general plan\" (\u00a765300 ). The general plan must cover a local jurisdiction's entire plann ing area and address the broad range of issues associated with a city's or county's development. Providing linkages to regional plans may also be included - incorporating regi onal policy and context where appropriate . Geographic Comprehensiveness The plan must cover the territory within the boundaries of the adopting city or county as well as \"any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency's judgment bears relation to its planning\" (\u00a765300) . For cities, this means all territory within the city limits, both public and private. Counties must address all unincorporated areas. When establishing its planning area, each city should consider using its sphere o f influence as a starting point, then building off of that area based on factors such as its location in a watershed . The Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) in every county adopts a sphere of influence for each city to represent \"the p robable physical boundaries and service area\" of that city (\u00a756076 ). Although there is no direct requirement that the sphere and the planning area match, the former provides a convenient measure of the city's region of interest. A county should consider the general plans of every city within the county and adjacent jurisdictions in its own plans, even if they are in a different county. In addition, since issues are not confined to political boundaries, the law provides for planning outside of the jurisdiction's territory. Cooperative extraterritorial planning can be used to manage groundwater resources; guide appropriate development within specific geographic context (such as areas that may be affected by sea level rise as a result of climate change ) and the orderly and efficient extension of services and utili ties; ensure the Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 20 preservation of open space, agricultur e, and resource conservation lands; and es tablish consistent standards for development in the plans of adjoining jurisdictions . Figure 5: Map Showing Spheres of Influence for G rass Valley, CA (www.cityofgrassvalley.com/content/maps/sphere -influence - map) Cities and counties should work together to delineate planning areas and may establish formal agreements for processing development proposals. As urbanization occurs and adjoin ing cities expand, the potential for conflict between cities competing for the same lands increases. Intercity cooperation in establishing planning areas can proactively help to avoid such disputes and avoid additional costs . Regional Co ntext Viewing the local general plan in its regional context is important. Traditionally, the concept of \"community\" encompassed only a local entity \u2014the city or county. With the growing interdependence of local governments, joint planning and procurement a nd important issues that transcend local boundaries such as transportation, provision of energy, climate change, air quality, water supply and management, and floodplain and flood risk management, the regional perspective should be considered. Cities and c ounties should coordinate plans regionally when possible and appropriate, for example to identify risks from natural hazards and climate change and opportunities for integrated resource management that extend acr oss jurisdictional boundaries. Using any available data --such as Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 21 watershed -based floodplain management, mapped earthqu ake faults or high fire-hazard areas, integrated water management plans , [and new requirements for sustainable groundwater management plans] sustainable community strategies , hazard mitigation plans , local coastal programs and other planning documents -- will improve planning and expand opportunities. Each local planning agency should coordinate its general plan with regional planning efforts as much as possible. This GPG update provides tools to make this easier. The general plan process provi des local jurisdictions with the opportunity to integrate across the requirements and opportunities provided by multiple regional documents and initiatives. The Legislature has mandated consideration of certain regional impacts , such as regional housing needs, in the general plan. Local general plans should recognize the city or county's regional role if regional needs are to be satisfied, fed eral and state standards met, and coordination achieved in the location of public facilities. Accordingly, general plans should include a discussion of the extent to which the general plan's policies, standards, and proposals correspond to regional plans and the plans of adjoining communities. A city or county may need to reexamine its own general plan when its neighbors make important changes to their plans. Issue Comprehensiveness While a general plan must address a broad range of issues , the plan should focus on those issues that are relevant to the planning area (\u00a765301(c) ). The plan must address the jurisdiction's physical development, such as general locations, appropriate mix, timing, and extent of land uses and supporting infras tructure. The broad scope of physical development issues may range from appropriate areas for building factories to open space for preserving endangered species (see Chapter 4 for examples). This may include not only thos e issues described in the planning statutes, but regional issues as well. Land use decisions have physical and environmental impacts, but also social and economic consequences, especially for vulnerable and disadvantaged communities . Recognizing these concerns in the general plan can help cities and counties plan for or mitigate them . Social and economic issues may be discussed within the context of the mandatory elements, such as housing and land use , or in additional optional elements such as environmental justice , economic development , or community health . Both methods are discussed in the GPG. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 22 Internal Consistency Internal consistency requires that no policy conflicts can exist, either textual or diagrammatic, between the components of an otherwise complete and adequate ge neral plan including internally referenced external documents like a climate action plan or local energy assurance plan (\u00a7 65300.5 ). Different policies must be balanced and reconciled within the plan. The internal consistency requirement has five dimensions, described below. Equal Status Among Elements All elements of the general plan have equal legal status. For example, in Sierra Club v. Board of Supervisors of Kern County (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698 , two of Kern County's general plan elements, land use and open space, designated conflicting land uses for the same property. A provision in the general plan text reconciled this and other map inconsiste ncies by stating that \"if in any instance there is a conflict between the land use element and the open space element, the land use element controls.\" The court of appeal struck down this clause because it violated the internal consistency requirement unde r \u00a765300.5 . No element is legally subordinate to another; the general plan must resolve potential conflicts among the elements through clear lang uage and policy consistency . Consistency Between Elements All elements of a general plan, whether mandatory or optional, must be consistent with one another . In Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 90 , the county land use element contained proposals expected to result in increased population. The circulation element, however, failed to provide feasible remedies for the predicted traffic congestion that would follow. The county simply stated that it would lobby for funds to solve the future traffic pro blems. The court held that this vague response was insufficient to reconcile the conflicts. Housing element law requires local agencies to adopt housing element programs that achieve the goals and implement the policies o f the housing element. The element must \"In construing the provisions of this article the Legislature intends that the general plan and elements are parts thereof compr ise an integrated , internally consistent and co mpatible statement of polices of the adopting agency .\" (Section 65300.5 ) Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 23 identify the means by which consistency will be achieved and maintained with other general plan elements (\u00a765583(c)) , including land use . A city or county may incorporate by reference into its general plan all or a portion of another jurisdiction's plan, a regional plan , or its own plan, such as a climate action plan. When doing so, the city or county should make sure that any materials incorporated by reference are consistent with the rest of its general plan. Consistency Within Elements Each element's data, analyses, goals, policies, and implementation programs must be consistent with and complement one another. Established goals, data, and analysis form the foundation for any ensuing policies. For example, if one portion of a circulation element indicates that county roads are sufficient to accommodate the projected level of traffic while another section of the same element describes a worsening traffic situation aggravated by continued subdivision activity, the element is not internally consistent (Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 90 ). Area Plan Consistency All principles, goals, objectives, policies, and plan proposals set forth in an area or community plan must be consistent with the overall general plan. The general plan should explicitly discuss the role of area plans if they are to be used. Similarly, each area pl an should discuss its specific relationship to the general plan Climate Action Plans and airport land use compatibility plans, where appropriate, should also be consistent with the general plan. Climate Action Plans can be created concurre ntly with or clos ely following a general plan update. However, if a local agency's resources do not allow for concurrent preparation of a general plan update and the climate action plan, general plans may be amended later to integrate all or part of the cl imate action plan . Text and Diagram Consistency The general plan's text and its accompanying diagrams and maps are integral parts of the plan. They must be in agreement. For example, a conflict exists if a general plan's land use element diagram designates low -density residential development in an area where the text Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 24 describes the presence of prime agricultural land and written policies to preserve agricultural land or open space. The plan's text and diagrams must be recon ciled, because \"internal consistency requires that general plan diagrams of land use, circulation systems, open -space and natural resources areas reflect written policies and programs in the text for each element.\" ( Curtin's California Land -Use and Plannin g Law , 1998 edition, p. 18) Long-Term Perspective Since the general plan affects the welfare of current and future generations, state law requires that the plan take a long -term perspective ( \u00a765300 ). The general plan projects conditions and needs into the future as a basis for determining objectives. It also establishes long-term policy for day -to-day decision -making ba sed upon those objectives. The time frames for effective planning vary among issues. The housing element, for example, specifically involves time increments of four, five, or eight years . Sewer, water, and road systems are generally designed with a 30 - to 50-year lifespan. Capital improvement planning is typically based upon a five - or seven -year term. Economic trends may change rapidly in response to outside forces. Climate change is affecting local governments now, but longer term planning should anticipa te the significant changes in the environmental setting associated with a changing climate as indicated by best available science . Differences in time frame also affect the formulation of general plan goals, objecti ves, policies, and implementation measures. Goals and objectives are longer term, s pecific policies shorter in their outcomes, and implementation programs the shortest span because they must quickly respond to the demands of new funding sources, the result s of their own activities, and the jurisdiction's immediate needs and problems. Most jurisdictions have selected 20 years as the horizon year for the general plan. The horizon does not mark an end point, but rather provides a general context in which to ma ke shorter -term decisions. The local jurisdiction may choose a time horizon that serves its particular needs including horizon years further out to address long term issues like climate change and land use . Planning is a continuous process; the general plan should be reviewed regularly, regardless of its horizon, and revised as new information becomes available and as community needs and values change. With easier access to data, cities and counties have the opportunity to evaluate their general plans more often, link directly to responsible Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 25 agencies, or monitor their process through data analysis or public das hboards . The City of Sacramento, for example, conducts annual reviews of their general plan as well as five year updates to the document based on the annual assessments. These regular reviews and updates reduce the potential cost of a comprehensive rewriting of their general plan, while keeping it timely and relevant to community needs. Considerations for General Plan s Area Plans, Community Plans, and Specific Plans Area and community plans are part of the general plan. A specific plan, on the other hand, is a tool for implementing the general plan but is not part of the general plan. The following paragraphs look briefly at each of these types of plans. In addition to consistency between plans, general plans must also be consistent with airport land use compatibility plans in specified regions , unless overridden by a two thirds vote of the local government, pursuant to Public Utilities Code \u00a721676 . \"Area plan\" and \"community plan\" are terms for plans that focus on a particular region or community within the overall general plan area. An area or community plan is adopted by resolution as an amendment to the general plan, in the manner set out in \u00a765350 , et seq. It refines the polic ies of the general plan as they apply to a smaller geographic area and is implemented by ordinances and other discretionary actions, such as zoning. The area or community plan process also provides a forum for resolving local conflicts. These plans are commonly used in large cities and counties where there are a variety of distinct communities or regions. As discussed earlier, an area or community plan must be internally consistent with the general plan of which it is a part. To facilitate such consistency, the general plan should provide a policy framework for the detailed treatment of specific issues in the various area or community plans. Ideally, to simplify implementation, the area or community plans and the general plan should share a uniform format fo r land use categories, terminology, and diagrams. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 26 Each area or community plan need not address all of the issues identified by \u00a765302 when the ov erall general plan satisfies these requirements. For example, an area or community plan need not discuss fire safety if the jurisdiction -wide p lan adequately addresses the subject and the area or community plan is consistent with those policies and stan dards. While an area or community plan may provide greater detail to policies affecting development in a defined area, adopting one or a series of such plans does not substitute for regular updates to the general plan. Many of the mandatory general plan issue s are most effectively addressed on a jurisdiction -wide basis that ties together the policies of the individual area or community plans. A specific plan is a hybrid that can combine policy statements with developme nt regulations (\u00a765450 , et seq.). It can be used to address the development requirements for a single project such as urban infill or a planned community. As a result, its emphasis is on concrete standards and development criteria. Its text and diagrams will address the planning of necessary infrastructure a nd facilities, as well as land uses and open space. In addition, it will specify those programs and regulations necessary to finance infrastructure and public works projects. A specific plan may be adopted either by resolution, like a general plan, or by ordinance, like zoning. Specific plans must be consistent with all facets of the general plan, including the policy statements. In turn, zoning, subdivisions, and public works projects must be consistent with the specific plan ( \u00a765455 ). Once a specific plan has been adopted, later projects may not require additional review under CEQA. The publication A Planner's Guide to Specific Plans , by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR), provides further information on relationships between plans. Adoption of Another Jurisdiction's General Plan and Joint Adoption A city or county may adopt all or a por tion of the general plan of another public agency (\u00a765301(a)) . Additionally, \u00a765302(g) specifically provides that a city may adopt the county's safety element if the county's element \"is sufficiently detailed containing appropriate policies and programs for adoption by a city.\" One of the benefits of this approach is that it eliminates duplication of effort in collecting data for the more technical elements. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 27 A city and county may jointly prepare and separately adopt a general plan or individual elements. A city or county may adopt part or a ll of a functional plan such as a regional transportation plan, climate action plan or sustainable community strategy prepared by a special district, regional planning agency, or some other public agency. Although joint adoption of another jurisdiction's plan or elements may be advantageous, a city or county remains solely responsible for the legal adequacy of its general plan. The other jurisdiction's plan and elements or the jointly prepared plan and elements must be sufficiently detailed to address the concerns of the adopting agency and to provide adequate coverage of the issues required in the Government Code. A plan or element that is jointly prepared or adopted from another jurisdiction's general plan has the same legal standing as the rest of the ad opting agency's general plan and internal consistency requirements continue to apply. Similarly, discretionary zoning, subdivision, and capital improvement project decisions must be consistent with the joint plan or element. Despite options such as adoptin g another jurisdiction's general plan or joint adoption between multiple agencies, each adopting agency must retain its sole and independent authority to make amendments to its general plan unless a joint powers agreement has been approved. In Alameda County Land Use Association c. City of Hayw ard (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1716 , the appellate court overturned a mem orandum of understanding (MOU) adopted by Alameda County and the cities of Hayward and Pleasanton to specify general plan goals and policies regarding the \"Ridgelands Area.\" The MOU provided that any amendment to the applicable sections by one jurisdiction would not be effective unless \"parallel amendments\" were approved by the other two. The court held this arrangement to be an impermissible divestment of the police power, restricting the individual agencies' legislative authority to amend their general pl ans. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 28 Chapter 3: Public Engagement and Outreach Designing Healthy, Equitable, Resilient, and Economically Vibrant Places \"Cities (and counties) have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by e verybody.\" --Jane Jacobs Introduction Robust community engagement is a vital component of drafting and updating a general plan. When a general plan is written or amended, state law requires the planning agency to \"provide opportunities for the involvement of citizens, California Native American Indian tribes, public agencies, public utility companies, and civic, education, and other community groups ,\"which may include public agencies, public utility companies, community groups, and others through hearings or other appropriate methods (\u00a765351 )The law also requires that a jurisdiction make a diligent effort to include all economic groups when drafting , adopting and implementing its housing element (\u00a765583 ). For the purposes of this chapter, the term \"update\" will refer to adopting new general plans as well as updating existing ones. By law, cities and counties must hold at least two public hearings before adopting a general plan: one by the plannin g commission and another by the legislative body (either the city council or the board of supervisors) (\u00a765353, 65355 ). However, this minimal numbe r of hearings does not constitute what most planners would consider an adequate public participation program for adopting or updating a general plan. As mentioned throughout the GPG, there is great opportunity to collaborate in innovative ways with differe nt public agencies, private entities, elected officials, and community members. A general plan update affects every aspect of a community and broad participation is important - particularly direct or representative participation of local citizens. Many ent ities have recognized the benefits of strong community engagement to improve local conditions, inform policy, enhance equity, and result in better program outcomes.i Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 29 Creating the opportunity for community dialogue throughout the general plan update - although challenging - can result in a much more informed and widely embraced plan. As stated in Chapter 2, a general plan should start with a community's vision, but community engagement should not stop there. The general plan update must be treated attentivel y throughout the process from the beginning stages of the visioning process to adoption , depending on the scope and extent of the project . A thorough update for an average -sized city is typically at least a year -long endeavor. The nature and intended outcomes during the outreach process will be different depending on the stage of the update: 1. Exploration: The initial stages of outreach allow stakeholders to identify community strengths, assets, priorities for future development, areas for improvement, and start the process of formulating a vision for the future. 2. Collaborative Action: After a general baseline of community goals is established, the next phase allows for collaborative engagement with partners regarding different options for consideration, an d how the policy priorities align to move toward attaining the future vision. 3. Decision Making: During the later stages of an update, various policy priorities have emerged to achieve the intended general plan vision, and it becomes paramount to orient poli cy options into a framework and select priority policies to move forward with the draft plan. This chapter discusses various issues planning departments can consider when designing a public engagement process. It also provides tools and lists resources t o inform the outreach process and ensure community involvement, input, and support for the general plan. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 30 Innovating for Sustainable Communities US Department of Housing and Urban Development Collective Impact is an engagement model that multipl e sectors can use to achieve positive change that is composed of strategies aimed at improving difficult social, economic, and environmental problems. At its core, it recognizes the importa nce of cross -sector collaboration, as well as bringing private, pu blic, and citizen partners together to achieve meaningful outcomes. Core strategies include, \"building a common agenda, creating shared measurement systems, identifying mutually reinforcing activities, promoting continuous communications, and supporting ba ckbone organizations.\" City and county planning departments around the US implemented this strategy at a time of significant fiscal constraint during the economic downturn in 2008 as part of the Partners hip for Sustainable Communities with the Department of Transportation , Housing and Urban Development , and Environmental Protection Agency . Through broad public engagement, co -learning, and leveraging financial resources many lessons resulted and highlighted the power of long -range planning to improve economic resilience, integrate equity into planning, and foster collaboration with new entities - such as health and arts to achieve sustainable communities. A vision at the beginning of the planning process is vital to frame the planning priorities and implementation plan. These lessons are applicable to establishing a vision in a General Plan Update. http://www.frbsf.org/community -development/files/ci_vol26no1 -The-Sustainable -Communities -Initiative.pdf Process Design Designing the outreach process before starting a general plan update is helpful to ensure adequate input from various stakeholders. In addition to any organized participation activities, state law allows the public to attend all meetings of appointed advisory committees, planning commissions, and local legislative bodies, with a few exceptions (Brown Act, \u00a754950, et seq.). Unexpected events can occur during an update, including changes in elected leadership, funding, staff, etc. Having a n outreach plan in place will help keep the pro cess on track. This section provides guidance for developing an outreach plan. Establish an outreach strategy A road map is an important tool to plan public engagement efforts throughout the process. Local jurisdictions vary tremendously throughout Cal ifornia, and engagement strategies will Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 31 also vary based on local circumstances. Local communities should help define the outreach strategy most relevant to their needs. However, there are some issues to consider across planning for all areas. These includ e: Funding available for engagement activities Timeline for activities Expectation -setting for stakeholders Staff time and knowledge and other expertise to conduct outreach and education Communication tools available Process to ensure efforts are transpa rent, accessible, and fun Methods available to capture and record the dialogue Translation services Variety of meeting spaces Some helpful tools in outreach include: Oversight responsibility Assign ing a staff member to oversee and be responsible for the engagement and outreach process will ensure dedicated attention to this important procedural step . Advisory Committee/Board Establishing a diverse advisory board comprised of experts as well as community members to serve as advisors throughout the general plan update can be helpful by providing insight on how to reach multiple populations, addressing potentially controversial issues, understanding sensitive community needs, and representing a greater portion of the community. A manageable size board (<20 people) should include multiple voices from the community General plan a dvisory board members represent the varied interests the public engagement process hopes to capture, and should be drawn from the same communities that general outreach will target. The following categories of advisory board members should be considered : Business leaders and/or representatives from Chambers of Comme rce Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 32 Local agency leaders including water agencies, fire departments, health officers, public works leads, and others Community development and health leaders Representatives and advocates from various income groups, special needs populations and neighborho ods in the jurisdiction Multi-lingual representatives State and/or federal agency leaders if the jurisdiction has a high proportion of public lands Survey of overlapping efforts Multiple public engagement processes may be in process simultaneously. For ins tance, outreach to solicit input on an application for grant funding may occur at the same time as outreach to update the general plan. This can confuse participants, and pose a potential challenge for recruitment and involvement. Additionally, other publ ic or private agencies (for example, Parks and Recreation, Hospitals, Departments of Public Health, Non - Governmental Organizations) may be conducting outreach simultaneously. Increased awareness of ongoing efforts to gain input can help avoid overlapping or conflicting outreach efforts and might even allow outreach sessions to be combined. Scale Outreach for a county general plan is a much larger undertaking than for a city, due to the larger catchment area. Also, stakeholders may have less of a perceive d stake in the process since county general planning is further removed from their local jurisdiction. Relating the importance of participation back to the group and sharing how the information will be incorporated into the planning process can help incre ase participation. Partnership All affected stakeholders should be represented in any public participation process. In a general plan process, this is the entire community. Stakeholder groups in the general plan process may include: Community and neighborh ood groups School districts County Transportation Commissions Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 33 Utility and public service providers o Energy o Water: water supply, wastewater, flood/stormwater districts, IRWM, Sustainable Groundwater Agency, reclamation district, etc. o Telecommunications o Waste Regional groups that can identify synergies with other regional efforts Affordable housing and special needs population representatives and advocates Non-profit and for -profit builders State and federal partners as appropriate Educational institutions Industry and business Civic and community service organizations Non-governmental organizations Religious communities Existing boards and commissions, such as planning boards, parks and recreation, etc. Other public agencies Topical experts: o Groups working on climate change o County Health Departments o Environmental justice groups o Tribal leaders o Innovation or Technology Officers o Local food sources o Agricultural community members Cultural Considerations Cultural differences can be present between and among professi onal groups as well as between and among community members. Reaching out to different professional groups and organizations not traditionally involved in planning occasionally presents its own set of challenges. It is important to account for different int eraction norms, priorities, levels of comfort with professional terminology, and expectations for project completion. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 34 It is important to consider cultural considerations throughout the design of community engagement , including overt differences such as l iteracy level, socioeconomic status, and language , as well as nuanced differences such as local history and cultural norms. Designing a process that is sensitive to all of these considerations can help encourage broader, more equitable and informed partic ipation. To ens ure equitable outreach, the following factors should be considered : Literacy Level: It may be more difficult to reach out to foreign -born community members or groups with a lower level of formal education using written materials. It is imp ortant to design outreach materials and events to accommodate different literacy levels as well as provide background information when necessary if referring to complex concepts. Socioeconomic Status: Lower economic groups are often disproportionately aff ected by environmental hazards, but also face more barriers to participation in community engagement efforts to help remediate them. Factors such as location and accessibility by public transportation, timing of outreach, availability of childcare, and availability of food can affect the ability of groups to attend events. Reviewing demographic data, such as available in the American Community Survey (ACS) , can help identify potential needs of each community. Language : All communication should be done in all of the major2 languages spoken in the community. This includes any advertising and written background materials as well as live translation at key public events . Some documents, such as the draft general plan or the draft environmental impact report associated with the general plan, may be infeasible to translate in their entirety. In such cases, the planning agency should consider translating an executive summary into the major languages spoken in the com munity. Translators should be available at meetings when it is clear that non -English speaking members of the community will be present. Many local 2 The definition of \"major\" varies. Some agencies define a major language as 10% or more of the population speaks the language. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 35 non-profit organizations can provide minimal or low cost translation services for public benefit effort. Age: Aging populations have specific needs and it is important to capture their input in the outreach process. Considering time of day and location of events, as well as ADA access to events and services available at the locations is important in including elderly residents. The needs of young residents must also be considered, including outreach methods such as social media and online platforms, location access and amenities, and innovative tools for discussion at events. Local History: Certain communities may have participated in previous outreach efforts that did not result in change. Over time, either not being included or participating and not feeling like the input was utilized can affect future participation. Understanding the local context is helpfu l prior to beginning outreach. Establishing trust, which also can happen through partnership at the local level, can make the process more likely to foster dialogue. Cultural Norms: California is rich in diversity. Each city and county across the state is comprised of different ethnic groups from around the world. From 1980 -2010, the percentage of people of color , for example, increased from 33.4 percent to 59.8 percent of the population . By 2040, 73.3 percent of the population will be other than Caucasian . Some members come from groups that are not as familiar with democracy, the ability to openly share opinions, are used to different gender roles, or may be fearfu l to have conversations and dialogue recorded. It is hard to learn all of the cultural nuances for each group in the community, but working in partnership with local non -profits or other groups skilled at working across cultures can help ensure all groups are able to participate in a way that is participatory for them. Outreach Structure Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 36 Next Door is an online neighborhood social networking website founded in 2010. It is currently used by 1 in 3 neighborhoods across the US. Established to provide a social media platform for neighbors, it has also been used by city governments to do outreach on community building events, public participation opportunities and public outreach. It is one of many potential online tools to help with a general plan update. Community members and other stakeholders have many competing interests for their time. Allowing different levels and types of involvement into the process can help foste r participation. For example, going to places where people already gather such as a community health or street fair, a cultural event, a public event at a local religious or community center, community event at a local school, etc, might allow attendees to share input without a large time commitment. This is an especially helpful mode of outreach when looking for feedback on specific topics, such as health , equity , and environmental justice . Meeting stakeholders in locations they are familiar and comfortable with can help to bridge cultural and trust gaps. Other more time intensive activities such as focus groups, charettes, and works hops can be available for stakeholders who are interested in providing more in - depth input. The structure of the outreach strategy can also influence the transparency and continued communication throughout the process. Ongoing information sharing can hel p maintain community relationships and build trust in the process especially if culturally appropriate communication methods are used. Web -based communications, for example, may exclude stakeholder groups without regular access to the internet. Data Data and data visualizations can be powerful tools to catalyze community engagement. Some local jurisdictions have used maps with geospatial data and charts to examine transit routes , map community assets and risks , or share health outcome information to allow community members to understand planning in a tangible context. Data presentations should be tailored to their specific audience. For instance, some member s might want to know much more about how the data is collected and specific details. Other stakeholder groups will be more interested in general associations and how the data fits into the process. Missing data must be considered alongside existing data . Including funds in the budget to collect data as the general plan process proceeds will help address identified gaps in data availability. There are also methods to allow local citizens to collect data which can help make engagement more interesting as we ll as provide local data sets. Tools such as walk audits , surveys of Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 37 building types, and community photos help with the visioning process for community improvement while increasing potential participat ion. Considering how this data is valued versus other data sets and sources -such as traditional data purchased from consultants - including how much weight it will carry in the process and how public contributors will be incorporated help ensure improved community data and input. On the horizon As technology has advanced in the private sector, people have become accustomed to using the intern et and their personal cell phones to locate services, buy products, fund a project through crowd sourcing, and share their life on social media. This constant and immediate interaction is changing the cultural norms for level of involvement with business, other community members, and ultimately with government agencies. Groups such as Code for America build o pen source technology to improve access to government services.ii Some places are starting to use personal cell phones to do surveys of local conditions , tweet responses to proposed policy options , or even provide their commentary online for local city council meetings rather than participate in person. These innovations within local government are increasingly common. As more local jurisdictions cr eate Civic Innovation Officer positions to facilitate new ways of interacting with local government, planning departments as well will likely have new opportunities for engagement. As potential methods of engagement increase, jurisdictions should consider possible age and cultural differences in the rate of adoption of new technology and plan accordingly. Engagement Tools There are a wide variety of engagement tools that can be used to inform and engage the community in a public participation process. Tools should be chosen based on the needs, strengths, and resources of the community. By using multiple techniques, a wide range of community residents may be reached . Community members who help develop the general plan will often become champions throughout t he process, helping carry the plan through adoption and implementation. Below are examples of different tools that may be employed . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 38 Web Based Meeting and Engagement Tools Webinars, online conferences, and internet collaboration tools allow for easy, conve nient engagement with the public. People with busy schedules, families, or limited mobility may find participation simpler via web based tools, entering questions or comments based on their own availability. Web based tools range from simple online webinar s or meetings to open forums, documents with commenting capability, and collaborative images for visioning. While some community members may not have access or interest in using online tools, including them in an engagement strategy may increase participat ion. Mailings - emailed or regular mail Mailings can be used to advertise process, request input, or share information. Note that some notices must be mailed (\u00a7 65091, 65092 ). The types of mailing used should be based on the goals sought to accomplish. Mass surveys or opinion mailings work well to broaden the range of participants in the process and can also share information about process scope, timelines, website links, data availability and issues. Newsletters work to keep the public updated on the progress of the process as well. Some communities utilize existing mailing services such as utility bills to reduce costs . Surveys Surveys are most often used in the beginning of a general plan process to help identify community issues and concerns and to identify residents' opinions about the strengths and weaknesses of their community. A survey can help identify issues to be addressed by the general plan and areas where residents would like more information. A good survey includes the public early on in the process, broadens the range of those involved by including residents who do not come to meetings, and publicizes the general plan process. A statistically valid survey, while more difficult to conduct, can b e very persuasive to decisions - makers and the public. Including demographic questions in a survey will help identify any inequities in response rates. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 39 There are a numbe r of methods available to improve access and equity in surveys. Pilot testing the survey instrument with the advisory group or a diverse group of pilot subjects may solicit feedback to improve the form. The survey should be piloted in every language in which it will be ultimately offered, to ensure that translations are conveying the intended information. Whil e this will add time to the process, it may ultimately improve public perception of the data collected. Additionally, soliciting feedback on data int erpretation may be useful before finalizing analysis. Because different interests may interpret the same data in multiple ways, providing an opportunity for discussion, feedback, and suggestions on how to analyze results may provide a stronger sense of tra nsparency and trust in the process. Meeting , Workshops, and Events Well-timed meetings help solicit input and keep participants informed. Meeting types can vary depending on purpose, participants, and a variety of other factors. In addition to regular mee ting structures, project leads can include innovative methods such as story telling, games, and white board/paper activities to capture input. Meeting types include: Public hearings Town hall meetings Open houses Events in non -traditional places, such as f armer's markets, churches, health fairs, school events, and community fairs Panel discussions Neighborhood meetings Civic meetings such as chamber of commerce Focus groups Small in -home meetings Activities Activities are a helpful tool to expand thinking and demonstrate new opportunities and possibilities. For example, engaging in a group walk and conducting a walk audit (where Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 40 local residents physically walk around and collect standardized information about the condition of the built environment) could h ighlight infrastructure and safety needs. Activities can also provide group -learning opportunities and build relationships with community members and planning and consulting staff. Tours Tours to other municipalities can show decision -makers and particip ants examples from other communities and help them visualize ideas for their own community , it is also a good way to experience parts of the city they may be less familiar with . Organized tours of recent or proposed projects within the community may also p rovide a good basis of discussion for decision -makers and participants. Open H ouses Open houses can allow community members to view plan proposals, data, and maps in a casual environment that also allows people to come and go as their schedules allow. Op en houses can be held at a church, school, community center, local business, or other location easily accessible to the public. Planners should be available to talk informally about the planning process with visitors. Translators should be present as avail able. Open houses can be combined with other tools, such as written or visual surveys. Community I mage Surveys (Photo v oice) and Taking pictures Photos can accomplish the same thing as tours but work for larger groups and take less time. These surveys usually consist of pictures of civic buildings, housing, streets, and design elements that participants rate based on what they like and feel would work in their community. Desig n Charrettes Design charrettes are also more interactive and visual. The public can participate with interdisciplinary teams of planners, architects, engineers, and artists or other local citizens. While charrettes are often used for specific plans and in dividual projects, they can also help The visioning process for Downtown Salinas started in December of 2008, through a collaborative public process to develop a consensus plan with the City. Multiple stakeholder and public meetings culminated in a design charette, engaging the community to identify ions in multiple areas, including safety and security, transportation and traffic, and open spa ce. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 41 community members visualize what they want their community to look like. These preferences can then be translated into general plan goals and specifications. For more information on charrettes visit www.charretteinstitute.org/ .

While a general plan will contain the community vision for fu ture growth, California law also requires a general plan to address each of the seven mandated elements listed in Government Code section 65302 to the extent locally relevant. The mandatory elements are land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, and safety. Cities and counties in the San Joaquin Air Pollution Control District must also address air quality in their general pl ans. The purpose of the following sections is to outline the content of each element as required by statute. Relationships Among Elements and Issues Each of the mandatory elements is presented separately in this chapter; however there is no requirement t hat a general plan be organized in seven separate elements. Consideration of local context and innovation is highly recommended in general plan preparation. A jurisdiction may organize its general plan in any format, including consolidated elements, so long as all of the relevant statutory issues are addressed. Gov. Code \u00a7 65301 ; Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692 ). Indeed, the statutory elements call for interrelated content. For example, consideration given in the conservation element to the vegetatio n that supports an endangered wildlife species also involves analyzing topography, weather, fire hazards, availability of water, and density of development in several other elements. The table on the following page illustrates the potential relationships among the seven mandatory elements and the required topics of the general plan. Not Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 43 every general plan will address these issues to the same extent or in the same manner. Cities and counties should design their general plan formats to suit the topographic, geologic, climatologic, political, socioeconomic, cultural, and historical diversities that exist within their communities. Each section in the GPG will also highlight the relationships between the elements individually.

( Sierra Club v. Bo ard of Supervisors of Kern County (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698. )This chapter provides cross -references between and among elements to help identify where statutory requirements overlap and consolidation may occur. Mandatory Element Format The Government Code requires OPR to develop and adopt guidelines for the preparation of and the content of the mandatory elements required in city and county general plans. (See section 65040.2 ). It states that the guidelines shall be advisory to each city and county in order to provide assistance in preparing and maintaining their respective general plans. These General Plan Guidelines present the statutory elements in the order that they appear in section 65302 . This order should not be construed as a ranking of importance, or the order in which a jurisdiction should prepare elements. All elements have equal weight under the law and can be prepared in any order or even combined, as discussed in Chapter 1 . For a glossary of terms and description of parts of a general plan, see appendix F . Water Quality Water Supply Watersheds Waterways/Water Bodies Wildlife Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 47 Land Use Element Introduction The most fundamental decisions in planning begin with land use: what to put where. Land use planning envision s the future of a city or county, and involves interaction with all other elements of planning. At its best, the land use element will reflect the community's vision and promote thoughtful, equitable, and accessible distribution of different land uses, inc luding residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and open s pace, as well as alignment with other general plan elements . It can also be a tool to improve public health , reduce infrastructure costs, enhance local economies and address long -term environmental issues such as climate change and water resources . The land use element can also be a venue to set forth and resolve conflicts and trade-offs in volved in land use decision s. For example, increasing density may result in increased people , but 65302 (a) (a) A land use element that designates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyme nt of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses of land. The location and designation of the extent of the uses of the land for public and private use s shall consider the identification of land and natural resources pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (d). The land use element shall include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various distric ts and other territory covered by the plan. The land use element shall identify and annually review those areas covered by the plan that are subject to flooding identified by flood plain mapping prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Water Resources. The land use element shall also do both of the following: (1) Designate in a land use category that provides for timber production those parcels of real property zoned for timberland production pursuant to the Calif ornia Timberland Productivity Act of 1982 (Chapter 6.7 (commencing with Section 51100) of Part 1 of Division 1 of Title 5). (2) Consider the impact of new growth on military readiness activities carried out on military bases, installations, and operat ing and training areas, when proposing zoning ordinances or designating land uses covered by the general plan for land, or other territory adjacent to military facilities, or underlying designated military aviation routes and airspace. (A) In determini ng the impact of new growth on military readiness activities, information provided by military facilities shall be considered. Cities and counties shall address military impacts based on information from the military and other sources. (B) The followin g definitions govern this paragraph: (i) \"Military readiness activities\" mean all of the following: (I) Training, support, and operations that prepare the men and women of the military for combat. (II) Operation, maintenance, and security of any military installation. (III) Testing of military equipment, vehicles, weapons, and sensors for proper operation or suitability for combat use. (ii) \"Military installation\" means a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Defense as defined in paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of Section 2687 of Title 10 of the United States Code. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 48 also increase s in water supply reliability, avoidance of long term costs of infrastructure maintenance, improved water use efficiency, land conservation, housing and transit options and equ ity. Designating areas for solar development may increase energy independence and generate local economic benefits, but also implicate agricultural lands and alter aesthetic values. Pursuing urban infill may require higher intensity development , directed to a limited number of parcels, some less ideal due to siting location, but allow for more accessible transit and walkability. Identifying and resolving such issues in the land use element can result in development patterns that are predictable, coherent and reflect community values. In this way, t he land use element functions as a guide to planners, the gene ral public, and decision -makers. Its objectives, polic ies, and programs relate directly to the other elements. In practice, it is the most visible and often -used element in the local general plan. Correlations among Elements Circulation Housing Conservation Open Space Noise Safety Land Use Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Required Contents Government Code Section 65302(a) describes the required c ontent of a land use element. Specifically, the land use element must designate the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for: Housing, business, and industry Open space, including agricultural land, watersheds, natural resources, and recreation Recreation facilities and opportunities Educational facilities Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 49 Public buildings and grounds Future solid and liquid waste facilities Timberland Preserve Zone lands Areas subject to flooding, identified b y flood plain mapping prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Water Resources . or mapped flood areas adopted by the local community on Flood Insurance Rate Maps Other categories of public and private uses of land. The land use element must also consider the impact of new growth on military readiness activities carried out on military bases, installations, and operating and training are as, when proposing zoning ordinances or designating land uses covered by the general plan for land, or other territory adjacent to military facilities, or underlying designated military aviation routes and airspace ( \u00a7 65302(a)(2)) . The land use element must also be consistent with airport land use compatibility plans where applicable (\u00a7 65302.3) . For more information on airport land use compatibility and requirements, see the California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook . The land use element should contain a sufficient number of land use categories to conveniently classify the various land uses identified by the plan. Land use categories should be descriptive enough to distingui sh between levels of intensity and allowable uses. The element should include categories reflecting existing land uses as well as projected development. Additionally, the land use element must include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan. The land use element must accommodate specific uses and avoid certain hazards. For example, the land use element must accommodate waterways used in flood ma nagement and groundwater recharge . General plans are currently required to consider the Urban Water Management Plans of water agencies within their jurisdictions. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 50 The land use element must reflect the specific contents from other elements . For example , Section 65302(a) requires that the land use element reflect \" rivers, creeks, streams, flood corridors, riparian habitats, and land that may acc ommodate floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge and stormwater management ,\" as identified in the conservation element. Section 65302(b)(1) requires that the land use element correlate with the circulation element. Section 65302(f) requires that the noise element be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise. For more detailed discussion of th ose requirements , see the discussion of the circulation , conservation and noise element s. In some circumstances, as explained later in this chapter, t he land use element must also identify disadvantaged communities and plan infrastructure in those communities. Density and Intensity California's po pulation continues to grow, and the general plan presents a platform to prepare for future needs. Jurisdictions must p lan to accommodate their fair share of regional housing needs, as determined by their Council of Governments (\u00a765584 ), but should consider other factors in their forecasts and build out scenarios, including population growth and trends, community and regional demographics, jobs/housing mix, economic trends, and infrastructure needs. The Demographic Research Uni t within the California Department of Finance (DOF) prepares annual population estimates for the state and for individual counties and cities. Information on housing units, vacancies, average household size, components of population change, and special po pulations is also available. DOF also forecasts both population and public school enrollment for the state and for each county for 50 years into the future with age, sex, and race/ethnic detail. DOF data are used to comply with various state codes, includi ng the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) process, and for research and planning purposes by federal, state, and local agencies, the academic community, and the private sector. Population density Camp v. County of Mendocino (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334 established that a general plan must contain standards for population density. It did not, however, define such standards. The court in Twain Harte Homeowners Association v. Tuolumne Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 51 County (1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 664 defined population density as the \"numbe rs of people in a given area and not the dwelling units per acre, unless the basis for correlation between the measure of dwelling units per acre and numbers of people is set forth explicitly in the plan.\" Quantifiable standards of population density must be provided for each of the land use categories contained in the plan. Population density standards need not be restricted solely to land use designations with residential development potential. As the court stated in Twain Harte : \"it would not be unreason able to interpret the term \"population density\" as relating not only to residential density, but also to uses of nonresidential land categories and as requiring an analysis of use patterns for all categories . . . it appears sensible to allow local governm ents to determine whether the statement of population standards is to be tied to residency or, more ambitiously, to the daily usage [sic] estimates for each land classification.\" Although applied differently from one jurisdiction to another, population density can best be expressed as the relationship between two factors: the number of dwellings per acre and the number of residents per dwelling. Current estimates of the average number of persons per household are available from the Department of Finance's Demographic Research and Census Data Center . The Camp decision also held that an adequate general plan must contain standards for building intensity. Again, the Twain Harte court has provided the most complete interpretat ion of building intensity available to date. These are its major points: Intensity should be defined for each of the various land use categories in the plan; General use captions such as \"neighborhood commercial\" and \"service industrial\" are insufficient measures of intensity by themselves; Building intensity is not synonymous with population density. Intensity will be dependent upon the local plan's context and may be based upon a combination of variables such as maximum dwelling units per acre, height and size limitations, and use restrictions. Unfortunately, the court stopped short of defining what proper measures of building intensity are. Local general plans must contain quantifiable standards of building intensity for each land use designation. The se standards should define the most intensive use that will be allowed under each designation. While the land use designation identifies the type of allowable uses, the building intensity standard will define the concentration of use. Intensity standards c an include provisions for flexibility such as Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 52 density bonuses, cluster zoning, planned unit developments, and the like. OPR recommends that each intensity standard include these variables: (1) permitted lands uses or building types; and (2) concentration o f use. Permitted uses and building types is a qualitative measure of the uses that will be allowable in each land use designation. The concentration of use can be defined by one or more quantitative measures that relate directly to the amount of physical d evelopment that will be allowed. Maximum dwelling units per acre is a good residential standard , with the actual numbers defined by local jurisdictions. Floor Area Ratio, or FAR (the ratio of building floor area to the total site area) , is a useful measure of commercial and industrial intensity. The dual standard of maximum lot coverage and maximum building height is suitable for agricultural, open -space, and recreational designations where development is being limited. On the other hand, lot size, which ha s been widely used for agricultural and open -space designations, is an inadequate standard of building intensity because although it regulates lot area, it does not quantify the allowable concentration of development on each lot. Statutory Requirements This section offers a general guide to the contents of the land use element. Note that while the focus is on the minimum requirements for an adequate land use element, an effective general plan will focus more extensively on those issues of greatest releva nce to the community. Diagram Requirement Description: The land use element must designate the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of uses of the land , and must contain a d iagram or diagrams (\u00a765302 ). Many types of development policies lend themselves well to graphic treatment, such as the distribution of land uses, urban design, infrastructure, and geologic and other nat ural hazards. A diagram must be consistent with the general plan text (\u00a765300.5) and should have the same long -term planning perspective as the r est of the general plan. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 53 Figure 6: City of Los Angeles Land Use Map Figure 7: City of Los Angeles Circulation Map The text and diagrams in the land use element that address the location and extent of land uses, and the zoning ordinances th at implement these provisions, may also express community intentions regarding urban form and design. These expressions may differentiate neighborhoods, districts, and corridors, provide for a mixture of land uses and housing types within each, and provide specific measures for regulating relationships between buildings, and between buildings and outdoor public areas, including streets ( \u00a7 65302) . Jurisdictions may choose between traditional typologies such as \"mixed use\" or \"residential,\" typologies based on urban form and design such as \" transit Figure 8 : Land Use Map for Napa County Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 54 centers\" or \"new growth areas,\" or use a combination of typologies. The Attorney General has observe d that \"...when the Legislature has used the term 'map,' it has required preciseness, exact location, and detailed boundaries....\" as in the case of the Subdivision Map Act. No such precision is required of a general plan diagram (67 Cal.Ops.Atty.Gen. 75,7 7). As a general rule, a diagram or diagrams, along with the general plan's text, should be detailed enough so that the users of the plan, whether staff, elected and appointed officials, or the public, can reach the same general conclusion on the appropria te use of any parcel of land at a particular phase of a city's or county's physical development. Decision -makers should also be able to use a general plan, including its diagram (s), in coordinating day -to-day land use and infrastructure decisions with the city's or county's future physical development scheme. However, given the long -term nature of a general plan, its diagram (s) and text should be general enough to allow a degree of flexibility in decision -making as times change. For example, a general plan may recognize the need for and desirability of a community park in a proposed residential area, but the precise location of the park may not be known when the plan is adopted. The plan would not need to pinpoint the location, but it should have a generaliz ed diagram along with policies stating that the park site will be selected and appropriate zoning applied at the time the area is subdivided. In this sense, while zoning must be consistent with the general plan, the plan's diagram (s) and the zoning map are not required to be identical. Many communities use a map as the general plan diagram . The land use element should focus on the future growth and physical development of the community while ensuring the provision of adequate infrastructure and services t o existing communities and development permitted by the land use map . Maps are useful for land use designations as well as designating building densities, FARs, and other development goals. The maps in this section demonstrat e some of these varying uses ut ilized by jurisdictions. Mapping proposed land uses will help decision makers and the public understand relationships between different uses. It may also be helpful to include other elements, such as circulation and infrastructure , in the land use map when possible. Including known assets such as roads, transit routes, jo b centers, and service centers can help inform decisions about future land uses and needs . The City of San Diego , for example, created numerous maps overlaying community assets and features such as wastewater facilities, planning area by financing type, and existing and proposed bikeways in addition to their land use and street system map. The City of Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 55 Emeryville used mapping to designate density and intensity in each land use category. The GPG mapping tool can assist communities map layers of data to identify concentrations of need and opportunity, and potential locations for specific types of land use. Directions for how to use the tool are available here. A land use element should contain a sufficient number of land use categories to conveniently classify the various land uses identified by the plan. Land use categories should be descriptive enough to distinguish betwee n levels of intensity and allowable uses. The categories should align with the goals of the general plan. For example, a jurisdiction wanting to promote infill dev elopment and compact growth may consider setting minimum density standards along with traditional maximums. The element should include categories reflecting existing land uses as well as projected development. There need not be an equal number of land us e designations and zoning classifications. In many cases, there may be more than one zone that would be consistent with each land use designation. Land use policies contribute to a framework of plan proposals and implementation programs and in some instanc es provide the basis for requiring exactions and development fees of new projects (for example, parks and recreational facilities under the Quimby Act (\u00a766477 ). The distribution of land use categories which is reflected in the plan diagram must conform to the plans policies. Existing development may not adhere to all of the development policies set forth by the plan, however, new and future developme nt must be in uniform compliance. The land use element requirements provide an opportunity to determine the future of a community. By ensuring thoughtful, equitable, and accessible distribution of different densities, intensities, and land uses, includin g residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and open space, well as alignment with other general plan elements, the land use element can address long term environmental issues such as climate change , enhance local economies , reduce infrastructure costs, improve air quality , increase healthy transportation choices , create community res ilience and promote quality housing for all residents of the community. Housing, Business, and Industry Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 56 Requirement Description: A land use element must designate the general distribution, location and allowable intensi ty of use for housing, business, and industry. To do so, a jurisdiction should: Examin e population data , including Regional and local population and growth forecasts Identify demographic trends (age, income, per sons per household, vehicle ownership rates, etc.), Inventory existing residential, commercial, and industrial land use in the planning area, and Identify key community assets (i.e., a thriving downtown, water fronts and open spaces (particularly those i dentified in the open space and conservation elements) , cultural amenities) that should be enhanced or preserved Identify geographic, fiscal and institutional limitations that may affect the location and type of future growth , such as infrastructure (wate r and energy service, sewage treatment, storm drainage adequacy, fiber optics, etc.) and environmental (flooding, fire hazard, noise, etc.) Consider functional and physical differentiation of land uses -- neighborhoods, districts, corridors, employment cente rs, etc. Analyze existing urban form --blocks, connectivity, building footprints, relationship to street frontages, etc. Analyze properties subject to land use change/development \u2014e.g., vacant, underdeveloped, transit -oriented, etc), including a discussion of the methodology used to identify such properties . Project needs for specific land uses, including watershed and groundwater recharge areas, residential, commercial, and industrial development, based upon estimates of future population, anticipated chang es in environmental conditions such as those resulting from climate change ,3 and economic conditions. 3 The CalAdapt tool (cal -adapt.org) helps communities understand the potential impacts of climate change in their region Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 57 Additionally, t he land use element should consider appropriate methodology for identifying land use designations aligned with general plan goals. . For example, it may designate residential and commercial growth in a series of connected areas, or along existing transit routes, encouraging compact development and a ccess for various populations; or require buffer zones surrounding industrial land and hazardous materials sites. While the land use element is forward looking, it can also provide remedies for past harms. For example, t he California Environmental Protect ion Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has developed Cal EnviroScreen as a screening methodology that can be used to help identify California commu nities that are disproportionately burdened by multiple sources of pollution. In the context of planning for future growth, such data may inform future decisions about whether certain locations are appropriate for additional commercial and industrial faci lities. The land use element can address environmental justice through careful consideration of the compatibility of certain land uses (see Chapter 6 for more information on Equity and Environmental Justice). Additi onally, the element should provide for the equitable distribution of services, opportunities, and resources particularly in communities that are the most in need. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Intent of analy sis Recommended Data Location needs for community assets Population density (US Census) Assessment of capacity and availability of infrastructure necessary to support proposed land uses Transportation routes and schedules, utility maps, broadband maps Potential gaps in services Types of businesses geographically Support mixed use Diversity of functional zoning Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 58 communities and vibrant places supportive of recreation, retail, and housing Open Space, including Agricultural Land, Natural Resources, an d Recreation Requirement Description: A land use element must provide for the general location and distribution of \"open space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty \" (Cal Gov. Code \u00a7 65302(a) ). Determining policies and locations for open space in the land use element may help create a foundation to build detailed policies in the conservation and open space element, or connect to themes including economic development climate change , or healthy communities , for general plans not organized by elements. An open space element should inventory existing open space, and identify public land for future open space, as designated in the land use diagram . This may include designation of parks, greenways, forests, community gardens, and other open space categories identified by the community. For cities and counties with agricultural lands, c onsideration of agricultural lands specifically in a broader la nd use context may help determine better policies to achieve their goals. In addition to their value as an economic driver, agricultural lands can help cities and counties preserve open space lands' aesthetic qualities, maintain physical separation between urban areas, and preserve biological resources. However , some of the most valuable agricultural lands are located closest to growing cities and are thus at highest risk for Statewide policies favo r preservation of open space. For example, Section 65561 of the Government Code states: (a) That the preservation of open -space land ... is necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of the state, but also for the assurance of the continued avai lability of land for the production of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of scenic beauty, for recreation and for the use of natural resources. (b) That discouraging premature and unnecessary conversion of open-space land to urban uses is a matter of publ ic interest and will be of benefit to urban dwellers because it will discourage noncontiguous development patterns which unnecessarily increase the costs of community services to community residents. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 59 conversion. Without appropriate land use planning and policies that encourage conservation, many of these spaces may be permanently lost. The land use element policies and maps must be consistent with the conservation and open space element , both of which contain more specific requirements . Those more specific requirements are described further in the discussions of the open space and conservation elements.

Gov. Code \u00a7 65302(a) ). Educational facilities may include not just district -run facilities, but also c harter schools, private schools, parochial schools, preschools, closed and surplus school properties, career colleges, higher education satellite ca mpuses, home school centers, independent study centers, adult education and Regional Occupational Programs . Land use may affect school functions; by inhibiting or facilitating safe routes to schools, for example. Similarly, the placement of schools withi n a community may influence circulation patterns and where people choose to live. School siting should consider regional growth characteristics and changes in demographics and density as state and local laws change to prioritize more resource efficient dev elopment patterns. Additionally, school districts and communities should consider climate related risks, such as flooding, fire, and other hazards, in the planning of facilities. Ensuring that school districts participate in the planning process, through o utreach, engagement, and coordination to the extent possible, can benefit the community and reduce potential future issues , and may help ensure alignment between city, county, and district goals. Although school districts are required to comply with city/c ounty zoning ordinances if the city/county has an adopted general plan and the ordinances make provision for the location of public schools, school district governing boards that have complied with notification requirements may, by a two -thirds vote, rende r a city/county zoning ordinance inapplicable to a proposed use of property by the school dist ricts for classroom facilities (Gov. Code 53094 ) (Pursuant to Attorney General Opinion No. 99 -401, \"even though such use would not be in conformity with the general plan\") . Early coordination between school districts and planners can help improve outcomes for all. Although land use approvals are controlle d by cities and counties, and school siting is controlled by local school districts , consultation between those entities is required at several points in the planning process: Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 61 Before adopting a general plan, a local government must solicit input from af fected school districts. (Gov. Code \u00a7 65352(a)(2). ) Before completing any long -range plans that contemplate school site acquisition, a school district must notify local government planning agencies, and must participate in a meeting if requested. ( Gov. Code \u00a7 65352.2. ) Before the acquisition of property for facilities, school districts must consult with the plann ing agency of local governments . (Gov. Code \u00a7 65402. ) The governing board of each school district before acquiring title to property for a new school site or an additional to a present site, shall give the planning commission having jurisdiction notice in writing... The planning commission shall investigate the proposed site... ( Public Resources Code 21151.2 ) The governing board of any school district shall meet with appropriate local government recreation and park authorities to review all possible methods of coordination planning des ign and construction of new schools, school sites and additions ( Ed. Code 35277 ) In addition to these general consultation requirements, schools districts must consult with local governments under certain specific circumstances. For example, if a school district will accept state funding for acquisition of a school site t hat is designated in a local general plan for agricultural uses, the district must consult w ith the local government. ( Ed. Code \u00a7 17215.5. ) Consultation between local governments and school districts at these various points in the planning process m ay resolve conflicts before they arise and provide a more efficient process. Useful consultation topics may include : California Code of Regulations, Title V, \u00a714001, Minimu m Standards: Educational facilities planned by school districts shall be: a) Evolved from a statement of educational program requirements which reflects the school district's educational goals and objectives b) Master -planned to provide for maximum site enrollme nt c) Located on a site which meets California Department of Education standards as specified in Section 14010 d) Designed for the environmental comfort and work efficiency of the occupants e) Designed to require a practical minimum of maintenance f) Designed to meet federal, state, and local statuary requirements for structure, fire, and public safety g) Designed and engineered with flexibility to accommodate future needs Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 62 District master plans and the acreage necessary to build a school, as well as other location factors. the ability of potential school sites to be accessed by pedestrian parents and students the potential impacts on schools of agricultural operations , industry, waste facilities, or other polluting land uses the potential for s chools to function as hubs for community and other activities during non -school hours and the joint use of parks and other facilities SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of analysis Recommended Data Proximity of scho ols to housing and transportation Transit, bike, and pedestrian facilities maps, overlayed with housing and demographic maps Potential joint use programs between schools and communities Community demographics, existing resources and assets Density of fast food outlets within \u00bd mile of schools (most relevant for high schools with open campuses).

Gov. Code \u00a7 65302(a) ). Such \"public buildings and grounds\" may include community centers, libraries, and clinics. New or enhanced public facilities can catalyze other planned development and redevelopment of existing areas. Additionally , thoughtful distribution of public buildings can help ensure equitable access to public resources and services throughout the community. Consideration should be given to housing and transportation access surrounding proposed public buildings, as well as preservation of access to existing buildings and grounds. Depicting planned future public facilities on the general plan diagram may help align these uses with other community assets and needs. An inventory of public buildings and grounds will help asses s the distribution of public facilities across the community and identify underserved areas. The land use element should also assess the need for additional facilities based upon existing need for additional services and projected increases in land use in tensity and population. An inventory of public and private historical landmarks (pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 5020 , and following) and existing publ ic surplus land and disposition (pursuant to Gov Section 54220 , and following, and Gov Section 25539.4 ) should also be included.

Achieving that goal will require the recycling, composting, or source -reduction of an additional 23. 5 million tons of recyclables annually, which could add more than 100,000 new full -time and part -time jobs in manufacturing and collection/processing industries. To redirect that much organic material by 2020 will require major efforts on many fronts. This will include the expansion or siting of many facilities to accommodate higher recycling volumes. It will also require stronger markets for recycled materials, ideally within our state, and in fact within regions of our state to make those markets sustain able and responsive to local needs and opportunities. It will also demand successful implementation of other policies such as increased commercial recycling as mandated by AB 1826. And, it will call for even greater participation in recycling behaviors by the general public. As local agencies work to meet the state's goal of diverting 75 percent of California's waste from disposal in landfills by 2020, they are turning to innovative technologies like anaerobic digestion to convert waste into energy as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. Local jurisdictions that have anaerobic digestion projects in their communities have seen a number of benefits including landfill disposal cost savings, the ability to meet greenhouse g as reduction goals and state waste diversion goals and requirements, increased community pride and recognition of their role as an environmental leader. When considering an anaerobic digestion facility, communities have the option to produce electricity or natural gas with heat as a co -product. Electricity can be used to power the facility or exported to the electrical grid. Natural gas can be used to fuel natural gas vehicles, including solid waste and recycling trucks, delivery trucks, passenger vehicles and buses. Either energy choice will generate a revenue stream which can help offset the costs of building an operating the facility. The Sacramento BioDigester started in 2012 with the capacity to process 10,000 tons of food waste per year and was expanded to four times that size in early 2015. The 40,000 ton input capacity includes food waste from area restaurants, food processors, hospitals, international airport, elementary s chools and supermarkets. The 730,000 gallons of biofuel produced annually are used at an onsite fueling station to fuel all of the natural gas trucks of the local trash and recycling collect ion fleet (24 of 55 trucks), as well as a portion of the city's an d county's waste fleets, security cars, California State University Sacramento commuter buses (6 buses), two local catering companies and local school buses (exclusive contract with Sacramento School District's 6 -12 buses, backup provider for Elk Grove's 6 -12 buses). The waste gas (not clean enough to use for transportation fuel) is used to produce one million kilowatts of electricity which powers both the facility and the fueling station. The digestate is used to produce eight million gallons of organic so ils and fertilizers for Sacramento area farms Alameda County adopted its Community Climate Action Plan in February of 2014. It includes a Waste Action Area that Area is responsible for a pproximately 2,510 MT CO2 e/yr and builds off the County's already exemplary waste management programs by establishing a target of diverting 90 percent of all waste from landfills by 2030 with an interim goal of 82.5 percent b y 2020. To achieve this, they have outlined measures and strategies that include mandatory household and commercial food waste recycling and a corresponding outreach and education program. The Alameda County Waste Management Authority/Source Reduction and Reduction Board, also known as StopWaste.Org , is a Joint Powers Authority in Alameda County. Its members include the county, the fourteen cities in the county and two special districts that provide solid waste and recycling services. Its education activities to encourage businesses to recycle include technical assistance for waste prevention and recycling, targeted outreach and assistance to large businesses, online resources and assistance for smaller businesses, g rants to businesses, and a high profile recognition program for businesses that recycle. Requirement Description: The land use element must plan for the use of land for \" solid and liquid waste disposal Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 65 facilities \" (Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7 65302(a) ). Plans should consider an inventory of existing solid and liquid waste dispos al facilities, as well as recycling and composting facilities, correlated with the County Integrated Waste Management Plan and the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan . Based upon projected land use s and population growth , as well as potential opportunities to reduce waste streams, the land use element should consider the potential need for additional facilities. Recycling organic materials, pursuant to AB 341 , AB 1826, the AB 32 Scoping Plan , and local requirements , through composting, mulching, and anaerobic digestion can p roduce renewable energy and fuel, reduce GHG emissions, and reduce waste put in to landfills by over 30% statewide . As organic material recycling programs are implemen ted locally, consideration should be given in the general plan to infrastructure needed to support increased diversion of organics from landfills; including the location of new facilities, the possibilities and needs of upgrading existing facilities to accommodate organic material specifically' or creating new curbside collection requirements incorporating food scraps with yard waste. These issues may also be addressed in the County Climate Action Plan. If relevant, cities and counties should consult with special districts and utilities providers to ensure the proposed land use plan is supported with adequate facilities. In addition, the potential impacts of solid and liquid waste facilities, waste -to-energy plants, and similar facilities on surroundi ng land uses should be considered. Generally, schools, hospitals, residences and other potentially sensitive receptors should not be located near facilities which could have toxic air, land, or water quality impacts or other effects which have a negative health impact s. If designating new areas in the land use plan for waste facilities, the city or county should carefully consider whether surrounding areas are already burdened by existing pollutant burdens.

One of those requirements is to \" identify and annually review those areas covered by the plan t hat are subject to flooding identified by flood plain mapping prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Water Resources \" (Gov. Code \u00a7 65302(a) ). Careful land use planning, fully informed by applicable flood information and management practices , can effectively reduce vulnerabil ity to potential flood damage in cities and counties . This can include non -structural flood protection measures, low impact development, and improved stormwater management practices. Federal, State, and local agencies may construct and operate flood protec tion facilities to reduce flood risks, but some amount of risk will remain for those residing in floodplains. Therefore, increasing awareness can help ensure Californians recognize the potential threat and are better prepared to implement flood management activities. Assembly Bill 162 (AB 162) requires additional consideration of flood risk in local land use planning throughout California and named the Department of Water Resources (DWR ) as a source for floodplain information and technical data for local governments . The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) considers the connections between groundwater management, land use, and flood management, and allows local agencies to customize plans to their regional needs. The Department of Water Resources created the Implementing California Flood Legislation into Local Land Use Planning: A Handbook for Local Communities and the Guidance on General Plan Amendments for Addressing Flood Risk to provide assistance and Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 67 recommendations for local governments complying with the 2007 flood legislation , and created the sustainable groundwater management toolbox to assist with the SGMA. Local jurisdiction s must assess floodplain mapping, groundwater recharge, and stormwater management information and determin e any needed changes in the general plan. If the new data exists, then the existing general plan's background information, maps, goals, policies, implementa tion measure s, and land use map may need to be updated . As flood risk may change over time, cities and counties should establish policies for land use that are consistent with evolving flood risks. The land use element policies addressing flooding should also be cons istent with additional flood control policies required in the conservation and safety element s, as well as any policies related to climate chan ge, and should consider the potential for groundwater recharge benefits for the water supply.

Under the Z'berg -Warren -Keene Forest Taxation Reform Act of 1976, landowners may dedicate their land to timber growing for a ten-year period in exchange for tax benefits. Timber Production Zones (TPZ) (also k nown as timber preserve zones), are restricted in use to the production of timber or compatible use and automatically renewed every ten years unless otherwise terminated. These acres of TPZ form the State's long -term produ ction of privately owned forestland base. TPZs values are assessed annually within three general forest types (youth -grown redwoods, whitewoods (douglas -fir), and ponderosa pine and mixed conifers) by the State Board of Equalization (SBE) and receive a gra de based on their ability to produce wood. As population increases, encroaching development threatens timberland production zones. The s tate discourage s the expansion of urban services and \" premature or unnecessary conversion of timberland to urban and o ther uses \"(Gov. Code \u00a7 51102 ). Ensuring the continual growing and harvesting of timber is important to \"ensure the long -term productivity of the fo rest resource, the long -term economic viability of the forest products industry, and long -term stability of local resource -based economies\" (Gov. Co de \u00a7 51101 ). Therefore, the land use element regarding TPZ should support and remain consistent with policy objectives in the conservation and open space elements.

Specifically, California Government Cod e Section 65302 (a) (2) requires consideration of impacts of land use decisions to the military's operations in local government's planning process. The law states that the land use element of the General Plan: \"shall consider the impact of new growth on m ilitary readiness activities carried out on military bases, installations, and operation and training areas, when proposing zoning ordinances or designating land uses covered by the general plan for land, or other territory adjacent to military facilities, or underlying designated military aviation routes and airspace.\" To further collaboration between the military and local jurisdictions and to prevent land use conflicts with military installations and training activities, California law created a notifica tion process to inform the military of local land use proposals that might have an impact on military facilities and operations. The law requires that local governments: 1) revise their development permit application forms so that they identify proposed pr ojects within 1,000 feet of a military installation, beneath a low -level flight path, or within special use airspace and 2) notify the military when a proposed project, or an updated or revised general plan, might have an impact on military facilities and operations. The California Military Land Use Compatibility Analyst (CMLUCA) can help identify where military operations are in relation to cities and counties. CMLUCA can also generate a report to notify the military when there is a project proposed under military airspace. Local military activity or Department of Defense Service points of contact can provide specific information ab out military installat ions and training areas within your County or City. It is important to check with the military points of contact to discuss the particular military Military Compatibility Planning Resources For more information on military compatibility issues, please see OPR's California Advisory Handbook for Community and Military Compatibility Planning and the Community and Military Compatibility Planning: Supplement to the General Plan G uidelines . Military staff are available to work with local governments on military compatible land use planning. For more information, and a memo on Gov.

In the case of areas with low -level flight paths, it is particularly important to coordinate with the branch points of contact. OPR maintains a list of military branch points of contact, here. Each City and County should implement a process to identify, coordinate and assist in resolving potential land use conflicts within nearby military training areas or under military Special Use Airspace to ensure that new development is compatible with military operations and safeguard mission training and testing requirements. New development should be reviewed and regulated to avoid impact to MOAs and maintain public safety. The General Plan Guidelines Mapping tool and the CMLUCA both can help map locations of military operations.

These communities range from remote settlements throughout the state to neighborhoods that have been surrounded by, but are not part of, California's fast -growing cities. This lack of investment threatens residents' health and safety and fosters economic, social, and education inequality. Moreover, when this lack of attention and resources becomes standard practice, it can create a matrix of barriers that is difficult to overcome . The purpose of SB 244 is to begin to address the complex legal, financial, and political barriers that contribute to regional inequity and infrastructure deficits within disadvantaged unincorporated communities. Including these com munities in the long range planning of a city or county, as required by SB 244, will result in a more efficient delivery system of services and infrastructure including but not limited to sewer, water, and structural fire protection. In turn, investment in these services and infrastructure will result in the enhancement and protection of Planning for Disadvantaged Unincorporated Communities (Gov. Code Section 65302.10 ) (b) On or before the due date for the next adoption of its housing element pu rsuant to Section 65588, each city or county shall review and update the land use element of its general plan to include all of the following: (1) In the case of a city, an identification of each unincorporated island or fringe community within the city's sphere of influence. In the case of a county, an identification of each legacy community within the boundaries of the county, but not including any area within the sphere of influence of any city. This identification shall include a description of the comm unity and a map designating its location. (2) For each identified community, an analysis of water, wastewater, stormwater drainage, and structural fire protection needs or deficiencies. (3) An analysis, based on then existing available data, of benefit assessment districts or other financing alternatives that could make the extension of services to identified communities financially feasible. (c) On or before the due date for each subsequent revision of its housing element pursuant to Section 65588, each ci ty and county shall review, and if necessary amend, its general plan to update the analysis required by this section. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 72 public health and safety for these communities. The land use element must identify certain disadvantaged unincorporated communities within the city or county sphere of infl uence. The identification must include a description of the community and a map illustrating its location. Under general plan law , a community is defined as an inhabited area within a city or county that is comprised of no less than 10 dwellings adjacent or in close proximity to one another. ( (Gov. Code Section 65302.10 (a)(1) ). A \"disadvantaged community\" is defined as a community with an annual median household income that is less than 80 percent of the statewide annual median household income (ID at sub. (a)(2).)4 Cities must identify \" island communities;\" any inhabited and unincorporated territories that are surrounded or substantially surrounded by one or more cities or by one or more cities and a county boundary or the Pacific Ocean; and \"fringe communities;\" any inhabited and unincor porated territories that are within a city's sphere of influence. Counties must identify \"legacy communities;\" any geographically isolated communities that are inhabited and have existed for at least 50 years. Certain terms within these definitions can be interpreted differently based on local context. For example, terms such as \"substantially surrounded\" or \"close proximity\" can differ greatly between rural and urban communities. 4 Cities and counties should note, however, that the definition of \"disadvantaged unincorporated communities\" used by LAFCos (see Gov. Code 56033.5) may be different than the definition used by local governments. For LAFCos, a disadvantaged unincorporated community means inhabited territory, as defined by Gov. Code Sec tion 56046, or as determined by commission policy, that constitutes all or a portion of a disadvantaged community. (Gov. Code Section 56033.5). The difference between the definition of disadvantaged unincorporated community in the local government context and disadvantaged unincorporated community in the LAFCo context lies in the phrase \"inhabited territory\", which is defined in Gov. Code Section 56046 as 12 or more registered voters. The commission may also determine its own policy, which could rely on ot her definitions that more closely align with the community definition used by local governments rather than citizenship status. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 73 Cities and counties should not rely solely on their LAFCos' definitions of \"disadvantaged unincorporated communities,\" or on lists of disadvantaged unincorporated communities compiled by a LAFCo, but instead are required to do their own independent identification of all communities that meet the definition given above. Cities an d counties may also consult with other agencies, organizations and reports which have identified unincorporated communities to guide identification and methodologies that lead to identification of communities. As part of the disadvantaged communities' a nalysis, the land use element must analyze the water, water supply, wastewater, stormwater drainage, and structural fire protection needs or deficiencies for each community through a lens of the horizon year and the impacts of a changing climate . This analysis should be consistent with the descriptions and planning for utilities in the circulation element and the fire and flood protection policies in the safety element. LAFCO municipal service reviews can be helpful in supporting this analysis. The analysis must also review the use of benefit assessment districts or other financing alternatives that could make the extension of services to identifi ed communities financially feasible. Each time the housing element is updated; the analysis for these communities must be reviewed, and if necessary, updated. For more info rmation , please see OPR's Senate Bill 244: land Use, General Plans, and Disadvantaged Communities Technical Advisory. Cities and counties should perform the disadvantaged communities analysis asking these questions: Type of Infrastruct ure Existing Infrastructure: What is serving the community now? What is the need for additional infrastructure? How can finance mechanisms meet the need? Which other programs and policies could address the infrastructure deficiency? What is the community' s input? Required (GC 65302.10) Water Wastewater Stormwater Drainage Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 74 Structural Fire Protection Potential Additional Services Police Protection Sidewalks Lighting Libraries, Schools, Community Centers , etc. Alleys and other unsafe roadways Public transit/ transportation The land use element should be updated to include the disadvantaged communities ' analysis, as required by Gov. Code section 65302.10 . Since all elements of a general plan must be internally consistent, the safety, circulation elements, and other elements as necessary, should be r eviewed to ensure consistency (Gov. Code section 65300.5 ). The land use element should consider where th ere may be opportunities to provide more efficient, high quality service through consolidation, extension of services, and other regional solutions to address inadequacy of services and infrastructure. Expansive land use patterns use more water per capita and create higher vulnerability to climate change. The land use element should consider the effect of development patterns on water use and the potential costs of infrastructure to deliver water.

Land use decisions near or adjacent to high volume roadways (100,000 vehicles per day or a rural roadway as 50,000 vehicles)5 often present conflicts among economic , health , and environmental benefits from the development and the potential health impacts of vehicle emissions on nearby residents, businesses, schools, and other uses. Red ucing exposure to pollution from near -roadway land use requires coordination and attention in several required general plan elements, including land use, housing , and circulation , as well as optional elements such as air quality and health . Infill devel opment along primary transportation corridors can promote multiple policy objectives (e.g., good access to destinations, low VMT, environmental benefits, heath benefit s, economic benefits, fiscal savings for governments, and transportation cost savings for citizens), but it may also involve residential and commercial development adjacent to high-volume roadways and elevat ed levels of air pollution or air toxics. Studies show that exposure to traffic pollution is associated with health issues including worsening of asthma and other respiratory health impacts. The Air Qua lity and Land use Handbook: A Community Health Perspective guide , published in 2005, provided a discussion of potential considerations for the general plan. State law restricts siting of new schools within 500 feet of a freeway.6 The guide also recommend ed a buffer of 500 feet for additional sensitive uses such as daycare centers, housing, playgrounds, and medical facilities. However, a buffer is not always possible with limited parcels for development, or where a buffer eliminates key locations for trans it-oriented and other travel -efficient development. Fortunately, in the last 5 A freeway is defined as an urban roadway with 100,000 vehicles per day or a rural roadway as 50,000 vehicles with some excepti ons.

Even as these policies are realized, there is a need for local governments to consider other options to protect sensitive populations from near -roadway pollution exposure and to reduce the health impacts associated with living or w orking near busy roadways. Deciding where to site a project is not a simple task. The pollutant levels and air quality near a freeway can vary significantly based on air -flow patterns, temperature, time of day, season, presence of sound barriers, vegetatio n, height of structures and other variables. The variation of near -roadway pollution levels means that development plans must consider reducing both peak and long -term pollution exposures. Cross -sector discussion and analysis are of utmost importance to determine adequate sites for future development and balance multiple policy objectives. Researchers have begun to evaluate measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate air pollution exposure near roadways. Simultaneously, new research shows health benefits f rom reducing GHGs; improving housing stock; preserving agricultural spaces, habitats, and recreational spaces; and engaging in the active transportation and mass transit made possible through infill development. A comprehensive discussion around strategies that can be implemented during the general plan update to avoid the need for mitigation and strategies to reduce pollution exposure 7 http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/apr/reports/January -2011 -aqiprogram -report.pdf Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 77 through near roadway land use has the potential to improve air quality and reduce exposure to toxics. Furthermore, a holist ic examination allows for weighing benefits related to equity, health, economics, resource protection, and overall sustainability goals. The Atlanta, Georgia Summer Olympic games of 1996 provides an example of a holistic approach to improve air quality th rough temporary mitigation strategies. Recognizing there would be an influx of people, Atlanta implemented a suite of policies to accommodate the additional visitors in a clean and travel efficient manner. These included a 24 -hour public transit system, additional buses, modified work place policies such as telecommuting, and even adjustments to delivery schedules. Researchers were able to evaluate the impact of these short -term policies and showed decreased ozone, traffic counts, and acute care asthma v isits.iii Although they pursued temporary measures, it is reflective of what a more comprehensive suite of policy objectives could achieve through mode shift from car dependency to alternative forms of transit. Just as in the Atlanta example, the suite of strategies considered to address near roadway land use must be evaluated in the local context. Potential strategies to address near - roadway land use are identified below. Additionally, strategies listed include those designed to reduce exposure to polluti on when pollution exposure is an issue. The measures to reduce exposure to pollution are based on a review of the literature being conducted by the Air Resources Board. Potential Strategies to avoid and reduce pollution exposure near roadways Process str ategies are aimed at identifying and thereby avoiding - if possible -near land use exposure to air pollution. Process Strategies Consult with regional air district during early stages of the general plan update when prioritizing areas for infill developmen t to identify stationary and mobile sources of toxic air contaminants Consult with regional air district, community, and other stakeholders during identification of potential infill sites and create an inventory Engage with local community members early in the general plan update process to discuss vision, local priorities, and concerns Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 78 Engage with local community groups working on related issues early in the general plan update Incorporate air pollution reduction goals and exposure reduction goals into th e general plan language Prioritize discussion of policy goals that have the potential to reduce emissions overall to be incorporated into the general plan policy language Prioritize discussion of policy goals that support mode shift from single occupancy vehicles to transit and/or active transit to be incorporated into the general plan policy language Pollution Reduction Strategies With respect to the specific problem of near roadway pollutant exposure, avoiding the need for mitigation is, of course, ideal . That is not always possible, and potential infill development sites near a high volume roadway may yield an array of benefits, which should be evaluated together with drawbacks associated with near roadway pollution.8 Additionally, many communities alrea dy have sensitive land uses near roadways that cannot be easily relocated, and so need mitigation strategies to reduce health impacts. Research over the last decade has identified mitigation strategies that reduce pollution concentrations, emissions, or improve air flow. Site -specific issues should be carefully considered as local jurisdictions, in conjunction with their regional air district, assess and select mitigation strategies. Also, as illustrated by the 1996 Atlanta games example, a combination of mitigation strategies often can have a greater impact than implementing one stand -alone measure. Pollutant Removal Indoor High Efficiency Filtration Studies show that particle filtration systems and devices, specifically high -efficiency filtration with mec hanical ventilation or portable high efficiency air cleaners, can be highly effective for reducing indoor pollution concentrations. High efficiency filters in ventilation systems, for 8http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/newsrelease.php?id=7 58&utm_content=buffer2b867&utm_medium=social&utm _source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 79 example, can remove from 50 -99% of particles in the air. However, resear ch shows that filtration technologies for gaseous pollutants (volatile organic compounds, or VOCs) are variable in their effectiveness; some remove certain VOCs well, but not others. Appropriate Context and Other Considerations: State building codes requ ire both new commercial and residential buildings to have mechanical ventilation with at least low to medium efficiency filtration. State regulation requires that mechanical systems in all workplaces (commercial buildings) be operated as designed to provid e the required amounts of outdoor air exchange during periods of occupancy. Studies show that new high efficiency filter technologies produce less airflow resistance than in the past. Particulate matter pollution is typically of greatest concern and poses the highest risk, but if VOCs are a concern at a specific site, planners should consider additional mitigation methods or consult with filtration experts. Planners should also be aware of current state and local building codes and their respective air filt ration requirements. Like other building systems, regular maintenance is necessary for highest filter and ventilation efficiency, and is required by regulation in commercial buildings. Possible Co -Benefits: Filtration can also mean cleaner buildings wi th less dust and soot build -up on the interior. Some studies have shown improved employee health and reduced absences with reduced exposure to pollution. Indoor filtration is among a very small number of mitigations that can be implemented in existing buildings. Possible Drawbacks: The cost of upgrading to high efficiency filtration in new construction is usually incremental and reasonable, but retrofit costs may be a limiting factor in some existing developments or buildings. Where retrofit costs are prohibitive, portable filtration devices should be considered. Like other mitigation measures, the effectiveness of indoor filtration systems depends on a variety of factors, many of which may be outside of the control of local and regional planners. For exam ple, opening of windows and inadequate filter upkeep (e.g., cleaning and/or replacement) can reduce filtration benefits. Additionally, there are tradeoffs between HVAC energy efficiency and filtration quality. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 80 Roadside Features Vegetation for Pollutant Fi ltration and Dispersion Studies show that vegetation can alter pollutant transport and dispersion. In some studies, specific locations and conditions translated to air quality benefits, though it should be noted that most studies have been conducted on the East Coast and in Europe where vegetation types and densities differ from what is found in California. Also, some of the studies involved modeling rather than actual measurements. Planners should be attuned to new research over the next few years. Appropriate Context and Other Considerations: The role of vegetative barriers is still under study, and it is uncertain how effective this strategy can be in urban settings in California. Planners should select low -VOC emitting species and consider watering n eeds, allergen impacts, and site -specific context before installing vegetation. Online tools are available to assist with this selection process, including SelecTree , developed by CA L FIRE and USDA Forest Ser vice. Arborists and foresters can also assist in selecting the right species and installation setting and configuration. Because pollution reductions have not yet been quantified in California, it is recommended that this strategy be used in conjunction wi th others, like solid barriers. Possible Co -Benefits: Expanding the tree canopy may mitigate the urban heat island effect, leading to indirect air quality benefits and energy savings. Additionally, urban greenery can encourage outdoor activity, and impro ve the street aesthetic. Possible Drawbacks: findings from some studies suggest that planting trees in urban environments can inhibit ventilation. Solid Barriers and Sound Walls Measurement and modeling studies consistently find that solid barriers redu ce near -road downwind concentrations by increasing vertical dispersion of pollutants emitted by vehicles. The magnitude of the reduction and its spatial extent depend on the height of the barrier, the width of the road, and micrometeorology. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 81 Appropriat e Context and Other Considerations: Solid barriers should only be considered for installation along freeways, which already act as barriers in the urban environment, and are not recommended for other urban environments, where they might add new barriers, w orsen sight -lines, and cause blight Possible Co -Benefits: Barriers used for other purposes, like sound walls, may have the added benefit of mitigating near -roadway pollution, and vice versa. Possible Drawbacks: There is limited evidence that the pollut ant plume is lofted vertically up and over the barrier and returns to ground levels at some distance from the barrier at concentration levels greater in those locations than a non -barrier case. Also some studies show that barriers may increase concentratio ns on the roadway side of barriers, so this should be considered for in -vehicle pollution exposure. Solid barriers can have negative impacts on community connectivity and can actually increase vehicle miles traveled if site -specific conditions and context are not considered, particularly if they are applied in non -freeway settings. Initial research suggests that gaps in roadside barriers may lead to higher localized pollutant concentrations at and immediately beyond the gaps. Urban Design Building Design th at Promotes Ventilation along Street Corridors The physical layout of urban streetscapes influences air flow and pollution movement. High volume roadways (100,000 AADT or greater) lined with tall buildings (over five stories), can lead to pollutant buildup between the buildings. Variations in building height, or gaps between buildings, can allow ventilation and help disperse pollutants. Research studies show that street corridors characterized by buildings with varying shapes and heights building fa\u00e7ade a rticulations, and spaces that encourage air flow (e.g., plazas or parks) benefit from better pollutant dispersion and air quality. Where such design can be accomplished without decreasing overall building density (and thereby increasing overall vehicle tr avel), pollutant exposure may be reduced. Appropriate Context and Other Considerations: Planners should consider complete streets designs for urban roadways as a way to improve ventilation. Wider sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and other pedestrian -oriented features create space for Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 82 better air flow and pollutant dispersion. If planners intend to site new parks, consider siting open space facilities with low volume such as trails and reserves, rather than playgrounds or re creation fields close to heavy traffic or other emission sources. Lastly, this mitigation measure should be considered in the context of the overall need to increase developmental density while also providing important health benefits. Possible Co -Benefi ts: Promoting ventilation can help support the preservation and siting of parks and employing complete streets as a mechanism will also facilitate active transportation, leading to additional health benefits. Complete Streets and parks have also been demon strated to increase property values and promote business viability. Possible Drawbacks: In cases where this measure would cause building intensity to decrease, leading to more disperse overall development, more vehicle travel will generally result, unde rmining benefits. In these cases, it could also inhibit economic development and neighborhood vibrancy. For this reason, this strategy is only recommended when it can be achieved without reducing overall corridor density. Space or other uses separating freeways from sensitive land uses Studies show that pollutant concentrations drop off rapidly with increasing distance from high volume roadways (100,000 AADT or greater) during the daytime. The rate of drop -off with distance at night and in the early mor ning is much more gradual, so pollutant concentrations tend to be higher at these times. Other studies also show that development density is associated with VMT reduction and health benefits, and some areas near high volume roadways are key locations for u rban development. Appropriate Context and Other Considerations: The ARB Land Use Handbook recommends avoiding siting sensitive land uses --like schools and healthcare facilities - -within 500 feet of a freeway. Other uses, like commercial buildings, may b e placed closer to the freeway because these buildings typically have greater traffic emissions protections in place (e.g., more advanced ventilation and filtration technologies and permanently closed or sealed windows). Also, pollution concentrations tend to be higher at night (there is a reduced drop -off in concentrations with distance at night) Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 83 so daytime uses are recommended for near -roadway development. As with the \"Building design that promotes ventilation along street corridors \" strategy above, this strategy should be considered in the context of the overall need to increase developmental density, which also confers health and environmental benefits. Possible Co -Benefits: Space separating sensitive uses not only protects them from air quality -related health impacts, but is also one way to avoid potential health impacts related to freeway noise. Possible Drawbacks: Forgoing development near high volume roadways can lead to more disperse development and high levels of vehicle travel. Driver exposur e to near roadway pollutants has also been found to have health impacts, as pollutant concentrations are highest on the roads themselves. Further, additional vehicle travel worsens regional air quality and GHG emissions; more disperse land use patterns consume more land, are associated with greater building energy use, water use, impervious surface area, and lead to poorer health outcomes partly because of reduced active transportation mode share. If parking is used as an alternative use separating sensiti ve uses from freeways, the result could be an increase in vehicle use due to an increase in parking availability. Similarly, when parking is sited, it may interfere with improved pedestrian or transit access to services. Traffic Management Speed reduction mechanisms such as roundabouts Speed reduction mechanisms change the \"design speed\" of the road, meaning the physical characteristics of the road that give drivers a sense of how fast or slow they should go. These features can reduce stop -and-go driving an d hard accelerations and thereby reduce emission rates. Some of these features, like roundabouts, can also be used to replace signalized intersections. Studies show that roundabouts in place of signalized intersections can reduce localized pollutant concen trations, depending on context and site -specific conditions. Roundabouts are defined by Caltrans as a form of a circular intersection design. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 84 It is distinguished in that 1) the shape is generally circular; 2) They have geometric features to slow traffic pa ssing through the intersection; and 3) They are always yield - controlled for the motorist entering the roundabout. 9 Appropriate Context and Other Considerations: Planners should carefully consider the potential direct and indirect effects of implementi ng speed reduction mechanisms to determine if they will result in emissions reductions and other environmental and safety goals. Regarding roundabouts, planners should consider site-specific factors and consult with Caltrans and Federal Highways Administration guidance. Under certain conditions (e.g., high traffic volume, intersections of a high - speed road with a low -speed road, etc.) a roundabout may not provide an air quality benefit over other types of intersection control. Planners should also be aware that roundabouts require sufficient right of way, which may not be available at some intersections in dense urban setti ngs, and that they should be designed to accommodate buses, emergency vehicles, and other large vehicles. Traffic circles are smaller and their main purpose is traffic calming; roundabouts allow greater vehicle flow10 Possible Co -Benefits: Depending on si te-specific conditions, speed reduction mechanisms can result in improved safety and fewer or less serious injuries when accidents occur. Data show that roundabouts are safer for pedestrians than traffic lights, and studies associate roundabouts with fewe r and less severe auto collisions, opportunities for improved aesthetics, and reduced operations and maintenance costs. Possible Drawbacks: At roundabouts, bicycle safety is a potential concern which can be addressed through signage and other features o f proper roundabout design. Planners can consult Federal Highways Administration11 or National Association of 9 http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist1/roundabouts/roundabout_english.pdf 10 http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/intersection/roundabouts/fhwasa10006/#s2 11 http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/intersection/roundabouts/ , Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 85 City Transportation Officials 12guidance for more information. Also, planners should be careful when considering placing roundabouts near schools as they may require additional signage and education about saf e crossing for children and parents. Traffic Signal Management Various traffic signal management systems can reduce stop -and-go driving and vehicle idling, resulting in reduced localized pollutant concentrations compared to corridors that do not implement these systems. Studies show that site specific conditions dictate the magnitude of reductions. Appropriate Context and Other Considerations: Planners should consider site - specific factors when considering traffic signal coordination for a corridor or ro adway section. Many different types of signal management are available, and planners should identify what is best for air quality, vulnerable road user safety, and transit and active mode throughput and comfort Possible Co -Benefits: When implemented with site specific context and other goals in mind, traffic signal management can improve safety and enable efficient movement of transit of vehicles and bicycles Possible Drawbacks: In some cases, coordinated signals may create more stops for vehicles drivi ng on perpendicular streets, thus increasing emissions. Additionally, coordinated signals could translate to more vehicle throughput and possible increased VMT on the road section and beyond. Theoretically, increasing vehicle speed could potentially count eract measures to improve walkability, bike access, and Complete Streets objectives given more difficulty crossing intersections. Speed Reductions on High Speed Roadways (>55 mph) Research studies have identified an optimal average speed range of ~35 -55 mp h within which per -mile traffic emissions and fuel consumption are minimized. 12 http://nacto.org/references/federal -highway -administration -3/ Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 86 Appropriate Context and Other Considerations: Speed reductions are an appropriate method for reducing near roadway impacts on roadways where speed limit and design speeds excee d 55 mph. Speed decreases may increase travel times. Possible Co -Benefits: Lowering vehicle speed to within the optimal range for emissions reductions generally will result in improved safety. Possible Drawbacks: Travel times may increase slightly. Near roadway siting considerations and strategies will continue to evolve. For example, vehicles will continue to become cleaner over the coming years, changing the balance in benefits and drawbacks of near roadway development. A general plan update provide s a platform on which to consider multiple policy options simultaneously in striking this balance, and the opportunity to come to holistic, internally consistent solutions.

This concept is discussed further in the circulation section. The Land Use Element and Regional Sustainable Communities Strategies ... California's land is an exhaustible resource, not just a commodity, and is essential to the economy, environment and general wellbein g of the people of California. It is the policy of the state ... to protect California's land resource, to insure its preservation and use in ways which are economically and socially desirable in an attempt to improve the quality of life in California. (Gov. Code \u00a7 65030.) Most land use approvals occur at the local government level. Nevertheless, local land use elements must reflect their statewide and regional contexts. (See, e.g., Gov. Code \u00a7 65030.1 (\"decisions involving the future growth of the state, m ost of which are made and will continue to be made at the local level, should be guided by an effective planning process, including the local general plan, and should proceed within the framework of officially approved statewide goals and policies directed to land use, population growth and distribution, development, open space, resource preservation and utilization, air and water quality, and other related physical, social and economic development factors\").) Indeed, in adopting a general plan, local gove rnments must consult with other entities that may be affected by the plan. Such other entities include, but are not limited to, neighboring cities, counties and special districts, school districts, local agency formation commissions, areawide planning age ncies, federal agencies, including the military, water providers, and California Native American tribes. ( Id. at \u00a7 65352.) Several regional activities may directly bear on local land use planning. One example is the sustainable communities strategy contai ned within regional transportation plans. While the Government Code states that a sustainable communities strategy does not regulate the use of land (Government Code section 65080(b)(2)(K)), for several reasons, local governments should consider and, if a ppropriate, incorporate applicable policies into local land use elements. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 88 First, sustainable communities strategies should already reflect the basic outlines of local plans. Second, some transportation funding is tied to consistency with the regional transportation plan. Third, streamlining benefits under the California Environmental Quality Act may be tied to consistency with the sustainable communities strategy. Fourth, any inconsistency with the regional transportation plan would need to be analyzed as part of the CEQA analysis for the general plan. A sustainable communities strategy might be relevant to a local land use element in several ways. A sustainable communities strategy should identify locations within the region where land use and transpo rtation investments can be maximized. Therefore, a local government planning agency might want to consider whether the land use element places development in transportation -efficient Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Cities and counties should promote more livable communities by expanding opportunities for transit -oriented development (TOD) so that residents minimize traffic and pollution impacts from traveling for purposes of work, shopping, school, and recreation. TOD is defined as moderate - to high -density development located within an easy walk of a major transit s top, generally with a mix of residential, employment, and shopping opportunities. TOD encourages walking and transit use without excluding the automobile. TOD can be new construction or redevelopment of one or more buildings whose design and orientation fa cilitate transit use (Statewide Transit -Oriented Development Study: Factors for Success in California, California Department of Transportation, 2002). A well -designed, vibrant TOD community can provide many benefits for local residents and businesses, as w ell as for the surrounding region. Compact development near transit stops can increase transit ridership and decrease rates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), thereby yielding a good return on transit system investments. TOD can also provide mobility choices , increase public safety, increase disposable household income by reducing transportation costs, reduce air pollution and energy consumption rates, help conserve resources and open space, assist in economic development, and contribute to the housing supply . TOD is a strategy that may help a community achieve its general plan goals related to circulation, housing, environmental quality, and economic development. Additionally, by improving access to jobs and housing and revitalizing existing neighborhoods, TO D can be a tool for promoting environmental justice. A variety of factors need to be considered during the development and implementation of TOD. These factors include transit system design; community partnerships; understanding of local real estate market s; coordination among local, regional, and state organizations; and providing the right mix of planning and financial incentives and resources. A successful TOD will reinforce the community and the transit system. Transit operators, property owners, and re sidents should be involved in the development of TOD proposals. Data to identify and assess potential locations for TOD should be collected during preparation of the land use, circulation, and housing elements of the general plan. An inventory of potential development (and redevelopment) sites within a quarter to a half mile of existing and proposed transit stops may reveal potential locations for TOD. Additional data may be used to verify the optimum location and mix of uses to further refine the viability of TOD at specific transit hubs. This data may include origin and destination studies, transit ridership projections, and data to determine the appropriate jobs -to-housing ratio and level of retail services. The appropriate density and intensity will supp ort a high level of transit service. An optimal mix of uses will provide opportunities to shop, work, live, and recreate without the need for an automobile. Local governments can promote TOD through general plan policies that encourage supportive densities and designs and a mix of land uses. TOD -supportive policies may provide for higher land use densities, reduced parking requirements, decreased automobile traffic levels of service, and increased transit levels of service. TOD policies should facilitate a pedestrian -oriented environment with features such as traffic calming strategies, traditional grid street patterns with smaller blocks, and architecture that orients buildings to sidewalks, plazas, and parks rather than to parking . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 89 locations as identified in the sustainable communities strategy. Other relevant policies include density and intensity maximums and minimums, as well as policies related to active transportation and protection of public health. Incorporating such policies into a local land use element may assist the local government in avoid ing conflicts with neighboring jurisdictions, and perhaps more importantly, maximizing benefits of transportation funding and regulatory streamlining .

By statute , the circulation element must correla te directly with the land use element, but also has direct relationships with other elements. The provisions of a circulation element affect a community's physical, s ocial, and economic environment, as well as its health . Correlations Between Elements Land Use Housing Conservation Open Space Noise Safety Circulation Identified in statute Closely related to sta tutory requirements Government Code Section 65302 (b) (1) A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, any military airports and ports, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan. (2) (A) Commencing January 1, 2011, upon any substantive revision of the circulation element, the le gislative body shall modify the circulation element to plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel in a manner that is suitable to the rural, suburb an, or urban context of the general plan. (B) For purposes of this paragraph, \"users of streets, roads, and highways\" mean bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods, pedestrians, users of public transportation, and seniors. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 94 Required Contents The circulation element must, consistent with Government Code Section 65302 (b), include the location and extent of existing and proposed Major thoroughfares Transportation routes Terminals Military airports and ports Public utilities and facilities Statutory Requirements Government Code requires that any revision of circulation elements after Jan 1, 2011 must plan for a \"b alanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways for safe and conve nient travel in a manner that is suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of the general plan.\" Users are defined in statute as \"bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods, pedestrians, users of public transportation, and seniors. \" The circulation element must identify funding for capital, operations, and maintenance of Relationship with Regional Planning California courts have recognized that general plans must reflect the regional context. Circulation elements must, therefore, account for both regional transportation plans and, in some cases, congestion management plans. Regional Transportation Plans Metropolitan planning organizations and regional transportation planning agencies prepare regional transportation plans in cooperation with Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Transit Administratio n (FTA), Caltrans, the Air Resources Board, the Department of Housing and Community Development and other stakeholders, including system users. The purpose of the regional transportation plan is to establish regional goals, identify present and future tra nsportation needs, deficiencies and constraints, analyze potential solutions, estimate available funding, and propose investments. In most regions in California, the regional transportation plan includes a sustainable communities strategy that aligns transportation investments with a land use pattern designed to reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions. In order to be eligible for federal and state funding, transportation projects must be consistent with the adopted regional transportation plan, including an applicable sustainable communities strategy. Regional transportation plans are required to reflect certain population growth and distribution assumptions contained in local general plans. As a practical matter, circulation elements should also reflect the adopted regional transportation plan. A circulation element that is not consistent with a regional transportation plan will need to provide sufficient information regarding local funding to support transportation improvements that are not consistent with the regional plan. If adopting a circulation element that is not consistent with the regional transportation plan, that inconsistency and its impact on regional greenhouse gas reductions will also need to be analyzed in the environmental analysis und er the California Environmental Quality Act. (See, e.g., CEQA Guidelines \u00a7 15125(d).) Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 95 planned additions to the network, additions to the network that would be triggered by policies in the element, and the existing network. Correlation with the Land Use Element Requirement Description: Creating connected, accessible, and complete systems of circulation networks and ensuring access to opportunities within a community and region requires coordination between land use and circ ulation planning. Due in part to the connection between transportation funding and greenhouse gas reduction established in SB 375 , vehicle miles t raveled (VMT) is becoming an increasingly important metric of circulation element performance. Because the circulation element is required to correlate with the land use element, it should account for the features of the particular community. For example , the circulation element may demonstrate that health care facilities and commercial destinations are not accessible via public transit from the affordable and senior housing planned in the land use and housing elements , highlighting the need for additiona l transit . Mapping transportation options as part of the general plan process may help identify gaps to address. The land use and circulation elements are essential places to plan for mobility and access for all communit y members. Pedestrian and bicycle routes in the circulation element should connect parks and schools with residential areas identified in the land use element. Moreover, truck routes should be directed away from sensitive users and designated instead to s erve areas designed for commercial and industrial uses in the land use element. Speed limits and roadway design should reflect the area's nearby uses. Regional Transportation Plans, SB 375, and Sustainable Community Strategies The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008 (Sustainable Communities Act, SB 375, Chapter 728, Statutes of 2008) supports the State's climate action goals to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through coordinated tra nsportation and land use planning with the goal of more sustainable communities. Under the Sustainable Communities Act, ARB sets regional targets for GHG emissions reductions from passenger vehicle use. In 2010, ARB established these targets for 2020 and 2035 for each region covered by one of the State's metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) . ARB will periodically review and update the targets, as needed. Each of California's MPOs must prepare a \"sustainable communities strategy\" (SCS) as an integral part of its regional transportation plan (RTP). The SCS contains land use, housing, and transportation strategies that, if implemented, would allow t he region to meet its GHG emission reduction targets. Once adopted by the MPO, the RTP/SCS guides the transportation policies and investments for the region. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 96 Where vulnerable road users are present, research shows that motor vehicle speed limits above 20 -25 mil es per hour create risk of serious injury or fatality. Special attention should be paid to ensure that all transportation facilities are des igned to be safe, accessible, and connected for all users. Simply putting a sidewalk or a bike lane on one street, for example, without a complete system that connects residents and destinations, may not address additional needs of a community. Using cont ext sensitive, flexible designs can help increase access for all users while improving overall conditions or addressing common issues such as stormwater runoff, air quality, and bicyclist and pedestrian safety. For additional information on the design of complete streets, see NACTO Street Design Guidelines and Caltrans Complete Street Guidelines . One of the most recent appellate court cases addressing the correlation requirement explained: [T]he internal consistency and correlation requirements do not require a city or county to limit population growth or provide traffic management measures to ensure that its transportation infrastructure ca n accommodate future population growth. The Planning and Zoning Law ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 65000 et seq..) does not require a city or county to avoid advers e impacts on transportation. Rather, the city has broad discretion to weigh and balance competing interests in formulating development policies.... (Federation of Hillside & Canyon Ass ns. v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 126 Cal. App. 4th 1180, 1196.) In characterizing the correlation requirement, the same court explained that \"the Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 97 circulation element of a general plan must provide meaningful proposals to address changes reflected in the land use element, and the land use element must provide meaningful proposals to reflect changes reflected in the circulation element.\" ( Ibid ) (emphasis added).) A proposal is \"meaningful\" if the element identifies reasonably reliable funding sources. (Id. at 1196 -1197.) On the other hand, an element that identifies proposals with no reasonable expectation of implementation (i.e., funding) is not meaningful, and therefore would not satisfy the statutory correlation requirement. ( Id.; see also Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 166 Cal. App. 3d 90, 103. ) In order to \"meet the needs of all users\" of the circulation network, meaningfu l proposals will address not just capital costs, but also costs associated with operations and maintenance. Because the circulation element addresses both transportation and services infrastructure, the statutory correlation requirement applies to utiliti es infrastructure as well. Appropriate fiscal analyses should be prepared to support the conclusion that the circulation element is capable of supporting the land uses planned in the land use element. Tools are available to allow comparison of total infr astructure costs and benefits across several build -out scenarios. These tools enable communities to make decisions regarding land use patterns with long term infrastructure costs and benefits in mind.

Cities and counties should consider the location and design of major thoroughfares in new developments, as well as street patterns (curvilinear, grid, modified grid, etc.), coordination with other infrastructure such as utilitie s, and relationships between destinations and transportation systems. Design standards for local streets (including, but not limited to, width, block size, speed, and accommodation of parking and bicycle and pedestrian traffic) may also be included in the circulation element. Providing charging stations and alternative fuel stations can facilitate use of zero emissions vehicles, reducing air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions.

Examine and align schedules Transportation Routes Requirement Description: Transportation systems are essential to any city or county and its economy, serving as a potential engine to enhance opportunity and improve equity. However, the implementation and maintenance of infrastructure and resources is costly, impacts the environment, and Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 99 affects human health. Transportation planning in California is rapidly changing, driven by a number of key factors: An increasing focus on Access to Destinations rather than just mobility, and transportation solutions involving proximity that better accomplish livability and environmental goals Shrinking local government budgets A mismatch of anticipated revenue and future maintenance obligations und er current policies An increasing focus on greenhouse gas emissions reduction An ongoing focus on air quality An increasing recognition of the research consensus that adding roadway capacity can induce additional vehicle travel An increasing recognition of the transportation network's effect on land use , and in turn the effect of more disperse land use on the environment and human health Demographic and social trends creating increased demand for infill and walkable development Emerging sharing economy transportation solutions such as carsh are, rideshare, and bikeshare services reducing automobile use and dependence Enhanced technology and information such as nextbus and intelligent transporation systems making navigation of multiple transportation systems more simple and convenient and in fluencing transportation choices . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 100 Further, recent legislation has driven change in the way we approach transportation and the types of solutions we provide: The Complete Streets Act Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act (SB 375) and the completion of Sustainable Communities Strategies CEQA Streamlining for infill Projects (SB 226) SB 743 shift in CEQA transportation metric Because of these factors, many California communities are substantially revising t heir circulation elements. Setting Goals and Measuring Progress in Transportation in the 21st Century The transportation system consists of viaducts to transmit vehicles and people (e.g. roads, sidewalks), ports to station vehicles at their destination (e .g. parking lots), and the vehicles themselves (e.g. busses, bicycles, cars). In developing a general plan, a jurisdiction should consider it s overall objectives, and develop policies for each of these three components that support those objectives. SAMPL E OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATIO N IN ANALYSIS OF THI S ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Ensure access for all members of community Population demographics, employment centers, transit routes and headways, cost of transportation by income and location Roads Requirement Description: The underlying goal of transportation is to provide access to destinations, also called providing \"connectivity.\" Connectivity is provided by a combination of mob ility (speed) and proximity (distance). The transportation system has traditionally been viewed primarily Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 101 through a mobility lens, measuring speed (e.g. via delay metrics like Level of Service). In addition, the primary focus has been on Level of Service (LOS), a qualitative measure of location specific delay, and auto-mobility rather than other modes. While auto mobility will continue to be critical to providing connectivity into the foreseeable future, so will other means of connectivity . Because of tr affic impacts, increasing auto -mobility can lead to worsening proximity, the other element of connectivity. Motor vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them (arterials, parking lots, freeways, etc.) take up substantial space in cities, which can result in sparser development and longer travel distances. Additionally , providing better auto -mobility (i.e. increasing speeds) can induce additional vehicle travel, which causes congestion, over time eroding mobility benefits while also generating en vironmental impacts . Many m obility measures for non -auto modes do not share these disadvantages, even though they may not always demonstrate the benefits of providing connectivity with proximity. The Level of Service measure has traditionally been used in determining intersection and roadway capacity needed to provide congestion -free motor vehicle travel for residents, workers, and shoppers in a suburbanizing landscape. However, as transportation networks become more complex and constrained by an increasin g number of factors, Level of Service has become less useful in determining capacity needs . SB 743 is beginning to address this mismatch and focus on measuring Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) instead. Additio nal vehicle travel can lead to poor outcomes for the environment and human health. Level of Se rvice standards can encourage more vehicle travel . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 102 Ideally, the circulation element of the General Plan should include a discussion of the transportation system designed and sized using metrics that capture connectivity (the fundamental purpose of transportation) rather than mobility (just one facet of connectivity). For example, the state of Virginia and some cities (e.g. Pasadena ) are already developing connectivity metrics and models to guide in frastructure investment. While connectivity measures and models are still being developed in California, Level of Service analysis remains relevant to transportation planning. The following are some suggestions for using the Level of Service in the genera l planning context: Use L evel of Service during the planning process to size roadways, but consider other criterion at the point of project implementation to require mitigation or to allocate impact fees. Level of Service can be used while other metrics a re under development, to help size roadways to accommodate automobile travel generated by planned growth. Allocating the cost of roadways and improvements to individual projects based on Level of Service analysis can be problematic, because it disproporti onately charges development that occurs in congested areas. Because infill development tends to locate in areas with existing congestion, it readily trips L evel of Service thresholds; meanwhile less transportation efficient outlying or greenfield developm ent is generally located where there is little existing traffic, so even though it contributes more to regional congestion, it tends not to trip L evel of Service thresholds. As a result, charging transportation impact fees based on LOS unfairly penalizes and discourages infill development, and subsidizes outlying development. Places with high delay (poor LOS) tend to be places exhibiting higher GDP. Level of Servi ce should be balanced with other metrics when used, rather than triggering decisions by itself. Other metrics are needed to measure the efficacy, comfort and safety of other transportation modes, and to measure the proximity benefits conferred by infill development. It is important to estimate the cost of achieving any L evel of Service threshold, in order to determine whether that threshold is fiscally feasible , and to identify, where possible, funding for long-run maintenance costs associated with buildin g to any Level of Service threshold s. Set Level of Service thresholds in consideration of the tradeoffs between mobility and other goals. Accommodating automobile traffic has direct tradeoffs with greenhouse gas Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 103 emissions, other emissions that affect air q uality, pedestrian collision risk, and active mode share and the resulting public health benefits. It also leads to sparser land development patterns, creating indirect tradeoffs with consumption of agricultural land and sensitive habitat, household energ y use, household water use, and water runoff affecting water quality and flood risk. A general plan should consider these tradeoffs when recommending a Level of Service objective. Transit Requirement Description: As more of the population chooses alternati ves to driving and California strives to reduce VMT and GHG emissions, transit availability becomes increasingly important. There are many important considerations for transit in general plans. Policies can promote and prioritize high quality transit, aligned with housing and economic development policies, which in turn increases efficiency of the overall transportation system. Transit providers should be involved in general plan processes, ensuring their alignment with community priorities. Well-planne d transit infrastructure can improve access to opportunity by making job centers, housing, schools, and other major destinations reachable by high numbers of residents via quality transit service. Providing infrastructure at transit stops for convenience a nd safety, such as proper lighting, covered shelter, and safe crossings; implementing transit priority on streets and bridges, such as priority lanes, signals, and other types of infrastructure; and Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 104 utilizing technology to communicate transit patterns in r eal time can help speed transit vehicles, shorten travel times, promote safety, and attract additional passengers. Coordinating transit stops, stations, and routes with bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure can help create first and last mile connections, promoting reduced VMT for short trips and potentially increasing transit ridership for an increased range of residents. Developers and employers can also incentivize transit ridership, and general plan policies can promote such programs through general vi sions and goals or through specific transit zones in the plan. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATIO N IN ANALYSIS OF THI S ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Identify most needed new transit routes Population demographics, travel patterns, housing and opportunity centers Active Transportation: Bicycle and Pedestrian Networks Requirement Description: Increasing bicycle and pedestrian networks in a city or county improves accessibility for numerous populations. Ensuring that infrastructure is safe for residents from ages \"8 to 80\" captures the needs of recreational riders, ADA users, bicycle and pedestrian commuters, and all people in between. Bicycle and pedestrian networks should be complete systems for transportation, including coordination with land use plans, housing, and transit systems. Bicycle and pedestrian networks should connect residents to employment centers, community centers, schools, commercial districts, and transit stops. Pat hs and facilities, both on and off road, should include user amenities such as shade trees, benches, and drinking fountains. Complete Streets policies should be integrated in to bicycle and pedestrian policies as well. Some jurisdictions have separate bicycl e and pedestrian plans, which should correspond and align with the general plan. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 105 SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATIO N IN ANALYSIS OF THI S ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Align bike and ped improvements with road improvements Re-paving schedule, map needed improvements, crash rate data Terminals Requirement Description: Airports, seaports, train stations, and other terminals play an important role in a region's transportation, social, and economic makeup. As such, the circulation element should include these facilities in its transportation discussion. Often, terminals bring a specific set of land -use issues that may need to be addressed as future growth occurs in existing infill areas. These issues include pollution, noise, traffic, and public safety. The location, type, and height of development in areas surrounding airports, should be considered in the context of the local Airport Land Use Plan. Airport Land Use Plans must coordin ate with general plans' land use elements, but should be considered in regards to circulation and safety as well. Some actions to consider in the circulation element include: Assess the adequacy of and safety hazards associated with existing aviation facilities and the need for expansion and improvements. Limit potential noise and safety hazards posed by airport activities to surrounding land uses Mitigate aviation -related hazards posed t o and by aircraft Make access to and from aviation facilities available by all modes of transportation Military Airports and Ports Requirement Description: The Department of Defense (DO D) has a significant presence in the State of California, using 10% o f the State's land. Consequently, military ports and airports impose demands on local circulation infrastructure that should be factored into the overall analysis of local circulation planning in a general plan. Furthermore, changes to circulation patter ns and routes may Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 106 affect military operations. For example, development along formerly rural roads can significantly increase urban traffic and limit the use of routes for military transport purposes. Such changes can impede military operations, especiall y for units that commute to conduct training operations. On the other hand, improvements to circulation routes, such as ports, can contribute to operations. Public Utilities and Facilities Requirement Description: In addition to transportation routes, the circulation element must identify the location and necessity of public utilities and facilities. Relevant utilities include water, sewers, sto rmwater, telecommunications and broadband, electric vehicle charging stations, electricity and natural gas lines. These facilities relate directly to the land uses planned in the land use element, consequently, the circulation element should consider not just \"right sizing\" such infrastructure to serve only that growth that is actually planned in the land use el ement, but also placing infrastructure in areas that maximize efficiency and minimize impacts to the community. California courts have noted that plans for infrastructure should follow determinations regarding desired growth that reflect resource constrai nts and other broader considerations. ( See, e.g., County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal. App. 4th 931, 949 -950.) In identifying existing infrastruc ture and planning for future needs, local governments should work closely with any relevant service providers, including water districts, utilities and others. In 2011, local governments were required to plan for infrastructure needs of disadvantaged unincorporated commu nities through Senate Bill 244 . The bill requires the land use element to analyze needs for infrastructure in these communities. To ensure consistency, the circulation and land use elements' policies and programs should be coordinated. For additional information on planning for disadvantaged unincorporated communities, see the Land Use Element chapter of the GPG and Senate Bill 244: Land Use, General Plans, and Disadvantaged Communities Technical Advisory . Both state and federal governments are implementing various funding programs that serve the goal of expanding broadband access to unserved and underserved areas. Within California, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) manages the California Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 107 Advanced Services Fund (CASF) , which invests hundreds of millions of dollars annually in broadband deployment. The state also created the California Emerging Technology Fund (CETF) , which was de signed to be a public -purpose venture capital fund. \"Dig once \" policies can help ensure efficiencies and reduce costs among circulation infrastructure. The underlying premise of a \"dig once\" policy is to coordinate conduit construction with unrelated civ il works projects, such as digging up the roads and sewer construction, to create a usable infrastructure for future network deployment/provisioning. A new provider can run fiber through leased conduit space at a fraction of the costs, incentivizing more p rivate actors to deploy or reducing costs to the city if self -provisioning broadband services. Dig once polic ies are flexible and may come in many forms. The goal and emphasis should be on impacting the rights of way as few times as possible by inviting multiple parties to lay their infrastructure together. For example, if conduit construction was promoted along ongoing civil work pro jects, fiber deployment costs drop by $30,000 - $100,000 per mile. On average, 60 to 90 percent of network deployment costs come from civil works as opposed to equipment and maintenance . For more information on broadband deployment, see the Broadband techn ical advisory. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 108 Other Considerations Transportation and Climate Change Climate chan ge is a critical consideration in a General Plan circulation element because transportation is a significant source of greenhouse gases. In California, transportation is the largest source of emissions: A ccording to the California Air Resources Board, abo ut 37% of the state's GHG emissions come from the transportation sector ,13 as compared to 28% nationally .14 If life-cycle emissions [extraction/refining/pipelines] are included in addition to tail pipe emissions, transportation is the source of over half of California GHG emissions. An update to the circulation element presents an opportunity to integrate measures for reducing vehicle travel that are critical to meeting our state's GHG reduction goals. General plans can help reduce greenhouse gas emission s by establishing policies for reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled and laying the groundwork for zero emission infrastructure. Strategies to reduce transportation -related GHG emissions fall into three general categories: vehicle efficiency, switching to low -carbon fuels, and reduction of vehicle miles traveled. General plans' most important policy levers focus on VMT reduction, by influencing land use and specifying transportation network characteristics and travel demand management strategies. Further, gen eral plans can help jurisdictions become \"ZEV -ready\", e.g. by specifying provision of alternative fuel fueling and charging stations [cite EV Guidebook].

Doing so provides a substantial subsidy to automobile mobility (summing to roughly $20 -40 Billion per year in California15). Free parking is a community choice, but should be recognized as one t hat entails costs, and can lead to additio nal vehicle travel, which in turn can impact community goals for livability, mode shift, environmental protection, emissions reduction, and fiscal benefits. The circulation element of a general plan provides a jurisdiction the opportunity to evaluate various tradeoffs, in cluding the costs and benefits of p arking , in conjunction with other planning goals. Tradeoffs a jurisdiction might consider include: Ready parking availability can induce increased vehicle miles traveled (VMT), leading to increased g reenhouse gas and emissions. Parking requires land that might be occupied by other land use, which may provide greater benefit (including fiscal benefit). Parking areas paved with standard asphalt can exacerbate impacts on water quality and runoff control . Free parking subsidizes motor vehicles potentially at the expense of other transit subsidies Transportation structures can adversely affect floodways 15 Shoup, Donald. The High Cost of Free Parking . (2005) APA Planners Pre ss. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 110 Many jurisdictions are already confronting parking tradeoffs and addressing these issues. Some strategi es can be used to manage pa rking demand and parking supply include : Managing Demand for Parking Support alternative transportation. Encourage development projects that will provide improvements to bicycle, pedestrian, and transit access. (See e.g. City of Berkeley )This includes to providing parking geometries that are compatible with and support pedestrian and bicycle facilities, such as b ack in parking and protected lanes (see images below) Attach a cost to parking. When construction and maintenance are considered, provision of parking is costly. Jurisdictions may wish to consider the benefits of optimizing parking prices to reflect the e quilibrium between supply and demand. (See e.g. City of San Diego ; City of Sacramento ) Managing Supply of Parking Set parking maxima. Set maximum parking rates or replace minimum parking rates with maximum parking rates. Especially in TOD or mixed -use development areas, relaxing minimum requirem ents, or establishing maximum requirements instead, will mean that space is available for other uses. (See e.g. Sacramento County ; City of San Jose) Allow the market to determine parking. In many cases, the free market will lead to provision of the optimal amount of parking, excluding external cos ts of vehicle travel. Manage the use of existing spaces . Prioritize based on location (e.g. proximity to employment centers) and intended use (e.g. short - or long -term). Implement shared parking or establish parking benefit districts. (See e.g. Sacramento County ) Optimizing use of existing parking will help make efficient use of land within the jurisdiction's bounda ries. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 111 SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATIO N IN ANALYSIS OF THI S ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Price parking per utilization Parking utilization Traffic Control Around Sc hools High volumes of pedestrian traffic, vulnerable users, and other factors create increased need for safety around schools. Considerations in roadway design should take in to account the specific needs of the population, including bicycle and pedestrian access, transit and drop off needs, and safety around crosswalks, intersections, and roundabouts. For additional guidance on traffic control specifically around schools, see the CalTrans Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices , including Section 3c on roundabout markings and Part 7 for traffic control around schools. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 112 Addressing Tradeoffs in Circulation The transportation network should be designed to accommodate multiple competing interests. The circulation element should address the tradeoffs between these interests rather than listing desirable but mutually impossible outcomes. The following are some of tradeoffs that this section might address. Roadway motor vehicle throughput and speed v. impacts on community along roadway Roadway motor vehicle throughput and speed v. capacity for other modes Roadway design speed and risk to pedestrians and cyclists Breadth of coverage of transit system v. cost Provision of bicycle facilities v. provision of additional motor vehicle capacity Transit priority measures (e.g. signal priority and queue jump lanes) v. automobile capacity Accommodation of potential emergency vehicle turning movements v. design for pedestrian safety Accommodation of freight vehicles v. pedestrian safety Automobile t hroughput and speed v. traffic calming measures such as narrower travel lanes, roundabouts, raised medians, speed tables, small curb radii, etc.) Goods Movement While freight moves throughout the state in multiple ways, trucks specifically: Emit diesel p articulate matter (DPM), which is a localized pollutant that is particularly hazardous to human health. Generate high noise levels Pose special collision hazards because of their size, especially to vulnerable road users, and for them especially during t urning movements, where rear wheels can follow a shortcut -track and collide with pedestrians and cyclists Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 113 For these reasons, truck routes should be designed to minimize risk to areas containing concentrations of sensitive receptors and vulnerable road user s. Also, goods movement facilities (distribution centers, rail yards, and ports) should be placed in locations that do not bring high levels of truck traffic near residential areas or schools whenever possible . Coordinating the land use element with the circulation element, freight mobility plans, and other relevant efforts, with the engagement of school boards, goods distributors, and community members may help assess tradeoffs and needs in locating facilities. Land use and circulation elements may also be coordinate d for freight movement in congested or high traffic corridors, such as by designating specific freight zones, lanes, or management practices, to improve efficiency overall. Policies specific to the needs of a community , depending on factors such as density, proximity to goods movement facilities, and average daily traffic (vehicle and non -vehicle) may help ease safety and congestion issues associated with urban freight movemen t. In general , trucks carrying freight have a substantially higher value on their travel time than private passenger vehicles. For this reason, it makes sense for a general plan to support transportation improvements that facilitate the timely movement o f goods, meet the needs of local business and industry, and support the efficient transfer of goods between truck, rail, and other transportation modes. These interests of goods movement must be balanced with the negative impacts to safety, air quality, a nd noise described in the previous paragraph . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 114 Completeness Checklist Statutory Citation Brief Description of Requirement Explanatory Notes Gov. Code, \u00a7 65302(b)(1) Existing and proposed major thoroughfares Congestion Management Plan s Each county containing an urbanized area must establish a congestio n management agency to prepare and adopt a congestion management plan. (See Gov. Code \u00a765089, et seq.) The congestion management plan establishes programs for mitigating the traffic impacts of new development, including deficiency programs where congesti on is extreme, and monitoring the performance of system roads. The congestion management plan is expected to link land use, transportation, and air quality concerns. At a minimum it must include all state highways and all principal arterial roads. Perform ance of the congestion management plan is measured through the land use approval process. As noted above, many jurisdictions have traditionally focused their circulation elements on automobile transportation, planning to certain \"level of service\" standard s. It is important to note, however, that congestion management law does not require general plans to designate level of service standards for every roadway and intersection. In fact, there are many reasons that a circulation element should not do so. ( See text box, below.) Moreover, congestion management plans address far more than just automobile transportation. They must also include an evaluation of the performance of multiple modes of travel and provide a program for travel demand management. Not ably, projects identified in a congestion management plan must be consistent with the regional transportation plan, and its sustainable communities strategy, in order to be funded. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65082.) In updating a circulation element, therefore, a loc al government must put the congestion management plan in a context that includes reductions in vehicle miles traveled, and provides for multiple users of the transportation system, including transit, bicycles and pedestrian transportation.

LAND USE , SAFETY , AIR QUALITY , HEALTHY COM MUNITIES , CLIMATE CHANGE Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 118 Housing Element Introduction Providing adequa te housing for all residents is a priority for cities and counties throughout California, and includes many considerations. The housing element implements the declaration of State law that \"the availability of housing is a matter of vital statewide import ance and the attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for all Californians is a priority of the highest order.\" Because of this, provisions in the housing element are more specific and directive than other elements, and contain detai led guidance and reviews. Housing element updates must be consistent with other general plan elements, including the land use element and diagrams, and should be considered concurrently. Integrating considerations of gene ral plan goals and policies through the housing element and each update may improve efficiency by ensuring consistency. Additionally, incorporating a holistic view of the document will allow the housing element to compliment other elements in addressing c hallenges such as climate change considerations, and working towards local goals, such as promoting infill development , TODs, healthy communities , and equity . Periodic updates assure that local governments \"will prepare and implement housing elements....toward the attainment of the state housing goal.\" This critical role is underscored by mandatory review and certification of housing element updates by a State agency ( Department of Housing and Community Development - HCD), along with annual reports s ubmitted to HCD. The housing element is to be prepared for a prescribed planning period, within the longer -term horizon of the general plan, every four, five or eight years Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 119 depending on various factors. ( Gov. Code \u00a765588 ). See the Department's website for a schedule of statutory deadlines . The GPG directs readers to HCD fo r detailed information on requirements for the housing element through links embedded in the headers and text. As the housing element has more precise requirements than many other elements, users should consult the detailed requirements for each section, i ncluding specificity and timelines, required by HCD by clicking on the provided links to get further assistance, assure compliance, and examine samples and resources. Correlations among Elements Land Use Circulation Conservation Open Space Noise Safety Housing Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Required Contents State law requires the housing element to address particularly detailed statutory requirements. For more information on these requirements, see the Departmen t of Housing and Community Development's (HCD's) website . A housing element must generally include the following parts, which are described in further detail below and through links: Review of previous element i f applicable Housing needs assessment Inventory and analysis of adequate sites Analysis of potential governmental and non -governmental constraints Housing policies and programs Quantified objectives Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 120 Housing element law also requires jurisdictions to a nalyze both governmental and non - governmental barriers to housing development and include programs to mitigate or remove those barriers. These barriers include entitlement processing, fees, land assemblage, development standards such as parking, and neede d infrastructure improvements. The broad yet detailed scope of the housing element requires a strong relationship to other elements of the general plan, and linkages between sections should be taken in to consideration. The housing element should integra te community health , climate change , and other considerations affecting and affected by housing throughout each section. More information on additional considerations is presented at the end of this chapter. Public Engagement: Housing issues affect the entire community - residents, employers and the public and private sectors. The public participation requirement of housing element law presents an opportunity to engage constituents in a dialogue - defining problems and creating solutions. Housing issues can be confusing, and are often misunderstood or contentious. Topics such as de nsity and affordable housing can divide communities who feel excluded from the process. The inclusion of community stakeholders , including residents , in the housing element public participation process helps ensure that appropriate housing strategies are m ore efficiently and effectively evaluated, developed, and implemented. An inadequate public participation process may lead to community conflict or in worse case scenarios, anti -development initiative s. Successful public participation is important because a diverse cross section of the population can be engaged in defining the housing problem and in crafting community sensitive solutions. The jurisdiction must make a diligent effort to include all economic segments of the community and/or their representat ives in the development, adoption and implementation of the housing element update , incliding low and moderate income households . Public engagement strategies to address multiple communities are outlined in Chapt er 3 of the GPG. The element must document how outreach and public engagement is carried out, from planning through implementation. This documentation should include current and future plans to involve varied members of the community in the full process. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 121 Review and Revise: The review and revise requirement is an important feature of the housing element update. A review facilitates a comprehensive update and ensures the e lement can be effectively implemented in the next planning period. Review and revise requires analysis in three areas: Progress in implementation : A description of the actual results or outcomes of the prior element's goals (i.e., what happened), objecti ves, policies, and programs. The results should be quantified where possible (e.g., number of units rehabilitated) and may be qualitative where necessary (e.g., mitigation of governmental constraints) Effectiveness of the element : For each program, the an alysis must evaluate the effectiveness in achieving the objectives such as analyzing differences between what was projected or planned in the earlier element and what was achieved Appropriateness of goals, objectives, policies and programs: A description of what has been learned based on the analysis of progress and effectiveness of the previous element. A description of how the goals, objectives, policies, and programs in the updated element are being changed or adjusted to incorporate what has been learn ed from the results of the previous element. General Plan Consistency: The goals, policies, and objectives and various accompanying analyses and text of the housing element must be reviewed in the context of the rest of the elements of the general plan such the land -use, circulation, and open space elements. The element must include a discussion of how internal consistency within the general plan has been achieved and how internal c onsistency will be maintained throughout the planning period. If appropriate, other elements may need to be updated concurrently with the housing e lement . Coastal Zone Requirements: To assist a locality's determination of whether the affordable housing stock in the coastal zone is being protected and provided as required by Section 65590, the element must contain data on the new construction, demolition, conversion and replacements h ousing units for low - and moderate -income households within the coastal zone : Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 122 Based on this analysis, localities should consider appropriate programs to provide incentives and regulatory concessions in order to preserve housing for low- and moderate -income households within the coastal zone. Internal Consistency in Updates Updates to other sections of the general plan often require a review of land use , with consideration to the potential impacts to existing housing stock and the housing element land inventory. For example, s hould the update of these elements demonstrate that certain parcels within the community will not be able to be developed or require significant mitigation; the sites inventory of the housing element should be updated to reflect these constraints. As a result, new parcels to accommodate the RHNA may need to be identified. Land Use Element : Gov Code Section 65302.10.(a) requires that each city and county review and update the land use element of its general plan, based on available data, including, but not limited to, the data and analysis developed pursuant to Se ction 56430, of unincorporated island, fringe, or legacy communities inside or near its boundaries. Safety and Conservation Elements : Gov Code Section 65302 requires amendment of the safety and conservation elemen ts of the general plan to include analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and management information. In addition, the safety element must be updated to analyze risk and include policies for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of wildland and urban fires. See page 7 of 2010 DWR Handbook: NOTE: 1) Does this Safety Element section include reference to Central Valley Flood Protection Board review? (2007 flood legislation) 2) Does this Safely Element sec tion include reference to Local Hazard Mitigation Plan requirement? (2006 flood legislation) Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 123 Analysis of Existing Housing Needs Requirement Description: An assessment of existing housing needs must include an analysis of population and employment tre nds and documentation of projections and a quantification of the locality's existing and projected housing needs for all income levels, including extremely low -income households (Government Code Section 65583(a)(1( and (2) ). The assessment must also include an analysis of household characteristics such as tenure (whether renting or owning) and overpayment; housing characteristics such as overcrowd ing; and housing stock conditions. The purpose of the assessment is to evaluate existing housing needs to formulate appropriate policies and programs. In the formulation of policies and programs, the assessment can also be combined with other areas of th e housing element such as evaluation of past programs and comments through public participation. An assessment of housing needs can utilize a variety of quantitative and qualitative information and should use current information when available. An assess ment may also evaluate trends over time and consider information or maps at a neighborhood level to better formulate appropriate policies and programs to address existing housing needs in the planning period. Items that must be included, as well as link s to more information on each, are discussed below. The HCD website includes detailed information on housing elements as well as examples, tools, and resources for updating the element. As with all elements of the gene ral plan, the required items provide a base, and jurisdictions can add other considerations as appropriate for their community. Population and Employment : In order to understand and prepare for the housing needs of a community, population trends and demographics, including employment trends and needs, must be assessed. The analysis should include current population and employment industry trends, using the most recent Census data available; comparisons in growth rates to countywide and regional rates; and analysis of population by age and other demographic Neighborhood -based Policies and Programs : Some jurisdictions will evaluate household and housing characteristics at a neighborhood level to target funding and other programs. For example a jurisdiction could e valuate housing conditions at a neighborhood level to target revitalization efforts or consider tenure and income to better utilize resources for conserving and improving affordable housing stock. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 124 characteristics . Employment analysis must examine shifts and anticipated shifts in employment and the potential impact on the housin g market; identification of large employers, job types, and earnings; and analysis of potential methods for improving job - housing relationships. Existing Housing Needs , Including Extremely Low -income Households : The element must include a description of existing households by income level, including a specific quantification and analysis of extremely low -income (ELI) households, defined as households with income at 30% or below of area median . Analysis of existing housing needs should include an estimate of existing and projected households with ELI, as well as proposed actions to address identified needs. The analysis should assess the resources avai lable to address the housing need, such as the kind of housing available and suitable for ELI households (including Supportive Housing and Single -Room Occupancy [SROs] units) and whether existing zoning permits those housing types. ELI households often ne ed additional assistance outside of market mechanisms, and may require specific housing solutions such as deeper income targeting for subsidies; housing with supportive services; single -room occupancy (SRO's) and/or shared housing; and rent subsidies (vouc hers). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 125 Housing and Household Characteristics Housing and household characteristics must be assessed in line with population and employment to determine current and future needs for homes available to renters and owners. A quantification and analysis of ho usehold characteristics addresses the number of households and trends and evaluates various factors such as tenure and the level of payment compared to their gross income or the ability to pay (overpayment). An analysis of overpayment must identify and analyze the number of lower -income households, by tenure, paying more than 30 percent of their gross income for housing and the number of households who pay 50 percent or more of their gross income for housing, and, where possible, identify households most significantly impacted by cost burdens (large families, seniors, etc.). The analysis should also identify potential resources and programs to address the need . A quantification and analysis of housing characteristics must address housing stock conditions and overcrowding to help determine housing need, potential health impacts, and possible reduction of affordable housing. The analysis can also address a variety of characteristics related to housing such as housing units by type (e.g., single family, multifamily, manuf actured housing) and their conditions, housing units by age, vacan cy rates , rent and sales prices, and the development patterns of the housing stock by various characteristics. Data for the housing needs assessment may be obtained fr om many sources. The US Census , American Community Survey (ACS) , the Department of Finance and Employment Development Department are the most common data sources for population and employment trends. These data sources can also be used to quantify the number of those living in overcrowded housing conditions, as well as those overp aying for housing. Overpayment data may also be found by utilizing HUD's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data. Data for at -risk housing can be fou nd via the California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC ), and data on housing stock conditions may be found by using local sources like a windshield survey or local building department. Many of these data sources ar e available in one comprehensive site via our GPG mapping tool. Jurisdictions should augment the tool with additional data available locally. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 126 SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Analysis of Projected Housing Needs Requirement Description: The housing element process begins with HCD allocating a region's share of the statewide housing need to the appropriate Councils of Governments (COG) based on Department of Finance population projections and regional population forecasts used in preparing regional transportation pla ns (Government Code Section 65583(a)(1) ). The COG develops a Regional Housing Need Plan (RHNP) allocating the region's share of statewide need to the cities and counties within the region. The RHNP is generally required to promote objectives that align with the state's priorities, including increasing the housing supply and the mix of housing types, tenure, and affordability in all cities and count ies within the region in an equitable manner; promoting infill development and socioeconomic equity, the protection of environmental and agricultural resources, the encouragement of efficient development patterns; and promoting improved intraregional relat ionship between jobs and housing. The RHNP should align with the regions sustainable communities strategy (SCS) , utilizing infill development plans, development around transit and active transportation, and other policies to reduce GHG emissions and enhan ce sustainability. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 127 Analysis of Special Housing Needs Requirement Description: Statute s require an analysis of specific categories of persons with special housing needs, including the elderly ; persons with disabilities, including developmental disabilities ; large families (households with 5 or more persons) ; farmworkers ; families with female heads of households ; and families and persons in need of emergency shelters . Each of these analyses must include detailed quantitative and qualitative data, including estimates of the number of persons in each category, discussio ns of available and needed resources, identification of housing types and numbers, and analysis of specific needs for identified categories (Gover nment Code Section 65583(a)( 7)). Additional considerations and categories should be identified by each community and analyzed as appropriate. These may include transitional housing, assisted living, homelessness, and any other special housing needs spec ific to the jurisdiction. Consideration of homelessness specifically may affect estimates of needed housing. The need for emergency shelter must be assessed b ased on annual and seasonal need, and may be reduced by the number of supportive housing units that are identified in an adopted 10 - year plan to end chronic homelessness. To be credited toward the need, these supportive housing un its must be either vacant or have funding identified for construction during the planning period. For assistance with the analysis of housing needs, including a discussion of resources such as existing housing, services and needs, cities and counties should contact local service providers . These include continuum of care providers, local homeless shelter and service providers, food programs, operators of transitional housing programs, local drug and alcohol program service providers, county mental health and social service departme nts, local Salvation Army, Goodwill Industries, churches and schools . Additional information on local services and needs may also be available by contacting one of 15 countywide Designated Local Boards certified by the HCD's Emergency Housing and Assistan ce Program. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 128 Economic, or Environmental Related Sites Inventory and Analysis Requirement Description: Local governments must prepare an inventory of land suitable for residential development, including both vacant and non -vacant sites, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites (Government Code Section 65583(a)(3) and 65583.2 ). The inventory must address the following c omponents: Inventory of Land Suitable for Residential Development: The land inventory must identify specific sites suitable for the development of housing within the planning period that are sufficient to accommodate the jurisdictions share of the regional housing need for all income levels. Land suitable for residential development includes vacant sites zoned for residential use, vacant sites zoned for nonresi dential use that allow residential development, residentially zoned sites capable of being developed at a higher density, and sites zoned for nonresidential use that can be redeveloped for, and as necessary, rezoned for, residential use. The inventory may also list sites by characteristics such as city owned, proximity to services and amenities, infill and equity opportunity areas, transit and other priority development areas and areas potentially eligible for CEQA streamlining. See Pub. Resources Code sections 21094.5, 21155.1 -21155.4 ; CEQA Guidelines section 15183.3 Analysis of Sites and Zoning : Targeting Opportunity Sites : One purpose of the site listing is to allow the housing element to function as a working land use document, showing the community and developers where the City intends to target its growth and accommodate households for all income levels. Some jurisdictions identify s ites by various characteristics to focus evaluation, resources, incentives and other actions to promote their intended use. For example, some jurisdictions may denote sites within priority development areas, transit priority areas, downtown areas, city -owned sites, areas meeting proximity criteria for funding (e.g., distance to amenities, infill, etc.) Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 129 The site specif ic listing must be accompanied by analysis to demonstrate that the land is suitable for development in the planning period and sites and zoning are sufficient and appropriate to accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need for all income levels. This analysis should include whether the impacts of a changing climate will affect the suitability of sites and zoning by subjecting sites to risks such as flooding, seismic activity, etc. More inform ation on these risks can be found in the safety and climate change chapters . The site inventory and analysis must be consistent with th e land use element and accompanying diagram. Analysis of sites coordinated with other elements of the general plan, including land use, circulation , safety, and open space , will help jurisdictions identify potential co -benefits toward their local goals. For example, identifying sites for higher density, mixed income, or low income housing near transit centers, active t ransportation routes, employment centers, services, or parks, may promote health and economic development , reduce GHG emissions and climate change impacts, and assist in affordability and quality of life. Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types: The analysis of sites must indicate whether the inv entory can provide for a variety of housing types, including multifamily rental housing, factory -built housing, mobilehomes, housing for agricultural employees, transitional and supportive housing, single -room occupancy units and emergency shelters. Provi ding development opportunities for a variety of housing types promotes diversity in housing price, style and size, and contributes to neighborhood stability by offering more affordable and move -up homes and accommodating a diverse income mix. Additionally , needs for housing types vary among jurisdictions, from high density needs in urban areas to smaller scale mid density rental housing, additional dwelling units, and other housing types in suburban and rural areas. Determining the analysis of a variety of housing types must account for a number of specific factors. This includes identification of zoning districts where each of the housing types are permitted, discussion of how development standards and processing requirements facilitate development of each of the housing types; and a description of capacity and its suitability to accommodate development or improvement opportunities Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 130 In addition, the statute provides flexibility to local governments in identifying sites to accommodate their share of the regi onal housing need. Alternative Adequate Sites: Local governments can address up to 25 percent by income group of their adequate sites requirement, under prescribed condition s, including units that are substantially rehabilitated, converted from market -rate to affordable, or where the affordability of certain multifamily housing units are preserved. Second Units: Local governments can address a portion of their adequate sites requirement through the provision of second units based on a number of factors including the number of second units developed in the prior planning period, community need and resources and/or incentives available that will encourage the ir development. Jurisdiction's may also use other alternatives to accommodate the regional housing need including units constructed since the beginning of the planning period, motel conversions , potential for manufactured housing on rural lots and sites with permanent housing on military bases undergoing closure or conversion. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Relate d Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 131 Identification of Zoning for Emergency Shelters Requirement Description: Every jurisdiction must identify a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use or other discretionary permit Government Code Section 65583(a)(4) ). The identified zone(s) must include sufficient capacity to accommodate the need for emergency shelter as identified in the housing element, EXCEPT that each jurisdiction must identify a zone(s) to accommodate at least one year -round shelter. Adequate sites can include sites with existing buildings that can be converted to accommodate need. Shelters may only be subject to development and management standards that apply to residential or commercial development in the same zone. However, local governments may apply written and objective standards that include maximum number of beds, off -street parking based upon demonstrated need, size and location of on -site waiting and intake areas, provision of on -site management, proximity to other shelters, length of stay, lighting, and security during hours when the shelter is open. For mo re information, see the HCD's technical assistance on zoning for emergency shelters. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmen tal Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Analysis of Governmental and Non -governmental Constraints Requirement Description: Governmental : The element must desc ribe and analyze governmental constraints for impacts on housing such as costs, supply and approval timing and certainty (Government Code Section 65583(a)(5) and (6) ). This analysis must include constraints in land use controls , Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 132 codes and enforcement , on and off site improvement requirements, fees and exactions , processing and permit procedures , and housing for persons with disabilities . Other governmental constraints specific to localized areas should also be addressed as appropriate. The analysis of potential governmental cons traints must describe past or current efforts to remove them. Where the analyses identifies that a constraint exists, program responses to address and mitigate or remove its effects should be included in the element. Ordinances, policies, procedures, or measures imposed by the local government that specifically limit the amount or timing of residential development should be analyzed as a potential governmental constraint and mitigated where necessary. The analysis will vary depending on the nature of th e measure. In general, the measure and its implementation procedures should be specifically described and analyzed as to the impact on the cost and supply of housing. Non -governmental : The housing element must include an analysis of non -governmental constraints, including land prices, construction costs, and financing availability. Although nongovernmental constraints are primarily market -driven and generally outside dire ct government control, localities can significantly influence and offset the negative impact of nongovernmental constraints through responsive programs and policies. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Econo mic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 133 Analysis of Energy Conservation Opportunities Requirement Description: The energy conservatio n section of the element must inventory and analyze the opportunities for energy conservation in residential development such as energy saving features, energy saving materials, and energy efficient systems and design for residential developmen t (Government Code Section 65583(a)(8) ). Planning to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and green building features can contribute to reduced housing costs for homeowners and renters, in addition to promoting sustainable community design. Such planning, development, and building standards can also significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gases. Updated policies and programs can address a variety of factors related to energy conservation and even broader environmental goals such as climate change by highlighting the environmental significance and operational benefits of employing energy conservation in the building an d retrofit of decent, safe and affordable housing. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Analysis of Assisted Housing At -risk of Converting to Market Rate Uses Requirement Description: The element must include a project inventory of assisted housing that could be converted to market rate rents because of expiration of affordability restrictions in mortgage and/or rental subsidy contracts (Government Code Section 65583(a)(9) ). Thousands of pub licly assisted housing units in California are eligible to change from low -income to market -rate housing during the next decade due to the termination of various government subsidy Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 134 programs and/or restrictions on rental rates. These units, known as at -risk units, are a valuable source of affordable housing for families statewide and as a result, the housing element must include a detailed analysis and proactive policies and programs to preserve these at-risk units. The at-risk analysis must prepare an inven tory of all units at -risk of conversion within 10 years of the beginning of the housing element planning period, assess the conversion risk, estimate and analyze the costs of replacement versus preservation for units at -risk in the current five -year planni ng period, identify entities qualified to preserve at-risk units, and specify financing and subsidy resources. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Quantified Objectives Requirement Description: Quantified objectives must establish the maximum number of housing units by income category that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved over a five -year time period (Government Code Section 65583(b) ). Housing Programs Requirement Descri ption: Local governments have the responsibility to adopt a program that implements the policies, goals and objectives of the housing element through their vested powers, particularly over land use and development controls, regulatory concessions and incen tives, and the utilization of financial resources. SB 375 amended sections of housing law to include specific Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 135 requirements, including timelines and consequences, referenced in these guidelines and described here. Programs are the specific action steps the locality will take to implement its policies and achieve its goals and objectives. Programs must include a specific time frame for implementation to have a beneficial impact toward the goals and objectives during the planning period. Programs must also identify the agencies or officials responsible for implementation. Effective program descripti ons also include immediate, short -term and long -term action steps, proposed measurable outcomes, objectives or performance measures, and specific funding sources, where appropriate (Government Code Section 65583(c) ). All housing elements must include programs to address the following six areas: Adequate Sites: The sites inventory must demonstrate adequate site capacity with appropriate zoning to accommodate the regional housing need for all income groups. Where the analysis of a local government's sites inventory does not demonstrate sufficient suitable and appropriately zoned sites to accommodate the regional housing need by income level, the element must include a program to make sites available during the planning period with appropriate zoning and development standards including meeting specific statutory requirements such as permitting residential development without discretionary action and providing sites zoned for owner occupied and rental multifamily residential uses by right . In addition, sites shall be identified as needed to facilitate and encourage the developm ent of a variety of types of housing for all income levels, including multifamily rental housing, factory -built housing, mobilehomes, housing for agricultural employees, emergency shelters, Beneficial Impact : Programs must have a schedule of actions, each with a timeline, to have a beneficial impact on the goals and objectives of the housing element within the planning period. The purpose of the clarification is to ensure program effectiveness in addressing housing needs in the planning period to better assist in meeting the housing objectives, including the objectives of SB 375. Programs must include a definitive date or deadline, or benchmarks for implementation early enough in the planning period to realize \"beneficial impacts\" and successful program implementation within the planning period. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 136 and transitional and supportive housing. In coordination with othe r general plan elements, aligning siting of adequate sites with goals can help communities improve outcomes, such as promoting infill development to address affor dability, climate change , and community health issues. Assist in the development of adequat e housing to meet the Needs of Extremely Low -, Low- and Moderate -income Households : Having assessed and identified the housing needs of extremely low -, very low -, low-, and moderate -income households, including special needs households, localities must em ploy a sufficient number of strategies to assist in developing adequate housing to meet those needs. To address this requirement, localities can utilize a variety of methods such as proactive outreach with the development community, assisting with funding and land acquisition, streamlining entitlement processes and providing concessions and incentives for development. Jurisdictions may also prioritize funding for certain income levels and special needs and focus efforts in priority growth areas. Address and Remove Governmental Constraints: For each policy, procedure or requirement identified as a governmental constraint, the element must include programs to address and remove or mitigate the constraint. Conserve and Improve the Condition of the Existing Affordable Housing Stock: The existing affordable housing stock is a valuable resource and the element must include programs to conserve and improve the existing affordable housing stock. Improvement includes physical activities that improve the housing stock such as rehabilitation. Conserva tion includes both maintenance activity such as code enforcement in deteriorating buildings or in response to complaints and improvements to the housing stock such as weatherization programs which help reduce housing costs or other actions, policies or programs to conserve the affordability of housing such as a mobileho me park preservation ordinance. The housing element can be a tool to identify and address displacement issues by including policies and programs to replace lost affordable housing, encourage new opportunities, provide rental subsidies to existing families, and increase the competitiveness of affordable housing develop ment through removal of governmental barriers, assisting with land Innovation in Affordable Housing and Regio nal Housing Needs Piedmont ADU ordinance example \u2014waiting on text approval from planning department Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 137 assemblage, developing a land banking program, or requiring a set -aide for below market rate units. Promote Housing Opportunities for All Persons: Since State and federal laws uniformly outlaw most kinds of housing discrimination, the local government's role is to identify program strategies that support and implement these laws and affirmatively further housing opportunities for all persons . Such strategies may include consultation with fair housing and counseling organizations in the community to document the incidence of housing discrimination , evaluati on of the availability of services and identification of opportunities to promote housing and community development choices throughout the community . At minimum, a local equal housing opportunity program must provide a means for the resolution of local ho using discrimination complaints and commitment to disseminate fair housing information and information about housing resources throughout the community. Preservation of Units At -risk of Converting to Market Rate Uses: The nature of conversion risk varies significantly among projects depending on the type of subsidy and related affordability controls. When units are identified at -risk, the element must include actions to preserve th e units such as monitoring, assisting with funding, outreach with developers, meeting noticing requirements and actions to assist tenants. Individual program responses should be tailored to the results of the analyses and specific local situations. Gentrification and Displacement : The opportunity to promote infill and transit oriented development (TOD) can place significant gentrification and displace ment pressures on existing lower income residents; potentially exacerbating the challenge to address important planning objectives such as climate change. In these circumstances, programs and policies to address gentrification and displacement issues may be appropriate such as policies and programs to prioritize the preservation and creation of housing affordable to lower-income households in TOD and infill areas. HCD has compiled a set of best practices to prevent gentrification and displacement. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 138 Other Considerations Climate Change Development patterns influence greenhouse gas emissions expended in the transportation sector via proximity and connectivity of jobs and housing. Residential development occupies the largest share of land use, affectin g the regional development footprint and travel patterns. Siting housing near services, transportation options, and jobs increases the effectiveness of a multi -modal transportation system. The location of housing can affect transportation in a number of w ays, including, for example, through proximity to employment and service centers, enabling less driving and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, preserving agricultural and forested lands, and enhancing environmental sustainability. Further, when affo rdable housing is not available near jobs, people may have to commute long distances, generating high rates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and GHG emissions. Denser forms of development can increase the effectiveness of these relationships, while reducin g travel time, travel costs, and the GHG emissions responsible for elevating the risks of climate change. Relaxed development standards and zoning requirements, e.g., smaller footprint and parking requirements, mixed uses, innovative ownership strategies and higher densities typical of affordable housing development , are strategies that contribute to more efficient development patterns. Transit accessibility is important for housing, jobs, and the environment. T ransit hubs record highest levels of riders hip within a quarter to half -mile radius. Studies reveal that public transit ridership drops off dramatically after a distance of four miles from transit stations, particularly for those commuting to and from places of employment, as ridership generally depends on variables including quality, frequency of stops and travel time. Lower income households account for nearly one third of all transit riders, and three quarters rely solely on Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 139 public transportation. Preserving and increasing housing choice for c ommunities that utilize public transit most will continue to contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions. As recognized by SB 375 , the housing element of general plans is a critical tool in implementing policies and programs that lower GHG emissions and promoting sustainable development. Through the housing element's site's inventory, jurisdictions must plan for where housing development will o ccur and adopt policies and programs to facilitate the development of housing. The jurisdiction can identify sites and adopt programs that direct growth in areas that promote efficient development patterns and transit use and alternative modes of transpor tation such as biking or walking. Programs to incentivize development such as mixed -use, affordable housing, and transit oriented development could include flexible development standards, fee reductions, expedited processing, and offer by -right permitting of projects that meet sustainability objectives. In addition, the housing element focuses on opportunities for rehabilitation and preservation of existing housing. This provides an important tool to target housing rehabilitation dollars to preserve older housing stock and achieve various objectives such as energy efficiency , health and transit options . Finally, the impacts of climate change on housing affordability, insurability and viability must be considered. Utilizing the Adaptation Planning Guide and other resources available by the State can help guide this consideration process. Health Housing aff ordability significantly impacts health. Affordable housing can provide increased stability, which allows families more resources for other goods and services, health care needs, and basic necessities such as healthy food. Housing location also affects a ccess to parks, recreation, grocery stores with healthy food, jobs, schools, and other community necessities. Positive health benefits, including decreasing st ress-related illnesses associated with long drive times and increased physical activity also resu lt from locating housing thoughtfully. Thus, cities and counties should see the housing element as providing an opportunity to promote health objectives . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 140 Neighborhoods designed to facilitate active transportation - walking, and biking - facilitate weight control and other health benefits. Walkability is influenced by neighborhood design and accessibility to transit, employment, schools, services and recreational opportunities and amenities. \"Safe routes to school,\" for example, is an important benefit fo r parents and children. Multifamily housing developments are often used as platforms for integrating healthcare, especially for the elderly. A number of housing developments in major metropolitan areas include health clinics and community spaces, and tena nt services for special needs populations such as elderly and disabled. Supportive services have multiple benefits, for both tenants and property management. Integrated service delivery plays a critical role with populations at risk of homelessness or ins titutionalization. Given the health impacts of having access to safe, decent, and affordable housing it remains critical th at jurisdictions plan for a variety of housing types and communities near schools, transit, and other services. The housing element allows jurisdictions to identify opportunities and adopt policies for housing development that benefits positive health outcomes. Economic Development Stable housing is a foundation for family economic well -being and thriving communities. Families in s table housing (adequate, safe and affordable) have more income in their budget available for basic living necessities, such as food, utilities, transportation to and from work, school, day care, and healthcare. Planning housing connected to transit, employ ment centers, services, schools, and destinations greatly decreases living costs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As a communitywide asset, adequate, stable housing boosts the surrounding economy, through increased local spending, employment, and revenues for local governments. Cost of shelter is the largest, non -negotiable expense for most families. When th is cost is excessive, families fall behind on rent or mortgage payments, have little or no disposable income, and often go without food, utili ties, or healthcare. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 141 Employers and regional economies are at competitive disadvantages without a sufficient supply of affordable housing. A survey of 300 companies found that one in the three reported that the lack of affordable housing nearby impacts the ability to attract or retain qualified entry- and mid -level workers. The housing element is a jurisdiction's primary tool to address issues of overcrowding, rehabilitation, and access to affordable housing opportunities. Through the housing element 's public participation process, the jurisdiction has an opportunity to identify those housing issues in the community that are of most concern and include policies and programs to address those concerns. Education Affordable Housing is a key ingredient for the educational well -being of families, facilitating educational attainment. Stable and safe housing provides a learning environment. Studies indicate that stable home environments are critical to educational outcomes. Areas of socioeconomic distress may have additional needs for educational support. The housing element can provide the linkage between housing and education through identifying key resources and polices to pro mote safe, decent, stable and affordable housing and educational attainment. For example, the sites inventory of a housing element can identify housing opportunities near schools, libraries, and educational services, promote policies to increase affordabl e housing opportunities , and encourage affordable housing developments to include essential educational programs . Coordination between housing and local school districts can help achieve mutual goals and benefits. Infill The Location Affordability Index (LAI) gives estimates of the percentage of a family's income dedicated to the combined cost of housing and transportation in a given location. The goal of the LAI is to help individuals, planners, developers, and researchers get a more complete understanding of the costs of living in a given locatio n by accounting for variations between households, neighborhoods, and regions, all of which impact affordability. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 142 Housing that is affordable to a b road range of households and income groups is constrained in many communities. Furthermore, the affordability of rental housing in many markets has gradually deteriorated. \"Infill development \" is development on previously - developed land or on parcels surrounded by previously -developed parcels. I nfill development can be an attractive option for accommodating growth and providing a mix of housing choices in many com munities - particularly as it can result in lower municipal costs for both capital improvements and long -term operations and maintenance as compared to \"greenfield\" development . Infill development provides an opportunity to revitalize economically -underut ilized land , and also conserves resources and provides environmental and health benefits. Infill development also has the potential to reduce GHG emissions to the extent that it spurs more pedestrian activity , increases transit usage , and reduces the numbe r and lengths of trips . Infrastructure and utilities must be able to support the infill envisioned through the general plan so it is important to coordinate planned infill priority areas with Capital Improvement Plans and other infrastructure investment p lanning. The sites inventory requirement of the housing element is one opportunity for identifying opportunities for infill development.

The conservation element establishes goals and policies for their retention, enhancement and development. The open space element and the land use element should work in coordination with the conservation element to guide conservation and development, balancing community needs with environmental preservation and the effects of climate change . All three of these mandatory elements must be consis tent with the others. Conservation of natural and agricultural resources is one of the State's three planning priorities ( AB 857 Wiggins ), and helps to achieve the State's climate goals. Land conservation policies may have many benefits. Agricultural land conservation can be a foundation for more permanently preserving lands at the edge of cities for their intrinsic open space values. As agricultural activities produce self -sustaining revenue, agricultural conservation can be amongst the most cost -effective means of protecting open space and promoting infill development . By maintaining a buffer zone between urban developments, agricultural lands can reduce sprawl and help to preserve the unique cultural Government Code 65302(d): (d) (1) A conservation element for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources. The conservation element shall consider the effect of development within the jurisdiction, as described in the land use element, on natural resources located on public lands, including military installations. That portion of the conservation element including waters shall be developed in coordination with any countywide water agency and with all district and city agenc ies, including flood management, water conservation, or groundwater agencies that have developed, served, controlled, managed, or conserved water of any type for any purpose in the county or city for which the plan is prepared. Coordination shall include t he discussion and evaluation of any water supply and demand information described in Section 65352.5, if that information has been submitted by the water agency to the city or county. (2) The conservation element may also cover all of the following: (A) The reclamation of land and waters. (B) Prevention and control of the pollution of streams and other waters. (C) Regulation of the use of land in stream channels and other areas required for the accomplishment of the conservation plan. (D) Prevention, control, and correction of the erosion of soils, beaches, and shores. (E) Protection of watersheds. (F) The location, quantity and quality of the rock, sand, and gravel resources. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 149 character of separate municipalities. Prime agricultural lands also help to conserve key environmental value s, including quality soil, air, and water. Finally, agricultural lands can provide a critical role in planning strategies to maintain connectivity of conserved lands, successfully preserving wildlife corridors and wetlands. This section describes the req uired components of the conservation element, provides links to suggested policies and tools to help communities in their updates and helps to achieve the State's goals. Correlations Among Elements Land Use Circulation Housing Open Space Noise Safety Conservation Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Required Contents The conservation element must address the \"conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources including Water and its hydraulic f orce Forests Soils Rivers and other waters Harbors and fisheries Wildlife Minerals, and other natural resources\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 65302(d)(1). ) The Government Code further requires the conservation element to \"consider the effect of development within the jurisdiction, as described in the land use element, on natural resources located on public lands, including military installations.\" Evaluatio n of a Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 150 jurisdiction's natural resource systems based on sound science and ecological principles is an important first step in preparing the conservation element. One role of the conservation element is to establish policies that reconcile conflicting deman ds on those resources. In recent years, some jurisdictions have adopted policies related to mitigation banking, conservation easement programs, and the state and federal Endangered Species acts in their conservation elements. Other local jurisdictions have incorporated policies related to regional greenprints or Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP) programs (see www.wildlife.ca.gov/conservation/planning/ncc p). Both of these methods present a broad - based approach to the regional protection of plants and animals and their habitats while allowing for compatible and appropriate economic activity. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife , Department of Conservation , Natural Resources Agency , and Department of Water Resources are some of the many resources available for examini ng current and future conservation needs. In addition, resource data is available for jurisdictions through the GPG mapping tool . Jurisdictions should assess the current condition of the ir natural resource systems, the ecological processes and compatibilities upon which they depend and their sustainability based on anticipated uses. Analysis of the sustainability of resource uses should take into accoun t changing burdens on local ecosystems as a result of a changing climate or other environmental conditions , and should measure the values that these resources contribute to the community and state (see sidebar below on nature's services). In their evaluation of natural resources , municipalities should identify priority areas to conserve that offer the most effective and efficient protection of the natural resource systems, and focus policies on those resources or areas. Greenprints , or sustainability plans seeking to balance conservation with growth, are one example of incorporating \"green infrastructure\" into General Plans (see more below). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 151 The following sections include descriptions of each of the requirement with links to model policies and useful information. Some of the requirements will not be locally relevant for all communities. For example, a land -locked county with no river ports would likely not need to address harbors in its conservation element. It i s up to the jurisdiction to choose how to arrange their treatment of the various required issues, which may overlap with one another when addressed in the conservation element's goals and policies. Natural Resources as Nature's Benefits ; Greenprints and Conservation A conservation element can include a quantification and explanation of the benefits that the community obtains from their surrounding ecosystems. Communities' well -being depends on the benefits that nature provides for free, every day and everywhere. For example, we depend on ecosystems such as forests and for clean water, fertile soils, food, fuel, storm protection, minerals and flood control. These benefits, often called \"nature's benefits\" are commonly categorized into four broad categ ories: provisioning, such as the production of food and water; regulating, such as the control of climate and disease; supporting, such as nutrient cycles and crop pollination; and cultural, such as spiritual and recreational benefits. To help inform plann ing decisions, these benefits can be assigned economic values , values that measure other non -monetary benefits to the community, and values that demonstrate the benefits gained when vario us natural resources mutually reinforce each other. These benefits and services can be expressed in a \"Greenprint ,\" such as those developed under the federal sustainable communities initiative , which can help municipalities and regions to analyze and plan for these cross -cutting and community -supporting benefits in their general plan updates and apply innovative and successful strategies for implementation. For more information on ecosystem services see http://www.fs.fed.us/ecosystemservices/ http://www.nature.org/science -in-action/ec osystem -services.xml http://www.nature.org/science -in-action/ecosystem -services.xml Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 152 * Local governments can dramatically impact the type and a mount of water used and conserved within their jurisdictions through land use decisions. For example, requiring more compact development types can significantly reduce per capita water use. Limiting new impervious cover in key recharge areas can protect groundwater supplies. Low impact development strategies can redirect stormwater from sewer lines to recharge areas, and thereby enhance water supplies. The California Water Plan provides strategies, resou rces, and tools for water management and conservation throughout the State. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 153 Water and Its Hydraulic Force Requirement Description: The discussion of water in the conservation element must be prepared in coordination with \"any countywide water agency and w ith all district and city agencies, including flood management, water conservation, or groundwater agencies that have developed, served, controlled, managed, or conserved water of any type for any purpose in the county or city for which the plan is prepare d,\" and must include any information on water supply and demand prepared pursuant to Government Code section 65352.5 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65302(d)(1). ) Specific information must be shared with groundwater agencies. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) allows local jurisdictions to customize groundwater plans based on their specific needs. Discussion of water should analyze water needs for domes tic, agricultural, ecological and industrial uses, and provide for the conservation of water supplies and protection of aquatic ecosystems as a beneficial use. Land use choices affect water demand long into the future. When evaluating the feasibility of po ssible land use patterns , municipalities should work with water agencies to consider projected available water resources under a changing climate, and water conservatio n measures to ensure a sustainable water supply, rather than simply deferring to water a gencies to meet any projected demand. Jurisdictions may want to form joint committees to synchronize planning timelines between water and land use, coordinate with local integrated regional water management plan s (IRWM), or consider using watersheds as their planning area or explicitly acknowledge their rela tionship to an existing watershed. Smaller urban development footprints (i.e. concentrated development) protects and enhances the watershed, improving water supply, flood management, and water quality. The California Water Plan currently projects diminishing reliability in water supplies of 3 -5% in the next twenty years. Existing water sources may also become less reliable due to climate change and development. The conservation element is inextricably connected to the land use and open space elements. The decision in County of Amador v. El Dorado Cou nty Water Agency helps to further clarify the relationship between availability of water and development: \"in determining whether and where to permit development, a county must necessarily consider the availability of consumptive water supplies. If additi onal water supplies are available, growth and development are feasible. Conversely, if that water is not available, growth is necessarily limited.\" (County of Amador v. E l Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 154 951). The Government Code and Water Code additionally require water supply districts to prepare water supply verifications and assessments for some large -scale projects, including subdivisions of ov er 500 dwelling units. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 66473.7 ; Water Code \u00a7\u00a7 10910 -10915 .) A water supply assessment is intended to play an informational role, and a project may move forward even when a water supply assessment fails to identify sufficient water sources. However, t he water supply verificatio n comes at the final approval stage of project development, and a subdivision cannot be approved if adequate water supplies do not exist at this stage . (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66473.7(b)(1). National Flood Insurance Rate Program maps , Central Valley Flood Protection Board's designated floodway maps , dam failure inundation maps , information available from the California Department of Water Resources , U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , the Federal Emergency Management Agency and historical data on flooding all provide useful information for identifying flood -prone areas for floodwater management purposes. Aspects of floodwater management must also be addressed in the land use and safety elements, and local governments may want to consider combining these discussions in their general plans. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 65302(a), 65302(g)(2) ).Government Code provides further requirements on development in flood hazards zones (defined in Gov.

Possible topics to addres s include protection of oak woodlands and urban forests, analysis of possible future development wit hin resource areas, the need for suitable and predicted -to-be suitable habitat management for the mitigation of climate change, precipitation retention for watershed management and attenuation of flood waters, aesthetics, cultural use, com mercial value of forests, and of timber resources subject to timberland production zoning (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51104(e) , 51110 - 51119.5. ) California's forests are valuable assets and their conservation provides many benefits to the natural and built environments. As trees grow and develop, their value to the forest ecosystem and climate change mitigation increases. Older trees sequester significantly more carbon than young trees and are necessary for nutrient cycles for nitrogen and phosphorous. These nutrients are the most limited and , if not maintained properly, could eventually deplete t he soil . Trees and source wood left on site significantly contribute to the abundance of biodiversity and the prevention of habitat loss and displacement. Trees in forest and urban areas act as micro and macro climate buffers by mo derating temperatures and moisture. Conservation of forests should be balanced with the proper action to prevent risk from wildfires ( see the Safety Element for more information). As climate change persists and temperatures rise, wildfires will continue to grow in size, frequency, and total area burned. Throughout its history, California experienced frequent fires by lightning and burning regimes. These fires were a critical factor in developing the composition, structure, and pattern of vegetation throughout the state's landscapes. In order to prevent destructive wildfires and restore and maintain resilient landscapes policies should be developed appropriate for local conditions to mitigate potential losses due to wildfire. Policies for mitigating potential losses should also consider approaches to Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 156 maintain healthy forests, including: prescribed burns, fuel breaks, wildfire protection zones, forest thinning and grazing. Fuel treatm ent manipulates and removes fuel to reduce fire intensity with methods such as lopping, chipping, crushing, piling and burning. Fuel treatment is critical to enhance protection of forests as well as develop resilience. As a guiding resource, OPR's Fire Hazard Planning Technical Advisory includes a detailed discussion about how to incorporate and comply with the fire hazard requirements in a general plan. Forest conservation practices also present the opportunity to conserve species in their native habitat. Collaboration with local tribes, resource conservation districts, non -government conservation organizations, and other government entities may help determine the best tools for ecosystem restoration, wildfire prevention, and wildlife habitat enhancement. The management and protection of forests should take into account anticipated changes in coming decades in temperature, changes in the viability or presence o f particular wildlife populations in response to warming trends, and the impact on forestry resources of increased extreme weather events and more intense forest fire seasons .

SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATIO N IN ANALYSIS OF THI S ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of analysis Recommended Data Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 157 Soils Requirement Description: Soils provide the fundamental resour ces necessary for the production of food, fiber and other agricultural products. Healthy soil resources, rich in soil organic matter, are essential to crop production, watershed functioning, carbon sequestration, and the support of vegetation. Highly produ ctive soil resources that support agricultural production and ecosystem services are a finite resource; thus requiring long -term conservation. Soil management and conservation practices , such as cover cropping, crop rotation, mulching, and nutrient management, may help support healthy soils and conservation goals. The Natural Resources Classification System and the Storie Index provide useful tools for assessing and inventorying farmland soils, as does the Farmland Mapping & Monitoring Program of the state Department of Conservation. Consultation with the municipality's local Resource Conservation District may also be helpful in assessing soil resources and in developing policies focused on the management of agricultural soils consistent with the Resource Conservation District's broader agricultural strategy. The conservation element is an appropriate place to identi fy soils necessary for agricultural production and include policies that promote the conservation of these resources. Preservation of prime agricultural land, and identification of water availability for that land, can be a foundation for improving and ma intaining soil while more permanently preserving lands , improving the economy, and preserving biological resources, and should be coordinated with the land use element . Local governments should consider identifying areas for inclusion in Agricultural Preserves under the Williamson Act. Gov. Code, \u00a7 51200 et seq ). Additionally, conservation easements on agricultural lands, working with willing landowners and land trusts, can also serve to protect soil resources and constitute feasible mitigation to lessen impacts on agri cultural resources, including highly productive soils. The soils is an appropriate place to identify areas subject to slides and erosion and to include policies focusing on erosion prevention , one of the optional issues listed in Government Code section 65302(d)(2 ).

As with water and its hydraulic force, any discussion of water in the conservation element must be prepared in coordination with \" any countywide water agency and with all district and city agencies, including flood management, water conservation, or groundwater agencies that have developed, served , controlled, managed, or conserved water of any type for any purpose in the county or city for which the plan is prepared,\" and must include any information on water supply and demand prepared pursuant to Government Code section 65352.5 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65302(d)(1). Topics to address as applica ble include identification of existing and potential water pollution sources, the benefits that these resources provide to the community, opportunities for protection and restoration and of water sources for which reclamation is feasible. Policies should t ake into account the impacts of future development on water bodies and aim to protect or improve water quality . Preservation of flood plains and innovative methods of flood control, such as making \"room for the river,\" can have positive benefits for related elements of the plan. Rivers, lakes, streams, bays, harbors, estuaries, marshes, and reservoirs might be affected by climate change impacts such as decreased snow pack, changes in precipitation, and sea level rise. Certain areas may also be important for groundwater recharge. Municipalities should consider taking these projected impacts into account when planning for the protection of their water bodies.

This sub -element has significant overlap with the circulation element, and may be combined with it at the local government's discretion. Policies in general p lans should be consistent with harbor and port master plans developed under the California Coastal Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 30000 et seq .) Fisheries are an important component of California's economy, and their careful management ensures their viability into the future. Possible topics to address in the fisheries sub-elements include evaluation of existing and projected future water quality, temperature, and sources of contaminants in bodies of water used for subsistence, recreational, and commercial fishing, expected impacts of climate change on habitat and fisheries and policies that protect and rehabilitate those water bodies , and preservation of riparian, tidal, and wetland habitat connected to waterways .

This must include wildlife that is rare, threatened, or endangered species under state and federal law. (See, Fish & G. Code, \u00a7 2050 et seq ; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 et seq. ) Planning for wildlife habitats should account for current habitats, health of wildlife, projected changes in such habitat due to climate change, wildlife conservation, furthering responsible development and addressing the needs of a growing human population, habitat connectivity and potential threats to such habitat from development pressures, fragmentation a nd edge effects. The conservation element's focus on wildlife should be consistent with State Wildlife Action Plan , Califor nia Essential Habitat Connectivity Project , Regional Advance Mitigation Plans, conservation plans developed by the state and regional entities, Habitat Conservation Plans (e.g. California Endangered Species Act (CESA) , California Environmental Quality Act Review (CEQA) , Lake and S teambed Alteration Program (LSA) , Timberland Conservation Program , Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP) , Conservation and Mitigation Banking , Invasive Species Program , Native Plant Program ) and other management plans, and should include coordination with other government agencies involved in wildlife preservation. Due to the considerable overlap between habitat lands and a gricultural lands, multiple benefits for wildlife and agriculture may be gained by coordinating conservation plans and strategies. The California Agriculture Vision Document highlights relationships between habitat and agricultural conservation, and presents strategies for conservation of both.

The minerals sub-element should inventory mineral resources and locate mineral resources designated by the State Mining and Geology Board under the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act ( Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 2710 et seq. .), and include polices that plan for the protection, use, and development of mineral resources. 'Other natural resource s' may include agricultural resources, wetlands, air, and energy producing resources. Some municipalities also include paleontological and archaeological resources in this section. Model policies include those that assess air quality and coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to improve it, identify agricultural resources using the Natural Resources Conservation Service's land inventory and monitoring criteria inventory and incl ude plans for the preservation of wetlands , and inventory energy resources including wind, solar, hydroelectric, and biomass resources. Air quality policies should be consist ent with regional air quality and transportation plans. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 162 SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATIO N IN ANALYSIS OF THI S ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of analysis Recommended Data Floodwater Management Requirement Description: To address floodwater management in the conservation element, the city or county should collect information concerning its flood plains and its watershed. DWR has updated its Best Available Maps to display the latest floodplains. DWR has expanded the floodplains to cover all counties in the State and to include 100 -, 200-, and 500 -year floodplains for display. OES and DWR have informa tion on past flood and flood levels based on awareness mapping. Local levee districts and resource conservation may also have information to share. DWR also completed the 2012 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan , as defined in Senate Bill (SB) 5 (2007), which provides a guide for state participation with managing flood risk along the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River. The 2012 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan (CVFPP) provides data and analysis that include the locations of flood hazard zones; goals, policies, and objectives based on that data and analysis; and feasible implement ation measures designed to carry out these goals, policies, and objectives. The CVFPP includes a Groundwater Recharge Opportunity Analysis , which can also be useful in considering waterways and water bodies This document summarizes the approach and findings of an evaluation of groundwater recharge project types and general locations that could be used to integrate groundwater recharge and groundwater storage with the flood managem ent system for the dual benefits of increasing flood management flexibility and water supply reliability. DWR also recommends work with applicable agencies to incorporate improvements in flood control channels that provide opportunities for stormwater retention and groundwater recharge, when major upgrades and/or reconstruction may be required when feasible.

County of Madera (1974) 38 Cal. App. 3d 303, 307 ; see also Cal. Const. Art. XIII, \u00a7 8. ) Together with the conservation element, an open space element identifies areas that provide value in an essentially undeveloped co ndition and provides a plan to preserve such areas. The conservation element should be used to inform and support both the open space element and the land use element, guiding the identification of resource areas that should remain undeveloped and those t hat are appropriate for future development. The open space element reinforces the conservation element by guiding the comprehensive and long -range preservation open space lands that are important to the conservation of the state's natural resources. Open space land is defined as any parcel or area of land or water that is essentially unimproved and devoted to open-space use (\u00a765560(b)). Such lands may provide value related to, among other things, recreation, habitat, biodiversity, wildlife conservation aesthetics, economy, climate change Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 167 mitigation and adaptation, flood risk reduction, managed natural resources production , agricultural production, and protecti on from hazardous conditions. Because open space issues are broad in nature and overlap those of several elements, consistency among elements must be considered carefully. For example, issues covered in the land use element regarding agriculture, natural resources, recreation, enjoyment of scenic beauty, and public grounds are also subject to consideration in the open space element . The open space element is interrelated to other elements, overlapping with the conserv ation element when referring to open space dedicated to the preservation of natural resources and the managed production of resources , the safety element when considering open space for public health and safety , and the housing and land use elements when determining the suitability of sites for future development. Correlations Among Elements Land Use Circulation Housing Conservation Noise Safety Open Space Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Required Contents The Government Code requires an open space element to contain detailed information about several categories of undeveloped land. Specifically, the open spac e element must inventory the following broad categories of open space: Open space for natural resources Open space for managed production of resources Open space for outdoor recreation Open space for public health and safety Open space for military support Open space for tribal resources The inventory must be reflected on maps, and policies must provide for conservation of such areas wherever possible (Gov. Code \u00a7 65562(a) ). The General Plan Guidelines Mapping Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 168 Tool is a useful tool to help communities identify existing resources, including natural resources, roads, buildings, and d emographics, and develop open space inventories accordingly. The tool pulls data from multiple state and federal sources, and allows supplemental data layers from local jurisdictions. Users can use the tool to map known resources, assets, and needs across their community. Policies must also be coordinated with state and regional plans. An action plan must be included that will guide implementation and provide for long term preservation of open spaces (\u00a765564 ). These specific requirements are described in greater detail below. Inventory Requirement Description : The open space element must contain an inventory of specified categories of land , and the inventory must be illustrated on a map or maps. The inventory must include any parcel in one of the listed categories that: (1) is \"essentially unimproved\" and (2) designated on any local, regional or state open -space plan. (Gov. Code \u00a7 65560(b)(1) ; Save El Toro Assn. v. Days (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 64. ) Note that when deciding whether to include a particular parcel, the parcel need not be completely vacant. The statute calls for inclusion of parcels that are \"essentially un improved.\" Also, categories of open space are defined in very broad terms in the statute. Thus, designations in local, regional and state plans need not actually use the words \"open space\" in order to be included in the inventory. In general, a plan should err on the side of inclusion. Examples of regional and state plans that could include open space designations include, among others: Sustainable communities strategies and alternative planning strategies adopted by metropolitan planning organizations in regional transportation plans Habitat conservation plans (HCP) and natural community conservation plans (NCCP) Regional greenprints Regional Conservation Assessments Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 169 Regional park district plans Agricultural lands designated on Department of Conservati on farmland maps The specific categories of open space that must be included in the inventory are set forth below. Open space for natural resources Requirement Description: The inventory must identify open space for natural resources, including, but not l imited to: Areas required for the preservation of plant and animal life, including habitat for fish and wildlife species . Such areas m ay include: Areas designated in Habitat Conservation Plans and Natural Community Conservation Plans Critical habitat id entified pursuant to the Endangered Species Act Conservation easements Areas identified in greenprints and Regional Conservation Assessments Parks and trails Areas designated by federal, state, regional and local agencies and governments as important habi tat Existing forest and woodland areas set aside for mitigation Areas important for habitat connectivity Areas required for ecologic and other scientific study purposes . Such areas might include preserves, parks and other land used by universities to study agricultural, wildlife habitats, and other natural systems. Rivers, streams, bays and estuaries; riparian areas; and coastal beaches, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams, and watershed lands . Virtually all waters within a jurisdiction should be identified in the open space element. Upland areas connected to such waters should also be identified. Such area may be identified in Basin Plans, watershed plans, and other planning documents produced by the State Water Resources Control Board, Regional Wate r Quality Control Boards, and other regional entities.

Forest lands must be maintained in an efficient way to support the continued cultivation of timberland (Gov Code \u00a751101 , \u00a751102 ). With an increasing state population these forest areas need to be protected against encroaching development to preserve their ecological services as well as economic vitality. Timberland Production Zones are restricted for the production of timber or compatible use and should not be converted for urban services. Forest and rangelands information is available fro m the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's California Forest and Range Assessment . Information regarding agricultural lands is available from the Department of Conservation's maps and inventory , California Protected Areas Database, CCED - California Conse rvation Easement Database , National Conservation Easement Database (NCED) , and Conservation Easements Registry . Many local governments also produce t heir own information regarding locally important lands. Areas required for recharge of groundwater basins .

A city or county should consult with any regional park and open space district in identifying such are as. Jurisdictions should inventory existing recreational space, and assess present and future demand based on population, demographic, and development trends. Including existing and planned open space for recreation on th e land use map can help coordinate future development with anticipated recreational needs.

The Native American Heritage Commission can help identify the appropriate tribes to engage in consultation. Jurisdictions must consult with Nati ve American tribes during an amendment or update to a general plan (Gov. Code \u00a7 65562.5 ). The following are categories of open space that should b e included in the Open Space Element (Government Code \u00a7 65560(b)(6) : Public land containing any Native American sanctified cemetery, place of worship, religious or ceremonial site, or sacred shrine. The Native American Heritage Commission can provide access to such information. Native American historic, cultural, or sacred site, that is listed or may be eligible for listing in the California R egister of Historic Resources pursuant to Section 5024.1.

OPR Recommended Policies These policies are an example of recommended policies adopted by varying jurisdictions, to be modified and used as appropriate . A full list of recommended policies can be found here Sample Policy Example of Application Relationship to Other Elements Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 179 Noise Element Introduction Noise surrounds us; it is a constant presence in everyday life. A noisy community can be an excellent indicator of a healthy community: the noise from busy shops, children playing, and public transportation are all signs of a healthy, thriving community. It is also the case that noise is often defined as unwanted sound , surrounding busy transportation corridors, recreational areas, and construction zones . Unwanted sound , however, is often subjective and will vary by community. Unwanted noise near a school will differ from unwanted noise near a commercial business area. Local planning areas will need to keep noise in mind and adopt innovative approaches to minimize exposure to excessi ve noise. When considering the proposed development of communities, tradeoffs must be weighed in terms of, at times, paradoxical goals. This is especially evident in consideration of noise, and how to mitigate its effects. The purpose of the noise elemen t is to ensure that a local planning area limits the exposure Government Code 65302(f): (1) A noise element that shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community. The noise element shall analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and projected noise levels for all of the followin g sources: (A) Highways and freeways. (B) Primary arterials and major local streets. (C) Passenger and freight online railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems. (D) Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport operation s, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation. (E) Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards. (F) Other ground stationary noise sources, including, but not limited to, military installations, identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment. (2) Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in terms of community noise equ ivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn). The noise contours shall be prepared on the basis of noise monitoring or following generally accepted noise modeling techniques for the various sources identified in paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive. (3) The noise contours shall be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 180 of the community to excessive noise levels in noise -sensitive areas and at noise -sensitive times of day. Correlations among Elements Land Use Circulation Housing Conservation Open Space Safety Noise Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Required Contents The noise element should cover the issues and sources of noise relevant to the local planning area. The element should utilize the most accurate and up-to-date information available to reflect the noise environment, stationary sources of noise, predicted levels of noise, and the impacts of noise on local residents. It should be as detailed as necessary to describe the local situation and offer solutio ns to local noise issues. In 1976, the Department of Health Services issued the first Noise Element Guidelines pursuant to Health and Safety Code \u00a746050.1 , followed shortly thereafter by a model noise ordinance. In 1984, revisions to the general plan statutes made extensive changes to the noise element requirements (Chapter 1009, Statutes of 1984). These revisions shortened the list of issues requi red by statute and gave flexibility to local governments in analyzing the issues and subjects pertinent to the local planning area. The Department of Health Services Office of Noise Control no longer exists, but the principles developed and referenced her ein are still valid and widely in use statewide. In 2014, Governor Brown signed legislation to allow the Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to update the noise element guidelines of Government Code section 65302 (f)), since the Office of Noise Control is defunct. ((Gov. Code s ection 65302 (f) Amended by Stats. 2014, Ch. 201, Sec. 8. Effective January 1, 2015. ) OPR may update the noise element Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 181 guidelines in the near future. The existing Noise Element Guidelines are in appendix D , and may be u sed in addition to this chapter to develop noise elements. Local governments should keep in mind that some development goals, such as infill, may create noisier places that are louder but acceptable. The hubbub of a busy street may be pleasant to some people.. Noise mitigation measures are especially important in infill areas. Louder outdoor areas such as parks, school playgrounds, and the exterior of buildings may significantly exceed interior noise , so long as there is adequate noise mitigation and quiet indoor space available. The noise element must include implementat ion measures and possible solutions to existing and foreseeable noise issues. Furthermore, the policies and standards must be sufficient to serve as a guideline for compliance with sound transmission control requirements (Gov Code\u00a765302 (f)(4)). The noise element should be used to guide decisions concerning land use and the location of new roads and transit facilities since these are common source s of excessive noise levels. Proposed land uses should be analyzed to ensure they are compatible with existing users in the surrounding area, especially where there are residential developments and other sensitive receptors, such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship. Additionally, construction noise, especially in urban areas, can be mitigated with local policies based on community values, such as limiting construction hours or days. There are many noise related planning resources available. The C altrans Office of Transportation Laboratory publishes the Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for and numerous reports on mitigating transportation noise. The California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook , published by Caltrans' Division of Aeronautics, includes noise information relating to airports. The Federal Highway Administ ration has published multiple noise reports, including a Construction Noise Handbook , Highway Traffic Noise: Analysis and Abatement Guide , Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment , and Synthesis of Noise Effects on Wildlife Populations . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 182 Statutory Requirements Local governments must identify noise problems in the community, and analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, current and projected noise levels, for specific land uses (Gov. Code section 65302(f)(1) ). These land uses include highways and freeways, major local streets, passenger and freight railroads and ground rapid transit systems, planes and airports, industrial plans, and other ground stationary noise sources, including but not limited to military installations. (Gov. Code section 65302(f)(1)(A -F)). The general plan's noise element must show contours for these noise sources , to the extent practicable, in either Community Noise Equivalent Levels (CNEL) or day -night average level (Ldn). These noise contours must be prepared using noise monitoring or accepted noise - modeling techniques. The noise contours must be used as a guide to establish a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community res idents to excessive noise (Gov. Code 65302 (f)(2), (3) ). Local airports are subject to the noise requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration and noise standards under Title 21, \u00a75000, et seq ., of the California Code of Regulations. These standards are designed to encourage the airport proprietor, aircraft operators, local governments, pilots, and Caltrans to work cooperatively to diminish excessive noi se. The Federal Aviation Act, however, preempts local regulations controlling noise at airports themselves and limits arrival and departure times of jet aircraft flights. ( See City of Bur bank v. Lockheed Air Terminal (1973) 93 S.Ct 1854 and 53 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen 75 (1970)). Proposed school sites within two nautical miles of an airport runway or potential runway in an airport master plan are subject to stricter noise levels pursuant to revie w by CalTrans Division of Aeronautics ( CCR Title 21 section 3570 , and Education Code 17215 ) which state that CalTrans shall object to the acquisition of a school site within a 65 decibel annual CNEL aircraft noise contour.

See Appendix D for more information about these t wo types of noise measurements and noise descriptors. Noise should be measured at multiple receptors. The volume of traffic noise, construction noise, and the noise of an environment (such as loud schools, playgrounds, or agricultural areas) and how we pe rceive it depends on many factors, including the location of dwellings and the location and types of trips we make in our neighborhoods on our way to school, work, or shopping.16 Measuring noise at multiple receptors throughout a community will ensure that the noise element is accurate. The noise element should address the following: Major noise sources, both mobile and stationary Ground borne vibration noise from public transit, freight trains, or light rail transit lines Existing and projected levels of n oise and noise contours for major noise sources Existing and projected land uses in relation to existing and projected noise sources Existing and proposed sensitive receptors, including: o Residential land uses o Hospitals o Convalescent homes o Schools o Churches o Sensitive wildlife habitat, including the habitat of rare, threatened, or endangered species Time-of-day, day -of-week, or seasonable variability of noise sources Locations where noise -generating activities are desired 16 Botteldooren, D., Dekoninck, L., Gillis, D., The Influence of Traffic Noise on Appreciation of the Living Quality of a Neighborhood, Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health (2011). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 185 The process to create the noise elem ent should include, but is not limited to, the following steps: Survey the community to determine the types of preferred and unwanted noise, and the location and extent of noise incompatibility in the community Explore methods of noise attenuation to min imize exposure to excessive noise Research methods to protect residences and other sensitive receptors from excessive noise Draft implementation measures and possible solutions that address existing and foreseeable noise problems Noise Contours and Expos ure To analyze and quantify the local noise environment, noise level contours, expressed in CNEL or Ldn, should be mapped for the area surrounding each of the identified noise sources. Projections of future noise sources, noise levels, and anticipated impa cts, including health impacts, upon existing and proposed land uses should provide information useful for guiding decisions about land use, locations of noise generating sources, and noise reduction mitigation measures. The noise element should also identi fy areas of conflict between noise sources and sensitive uses to minimize exposure to excessive noise. Noise contours, from all applicable sources, must be mapped and used to inform land use decisions. Mapping noise contours creates an opportunity to engage the community in a practical discussion about noise, and the tradeoffs between noise and other local priorities. Not all noise can be minimized, and there may even be areas where noise is desired. Some noise sources are inherent to a region, such as no ise generated from farming activities in agriculture intensive areas, or wildlife noise from nearby habitat. While urban infill developments can be noisy environm ents, they are often healthy communities . Residents whom opt to live in infill developments may welcome such noise, and there are many ways to minimize harmful exposure to excessive noise. Local planning areas are encouraged to embrace the noise characteristics inherent to their region and \"design with noise in mind\" to minimize harmful exposure to excessive noise. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 186 Mitigation Measures To minimize exposure to excessive noise, the noise element should identify t he best means of noise mitigation for a community. Mitigation measures include soundproofing with soundproof windows and insulation, landscaping and berms, building design and setbacks, buffer areas, operating hours of major sources, roadway maintenance an d traffic flow, quieter pavement strategies, and other techniques. Noise mitigation measures are not one -size-fits-all solutions: some noise mitigation measures are better suited for some communities than others. For example, while sound walls may be a fi tting mitigation measure for a rural area, they may not be the best mitigation solution for urban infill areas, as sound walls can impair community connectivity. Consider increased building setback zones or buffer zones: while these may be appropriate mitigation measures where land is not a constraint, it is unlikely that such measures would be feasible in more urban areas where land is limited. The noise element should be flexible and consider the different needs of various communities in a local planning area to determine the best measures to minimize exposure to excessive noise. Caltrans administers several freeway noise control programs. In general, these are applied to residential and school uses that existed before the particular freeway was construct ed. For instance, noise attenuating walls are installed along the freeway frontages of qualified residential development under the New Construction or Reconstruction and Community Noise Abatement programs. In addition, there are a number of schools adjacen t to freeways that have qualified for School Noise Abatement Program funds for the acoustical attenuation of classrooms. Some critics of sound walls feel that they can isolate communities. Whenever practicable, noise mitigation should be an unobtrusive as possible. Implementation measures Minimization of excessive noise will depend on the success and effectiveness of a local planning area's implementation measures. A critical implementation measure is a noise control ordinance. Noise control ordinances are generally used to resolve short -term noise problems, but they can also be helpful when evaluating the creation of a potential nuisance, or expansion of a major source near sensitive sources. Local planning areas should also regularly update their noise ma ps so that planning efforts are consistent. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 187 Other Considerations Noise and Health Exposure to excessive noise can have health impacts. The most common health impact from excessive noise exposure is sleep disturbance.17 Sleep disturbance can impair cogn itive performance, and alter hormone levels, heart rate, sleep patterns, and mood. Other potential health impacts from exposure to excessive noise include increased levels of hypertension, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease.18 Fortunately, the re are multiple options to minimize excessive noise exposure and reduce potential health impacts. Minimization measures include options such as soundproofing a residence to reduce outdoor -to-indoor noise, requiring new residences to place bedrooms in the q uietest part of the floor plan, and reducing traffic noise will all minimize exposure to excessive noise and reduce potential health risks. Noise and Infill Development Considerations Ground borne Vibration Noise Ground borne vibration is manmade noise c aused by vibrations of the ground due to explosions, construction, or railway and transit movement. Especially for local planning areas where sensitive use areas are, or will be, located near transit centers or railway lines, ground borne vibration should be included in the noise element. Ground borne vibration is already included in the noise section of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Environmental Review Checklist. California Code of Regulations, Title 14, \u00a7 15000 et seq., 17 King, G., et al, Noise Levels Associated with Urban Land Use, Journal of Urban Health: Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine, Vol. 89, No. 6, p. 1017, 1028. 18 Id at 1018. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 188 Appendix G, subd. XII (c) ). Addressing ground borne vibration in the noise element of a General Plan will ensure greater consistency between a General Plan and CEQA. Infill development helps reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions and is encouraged as part of the State's Planning Priorities . Rail and public transit are key tools for infill development. To the extent ground borne vibration is an issue, it should be mitigated and planned for, with the high value of rail and public transit in mind. While cars and buses do cause gro und borne vibration, it is usually caused by rough or uneven roadways. The repair of any bumps, cracks, potholes on the roadway surface will dramatically reduce or solve ground borne vibration from vehicles. Ground borne vibration noise from rail systems typically stems from degraded wheel and rail surfaces. Routine maintenance of wheel and rail surfaces is critical to control ground borne vibration. When vibration persists despite routine wheel and rail maintenance, other solutions to control vibration f rom rail systems include: Special track support systems such as floating slabs, resiliency supported ties, high reliance fasteners and ballast mats Trenches along the railway to act as a vibration barrier Reduction in vehicle speed near sensitive use sites Building modifications for nearby buildings with vibration -sensitive equipment affected by rail vibration Expansion of the rail right -of-way or purchase of a vibration easement See the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment for further guidelines on ground borne vibration and various mitigation strategies. Ground borne vibration is especially relevant for areas expected to benefit f rom California's High Speed Rail. The project will stretch from Sacramento to San Diego, with up to twenty - four stations. The project will also invest in local and regional rail lines. Areas expected to benefit from the project should consider effects of g round borne vibration in their noise element. See the project's Environmental Impact Report/Statement Noise and Vibration Mitigation Guidelines Technical Ap pendix for more information.

CITY OF SACRAMENTO LAND USE , CIRCULATION , HOUSING , HEALTHY COMMUNITIES , SOCIAL EQUITY Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 192 Safety Element Introduction The aim of the safety element is to reduce the potential risk of death, injuries, property damage, and economic and social dislocation re sulting from fires, floods, droughts, eart hquakes, landslides, as well as other hazards and climate change impacts. Other locally relevant safety issues, such as airport land use, emergency response, hazardous materials spills, and crime reduction, may als o be included. Some local jurisdictions have chosen to incorporate their hazardous waste management plans into their safety elements. The safety element overlaps topics also mandated in the land use, conservation, and open - space elements, as development pl ans must adequately account for public safety considerations and open space for public health and ecological benefits often incorporate areas of increased hazard risk. When preparing a new general plan or undertaking a comprehensive revision of an existing general plan, OPR suggests addressing these common topics in a single place rather than spreading them among four separate elements. The key concern should be to integrate effectively these common issues into the decision -making process. The safety eleme nt must identify hazards and hazard abatement provisions to guide local decisions related to zoning, subdivisions, and entitlement permits. The element should contain general hazard and risk reduction strategies complementary with those of the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan. Ideally, the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan would be incorporated into the safety element as outlined below . Policies should identify hazards and emergency Government Code 65302(g): (g) (1) A safety element for the protectio n of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence; liquefact ion; and other seismic hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with Section 2690) of Division 2 of the Public Resources Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and urban fires. The safety elemen t shall include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It shall also address evacuation routes, military installations, peakload water supply requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to ide ntified fire and geologic hazards. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 193 response priorities , as well as mitigation through avoidance of hazards by new proje cts and reduction of risk in developed areas. As California confronts mounting climate change impacts, effective planning measures should include comprehensive hazard mitigation and emergency response strategies that account for heightened frequency and magnitude of wildfires, floods, droughts, extreme heat, and coastal storm damage. Communities may use the safety element as a vehicle for defining \"acceptable risk\" and the basis for determining the level of necess ary mitigation. Policies may include methods of minimizing risks, as well as ways to minimize economic disruption and expedite recovery following disasters. Climate change will affect and potentially exacerbate the impact of other hazards rather than being solely a distinct hazard with unique impacts. For example, extreme heat and heat waves are existing hazard s that will be exacerbated by climate change. Impacts of climate change on the frequency, timing, and magnitude of flooding var y with the geography throughout the state. Areas that experience early run off from snow melt coupled with intensified rain or coastal areas experiencing sea level rise may be more greatly impacted by flooding. Hazards that have t he potential to be affected by climate change are grouped in this subsection. AB2140 Under the federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA2K), each municipality must develop a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP) or participate in a multi -jurisdictional LHMP in order to be eligible for pre -disaster mitigation grants or post -disaster recov ery assistance from the federal government. Climate Change An increasingly important factor affecting disaster management functions is climate change. Climate Change reflects new uncertainties and factors shaping and conditioning hazard mitigation planning. Chapter 4.5 in the 2013 California State Hazard Mitigation Plan (SHMP) addresses a specific approach for local communities to evaluate their risk as a result of climate change. The Safety Element of the general plan plays an important role in ensuring consistency with the Local Hazard Mitigation P lan (LHMP) and the SHMP. The general plan and LHMP both provide a local vehicle for implementation of the SHMP, including the provisions dealing with climate change. The SHMP outlines tools, resources and a process for addressing climate change at the loc al level. The resources the SHMP and LHMP guidance materials reference are the same materials referenced in Chapter 8 of the General Plan Guidelines, Climate Change. (add link back) This provides for consistency across multiple documents such as an adaptat ion plan, climate action plan, general plan, implementation plan, local hazard mitigation plan, etc.. For more information refer to the website for the State Hazard Mitigation Plan . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 194 At the state level, AB 2140 (2006) authorizes , local governments to integrate their LHMPs into the safety eleme nts of their general plans. Integration is encouraged through a post - disaster financial incentive which authorizes the state to use available California Disaster Assistance Act funds to cover local shares of the 25% non -federal portion of grant -funded post-disaster projects. AB 2140 is one of the most important links between general plans and hazard mitigation in California. Integration of the LHMP into the safety element provides an excellent vehicle for implementation of the LHMP. This integration allows hazard mitigation strategies to be implemented and local hazard awareness to be upgraded and enhanced. In addition, all other elements of the general plan, as well as implementation programs (such as zoning, subdivision maps, specific plans, and capital improvement programs), would be required to comply with an LHMP that it is adopted with the safety element. See AB 2140 (2006) for language regarding the safety element's relationship to Local Hazard Mitigation Plans. Correlations among Elements Land Use Circulation Housing Conservation Open Space Noise Safety Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Required Contents The safety element must, consistent with Government Code Section 65302( g), provide the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of: Seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure tsunami, seiche, and dam failure slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides subsidence liquefaction Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 195 other seismic hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (c ommencing with Section 2690) of Division 2 of the Public Resources Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body flooding wildland and urban fires The safety element must include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It must also address evacuation routes, military installations, peakload water supply requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards. The safety element must also identify information regarding flood hazards, establish a set of comprehensive goals, policies, and objectives for the protection of the community from the unreasonable risks of flooding, and establish a set of feasible implementation measures designed to carry out th e goals, policies, and objectives for flood protection. While not required, it is recommended that the safety element do the same for drought impacts. The safety element must also be reviewed and updated as necessary to address the risk of fire for land cl assified as state responsibility areas and land classified as very high fire hazard severity zones. Because climate change will likely increase California's frequency and intensity of fire weather conditions, eve n historically less vulnerable regions should reevaluate wildfire risk and prevention strategies in their general plan's safety element. See the sidebar for more information on fire hazard requirements. Consultation Requirements Prior to the periodic revie w of its general plan and prior to preparing or revising its safety element, each city and county shall consult the California Geological Survey of the Department of Conservation , the Central Valley Flood Protection Board , if the city or county is located within the boundaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Drainage District , as set forth in Section 85 01 of the Water Code, and the Office of Emergency Services for the purpose of including information known by and available to the department, the agency, and the board required by this subdivision . In particular, the Office of Emergency Services Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 196 can assist local governments with developing their safety element and aligning general plan strategies with those of the local hazard mitigation plan to ensure consistency. Statutory Requirements This secti on offers a general guide to the contents of the safety element. Note that while the focus is on the minimum requirements for an adequate safety element, an effective general plan will focus more extensively on those issues of greatest relevance to the community. The effects of climate change in particular will influence emergency management issues through varying impacts across local communities statewide. Increases in average temperature, a greater incidence of extreme weather conditions, and sea level rise all will not only exacerbate existing hazards mentioned in this section, but also create new hazards where none previously existed. Useful Definitions Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 197 Alquist -Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone: A regulatory zone, delineated by the State Geologist, within w hich site-specific geologic studies are required to identify and avoid fault rupture hazards prior to subdivision of land and/or construction of most structures for human occupancy.

Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 199 planning area could be addressed with a map known seismic and geologic hazards. The element should determine the location of active fault zones designated by the State Geologist under the Alquist -Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act . Next, a geologic evaluation could evaluate the potential for displacement along active and potentially active faults in the planning area. Active an d potentially active faults in the region should be identified with historical data on seismic ground shaking within the planning area. A geotechnical evaluation based on the state pro babilistic earthquake hazard map could determine the potential for localized ground shaking, landslides, and tsunamis. Hazardous or substandard structures that may be subject to collapse in the event of an earthquake, including, but not limited to, unrein forced masonry buildings could be identified. The geotechnical evaluation could also identify the potential for earthquake -triggered landslide, mudslide, liquefaction, and soil compaction. It should also determine the location of zones of required investig ation for liquefaction and earthquake -induced hazards on a seismic hazard zone map prepared by the State Geologist. Areas that would be inundated in the event of a dam failure should also be identified. Dam inundation maps are available from the Office of Emergency Services . The development, facilities, and people potentially at risk in areas subject to potential inundation should be identified as well. The safety element should include historical data on landslides and mudslides and identify areas that are landslide -prone by using, among other sources, landslide features maps, seismic hazard zone maps , and geology for planning maps produced by Department of Conservation. The local potential for landslides and mudslides could also be identified in a geotechnical evaluation. Historical data on land subsidence resulting from extractio n of groundwater, natural gas, oil, and geothermal resources and from hydrocompaction can be used to identify areas of known risk from liquefaction, subsidence, or ground shaking. The potential risks associa ted with other known geologic hazards, such as volcanic activity, avalanche, or cliff erosion may also be analyzed. Most of the information listed, needed to complete the analysis for the Safety Element , can be obtained by a combination of five sources: th e State Hazard Mitigation Plan , MyPlan tool, the General Plan Guidelines Mapping Tool, Cal-Adapt and the Adaptation Planning Guide . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 200 Key Terms Flood management is defined as the overarching term that encompasses both floodwater management and floodplain management. Floodwater Management Floodwater management includes actions to modify the natural flow of floo dwaters to reduce losses to human resources and/or to protect benefits to natural resources associated with flooding. Examples of floodwater management actions include containing flows in reservoirs, dams, and natural basins; conveying flows via levees, channels, and natural corridors; managing flows through reservoir reoperation; and managing watersheds by decreasing rainfall runoff and providing headwater stream protection. Floodplain Management Floodplain management includes actions to the floodplain to reduce losses to human resources within the floodplain and/or to protect benefits to natural resources associated with flooding. Examples of floodplain management actions include minimizing impacts of flows (e.g., flood -proofing, insurance); maintaining or restoring natural floodplain processes (e.g., riparian restoration, meander corridors, etc.); removing obstacles w ithin the floodplain voluntarily or with just compensation (e.g., relocating at -risk structures); keeping obstacles out of the floodplain (th rough subdivision and zo ning decisions); education and emergency prepa redness planning (e.g., emergency response plans, data collection, outreach, insurance requirements, etc.); and ensuring that operations of floodwater management systems are not compromised by activities in the floodplain. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSI DERATION IN ANALYSIS OF THIS ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of analysis Recommended Data Flood Protection Requirement Description: Flooding is a natural function of every river, alluvial fan, and coastal area. In riverine systems, floodwaters enrich bottomlands and provide spawning habitats for native fish. There are ecological benefits to maintaining connections between the river and its floodplain. Land use decisions directly influence the function of floodplains and may either reduce or increase potential flood hazards. The functions of floodplains include, but are not limited to, water supply, water quality, flood and erosion control, and fish and wildlife habitat. Development within floodplains may not only exp ose people and property to floods, but also increase the potential for flooding elsewhere and negatively impact floodplain ecosystems. Land use regulations, such as zoning and subdivision ordinances, are the primary Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 201 means of implementing general plan policies established to minimize flood hazards. In addition to including floodplain management policies in the general plan, making related changes to zoning and subdivision ordinances is crucial to the success of a floodplain management program. In the process of preparing a flood management element, the city or county will have to collect a substantial amount of information concerning its floodplains and its watershed. There are a variety of sources for this information. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maps are available for most communities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will do floodplain delineation on a cost -sharing basis and has information on floodplains and project levees. The Department of Water Resources (DWR) also has floodplain information and a floodplain management program , as does the Central Valley Flood Protection Board . The California Office of Emergency Services (OES ) and DWR have info rmation on past flooding and flood levels based on awareness mapping. Local levee districts and resource conservation districts may also have information to share. See the box below for a list of legislation passed since 2003, updating safety element requirements specific to flood hazard mitigation plans. Of special note, the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan (described under SB 5) aims to revamp insufficient levee, bypass, and other flood defense mechanisms to create a more integrated and hazard -averse flood management system. Carrying implications for Central Valley land use, conservation, and safety planning in floodplain zones, the 2012 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan (CVFPP) documents the condition of all of the region's state and federal flood management facilities and guides improvements to flood hazard prevention along the Sacramento River and San Joaquin Rivers. OPR will provide links to basin-wide state feasibility studies, locally -initiated regional flood management project plans, and a Central Valley conservation strategy as they become available . However , updates to the safety element should remain consistent with land use development policies and conservation areas and practices described in other general plan elements. For legislation related to the Safety Element please refer to the State Hazard Mitigation Plan Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 202 SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATIO N IN ANALYSIS OF THI S ELEMENT Social, Economic, or Environmental Related Intent of analysis Recommended Data Fire Hazards Requirement Description: There are many opportunities to address fire protection, fire prevention and hazard mitigation in the General Plan, most obviously in the safety element which deals with all manner of na tural and man -made hazards to life and property.

Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 203 temporal variability of water availability, continues to increase wildfire risk in many areas. Meanwhile drought episodes with greater frequency and severity effectively lower fuel moisture conditions to create longer fire seasons, and combined with overstocked vegetation vulnerable to insects and diseases, produce an abundance of dead woody matter prime for intense burning. For a discussion of how local governments can plan for drought conditions and consequent fire hazards, see box below. Mitigating Hazards through Drought Resiliency Plans The gradual onset of severe droughts in Californ ia poses considerable threats to public safety and wellbeing by increasing fire hazard susceptibility and straining already scarce water resources.Drought's toll on crop yields, livestock production, and local community water sources create food and water security concerns, in addition to economic considerations, that showcase the importance of proper preparedness plans. Millions of dollars in drought -related damages over the last several decades, stemming especially from irrigation shortages, may become mo re commonplace as climate change results in longer and more severe drought conditions. Climate change will likely foster more consecutive disasters - for example, droughts followed by fires, or floods followed by drought - prolonging recovery of natural re sources and compounding total recovery costs In response, many local governments are choosing to strengthen water management and drought prevention efforts by adding a separate water element to their general plan, but drought preparedness strategies could also be incorporated into the safety element as part of fire or flood hazard mitigation tactics. Structural and nonstructural flood management methods that enhance water storage and groundwater recharge work to mitigate drought impacts, and promoting great er water efficiency through land use and development policies can minimize capital damage from droughts as well as fires. As opposed to solely relying on local hazard mitigation plans, existing urban and agricultural water management plans, or expecting st ate or federal disaster aid after severe drought impacts, local governments can use the general plan as a tool to encourage water conservation policies, drought -tolerant parks and landscaping, water audits, and dual plumbing with recycled water. For more resources on how local governments can plan for droughts, see: California's 2010 State Drought Contingency Plan Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 204 OPR's 2014 Local Government Drought Toolkit California's 2009 State Water Plan for integrated water management Local Government Commission's guidebook for regional water sustainability Aside from local fire plans and hazard mitigation plans, the general plan's safety element can provide a framework for inserting f ire protection and prevention policy requirements in zoning, subdivision, and strategic fire d efense ordinances. To safeguard the increasing \"wildland -urban interface , \" communities with State Responsibility Area (SRA) or Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zon e Local Responsibility Area (LRA) must update their safety element following the next revision of the housing element on or after January 1, 2014 to address the risk of wildland fire. In order to develop viable plans for fire protection , wildfire risk reduction, evacuation needs, and consistency between general plan elements and other local plans, the safety element shall incorporate information such as fire hazard maps and assessments, implementation goals and actionable policies, as well as any appropriat e references to local fire safety plans.

Safeguarding public health has been the primary focus of federal and state air quality legislation and activities for many years. Air pollution also impacts local economies by damaging agricultural crops, natural vegetation, buildings, and other exposed materials. In addition, the economic health of an area can be affected adversely if insufficient air quality improvement triggers more stringent federally mandated air pollution controls on business. Air pollution also can impair visibility and obscure views. For these reasons, citie s and counties should strive to reduce emissions for the benefit of both their own residents and those of other communities in their region and the state as a whole. Local jurisdictions have responsibility for land use planning and can also significantly affect the design, creation, and management of development and the local circulation system. Local governments have an opportunity to address air quality issues through general plans, development ordinances, local circulation systems, transportation servic es, and other plans and programs. No other level of government has such responsibility, including air districts. The general plan, as the foundation for local planning and development, can be an important tool for implementing policies and programs benefi cial to air quality. Communities may choose to adopt a separate air quality element or to integrate air quality - beneficial objectives, policies, and strategies in other elements of the plan, such as the land use, circulation, conservation, and community de sign elements. Whichever method is selected, consistency among elements and policies within the plan is essential for successful implementation. Government Code 65302.1(c): The adoption of air quality amendments to a general plan to comply with the requirements of subdivision (d) shall include all of the following: (1) A repo rt describing local air quality conditions including air quality monitoring data, emission inventories, lists of significant source categories, attainment status and designations, and applicable state and federal air quality plans and transportation plans. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 211 San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District Boundaries Cities and counties within the San Joaquin Valley Air Polluti on Control District (SJVAPCD) jurisdiction are required by state law to include air quality measures in their general plans. The SJVAPCD has developed the Air Quality Guidelines for General Plans to assist these cities and counties in meeting these requirements. The document provides additional goals, policies, and programs for adoption in general plans that will reduce vehicle miles traveled and improve air quality. Although air qua lity measures are only statutorily required in the San Joaquin Valley, the benefits of adopting an air quality element or implementing air quality policies throughout a general plan are universal. Correlations among Elements Land Use Circulation Housing Conservation Open Space Safety Noise Air Quality Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Required Contents The legislative body of each city and county within the jurisdictional boundaries of the San Joaquin Vall ey Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) must amend the appropriate elements of its general plan, which may include, but are not limited to, the required elements dealing with land use, circulation, housing, conservation, and open space, to include data and analysis, goals, policies, and objectives, and feasible implementation strategies to improve air quality. The adoption of air quality amendments to a general plan shall include all of the following: Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 212 A report describing local air quality conditions i ncluding: o Air quality monitoring data o Emission inventories o Lists of significant source categories o Attainment status and designations Applicable state and federal air quality plans and transportation plans A summary of local, district, state, and federal p olicies, programs, and regulations that may improve air quality in the city or county. A comprehensive set of goals, policies, and objectives that may improve air quality. A set of feasible implementation measures designed to carry out those goals, policie s, and objectives. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 213 Federal, State, Regional and Local Air Quality Federal Air Quality Standards - The Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency ( U.S. EPA) to set and peri odically review national air quality standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants: carbon mon oxide (CO), ozone (O 3), particula te matter (currently in two size ranges: less than 10 microns in diameter, PM10; and less than 2.5 microns in diameter, PM2.5, also c alled fine particulate ), nitrogen oxide s (NO X), sulfur oxide s (SOX), and lead (Pb) . Primary standards based only on health consideration , and secondary standards are based only on public welfare considerations. When U.S. EPA revises a NAAQS, states are required to attain the NAAQS by target dates specified in the CAA. A state's NAAQS attainment or non -attainment status is determined by U.S. EPA. States that do not attain the NAAQS are required to develop and implement air pollution control plans to achieve the NAAQS (state implementation plans, SIPs) by the target date. U.S. EPA provides guidance interpreting the SIP requirements in the CAA that the states must follow to develop an approvable SIP. If U.S. EPA deems a SIP is not approvable or if a stat e fails to develop a SIP, U.S. EPA can develop a Federal Implementation Pla n that can be imposed on the state. State Air Quality Standards - The California Air Resources Board (ARB) was established in 1968 to address air quality problems in California. Sin ce formation of U.S. EPA in 1970, ARB has been designated as the State agency responsible for carrying out the State's responsibilities under the CAA. Because California was already regulating air quality before formation of U.S. EPA a nd passage of the CA A, California was granted several privileges that are not allowed to any other state, including the unique authority to regulate mobile sources.. The California Clean Air Act (CCAA) also directs ARB to set state ambient air quality standards (CAAQS), as well as directing ARB to identify nonattainment areas of the State. In contrast to NAAQS, CAAQS do not have attainment date targets, however, areas t hat are nonattainment for the CAAQS must make annual progress to reduce air pollution levels. ARB monitor s air quality statewide through an extensive monitoring network that is jointly operated with local air pollution control districts (APCDs) and air quality management districts (AQMDs) . ARB also promulgates regulations that reduce air pollution emissions from motor vehicles and consumer products that improve air quality throughout the State. ARB has oversight responsibilities related to local air dist rict activities. Regional Air Quality Management -California is divided into g eographic areas which share c ommon airshed s, called air basins . Each part of California falls under the authority of a county air pollution control district (APCD) or a multi-county air quality management district (AQMD). These local districts have the main responsibility of control ling air pollution emissions from stationary sources within their jurisdictions, including sources such as factories, power plants, gas stations, and dry clean ers. The districts adopt and implement rules and regulations related to the stationary sources u nder their jurisdiction to reach ambient air quality standards in their air basin, and to enforce relevant S tate and federal law s. Local Air Quality -Local government air quality responsibility includes four main areas: land use planning, review and mitiga tion of the environmental impacts of development projects, development and maintenance of transportation infrastructures; including transit systems , and implementation of local air quality programs. At least 45 days prior to the adoption of air quality amendments to a general plan pursuant to this section, each city and county shall send a copy of its draft document to the SJVAPCD. The SJVAPCD may review the draft amendments to de termine whether they may Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 214 improve air quality consistent with the strategies. Within 30 days of receiving the draft amendments, the SJVAPCD shall send any comments and advice to the city or county. The legislative body of the city or county shall consider t he district's comments and advice prior to the final adoption of air quality amendments to the general plan. The SJVAPCD's comments are advisory to the city or county. Statutory Requirements The SJVUAPCD prepared the Guide for Assessing and Mitigating Air Quality Impacts guidance manual on August 20, 1998. The manual, which has undergone subsequent revisions to insure its applicability over time, was developed to provide g uidance for addressing air quality in environmental documents within the District. This includes methods of determining local air quality and suggested policies for improving air quality.

Protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of its residents is the legal basis for land use regulation.19 Homes, schools, and neighborhoods influence community health in fundamental ways . In these places are opportunities to influence and improve healt h, by ensuring that everyone has access to the ingredients for a healthy life, including nourishing food, safe water, affordable places to live, safe places to walk, bike, and be active, and clean air indoors and out. Policy priorities established in local general plans have tremendous potential to improve community health and make the healthy option the easier option. Research shows that while access to health services is important, social, environmental, and economic factors also have a significant impact on health outcomes - the built environment is a key component of those factors. The built environment can affect all chronic conditions. Walkable neighborhoods promote physical activity.iv Other links between health and environment continue to emerge ; for example, the impact of green space on mental and physical health.v Many planning policies, such as Complete Streets, already promote healthier outcomes by creating safer places to walk with improved connectivity to destinations. Adding a health lens to the planning process can lead to better health outcomes . Cross-sectoral work throughout the planning process allows communities to prioritize policies and coordinate with other local government agencies and private or non - 19 Cecily Talbert Barclay, Matthew S. Gray, Curtins California Land Use and Planning Law (Solano Press 34th Edtn. 2014). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 217 profit partners to improve the health of the community. Many of the health -related policies identified in this section also promote economic, equity, and climate resiliency goals. This chapter provides concepts integrated from promising practices that communities may voluntarily incorporate i nto their general plans and focuses on data analysis and policy developmen t to further healthy planning . Fortunately, many opportunities are already aligned with existing planning practice and state legislation, such as requirements for incorporating complete streets , addressing climate change , and considering environmental justice. This chapter provides ideas for data analysis, policy d evelopment, and implementation. Information was gathered from multiple sources, including health organizations across the state, a review of existing published research literature, a survey of promising practices, and extensive stakeholder engagement. As with all of the voluntary sections, this chapter provides suggestions and resources for use by jurisdictions as they see fit. Correlations among Elements Land Use Circulation Housing Conservation Open Space Noise Safety Healthy Communities Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Strategies and Approaches Incorporating Health Considerations in General Plans Local jurisdictions that have incorporated health considerations into their general plans hav e opted for one of three formats 1) a separate health element; 2) an integrated approach which has health woven throughout all elements; or 3) a hybrid approach that weaves health throughout the General Plan and uses a health element to frame the importanc e of health issues. The adoption of a health element is consistent with Section 65303 of the State of California Government Code. There are bene fits to having a separate health element Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 218 because it can be easier for the public and decision -makers to see health -related policies in one place. At the same time, an integrated approach puts health -related policies into the elements that address those iss ues; for example, including active transportation policies in a circulation element could potentially make implementation more actionable , by incorporating them in to larger transportation plans . Some jurisdictions incorporate more specific health considerations into the housing element. Since this element is often updated more frequently, it provides an opportunity for more regular evaluation of policy implementation and progress. Re gardless of approach, the health -related policies must meet internal consistency rules set forth in Government Code Section 65300.5 . Health policies carry the same legal weight as all other elements once the final general plan is adopted. Ultimately, the best format will depend on the local context, available funding, and community interest, and should complement the overall general plan update an d vision. Jurisdictions will likely prioritize various health considerations differently depending on the local context. For instance, some communities may focus on active transportation, while other communities may emphasize clean water access, food syst ems or access to health care. Whether the General Plan is being updated at the city or county level could also impact which health issues emerge as priority areas in a general plan update. Additionally, policies that work in a rural area might not be as r elevant for an urban area and vice versa. The discussion below is not an exhaustive list, but rather a starting point for further deliberation as to some of the associations between health and planning. Innovative Partnerships and Collaboration Planning r elies on collaborating with different sectors to accomplish the vision set forth in the General Plan. Addressing health in the built environment creates an opportunity to form new partnerships. Several organizations can provide unique health expertise and offer a health perspective during the planning process. Additional models of collaboration are referenced in the Public Engagement and Outreach Chapter. Both health and planning have distinct professional termin ology. In local jurisdictions that have successfully integrated health considerations, cross -sector groups prioritized learning basic planning and health terms, which is important for professional collaboration as well as Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 219 for community outreach. The long -term nature of the land use plans, e.g., 20 years or more, is new to many groups outside of the planning community. Particularly for large jurisdictions, general plan updates can be costly and are not undertaken frequently. Therefore, it is important to pro vide clear expectations in the initial phases of engagement, to clarify the timeline, and set expectations about the planning process. In addition, it may be beneficial for jurisdictions that decide to incorporate explicit health considerations into their general plan to start with a city or county resolution prior to the formal update of the General Plan to raise awareness about the connections between the built environment and healthy planning to achieve improved health outcomes. The \"Healthy Eating, Act ive Living Resolution\" is an example of such a resolution. To date , 176 cities across California have enacted resolutions to support health and wellness policies.vi Sources of Support and Information for health considerations Local County and City Depar tments of Public Health : Public health experts have in - depth understanding of local health data as well as strong ties with community organizations Health related non -profits: Many organizations are working to improve walkability, bikeability, accessib ility for the disabled, and overall health in local communities Equity or EJ related non -profits : Many organizations are working to improve conditions in communities unable to access basic resources like safe water, healthy foods, and healthful air qualit y Community groups: Neighborhood or community organizations, environmental justice organizations, l ocal parent groups, youth groups, faith -based organizations, or topically focused interest groups often work on community health issues Academic institutio ns: Academic researchers often analyze health data and provide expertise on data analysis, mapping, health impact analysis, and knowledge of local health conditions Hospitals and/ or Clinics : Health care reform has increased awareness on the social, environmental, and economic issues that affect health beyond clinic walls; non -profit hospitals conduct community health needs assessment s (CHNAs) and provide funding for initiatives to improve health Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 220 Local and Regional Governments : Local agencies such as p olice, water, flood, utility, and air districts manage programs that impact healthy planning processes Local School Districts: School districts partner with Safe Routes to School programs to ensure safe access to get to school; districts also participate in school siting of new facilities, have access to forecasted school growth and/or school closings Private Sector Partners: Local business associations, vendors, and local industries are increasingly designing work wellness programs which often have a transit component Health Considerations The health considerations listed in this section were gathered from multiple sources, including health organizations across the state, a review of existing literature and best and promising practices, and an ex tensive stakeholder engagement process. It is divided by general health consideration , example policies are listed below to address these topics as well as in the appendix A . As mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, some local jurisdictions have sep arate health elements, and others have integrated or hybrid approaches. Health & Economic Opportunity Innovat ing in Riverside - A Healthy Community Planner In 2011, through a grant by The California Endowment (TCE), the Riverside County Department of Public Health became the first health department in California to hire a full-time urban/regional planner. This \"Healthy Communities Planner\" position is designed to provide leadership in bringing public health concerns into municipal planning. The planner is key to bridging the gap between public health and urban/regional planners to help ensure that health is considered as the cities and the county plan for the built environment, future development and population growth. The planner is helping to implement the County's Health Element of the General Plan, actively participates in TCE's Building Healthy Communities Initiative , and works with the county's 28 cities to adopt \"Health City Resolutions.\" Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 221 Increasingly, health is recognized as a vital component of human capital. Several measures of health and wellbeing are factored into the World Economic Forum Human Capital Report.vii Communities that have access to a wide array of resources have more opportunities to experience healthier outcomes and attain their fullest potential. Land use planning can influence commute patterns, access to jobs, and devel opment projects can serve as job creation opportunities. General plan policies can impact the presence of anchor institutions, such as universities, schools, medical facilities and/or clinics, and have a stabilizing effect on the local economy. Recently, the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank launched a nation -wide Healthy Communities cross -sector initiative to facilitate discussion between community development partners and the health sector, seeking to improve investment in low -income communities and imp rove health at the community level.viii New models, with a more integrated approach, continue to emerge and focus on measureable and scalable results. Many of the models for economic development examine the role of Transit -Oriented and Infill Development reco gnizing that access to transit corridors can leverage resources and increase access to services and amenities to support healthy lifestyles for local community members that work, live, and play in the surrounding areas. Concurrently, land use patterns th at promote healthier lifestyles can generate economic value. A synthesis of peer -reviewed literature showed that open space for recreation and walkable communities create positive economic impacts.ix For Instance, a rising demand for more walkable transit -oriented neighborhoods has increased resale value of property in those neighborhoods.x Recognizing the power of healthy planning, the Urban Land Institute has a building healthy places initiative and recently published a series of case studies from develop ments around the world with a host of wellness features including support of bicycling, built amenities to support physical activity, and design to increase social interaction.xi With changes in health policy, new incentives have emerged for workplace wel lness programs, xii including opportunities to site businesses near multi -modal transportation in a manner that encourages walking, increase activity through design, and improve health in conjunction with workplace programs. A Changing Climate & Resiliency Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 222 The natural environment supports human life. Humans, in turn, impact the natural environment. The most prominent example is climate change caused by greenhouse gases (GHGs). Changes to the climate can have devastating consequences on health due to physic al or mental harm or displacement from increased frequency or severity of disasters like flooding, drought, fire, and landslides. Climate change many not only increase existing risks but will also pose new threats to human health. The California Department of Public Health provides recommendations and publications dealing with health and climate change through their climate change and public health team . While climate change will be t he biggest common pathway that threatens public health for decades to come, land use planning can help reduce GH Gs that cause climate change and prepare and adapt. The Safety Element already requires natural hazard areas to be considered to avoid or mitiga te for potential hazards such as fires, flood zones, earthquakes, landslides and other hazards. Explicit consideration of health issues provides an opportunity to improve resilience of local communities. Some health effects of climate change are already being experienced due to increasing temperature. Twelve of the warmest years ever recorded in history have occurred in the last fifteen years. xiii Temperatures in urban areas can exacerbate already warm conditions due to materials - such as asphalt -absorbing heat and then releasing it, causing urban heat islands. Increased exposure to heat puts children, elderly, and people with pre -existing health conditions at more serious risk to suffer from heat stroke and heat -related complications. Studies show increas ed mortality during times of high heat.xiv In fact, according to the Center for Disease Control, between 1979 and 2003, more people prematurely died from extreme heat -related illness then the total combined deaths from other natural disasters including torna does, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and lightning.xv Land use planning to reduce urban heat island effects is important to create more resilient communities to withstand extreme heat. Increased urban greening and cool surfaces, which have a high -albedo e ffect, reflecting higher portions of radiation and thus absorbing less , can decrease temperatures and lessen the effects of extreme heat. Green roofs can also have health benefits by reducing exposure to heat with the added benefit of better air quality. Healthy tree canopy can also provide shade from heat, help with carbon capture, Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 223 and improve air quality.xvi Land use planning can also help to ensure the availability of water resources for cooling purposes. With climate change, there is a growing recogniti on of the need to preserve limited resources such as water, fertile ground for agriculture, energy, and clean air. All of these actions are vital for human health. Land use policies to promote efficient circulation, conservation, and recapture of water are needed for water conservation and drought mitigation . Additionally, it is important to control for pools of stagnant water. As water pools, without natural systems, such as certain fish populations, there is an increase d risk for mosquito reproduction. With higher mosquito populations, strong pesticides - that can affect health - are required to spray to contain mosquito populations. Scientists predict that vector borne diseases will change in the future as a result of climate change. More tropical diseas es, not previously experienced in California, such as dengue and yellow fever could become more of a concern. In 2013, the particular mosquito that carries Dengue was found in California. Land use policies to conserve water and prevent large scale stagnant pools will be key. Climate change also has the potential to harm agricultural yields. Ensuring adequate food supplies to feed the population and avoid famines will require preservation of agricultural land. Land use policies that identify and avoid deve lopment on prime agricultural land are important to protect California's food supply. Energy conservation programs have potential health co -benefits. When buildings and developments are planned to use less energy they can reduce energy bills and allow fami lies to use the savings towards other expenses. Additionally, programs have started to monitor the benefits of energy efficiency measures and the opportunity to improve indoor air quality at the same time, which can reduce costs of respiratory illness such as asthma.xvii Policies that continue to improve air quality such as creating more public transportation options, zero emission vehicles, and bike and walk options for commuting are all important to maintain air quality and promote public health. Active Living & Recreation Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 224 The design of the physical environment can either facilitate active transport or serve as a barrier. Physical inactivity is one of the key contributors to chronic disease in California.xviii Only half of Californians meet the recommended da ily activity: about thirty minutes a day for adults and one hour for children. xix Physical inactivity is associated with obesity. In 2011, 30.4% of California Children age 10 -17 were overweight or obese.xx In 2012, 25% of adult Californians were obese. xxi Obesity increases the risk for many chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease and many cancers. A more active lifestyle can help reduce the risk of obesity. Active living incorporates physical activity into o ne's daily routine such as walking to perform errands, active transportation to work, walking or biking to school, or accessing nearby open space to pursue recreation. Active transportation options allow for less time spent in vehicles. In addition, great er individual activity also helps reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) resulting in less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improving air quality. Many local jurisdictions have developed active design guidelines that can also complement General Plan Policie s. Planning connected bike and pedestrian paths increase alternatives to auto use . Both transit oriented development (TOD) and infill development also create an opportunity for more active lifestyles. Complete Streets and multimodal, interconnected transi t allow access to services, housing, school, open space recreation areas, and other amenities without the need for vehicles. In conjunction with a robust public transportation system, first and last mile policies - addressing the need to provide connections between destinations and the beginning or end of transit - ensure increased mobility. Additional infrastructure such as covered rest areas, shade, age friendly seating, and bike storage are important to increase utilization. This is an area where interage ncy cooperation with other districts or entities can allow for creative and cost effective solutions such as through easements for trail networks. The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection act of 2008 (SB 375), promotes regional coordination of t ransportation and land use planning , including support of active transportation. These policies help reduce the burden of transportation on the environment, improve air quality, and help communities be more active. Prioritizing more forms of active transp ort policies in general plans will strengthen potential for regional transportation plans to meet GHG reduction targets established pursuant to SB 375 (2008). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 225 Due to recent federal legislation, the statewide funding mechanisms to support active transportat ion have been evolving. The Active Transportation Program, enacted via Senate Bill 99, is a new program to fund pedestrian, bicycle, and Safe Routes to School programs (SRTS). In 1969, nationally, almost half of the children between the ages of 5 -14 walke d or biked to school, but that number has plummeted to 13% in 2009 While the reasons for this are many, factors include the distance to school, school siting, safety of the area, and physical conditions on the route to school . Programs that promote walking or biking to school help achieve daily -recommended physical activity. Improving infrastructure and safety also increase the ability of children to walk or bike to school as desired. Although school siting is conducted outside of the realm of the general plan, the general plan process can promote coordination with school districts and help align school modernization and reinvestment with the general plan. Planning for active lifestyles also benefi ts the elderly. The \"Aging in P lace\" concept focuses on enabling seniors to stay in their own homes and communities. Also known as Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORC), these areas prioritize creating walkable communities to accommodate their needs and provide access to full services such as stores , clinics, and social programming. Furthermore, providing parks and natural recreation opportunities and access to gree n space is vital to good health, allowing easy access to physical activity and relief from urban stress. As more compact development occurs, it is important to ensure access to adequate green space for all community members . Social Connection & Safety The physical environment can have a significant impact on health and wellbeing, but the social structures and how citizens engage withi n the physical space can be equally important. Feeling connected to neighbors, feeling safe in one's home, and having a robust supportive social network has been shown to affect physical and mental health.xxii A neighborhood can be well designed and offer ame nities, but if the local residents perceive the area to be unsafe, or it is unsafe, it will not be utilized to its full capacity. Design Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 226 principles can be implemented with this in mind. Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) examines environ mental conditions that have unintended consequences on behavior.xxiii This field of research combines evaluating place and human interaction. CPTED uses design elements to control access, provide more opportunities for passive observation of what is occurring in the area, and encourage civic engagement to maintain properties. An important aspect of implementing CPTED includes a wide multi -sector, such as with law enforcement - and community engagement process to define the problems, opportunities, and solutions . Civic participation and social cohesion can be supported through the design of community spaces that provide engagement, access to learning opportunities, quality interaction of citizens, multi -generational connections, public services such as libraries, and cultural and art facilities. Joint use agreements with schools allow for another opportunity to collaborate with school districts, maximize resource utilization, and foster more activated spaces that otherwise would be empty during non -work hours. A safe community with active streets includes protection from criminal activity, as well as from avoidable accidents. Many design elements such as narrower streets, intensity - appropriate lighting, improved signage, and slower speed limits can help reduce ac cidents. Traffic calming measures, complete streets, and improvement of physical infrastructure are important components of injury prevention. As referenced in the circulation element, the California Complete Streets Act of 2008 (AB 1358) requires local j urisdictions, upon any substantial revision of the circulation element, to plan for a \" balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of the streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel in a manner that is suit able to the rural, suburban, or urban context of the general plan.\"xxiv The circulation element can be an excellent place to incorporate design for safety and multimodal use. The National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) Street Design gu idelines, formally endorsed by Caltrans in 2014, offer excellent examples and a blueprint to guide complete street policy implementation, particularly around priority sites such as schools and daycare centers.xxv Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 227 Housing Housing affordability, locatio n, and quality have major health implications. Also special housing considerations factor into planning such as housing to accommodate special groups such as homeless populations, marginally housed, individuals with disabilities, and aging populations. The housing element allows jurisdictions to identify opportunities and adopt policies to promote positive health outcomes. State Housing Element law, including the Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) process , a.k.a, \"fair share\" planning, fundamentally addresses equity issues, and related planning and zoning laws require regional and local governments to adopt plans for increasing, improving and preserving the State's housing supply for all income groups . Location of ho using plays a central role in how individuals and families engage in their communities, particularly for the elderly population with the growing interest to \"age in place.\" Neighborhoods with accessible transit and active transportation infrastructure offe r opportunities for access to employment, schools, and services. If the neighborhood is safe, housing located near parks and green space provide s recreational opportunities. Housing location can influence ease of access to fresh food and produce. The qu ality of available housing stock has direct health implications. Older housing that has not been maintained or updated can lead to physically unsafe conditions such as pest infestation, water intrusion, mold, poor insulation, and exposure to toxins such as lead. Water intrusion, poor insulation, and mold can exacerbate respiratory illnesses such asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Lead exposure, a known neurotoxin, can have lifelong health consequences for young exposed children. In additi on to the quality of housing, affordability is a key factor. Access to affordable housing helps alleviate undue stress suffered from unstable living conditions. Often, since Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 228 families are on fixed incomes, affordable housing allows them to use remaining inc ome towards other goods and services, health care needs, and basic necessities such as healthy food. When housing prices rise, household occupancy rates often increase , becoming overcrowded, leading to unsafe living conditions and increased risk for sprea d of infectious disease. Rising rents can also lead to displacement of r esidents result ing in a disruption of social networks and school attendance, and can change the fabric of the local community. Given the health impacts of having access to safe, decent , and affordable housing it remains critical jurisdictions appropriately plan for variety of housing types. Nutrition & Food Systems The paradigm around access to healthy food has been shifting nationally as the percent of obese adults and children h as been on the rise. In addition to public health messages targeted at individual behavior, the focus also now includes policy around food access. Over consumption of less nutritional food is a component of the problem as well as lack of access to enough h ealthy, fresh food. Some areas struggle with food deserts, areas that do not have adequate physical access to nutritious healthy foods.xxvi Many Californians have experienced food insecurity, defined as a time when they could not afford enough food or had to forgo other basic life expenses to buy food.xxvii Although foods choices are for individuals to decide, those choices are made within the context of what is accessible and affordable. Access to healthy food is a critical factor to better nutrition.xxviii New resea rch also shows the lifetime risk of developing diabetes in the US population is on the rise with nearly a 40 percent risk to develop diabetes during the average lifespan, further supporting the need to improve nutrition.xxix Increasing access to healthy foods can occur in multiple ways, such as zoning for and opening grocery stores in underserved areas, providing policies to increase access to farmers markets, promoting community gardens, working with local convenience stores to increase affordable fresh produ ce selection, and using food procurement policies. California is the largest and most diverse producer of healthy foods and commodities in the nation. The food system cycle has many points where general plan policies can improve resilience and access to healthy foods Production Distribution & Processing Access & Consumption Waste Disposal Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 229 The American Planning Association recently completed a national scan of planning documents addressing foo d issues, and compiled findings into a policy report, Planning for Food Access and Community Based Food Systems . CDFA's Farm to Fork office provides information on programs to improve food access. In addition, local and regional collaboratives can help address food access issues in the global sense, including evaluating policies that cover the range of food system issues from production, distribution and processing, access and consumption, through the end of the cycle to waste disposal. According to the USDA, \"a community food system is one in which ' food production, processing, distribution and consumption are integrated to enhance the e nvironmental, economic, social and nutritional health of a particular place.'\"xxx General Plans can support protecting agricultural land for production as well as establishing a framework to support and encourage local food production in the form of comm unity gardens and zoning. Integrated transportation systems connecting regional networks can ensure distribution and processing that has a lower carbon footprint and is more sustainable. Also, local access can help reduce trip generation, promote locally sourced food and general plan policies can support mixed use for food retail, farmers markets, and other food stores. Waste disposal has been a component of some local general plans as local jurisdictions have gone toward zero waste policies. All of the policies to support improved access to fresh food are not only important for health, but also for community resilience. Environmental Health Exposures to various toxic substances in air, water, and soil can significantly affect health. Noise, when ext reme can also be considered a health hazard. Diseases such as asthma, birth defects, cancer, heart disease, neurologic disorders, and reproductive disorders can be linked to toxins in the environment. In addition, certain geographic areas and communities experience a disproportionate share of exposure to environmental toxins. As a result, compatible siting should be considered in the context of housing, childcare, and businesses. . Siting of childcare is particularly important since children are more pr one to exposure of toxic substances due to their developmental stage. Childcare sites are often sited in Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 230 residential or mixed -use zones. When sited in a residential use zone it is usually safer since it avoids siting near incompatible uses. Occasionally, sites are in commercial or industrial zones. If this occurs, it is important to ensure there are not hazards. Although school siting occurs outside of the general plan, local planning agencies can provide information to school districts and other entities involved in locating services to avoid location near higher - risk areas, such as near businesses producing toxic substances, agricultural land where pesticides are used, or areas with poor air quality. Additionally, providing guidance on buffer zones and limiting certain types of uses can help minimize toxic exposure. Air quality can also be a relevant consideration for public health. Of course, air quality varies from day to day and can be affected by many environmental factors as well as the emission sources, prevailing winds, and natural terrain. Most jurisdictions are not required to address air quality in their general plan,20 although some have chosen to do so voluntarily. For additional discussion see Social Equity, Environmental Justice, and Community Resilience Chapter. Health & Human Services Hospitals and clinics are increasingly recognizing that where patients live, learn, work, go to school and play affects their health and wellbeing. Through new p aradigms and innovation, they are considering what community services are necessary to support health for individuals in their community. Non -profit hospitals conduct community health needs assessments as part of their community tax requirements and can re invest into the community based on the assessment. Increased access to health care, physical activity opportunities, and healthy foods are often key priorities to improve community health . General Plan policies can improve all of these and particular plan ning decisions can improve access to health services through integrated public transportation and provisions for access to broadband and thus allow for telemedicine capacity. General plan policies authorizing or promoting supportive housing can facilitate the integration of h ealthcare services into multifamily housing developments, especially for the 20 See Air Quality chapt er Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 231 elderly and disabled. A number of housing developments in major metropolitan areas include health clinics, and community spaces, and tenant services for speci al needs populations.xxxi Supportive services have multiple benefits, for both tenants and property management. Integrated service delivery plays a critical role with populations at risk of homelessness or institutionalization. Healthcare providers have star ted to bring farmer's markets and gardens on clinic and hospital premises to facilitate access to healthy food for their staff and patients. Clinic locations, particularly federally qualified health centers, serve as important meeting points and services in case of a disaster. Having established systems in place to ensure access to routine services allow for a more robust and resilient system during times of emergency. Health Data and Mapping Data, Mapping, and Tools Defining existing conditions is part of the General Plan update. Incorporating health data creates an opportunity to conduct a more comprehensive existing condition analysis and also serves as a means to provide baseline data to track progress , particularly for the social, economic, and envir onmental factors that can impact health . The housing element section includes analysis of community characteristics related to population characteristics, economic conditions and well-being, housing needs, and special populations. These issues all have he alth implications. As more and more local jurisdictions have started to incorporate explicit health considerations, Geospatial data can be used to analyze health outcomes at a geographic level and to inform how health considerations might be incorporated or targeted. Additional tools such as walk audits, charrettes, community -based visual cataloging, and new crowd sourcing platforms can be an effective means of getting communities involved for more local and qualitative data. Data is informing policy in innovative ways. Just as a physician would look at vital signs of a patient, cities and counties have started to look at vital signs or community dashboards that are reflective of how the population's health is fairing and other indicators that reflect the social, economic, and environmental conditions. This type of analytic measurement can be Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 232 particularly informative when examining areas that are disproportionately burdened by poor health outcomes and help target needed resources towards more vulnerable po pulations. It can also provide a baseline for analytic discussion on location of services, where to prioritize new or update current infrastructure, and provide a means for tracking outcomes of development and infrastructure investments over time. See Social Equity, Environmental Justice, and Community Resilience Chapter for a more in -depth discussion on addressing vulnerable populations. Additional Health Data Resources Many indictors for health, social, environme ntal, and economic indicators are available at the census track level. Health departments also have access to local data that is occasionally available at a more granular level. Some additional health data resources include: Community Health Needs Assessment: This free web -based platform was created to assist community hospitals doing their needs assessment and provides census level data for health, economic, social, environmental, and behavioral data . California Environmental Health Tracking Program : This program is hosted by the CDPH. The data is more focused on environmental health impacts such as air quality, health, climate chan ge related outcomes, water quality, and cancer prevalence. Envirostor : This program is hosted by the Department of Toxic Substances Control. It is a database that provides data in a GIS form to id entify contaminated sites as well as facilities that deal with hazardous waste. This resource is important for remediation and siting. CalEnviroscreen : The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) in the California Environmental Protection Agency created this online mapping tool. It is a tool that can help identify communities that are burdened with high levels of pollution. Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI ): HCI is hosted by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). This indicator list provides evidence for the link to health outcomes, data sources, and provides the ability to create maps. California Health Interview Survey (CHIS): The largest state health survey in the nation, CHIS is a random phone interview administered by the UCLA Center for Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 233 Health Po licy in conjunction with the State Department of Public Health and the Department of Health Care Services. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATIO N IN ANALYSIS OF THI S ELEMENT Health & Health Behavior Related Intent of Analysis Recommended Data Life expectancy can be a good proxy for general health and well -being in the community. Many low -income areas suffer from early mortality and morbidity . Life Expectancy at Birth Asthma can be worsened by environmental triggers such as poor air quality, poor housing quality, and climate change, examining baseline conditions can help inform siting decisions. Asthma (Prevalence, ED visits, hospitalizations) Obesity is caused by many factors, but lack of access to healthy foods and phys ical activity are significant contributors. Examining baseline status can help with policy decisions around active transportation, recreation priorities, and food system policies. Obesity (child and adult) prevalence These diseases, also caused by many f actors, are often associated with obesity. Examining baseline status can help with policy decisions around active transportation, recreation priorities, and food system policies. Secondary diseases from obesity (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, type 2 diabetes prevalence) Many accidents involving pedestrians and bicycles could be improved through infrastructure, design, and signage. Examining a baseline can inform policy and planning for transit routes, active transportation, and safety. Unintentional injury such as pedestrian and bicycle accidents Walk trips is a behavior that benefits health and is influenced by the environment. Examining a baseline number can help inform active transportation and for Walk trips per capita Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 234 climate change and resilien cy policy. Children walking, biking, or rolling to school is a behavior that can improve health and is influenced by the environmental conditions such as distance to school and safety. Examining the baseline condition can inform pol icy priorities around active transportation, active design, school siting, and housing siting. Percent of children who walk, bike, roll to school Commuting decisions also can be influenced by connectivity, cost and ease of use. Active transportation can have positive health benefits since people are able to achieve higher physical activity. Examining the baseline can inform policy priorities around active transpor tation, mixed use developments, job locations, and housing locations. Percent of commuters who use active transportation Eating more fruits and vegetables is a behavior that can be supported through more access to healthy, affordable options. Examining a baseline condition can inform policy around food systems, location of services, and mixed use developments. Consumption of daily fruits and vegetables Understanding the poverty conditions can help focus resources and policy development to areas that need additional support . Poverty data for population below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level Income is an important predictor of health outcomes. Access to job opportunities as well as job/housing/work force fit can inform transit lines, housing location, and where jobs are incentivize d to locate. Employment Density (example: Trade Transportation, utility, leisure, hospitality, goods producing, government, education, real estate, finance, health services) Mapping baseline food retail and access conditions can identify areas that might not have adequate access and inform policy priorities and decisions for siting.

Walk and bike maps Mapping baseline conditions can help identify areas that could benefit from improved transportation options Public transit facilities Safety in the neighborhood can impact social stress and influence whether people will be active. Establishing a baseline condition can help inform safety policies such as crime prevention through environmental design. Percent of people that feel safe in their neighborhoods Air quality has direct effects on people with respiratory disease. Mapping baseline condi tions can help inform policies around transportation, connectivity, siting, and industry. Air quality (ozone, pm 2.5) Extreme heat days and heat island effects can cause illness and even death in extreme circumstances. Monitoring heat days and areas wi th worse heat effects can help inform policies around transit, greening, materials, and programs to mitigate its effects. Extreme Heat Days, heat islands effects Urban canopy can have multiple benefits for air quality, shade for easier time spent outdoor s for commuting and recreation, and even new research on the benefits of mental health and mood. Establishing a baseline can help inform policy for transit, roadway, recreation, and bike and pedestrian planning. Urban canopy Health facilities provide da ily services and often serve the community in disaster. Establishing a baseline of where services are located can help improve transit decisions, siting, and emergency preparedness planning. Location of health facilities Mapping where schools and child facilities are can provide an important baseline. This can inform policies Location of schools, child care facilities Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 236 to leverage joint use agreements, ensure they are accessible and free from newly sited environmental hazards. How much people drive is a great proxy to understand how active community members are. New research suggests that the amount of time spent in a vehicle may have potential effects on mental and physical health. VMT OPR Recommended Policies A full list of recommended policies c an be found here As is the case throughout the entire general plan, many of the policies have relation to other elements. This is particularly true with the healt h-related policies, below are some of the top pr iorities for consideration. A full appendix of example health r elated polices are in appendix A .

Th e paths to it are not found, they are made.\" --Jane Garvey Introduction Addressing equity in policy decisions is vital for community well -being, the economy, and health of the population. Studies show the relationship between zip code and life expectancy, with lower life expectancy frequently in the most disadvantaged areas.xxxii In addition to infrastructure investments and locations, policies to support community engagement and the human capital in local communities is vital to create more thriving, health y, and equitable places.xxxiii Additionally, there are significant demographic shifts taking place across California including more aging seniors, increasing ethnic diversity, and changing household structures.xxxiv Using a social equity lens in the general plan process is one important mechanism to ensure more equitable access to opportunity in cities and counties and greater environmental justice throughout California.xxxv Many professional disciplines such as Transportation, Housing, Agriculture, Energy, Economic Development, Land Use, Health, and Education are increasingly using a social equity lens to inform policy.xxxvi xxxvii Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 239 Equity has been advocated as a framework for urban planning since the 1960s. The concept recognize s that through expanding choices and services to those with limited options, local jurisdictions could work towards improved planning outcomes.xxxviii The environmental justice (EJ) movement gained momentum in the 1980s and was strengthened by President Clinton's Executive Order 12898, \"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low -income Populations\" in 1994.xxxix The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledges \"equitable development draws on both environmental justice and smart growth.\"xl There are several overlapping definitions and frameworks to contextualize social equity, EJ, and disadvantaged communities with ongoing robust conversation to refine these definitions. In fact, EJ as a field has undergone tremendous transition both in research and on the ground as groups ha ve worked to expand access to services, healthy food, affordable housing, and expand beyond the work that traditionally focused on the disproportionate burden of pollution and contaminants suffered by many communities of color.xlixlii AB 1553 (Keeley, Chapter 762, Statutes of 2001) requires OPR to provide guidance for lo cal jurisdictions to incorporate Environmental Justice Considerations (1) Propose methods for planning for the equitable distribution of new public facilities and services that increase and enhance community quality of life throughout the community, give n the fiscal and legal constraints that restrict the siting of these facilities. (2) Propose methods for providing for the location, if any, of industrial facilities and uses that, even with the best available technology, will contain or produce materia l that, because of its quantity, concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics, poses a significant hazard to human health and safety, in a manner that seeks to avoid over -concentrating these uses in proximity to schools or residential dwellings. (3) Propose methods for providing for the location of new schools and residential dwellings in a manner that seeks to avoid locating these uses in proximity to industrial facilities and uses that will contain or produce material that because of its quan tity, concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics, poses a significant hazard to human health and safety. (4) Propose methods for promoting more livable communities by expanding opportunities for transit -oriented development so that residents minimize traffic and pollution impacts from traveling for purposes of work, shopping, schools, and recreation. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 240 It is impossible to full y separate the concept s of social equity and EJ because they are intertwined. However, for practical reasons, in this chapter we will first consider broader social equity issues. Incorporating equity in land use planning is a key component to achieving EJ and generally more equitable outcomes across communities. This chapter explores how planning decisions can affect equitable opportunity in a community and how local jurisdictions can incorporate a social equity lens in their planning process with definiti ons of commonly used terms as related to disadvantaged communities. Using a social equity lens is a first step in addressing EJ considerations, but more specific considerations are necessary to adequately address EJ, which this chapter provides. Additional ly, examples are provided for how incorporating social equity in general plans will improve community resilience. Correlations Between Elements Land Use Circulation Housing Conservation Open Space Noise Safety Social Equity and Environmental Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Social Equity Incorporating equity considerations with regard to race, ethnicity, gender, age, income, and physical ability throughout the general plan update from outreach to policy to implementation can have important outcomes at the local, regional, and state level. Incorporating social equity in the General Plan - What does it mean? It means: Improved access to healthy, green places to play More reliable t ransit options Increased safe roads and sidewalks Ensuring access to affordable housing options Creating spaces for all ages and abilities Improved access to jobs Active inclusion in governmental processes, programs, and decisions Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 241 Programs are increasingly incorporating an equity lens in the decision and policy -making process to ensure better decisions.xliii Social equity in the policy conte xt can be defined as \"the fair, just, and equitable management of all institutions serving the public directly or by contract; the fair, just and equitable distribution of public services and implementation of public policy; and the commitment to promote f airness, justice, and equity in the formation of public policy.xliv SB 244 , passed in 2011, specifically recognized that many disadvantaged unincorp orated communities lacked adequate investment in infrastructure such as sidewalks, safe drinking water, and adequate waste processing. This lack of adequate investment threaten s both health and safety of residents and create s more inequity in terms of acc ess to quality services.xlv SB244 created procedural requirements to identify these areas of risk and update policies within the local general plan to improve conditions. See OPR's Technical Advisory on SB244. In the context of creating a general plan, one can think about distribution and access to resources within a neighborhood that help provide opportunity to thrive and protection from harmful elements that will make it difficult for a pa rticular community to prosper and reach their full potential. Cities and counties can prioritize access to public facilities and services that enhance quality of life , including, but not limited to, public transportation options connected to job centers, Chico's General Plan Vision 2030 - Inclusion of Social Equity \"For the purposes of this General Plan, social equity means fair access to housing, transportation, jobs, educa tion, and recreation, and access for all residents to fully participate in the political and cultural life of the community. Social equity is closely connected to the other two sustainability components of economic vitality and environmental protection. It both depends on and supports a local, diverse economy that provides a wide range of work and volunteer opportunities for people of all ages and skills and a healthy environment with clean air and water, open spaces to recreate, and protection from potenti al hazards. Strategies in this General Plan that promote social equity include ensuring adequate housing for all age and income levels; providing an open government that values public participation; celebrating arts and cultures; assisting the more vulnera ble members of the community; supporting the development and preservation of complete neighborhoods, promoting public health through protection from hazards and the provision of a safe multimodal circulation system; and providing parks and quality public s ervices to all members of the community.\" Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 242 housing, parks, open space, trails, greenbelts, recreational facilities (including senior and youth centers), community centers, grocery stores, health care facilities, child care centers, libraries, and cultural centers. Considering the number , quality, and access to facilities is important. For example, with regard to access, transportation decisions are informed by commute times. However, commute times are calculated during certain hours. Often service sector commuters travel at later or earlier hour s and regular commuter calculations do not adequately capture service sector needs. Many forms of inequity are not intentional, but manifest themselves in terms of process or results. Therefore, by increasing awareness and modifying practices , jurisdicti ons can improve processes. Geographic inequity describes a situation in which the burdens of undesirable land uses are concentrated in certain neighborhoods while the benefits are received elsewhere. It also describes a situation in which public amenities are concentrated only in certain areas. Examples of Procedural Inequity Examples of Geographic Inequity \"Stacking\" commissions or committees with certain interests while not taking into account the interests of other segments of the community, such as minority and low -income residents. Certain neighborhoods have a disproportionate share of waste disposal facilities, while the benefits of such facilities are received by the community or region as a whole Holding meetings at times or in locations that mini mize the ability of certain groups or individuals to participate. Certain neighborhoods have ample community centers, parks, and open space and thus experience more of the environmental benefits associated with these amenities, while other neighborhoods ha ve fewer such amenities. Using English -only written or verbal communication when a non -English speaking population will be affected by a planning decision. Certain neighborhoods have more access to healthy food retail, banks, or transit options . In cont rast, some neighborhoods have an abundance of less healthy retail, due to differing land uses. Enforcement of city codes and policies Certain municipal services, such as libraries, Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 243 through a complaint system only accessible by some (such as online or during specified hours) after school programs, and recreation services, are not available in some neighborhoods Requiring lower levels of mitigation for projects affecting low -income or minority populations. Certain neighborhoods have a disproportionate share of industrial facilities that handle or produce hazardous waste, while the economic benefits are distributed to other neighborhoods (in the form of jobs and tax revenue). Definitions In conversations about equity terms such as underserved, low -income , disadvantaged, or environmental justice community are often interchanged but can potentially have different meanings depending on the context. In discussions about equity, it is important to clarify terminology. For instance, one could reference a disad vantaged community while referring to an elderly or disabled population that does not have adequate access to transit options. Alternatively, disadvantaged could refer to children who do not have access to safe places to play. Several common terms have statutory definitions and others are used more generally. Additionally, many state and federal programs utilize the statutory definitions to determine funding for programs. Some of the most applicable to local planning are below and apply where there is no ot her prevailing statutory definition: Some of the more common definitions are below: Statutory definitions Disadvantaged Community - Public Resources Code S ection 75005, Water Code Section 79505.5 A \"Disadvantaged Community\" is a community with a median household income less than 80 percent of the statewide median household income. \"Severely disadvantaged community\" means a community with a median household income less than 60 percent o f the statewide average. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 244 Disadvantaged Unincorporated Community as per SB244/ GC Section 65302.10 (a) \"Community\" means an inhabited area within a city or county that is comprised of no less than 10 dwellings adjacent or in close proximity to one another. \"Disadvantaged unincorporated community\" means a fringe, island, or legacy community in which the median household income is 80 percent or less than the statewide median household income. \"Island community\" means any inhabited and unincorporated territory that is surrounded or substantially surrounded by one or more cities or by one or more cities and a county boundary or the Pacific Ocean. \"Fringe community\" means any inhabited and unincorporated territory that is within a city's sphere of influence. \"Legacy community\" means a geographically isolated community that is inhabited and has existed for at least 50 years Environmental justice Government Code 65040.12(e) EJ is defined in state planning law as the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Health Equity Health and Safet y Code 131019.5 Recognizes \"determinants of equity\" means social, economic, geographic, political, and physical environmental conditions that lead to the creation of a fair and just society. Furthermore, \"Health equity\" means efforts to ensure that all pe ople have full and equal access to opportunities that enable them to lead healthy lives. Government Funding Perspectives Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 245 Some land use related funding programs also incorporate equity considerations and have slightly different qualifying definitions for d isadvantaged communities. AB 32 ( The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 ) commits California to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. A k ey part of the strategy to reduce GHG was the implementation of the Cap and Trade Program. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), established in 2012, receives auction proceeds from Cap and Trade and directs how funds are administered. SB 535xlvi, signed into law in September 2012, requires that 25% of the proceeds benefit disadvantaged communities and that 10% of project funds be used within disadvantaged communities. The bill requires the California Environmental Protection Agency ( CalEPA) to identify the disadvantaged communities. CalEPA developed the EnviroScreen tool to help define these communities. Sev eral programs, including the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program, administered by the Strategic Growth Council, rely on this tool. The Active Transportation Program consolidate s many state and federal programs into one program to be administered by the California Department of Transportation. This program ensures that at least 25% of the funds benefit disadvantaged communities. This program allows communities to qualify as disad vantaged if one of three criteria is met including: xlvii 1. The median household income is less than 80% of the statewide median 2. The area is identified by Cal Enviroscreen in the most disadvantaged 25% of the state 3. At least 75% of public school students in the project area meet eligibility criteria to receive free or reduced -price meals Incorporating a Social Equity Lens Cities and counties may incorporate equity into their general plans in several ways. To incorporate equity it is helpful to consider 1) Dat a, Mapping, and Tools; 2) Community Engagement and Partnership; and 3) Incorporating supportive policies. Data, Mapping, and Tools Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 246 An important step in the process of incorporating equity considerations is to assess baseline conditions and acknowledge exi sting disparities. Jurisdictions have to collect at least jurisdiction -wide socioeconomic data during the preparation of the housing element, such as income level and persons with special housing needs (elderly, farmworkers, single head of household, etc. ). However, a more complete socioeconomic picture of the community can be analyzed using smaller geographic data sets, less than jurisdiction -wide, such as census tracts, which allows a comparison of different areas throughout a community . Many of the suggested data is available in the GPG mapping tool . Data sources specifically help evaluate equity and EJ considerations: Census Data : The United States Census collects data on a range of factors. The American Community Survey is conducted annually. Regional Opportunit y Index , UC Davis Toolxlviii: This tool provides an index based on social, economic, and environmental indicators for review and analysis by local citizens, program managers, and policy makers to inform investment decisions. Local data: Local data on amenities available. Envirostor : This program is hosted by the Department of Toxic Substances Control. It is a database that provides data in a GIS form to identify contaminated sites as well as facilities t hat deal with hazardous waste. CalEnviroscreen : The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) in the California Environmental Protection Agency created this online mapping tool. It is a tool that can help identify communities that are burdened with high levels of pollution. California Environmental Health Tracking Program : The California Department of Public Health created thi s online mapping tool. It is a tool that helps identify environmental risks associated with health outcomes such as poor air quality and asthma. SAMPLE OF OPR RECOMMENDED DATA FOR CONSIDERATIO N IN ANALYSIS OF THI S ELEMENT Intent of analysis Recommended Data Different segments of the population have Population by age Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 247 Social, Economic, or Environmental different needs. For instance, elderly populations might need more time to cross the street or need specific accommodations to use public transit. Understanding the ethnic distribution throughout the city and/or county can help inform languages used in outreach and cultural considerations for engagement. Population by race/ethnicity Understanding characteristics such as single parent househol ds, larger family households, age, etc. can help inform priority amenities in an area Population by household type Life expectancy is often used as a good proxy measure for overall health. There can be significant variation by zip code in life expectanc y. Resources could be targeted in these areas as well as additional grant opportunities leveraged. Life Expectancy Overall balance of resources is important to create a livable community. Location of amenities such as parks, health care facilities, hous ing, job corridors, and water-related services Community Engagement and Partnerships Robust community engagement to capture all voices within the community from the beginning of the general plan update is vital to creating a shared vision with significan t community support , creating a plan that is more likely to acknowledge community challenges and accurately account for existing community assets. Partnership and engagement with diverse stakeholders also helps create more support for the plan during the a pproval process. There are many actions a local agency can take to support engagement from all sectors and groups within the local community. Focused outreach effort to specific groups that work on equity issues within the community , such as local communit y-based organizations , can be an effective way to incorporate an equity lens. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 248 Often, outreach is overseen by consultants assisting with the General Plan update. It is also helpful to have a city or county staff assigned to serve as a liaison or oversee t he outreach process for continuity after the consultant finishes the project. This also provides for consistent and ongoing communication after plan adoption and implementation updates with the community. As emphasized in the second chapter, A Vision for Long -Range Planning , working in partnership with local agencies is important to provide coordination and accomplish many of the policies to provide more equitable access to resources. The Community Engagement and Partnership chapter provides more detailed guidance on ways to effectively engage with the community. Incorporating Supportive Policies An analysis of existing conditions combined with robust community input can help bri ng particular policy issues to the forefront for discussion. As policy priorities are established, formulating strong policy language is a key first step. For example, rather than \"consider implementing\" use the word \"implement.\" Also, instead of using th e phrase \"consider the development of ,\"\" use \"develop and implement.\" Additionally, to create more actionable policy language use \"priority on\" rather than \"emphasis on\" to highlight policy areas of particular focus. Environmental Justice A social equ ity lens in the planning process is an important initial step towards achieving more equitable outcomes and environmental justice. It tends to be most helpful when planning toward future development. Many EJ issues require specific remediation efforts, or more in -depth policy and siting considerations with regard to specific environmental exposures. Additionally, some jurisdictions have created a stand -alone element that weaves together policy to ensure more equitable access to services, food, safe places to play, and EJ issues. The adoption of an EJ element is consistent with Section 65303 of the State of California Government Code. There are ben efits to having a separate EJ element because it Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 249 can be easier for the public and decision -makers to see EJ -related policies in one place. At the same time, an integrated approach puts EJ -related policies into the elements that address those issues; for ex ample, including siting of industries into the land use element could make implementation more actionable. Regardless of approach, the EJ -related policies must meet internal consistency rules set forth in Government Code Section 65300.5 . EJ policies carry the same legal weight as the required elements once the final general plan is adopted. Ultimately, the best format will depend on the local cont ext, community interest, and should complement the overall general plan update and vision. Whether incorporated into a separate element or addressed throughout the document, explicitly considering siting compatibility, location of industrial facilities, an d siting of sensitive populations is important to achieve EJ. Additionally, inserting policies that may help mitigate existing injustices. Compatibility At the general plan level, discussions about environmental justice involve a central land use concept: compatibility. The primary purpose of planning, and the source of government authority to engage in planning, is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Incompatible land uses may create health, safety, and w elfare issues for the community. Traditional, r igid separation of land uses has resulted in disconnected islands of activity and contributed to sprawl. Development patterns characterized by single -use result in the automobile being the only viable transpo rtation option, which results in high environmental, economic, health, and social costs. Incorporating general plan policies to encourage equity while protecting residential and school land uses requires an understanding of compatibility combined with an interest in equity. Encouraging mixed use development, proximity to transit corridors, and access to employment, education, commercial centers, services, and recreation should be considered alongside specific uses that will always be incompatible with resi dential and school uses. Residential and school uses are impacted by incompatible land uses that have environmental effects, such as noise, air emissions (including dust), and exposure to hazardous materials. The compatibility problem also operates in rev erse. Incompatible uses adjacent to residential units, schools, or environmentally sensitive areas may also suffer Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 250 negative consequences in the form of higher mitigation costs or the curtailment of economic activities. Specific examples of land use incompa tibility include: Residential , childcare, and school uses in proximity to industrial facilities and other uses that, even with the best available technology, will contain or produce materials that, because of their quantity, concentration, or physical or c hemical characteristics, pose a significant hazard to human health and safety. Residential , childcare, and school uses adjacent to intensive agricultural uses. Residential , childcare, and school uses adjacent to major thoroughfares, such as highways. Residential or commercial uses in proximity to resource utilization activities, such as mining or oil and gas wells. Industrial Facilities and Large Scale Agricultural Lands Facilities that emit, handle, store, or dispose of hazardous materials are regulated by a variety of agencies. These agencies include local Certified Unified Program Agencies . However, cities and counties, as the local land use authority, are primarily responsible for the location and distribution of potentially hazardous industrial facilities through their general plans and zoning ordinances. Cities and counties may pursue several strategies within their general plans to address over - concentration whi ch occurs when two or more industrial facilities or uses, which do not individually exceed acceptable regulatory standards for public health and safety, but pose a significant hazard due to their cumulative effects. Strategies may include incorporating pol icies for the following areas: Buffer zones between industry and residential land uses. Buffer zones are a broad approach to land use compatibility. Buffer zone policies may be approached in one of two ways. The general plan land use diagram may designate transitional land uses between industrial and agricultural and residential areas. Transitional uses may include open space, light industry, office uses, business parks, or heavy commercial uses. The land use policies for these buffer areas should prohibit school uses. Appropriate distances for buffer areas will vary Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 251 depending on local circumstances. Factors such as the intensity of nearby residential uses, prevailing winds, geographic features, and the types of facilities and uses allowed in industrial are as should be considered. Buffer zones may be implemented at the project level. One weakness of general buffer zone policies is the difficulty of making a priori decisions about how much distance is needed to minimize potential health and safety hazards to residential and school uses. A stronger approach may be buffer policies aimed at individual siting decisions. Project siting decisions. Approval of certain industrial facilities or uses can be made conditional if they are within a certain distance of resi dential or school uses and/or contain or produce hazardous materials. This allows the city or county to consider the potential hazards associated with individual facilities or uses on a case -by-case basis. General plan policies can outline consistent stand ards to be used in approving, conditionally approving, or denying proposed locations for industrial facilities and other uses that may pose a significant hazard to human health and safety. Such standards should be reflected in the zoning ordinance that imp lements the general plan (see Implementation Chapter ). Capping the number of certain facilities and uses. Another policy response to over -concentration is to cap the number of potentially hazardous facilitie s within a certain distance of each other. For example, the State of Georgia does not allow siting of a new solid waste facility if two such facilities already exist within a two mile radius of the proposed facility. While capping policies are easy to impl ement and understandable to the public, they have serious drawbacks. Without analyzing the type, quantity, and concentration of materials to be contained or produced at a proposed facility, it is difficult to determine the number of facilities that would c reate a situation of over-concentration. Changing land use designations in over -concentrated areas. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 252 One way to address existing or potential future problems of over -concentration is to change the land use designation for existing industrial areas. This ap proach differs from buffer zones in that buffer zones affect the land use designation of areas adjacent to existing or proposed industrial areas. Changing the allowable land uses in existing industrial areas prevents new industrial land uses from being established and may affect the expansion of existing facilities and uses (depending on how local policies treat pre -existing or \"legal non -conforming,\" land uses). An important caveat is to consider what new uses will be allowed in the previously industrial areas. A new environmental justice problem could be created if residences and schools are allowed without considering any lingering effects of industrial over-concentration. At the same time, where over -concentration is no longer an issue and effective rem ediation or clean -up is possible, so -called \"brownfield\" development is an important tool for a community's continued sustainable development. New Residential Uses and Schools Cities and counties should provide for the location of new schools and residen tial dwellings in a manner that avoid s locating these uses in proximity to industrial facilities and agricultural lands and uses that will contain or produce materials that, because of their quantity, concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics, pose a significant hazard to human health and safety. The location of new residential and school development is the flip side of the problem discussed in the section above. Given the need for new housing and schools and given the need to make efficient us e of land, how do Legal Requirements: CEQA and School Siting CEQA requires that the environmental document prepared for a new school identify whether the proposed site is any of the following: a current or former hazardous waste o r solid waste disposal facility, a hazardous substances release site identified by DTSC, the site of one or more pipelines that carry hazardous substances, or located within a quarter mile of a facility that emits hazardous air emissions or handles acutely hazardous material (Public Resources Code \u00a721151.8). for sites within 500 feet of a busy traffic corridor, the school board must determine through modeling that neither short term nor long term air quality exposure poses significant health risks to pupils (Ed Code 17213) If such facilities exist, the school board must make findings that the facilities would not endanger the health of those attending or employed by the proposed school or that existing corrective measures would result in the mitigation of any health endangerment. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 253 cities and counties deal with existing over -concentration of industrial uses? When designating areas for residential development, the city or county should identify any areas of over -concentration. Appropriate buffers should be placed bet ween over -concentrated industrial and agricultural areas and new residential areas. Using their authority over the approval and design of subdivisions, cities and counties may develop policies and standards related to industrial over -concentration and new residential subdivision approvals. These policies could include buffer zones, as well as the criteria to be used for rejecting new residential development (such as standards for risk to human health and safety from nearby industrial facilities and uses). The location of new schools is of particular concern to both local governments and school districts. The general plan should identify possible locations for new schools. Such locations may be approximate and need not indicate specific parcels. Identifying a ppropriate school locations as part of the general plan process may avoid project -level problems of proximity to certain industrial facilities and uses. Due to the fragmentation of authority in the areas of land use planning and school siting and construct ion, it is recommended that the planning agency work closely with the school district to identify suitable school locations. Before adopting or amending a general plan, the planning agency must refer the proposed action to any school district within the ar ea covered by the proposed action ( \u00a765352 ). The city or county should use this opportunity to engage school districts on issues of school siting. School districts are required to notify the planning commission of the city or county before acquiring property for new schools or expansion of an existing school. School districts are not bound by local zoning ordinances unless the ordinance provides for the location of schools and the city or county has adopted a general plan (\u00a753091 ). School districts can override the general plan and zoning ord inances with regard to the use of property for classroom facilities by a two -thirds vote of the school board ( \u00a753094 ). The school board cannot ex ercise this power for non -classroom facilities, such as administrative buildings, bus storage and maintenance yards, and warehouses. If the school board exercises their override power, they must notify the city or county within 10 days ( \u00a753904 ). At least 45 days prior to completion of a Master Plan or other plan relating to the \" Social equity factors, such as disparities in income, linguistic isolation, educational attainment and access to resources can greatly influence the ways populations experience a hazard. Understanding equity and engaging communit ies that will be most affected before, during and after a hazard event are steps toward building an adequate response to climate change. By helping to facilitate responses that are rooted in the needs of local communities and local challenges, climate chan ge adaptation planning can become more effective. \" ART paper Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 254 expansion of existing school site or acquisition of new sites, the scho ol district governing board shall notify and provide relevant information to the city/county planning commission and meet with the city/county if requested. ( \u00a765352 .2) Community Resilience Community resilience refers to the ability of a community to respond, recover, and adapt, and do so dynamically. Akin to the circulation of traffic, if power is lost and a traffic light goes out, a bottleneck wi ll occur, slowing traffic down. If the system is vulnerable - for example, if one street light stops working , and that ripples throughout the community with traffic jams - the system is not resilient . When systems within a community are vulnerable, the ef fects can ripple throughout the area as well. \" Vulnerability is the flip side of resilience: when a social or ecological system loses resilience it becomes vulnerable to change that previously could be absorbed.\"xlix Incorporating social equity is a key stra tegy for local governments to work toward sustainability and create resilient communities. Often, sustainability is discussed in terms of the \"three E's\" - environment, economy, and equity.\" Although it is one of the central pillars, social equity is often not integrated into planning to the full extent possible.l General plan policies provide a unique opportunity to integrate planning priorities across agencies as well as align with other planning initiatives such as climate action planning and regional pl anning which is needed to incorporate many of the social equity considerations. It is vital to incorporate policies to support community resilience given the growing social, economic, and disaster risks. Some examples of climate action planning include wat er security planning, drought planning, wildfire planning and hazard mitigation plans. The following section brings together some example strategies and polices from throughout the General Plan Guidelines and highlights how incorporating social equity con siderations strengthens cities and counties as a whole.

It strongly influences how a jurisdiction governs . Cities and counties may include a distinct economic development element, or highlight economic development as a primary theme or goal throughout their general plan . Most communities set forth goals of economic health and sustain able funding for public services for current and future residents , as part of support for a thriving business environment, job growth and retention, and , as approp riate, community revitalization. Correlations Between Elements Land Use Circulation Housing Conservation Open Space Noise Safety Economic Development Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 257 Economic Developmen t and the General Plan Decisions regarding land use and circulation can promote businesses and increase property values ( Cervero 2002 ). Planning effective transportation access to c enters of employment, education, and services can help a city or county build and maintain a strong economy. Ensuring an appropriate jobs housing balance provides residents with nearby employment choices. And fostering public health will have a direct effe ct on improvements in labor productivity and increased personal income (Merson 2012) . Businesses and Employment Cities and counties can use general plan policies to promote business development and retention , job training and workforce development polici es, partnerships with education institutions and private and non -profit organizations, incentives for targeted business investments, and marketing and communications programs . Connecting economic development with businesses and employment opportunities sh ould be based around goals identified through community engagement, which should include targeted outreach to the business community. Involving potential employees, developers, and business leaders in the planning process early will help ensure policies g rounded in community. Economic development has a strong relationship to circulation. Resident and visitor access to employment centers and commercial centers is critical . Assessing and addressing the relationship between current and future accessibility through multiple modes , including transit and pedestrian and bicycle will provide employees and customers access to new and existing businesses and help support economic growth and vitality. Proximity to transit options increases property value as well as economic activity. Promoting connected systems of walkways, bikeways, and transit lines leading to economic centers provides easy, affordable access to retail, employment, and services. Including additional infrastructure around retail centers, such as b ikeshare stations, pedestrian rest areas, and covered transit stops, may help economic stimulation. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 258 Revenue Share Agreements At times, when potential development straddles geographic boundaries between jurisdictions, projects can be delayed or terminated due to conflict over revenue. Shared sales tax agreements, such as the one between the cities of Oakland and Emeryville , can ensure each city or county receives a share of the benefits of economic growth. Economic Development and Displacement As cities and counties grow and prosper, consideration must be given to ensuring equitable development and opportuni ty for all community members. Whether low income or middle class, families across the country are feeling the financial strain brought on by higher rents and cost of living. While figures vary by geography and demographics, overall, low and middle income housing availability in California is shrinking. For every 100 extremely low income (ELI) renter households, there are just 31 affordable and available units (NLIHC). Revitalizing communities, building strong city and county economies, embracing sustainab le, coordinated development, and improving infrastructure are all positive policies with a wide range of benefits for their communities. A strong economy will produce a wide range of jobs with a wide range of salaries. An efficient economy will make the w hole range of workers needed accessible to those jobs. HCD has created a set of best practices to combat displacement in planning and imp lementation. Additionally, numerous organizations and academics are working to identify potential tools for planners, advocates, and local governments. Some of these tools include Community benefits funds Value Capture Inclusionary zoning Community Assets and Fiscal Stability Community assets suc h as schools, parks, open space, universities, and cultural amenities, as well as infrastructure such as sidewalks, transit systems, and utilities, help create cities and counties that attract citizens and businesses. The creation, maintenance, and promoti on of assets and infrastructure should be addressed throughout the general plan. Infrastructure and community assets must align with economic development goals, as they attract, retain, and support the workforce and commercial base that new and existing bu sinesses require. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 259 Ultimately, businesses will invest in and support communities that offer a strong workforce, a stable fiscal climate, and policies to support their growth. General plans create an opportunity for cities and counties to implement policies that can spur economic development, revenue generation, and shared benefits for all community members. Engagement with the Business Community A strong general plan will benefit from outreach and input from all community members. It is especially importan t to engage business community members in any economic development plans, as their input and support is vital to its success. Direct outreach including visiting existing businesses, surveys, and small, targeted meetings, will help ensure engagement with th e business community. Additionally, working with business organizations such as chambers of commerce, Business Improvement Districts, and Economic Development Corporations; partnering with service clubs such as Rotary or Kiwanis; and connecting with Colleg es and Universities and Workforce Investment Boards will create a robust pool of information from community members invested in economic development. Such outreach could even lead to public private partnerships, shared benefit programs, or increased invest ment in the community.

As the bodies that govern land use, cities and counties have the authority to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from new development, and to plan ahead to alleviate the worst effects of climate change. This chapter refers readers to resources and tools designed to help cities and counties address climate change effectively in their general plans. Throughout the General Plan Guidelines there are references to addressing GHG emissions reductions and climate change resilience and adaptation. The climate change chapter is meant to frame climate change as a priority to be addressed throughout the general plan and to provide a holistic view f or how resources and tools should be used to support analysis of climate change. Other chapters are much more specific about how climate change should be addressed in the context of that element/chapter and should be referenced for guidance in that topic a rea. The impacts of c limate change pose an immediate and growing threat to California's economy, environment, and to public health. Cities and counties will continue to experience effects of climate change in various ways, including increased likelihood o f droughts, flooding, wildfires, heatwaves and severe weather . Communities can explore the potential Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 263 impacts of climate change in distinct places through the Cal -Adapt tool at www.cal - adapt.org . California communit ies can address these impacts in various ways. One is through adaptation and resilience policies. Another is to reduce the impacts of climate change through policies and programs that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Throughout this section, reducing green house gas emissions will be referred to as \"GHG reductions\" and taking measures to address the impacts of climate change will be referred to interchangeably as either \"resilience\" or \"adaptation\". For more in depth definitions of GHG emissions and resilien ce refer to the California Air Resources Board \" AB32 Scoping Plan \" and the California Natural Resources Agency \" Safeguarding California Plan .\" The State of California addresses climate change through greenhouse gas emissions reduction, climate change resilience/readiness, and research in to the causes and effects of climate change. These \"three R's\" of climate change policy can help support jurisdictions throughout the State understand, mitigate, and become more resilient to climate change. For more information on how the State of California is supporting these efforts please visit the State's climate change portal: www.climatechange.ca.gov . The tools and resources outlined in this chapter provide a basic set of resources for local governments to address climate change in general plans and related documents like climate action plans. Each jurisdiction is differ ent, but these tools can be used to develop locally - appropriate climate policies. Planners should note that mitigation measures chosen should disproportionately affect low income communities. S ome of the more useful climate change tools and resources refe renced throughout this section and in other parts of the general plan guidelines include the following: Process Guidance and Vulnerability/Impac t Tools Comprehensive free resource for reducing GHG emissions at the local level California SEEC Guidelines for CEQA compliance CEQA Guidelines Comprehensive framework for addressing adaptation at the local level Adaptation Planning Guide Visualization tool for the impacts of climate change and links to resources Cal-Adapt Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 264 Federal resource for visualizing impacts, case studies, decision sup port Climate Resilience Toolkit Greenhouse Gas Emission s Tools Links to various tools and case studies Cool California Outlines the steps to reduce GHG emissions and includes templates California SEEC Outlines examples of policies and programs to reduce GHG emissions CAPCOA Provides state priorities, targets and the narrative regarding the importance of local planning on climate change AB32 Scoping Plan Climate Adaptation and Resilience The definitive guide to developing adaptation policy at the local level in California Adaptation Planning Guide The State's approach to addressing climate impacts Safeguarding California Plan The State's framework (and local guidance) for climate hazards State Hazard Mitigation Plan Correlations Between Elements Land Use Circulation Housing Conservation Open Space Noise Safety Climate Change Identified in statute Closely related to statutory requirements Climate Adaptation Planning Extreme weather events are expected to intensify in the coming decades due to climate change. Emergency managers, planning g agencies, private companies, and communities affected by climate change will need to plan for the increase in the type, extent , and Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 265 intensity of natural hazards. A jurisdiction can start the process of understanding local impacts by using the resour ces in Cal-Adapt , the State's visualization tool for climate impacts. Cal -Adapt can be used in conjunction with California's climate change resilience decision support tool called the Adaptation Planning Guide . In addition to individual action, many l ocal governments are choosing to create or join collaborative partnerships that address climate adaptation at a multijurisdictional level . The Alliance of Regional Collaboratives for Climate Adaptation (ARRCA) (see www.arccacalifornia.org ) was developed in 2012 to help prepare California's urban centers for the poten tial extreme events such as flooding, heat waves, and fi res and can be a coordination point for policy and program initiatives related to climate change impacts. California Climate Adaptation Planning Guide (APG) The California Climate Adaptation Planning Guide (APG ) provides guidance for addressing the unavoidable consequences of climate change. The APG introduces the reason for climate change adaptation planning and details a step -by-step process for lo cal and regional climate vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategy development. The APG was developed to allow flexibility in the commitment of time, money, and scope. The APG consists of the following four documents: APG: Planning for Adaptive Com munities - This document presents the reason for climate change adaptation planning and introduces a step -by-step process for local and regional climate vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategy development. All communities should start with this do cument. APG: Defining Local and Regional Impacts - This supplemental document provides a more in-depth understanding of how climate change can affect a community. Seven \"impact sectors\" are included to support communities conducting a climate vulnerability assessment. APG: Understanding Regional Characteristics - The impact of climate change varies across the state. This supplemental document identifies climate impact regions, including their environmental and socioeconomic characteristics. APG: Identifying Adaptation Strategies - This supplemental document explores potential adaptation strategies that communities can use. Adaptation strategies are categorized into the same impact sectors used in the APG: Defining Local and Regional Impacts document. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 266 Steps i n Climate Adaptation Strategy Development Developing climate change adaptation strategies can take different approaches; however, the basic steps are described below (see Figure 4.A). Figure 6: The Nine Steps in Adaptation Strate gy Development as outlined in the Adaptation Planning Guide Source: California APG: Defining Local and Regional Impacts The steps outlined above are part of the vulnerability assessment (Steps 1 -5) and adaptation strategy development (Steps 6 -9). For m ore information on each of these steps and details Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 267 about how to proceed through vulnerability and adaptation planning please refer to the Adaptation Planning Guide. Climate change adaptation and resilience should be integrated throughout the elements of a general plan. It should also provide context for changes in the environmental setting that will occur over time. Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions While responding to t he impacts resulting from climate change may be the primary reason to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, co -benefits from reduction strategies may result in better health outcomes, lower energy costs, improved access to transportation options, recreational o pportunities and general resource efficiency. The AB32 Scoping Plan located on the California Air Resources Board website and the related Cool California website are good p laces to start reviewing context and guidance for jurisdictions developing climate action plans and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. The AB32 Scoping Plan includes a section on local and regional leadership that provides examples and case studies of successful local initiatives on climate. The California State Energy Efficiency Collaborative (SEEC) also provides free tools and resour ces for developing a climate change program. Figure 4b, The Five Milestone Process for Developing a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 268 Source: www.californiaseec.org Local governments play a critical role in re ducing greenhouse gas emissions . In California local governments regulate many activities that contribute to GHGs and air pollutants, including industrial permitting, land use and transportation planning, zoning and urban growth decisions, implementation o f building codes and other standards, and control of municipal operations. For example, local and regional actions have a significant influence on vehicle miles traveled (VMT). ARB regulates vehicle fuel efficiency and the carbon intensity of fuel, but V MT is impacted by land use decisions and continues to increase in California . Regional and local governments and agencies influence VMT -related GHG emissions both on a project -level basis and in integrated, long -term blueprints such as the Sustainable Comm unities Strategies (SCS) and regional transportation plans. In addition, local land use decisions can promote climate -friendly policies such as transit -oriented and mixed -use development that can also create consistency with the region's SCS, if applicable . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 269 Building and energy efficiency actions present another general plan opportunity for local GHG emission reduction action. Nearly 70 percent of all single family homes in California were built before the adoption of California's Building Energy Efficiency Standards . Many l ocal governments have already adopt ed energy efficiency standards for existing buildings that exceed Title 24. In addition, some local governments have adopted time -of-sale ordinances re quiring energy efficiency upgrades exceeding Title 24 upon a change of title. There are numerous other resources embedded in SEEC's tools and located on www.coolcali fornia.org that can help local governments calculate emissions, understand impacts to the community and plan to reduce emissions and risk associated with a changing climate. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 270 CHAPTER 9: Preparing, Integrating, and Implementing the General Plan Introdu ction All statutory references are to the California Governm ent Code unless otherwise noted The implementation of a general plan is particular ly important to consider even before the general plan update process is started. Determining how goals, policies and actions may work in practice can help define how best to approach the ge neral plan update and content. Additionally, with the proliferation of regional planning initiatives, grant programs promoting particular policies , and focused and related companio n documents such as climate action plans, the general plan serves the function of integrating and synthesizing the various interrelated documents and programs that make a community function effectively. A general plan is ineffective if it is not well implemented. General implementation relies on specific plans, zoning ordinance s, subdivision ordinances, and public project consistency requirements , among other mechanisms . State law requires cities and counties to have subdivision regulations, and building r egulations , and open -space zoning, while m any of the other measures described in this chapter are adopted at the discretion of the city or county. If the objectives, policies, and proposals of the general plan are to be implemented effectively, implementin g measures must be carefully chosen, reflective of local needs, and carried out as an integrated program of complementary and mutually reinforcing actions. It is important t o remember that implementation measures identified in the general plan (and the m itigation m easures identified in its EIR) must be fiscally constrained and feasible to implement in order to be vertically consistent and legally defensible. Cities and counties are advised to collaborate proactively with their regional public and private se ctor partners in order to develop and adopt multi -party fair share impact fee programs needed to finance planned infrastructure improvements. Transportation components of the improvements should base such impact fee programs on multi -modal system improveme nts with a demonstrated ability to reduce the VMT generated by new development. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 271 ZONING Zoning is one of the primary means of implementing a general plan. In contrast to the long - term outlook of the general plan, zoning classifies the specific, immediate uses of land. The success of a general plan, and in particular the land use element, rests in part upon the effectiveness of a consistent zoning ordinance in translating the long -term objectives and policies contained in the plan into everyday decisions. The typical zoning ordinance regulates land use by dividing the community into districts or \"zones\" and specifying the uses that are to be permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited within each zone. Text and map(s) describe the distribution and in tensity of land uses in such categories as residential, commercial, industrial, and open space. Trade-offs and considerations related to sustainable development, infill, and equity should be considered when designating zoning maps. Written regulations establish procedures for considering projects , standards for minimum lot size, building height and setback limits, fence heigh ts, parking, and other development parameters within each land use zone. Form based codes (FBC's) have also emerged as a resource for planning the \"feel\" of a community. FBCs are typically accomplished through overlays on a base zoning designation but can also be stand alone. More information on FBCs can be found here. In counties, general law cities, and charter cities with a population of more than two million, zoning provisions must be consistent with the general plan (\u00a765860 ). Charter cities with a population of under two million are exempt from the zoning consistency requirement unless their charters provide otherwise , however, these charter cities should see consistency between the general plan and zoning. An in-depth discussion of zoning consistency can be found later in this chapter under the heading \"Consistency in Implementation.\" Zonin g Tools The following are some common examples of zoning provisions that can be used to further general plan objectives and policies. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 272 Cluster zoning : A district that allows the clustering of structures upon a given site in the interest of preserving open space. Cluster zones typically have a low standard for gross residential density and a high minimum open -space requirement to encourage the clustering of structures. Conditional use permit (CUP) : A discretionary permit that enables a city or county to consider, on an individual basis, specific land uses that might otherwise have undesirable effects upon an area and to approve such uses when conditions can be placed on them that would avoid those effects. Design review : Required review of project design and/or architectural features for the purpose of ensuring compatibility with established s tandards. It is often used in historic districts or areas that have a distinct character worthy of protection. Design review is a means of enforcing aesthetic standards. Floating zone : A district described in the zoning ordinance but not given a specifi c location on the zoning maps until a property owner or developer applies for it. Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning is a common example of a floating zone. Floating zones can implement development standards established in the general plan. Floodp lain zone : A district that restricts development within delineated floodplains in order to avoid placing people and structures in harm's way and obstructing flood flows. The zone may allow for agricul tural, open -space or similar low -intensity uses. Hillside development ordinance : Provisions regulating development on steep slopes, often by establishing a direct relationship between the degree of slope and minimum lot size. This can implement specific policies and standards that may be found in the land use, open -space, and safety elements. Mixed -use zoning : An ordinance provision that authorizes several land uses to be combined in a single structure , area or project. It is being widely used in a variety of communities from urban to rural in nature. It is often used for office/commer cial/high - density residential projects, such as San Francisco's Embarcadero Center, and increasingly for urban projects that com bine ground floor retail/commerc ial with residential units above. Open-space zoning : Government Code Section 65910 specifically requires the adoption of open -space zoning to implement the open -space element. Sim ilarly, the Timberland Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 273 Productivity Act ( \u00a751100 , et seq.) requires local governments with qualifying timberlands to adopt Timberland Productivity Z oning (TPZ) for qualifying timberlands. Overlay zone : Additional regulations superimposed upon existing zoning in specified areas. Subsequent development must comply with the requirements of both the overlay zone and the base district. Historic districts, airport height restrictions, and flood plain regulations are commonly established by overlay zones. Planned unit development (PUD) zoning : A type of floating zone designed to provide flexibility in project design and standar ds. It is usually characterized by comprehensive site planning, clustering of structures, and a mixture of land uses. A PUD can implement specific density, open -space, community design, and hazard mitigation standards contained in the general plan. Specific plan zone : A district that mandates the preparation of a specific plan prior to development. The specific plan establishes zoning regulations tailored to that site, consistent with the general plan. Transfer of development rights (TDR) : A device by which the development potential of a site is severed from its title and made available for transfer to another location. The owner of a site within a transfer are a retains proper ty ownership but not approval to develop. The owner of a site within a receiving a rea may purchase transferable development credits, allowing a receptor site to be developed at a greater density. The California Coastal C ommission has used this technique to \"retire\" antiquated subdivision lots in environmentally sensitive areas. Tree preservation ordinance : Regulations that limit the removal of specified types of trees and require replacement of trees that are removed. Zoning -Related Statutes Although loc al governments have broad discretion in zoning matters, there are a number of state-mandated zoning requirements that directly relate to the general plan. The following summarizes most of the req uirements that apply to general law cities, charter cities wi th a population above two million, and counties: Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 274 Surplus school sites : School districts may request the rezoning of certain surplus school sites (\u00a765852.9 ). The city or county must then zo ne the site consistently with the general plan. The local government may not rezone surplus school sites to open -space, recreational, or park uses unless surrounding lands are similarly zoned or the school district agrees to the rezoning. Prezoning : Government Code Section 65859 allows a city to prezone adjacent unincorporated territory. The prezoning action is subje ct to the requirements applic able to zoning in the city, including the requirement for consistency with the general plan. Prezoning has no regulatory effect until the property is annexed to the city. Local agency formation commission (LAFCO) law requires prezoning as part of the annex ation process. Interim ordinance : Cities and counties may enact interim ordinances prohibiting uses that may conflict with a contemplated general plan, specific plan, or zoning proposal (\u00a765858 ). Interim zoning may be imposed for an initial period of 45 days and extended for up to two years. It can be used effectively when the general plan is being revised or when major rezonings are being under taken in order to ac hieve general plan consistency. Local governments should exercise caution when imposing land use controls or moratoriums, even if they are only temporary. Excessive restrictions may constitute a regulatory taking entitling affected land owners to just compensation and may be considered a constraint, warranting revision to the housing element . City and county officials should consult with their legal counsel to determine what degree of development control is reasonable. Regional housing needs : Local governments must consider the effects of proposed ordinances on regional housing needs and balance them against the availability of public services, fiscal resources, and environmentally suitabl e sites. A zoning ordinance limiting the number of new housing units must contain findings regarding the public health, safety, and welfare that justify reducing regional housing opportunities (\u00a765863.6 ). Pursuant to \u00a765913.1 , the local government must zone a sufficient amount of vacant l and for residential use to maintain a balance with land zoned for nonresidential use and to meet the community's housing needs as projected in the housing element. In addition, \u00a765863 restricts the ability of a city or county to reduce, through administrative, quasi - judicial, or legislative action, the residential density of any parcel to a density lower than Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 275 that used by the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) in determining compliance with housing element law. Housing development projects: Government Code Section 65589. 5 restricts cities and counties from disapproving housing development project affordable to very low -, low- or moderate -income households except under certain circumstances. These circumstances include inconsistency with the general plan, specific unavoid able impacts on the public health and safety, and overconcentration of low -income households, among others. This code section further restricts the ability of cities and counties to disapprove or lower the density of a housing development project that is c onsistent with general plan and zoning standards unless there is an impact on the public health and safety that cannot otherwise be mitigated. Density bonus : Local governments must provide incentives to developers of specified housing developments. A density bonus and at least one other regulatory incentive must be provided when a develo per pledges to set aside specific percentages of the total amount of housing for low - or very low -income residents, seniors, or \u2014for condominium projec ts only \u2014moderate -income residents (\u00a765915 ). In return, the developer must reserve these units for this purpose for a certain number of years. Incentives may include a reduction in site development standards or approval of mixed -use zoning. A density bonus must exceed the maximum allowable general plan or zoning density by at least 25 percent. Second units : Local governments may, by ordinance, provi de for the creation of second residential units in single family and multifamily zoning districts (\u00a765852.2 ). The ordinance may designate areas where second units are permitted, based on specified criteria, as well as impose certain zoning and design conditions. Second unit applications must be considered ministerially without discretionary review. A local government cannot adopt an ordinance tota lly precluding second units unless it makes certain findings. In the absence of any local ordinance, state law provides for the approval of second units that meet the required standards. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 276 SPECIFIC PLANS A specific plan is a great tool for systematically i mplementing the general plan within all or a portion of the planning area ( \u00a765450 , et seq.). Any interested party may request the adoption, amendme nt, or repeal of a specific plan. A plan may be prepared by either the public or private sector, however, responsibility for its adoption, amendment, and repeal lies with the city council or county board of supervisors. As a legislative act, a specific pla n can also be adopted by voter initiative and is subject to referendum. At a minimum, a specific plan must include a statement of its relationship to the general plan (\u00a765451(b) ) and text and diagram(s) specifying all of the following in detail: The distribution, location, and extent of the uses of land, including open space, within the area covered by the plan. The proposed distribution, locati on, extent, and intensity of major components of public and private transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid waste dis posal, energy, and other essential facilities proposed to be located within the area covered by the plan and needed to support the l and uses described in the plan. Standards and criteria by which development will proceed and standards for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources, where applicable. A program of implementation measures, including regulations, programs, public works projec ts, and financing measures necessary to carry out the provisions of the preceding three paragraphs (\u00a765451(a) ). Any other subjects that, in the j udgment of the planning agency, are necessary or desirable for general plan implementation (\u00a765452 ). A specific plan is especially useful for large projects, as well as for sites with environmental and fiscal constraints. A specific plan may be adopted by resolution (like a general plan) or ordinance (like a zoning ordinance). Some jurisdictions have chosen to adopt the policy portions of their speci fic plans by resolution and the regulatory portions by ordinance. This enables a city or county to assemble, in one package, a set of land use specifications and implementation programs tailored to the unique characteristics of a particular site. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 277 A regulat ory specific plan often has advantages over zoning. A community's control of development phasing provides a good example. The regulatory effects of zoning are immediate, while the provisions of a general plan are long term. If a general plan's implementati on is limited to zoning, phasing a long -term development so that it meets the general plan's object ives can be difficult. The one -time adoption of a specific plan that stipulates development timing or schedules infrastructure installation can solve the pro blem. Statutory provisions allow streamlined permitting once a specific plan is in place. For example, residential development projects are exempt from CEQA if they implement and are consistent with a specific plan for which an EIR or supplemental EIR has been prepared (\u00a765457 ). A specific plan can reduce development costs. For example, the specific plan's land use specifications, in combination wi th its capital improvements program, can eliminate uncertainties as to future utility capacities and help avoid costly oversizing. A specific plan must be consistent with the jurisdiction's general plan ( \u00a765454 ). In turn, zoning ordinances, subdivisions (including tentative tract and parcel maps), public works projects, development agreements, and land projects (as defined in Business and Professions Code \u00a711004.5 ) must be consistent with any a special district, school district, or joint powers authority may not carry out its capital improvements program , which can include school district bond plans, master plans , and other documents (prepared pursuant to \u00a765403 ) if the affected city or county finds the program or any part inconsistent with a specific pl an. The district or local agency may carry out an inconsistent project only if it explicitly overrules the city's or county's finding ( \u00a765403(c) ). A specific plan is prepared, adopted, and amended in the same manner as a general plan, except that it may be adopted by resolution or ordinance and it may be amended as often as the local legislature deems necessary ( \u00a765453(a) ). A specific plan is repealed in the same manner as it is amended ( \u00a765453(b) ). To defray the cost of specific plan preparation, a city or county may impose a fee upon persons whose projects must be consistent with the plan. The fee must be prorated according to the benefit a person receives from the specific plan (\u00a765456 ). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 278 For more information about specific plans, see OPR's publication The Planner's Guide to Specific Plans. SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS Land cannot be subdivided for sale, lease, or financing in California without local government approval. The Subdivision Map Act (\u00a766410 , et seq.) establishes statewide uniformity in local subdivision procedures while giving cities and counties the authority to regulate the design and improvement of subdivisions, require dedications of public improvemen ts or related impact fees, and require compliance with the objectives an d policies of the general plan. This includes the authority to approve and design street alignments, street grades and widths, drainage and sanitary facilities, lot si ze and configurat ion, traffic access, and other measures \"as may be necessary or convenient to insure c onsistency with, or implementation of, the general plan or any applicable specific plan\" (\u00a766418 and \u00a766419 ). These regulatory powers can promote the usual array of land use, circulation, open -space, and safety element objectives, policies, and plan proposals. Good subdivision design can encourage pedestrian acces s, residential street calming, urban forestry, tree preservation, floodplain management, wildland fire safety, and other principles or policies that may be articulated in the general plan. Subdivisions provide infrastructure that will serve the new lots be ing created. Local governments can require dedications of public improvements or the payment of in -lieu fees for: Streets, alleys, drainage, public utility easements, and public easements. (\u00a766475 Local transit facilities, such as bus turnouts, benches, shelters, and landing pads. (\u00a766475.2 ) Bicycle paths. ( \u00a766475.1 ) Parks and recreational facilities, if the city's gen eral plan or specific plan contains policies and standards for such facilities. ( Quimby Act, \u00a766477 ) School sites (this is actually a reservation with a right to purchase at a later date). (\u00a766478 ) Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 279 Access to waterways, rivers, and streams. ( \u00a766478.11 ) Access to coastline or shoreline. ( \u00a766478.11 Access to public lakes and reservoirs. Drainage and sanitary sewer and major thoroughfares. ( \u00a766484 ) No tentative subdivision map or parcel map can be approved unless the city or county finds that the subdivision, together with design and improvement provisions, is consistent with all aspects of the general plan or any applicable specific plan \u00a766473.5, \u00a766474, and \u00a766474.61 )Lot line adjustments must also be consistent with the general plan (\u00a766412 ). The local government must deny a proposed subdivision if it finds that the proposed subdivision map is inconsistent with the general plan or any applicable specific plan; the design or improvem ent of the subdivision is inconsistent with the general plan or any applicable specific plan; the site is physically ill -suited for either the type or proposed density of development; or the subdivision's design or types of improvements are likely to cause substantial environmental damage, substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat, or cause public health problems. Cities and counties must make written findings of fact supported by substantial evidence for each of these matters whe n deciding upon a subdivision. The special rules applicable to vesting tentative maps are worth noting, as detailed in \u00a766498.1 , et seq. When subdividers receive city or county approval of a vesting tentative map, they also obtain a limited right to develop the subdivision in substantial compliance with those ordinances, policies, and standards ( \u00a766498.1(b) ) in effect at the time the application was deemed complete ( Kaufman and Broad v. City of Modes to (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1577 ). If, however, a local agency has initiated formal proceedings to amend applicable plans or regulations prior to the application being deemed complete, the amendments, if adopted, will apply to the vesting map. The local agen cy may condition or deny building permits for parcels created under a vesting tentative map if the agency determines that a failure to do so would threaten community health or safety or the condition or denial is required by state or federal law. The vesti ng tentative map law applies to all subdivisions, including commercial and industrial tracts Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 280 CAPITAL FACILITIES Capital facilities must be consistent with the general plan (Friends of B Street v. City of Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988 ). The network of publicly owned facilities, such as streets, water and sewer facilities, public buildings, and parks, forms the framework of a community. Although capital facilities are built to acc ommodate present and anticipated needs, some (most notably water and sewer facilities and roads) play a major role in determining the location, intensity, and timing of development. For instance, the availability of sewer and water connections can have a p rofound impact upon the feasibility of preserving agricultural or open -space lands. The general plan should identify existing capital facilities and the need for additional improvements. The circulation element is the most obvious place to addres s infrastructure issues, but it is not the only element where capital improvements come into play. For example: The housing element must identify adequate sites for various housing types based in part on public services and facilities. Water and sewer providers are required to adopt a procedure to grant priority to development with units affordable to lower income households. The safety element must \"address eva cuation routes, peakload water supply requirements, and minimum road widths...as those items relate to fire and geologic hazards\" ( \u00a765302(g) ). The land use element must include education -related land uses such as school sites , open-space for recreation, public buildings and grounds (the placement of public buildings may play an important role in urban design), and solid and liquid waste disposal facilities. The open-space element may consider \"open -space for outdoor recreation...areas particularly suited for park and recreation purposes\" ( \u00a765560(b)(3) ). It may also address open-space areas for protecting water quality and for water reservoirs. The conservation element can address flo od control measures and is required to be developed in coordination with any countywide water agency and with all district and city agencies that have \"developed, served, controlled or conserved water for any purpose for the county or city for which the pl an is prepared\" ( \u00a765302(b) ). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 281 Local governments can underscore their interest in public services and facilities by adopting an opti onal public fa cilities element. Each year, the local planning agency is required to \"review the capital improvement program of the city or county and the local public works projects of other local agencies for consistency with their general plan\" ( \u00a765103(c) ). To fulfill this requirement, all departments within the city or county and all other local governmental agencies (including cities, counties, school dist ricts, and special districts) that construct capital facilities must submit a list of proposed projects to the planning agency ( \u00a765401 ). In lieu o f considering individual projects or only those projects to be undertaken in a single year, many cities and counties prepare and annually revise a 5 - to 7-year capital improvement program (CIP). The CIP projects annual expenditures for acquisition, constru ction, maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement of public buildings and facilities, including sewer, water, and street improvements; street lights; traffic signals; parks; and police and fire facilities. In rapidly developing areas, a CIP coordinated w ith a general plan can help shape and time growth according to adopted policies. In an older city with a declining tax base and deteriorating capital facilities, a CIP can help stimulate private investment or stabilize and rehabilitate older neighborhoods by demonstrating a public commitment to the provision of key public facilities on a predetermined schedule. Many federal grant programs, including those under the Clean Air Act and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP -21) require or p romote consistency between federally assisted capital projects and local, regional, and state plans. For example, the Clean Air Act requires that the population projections used in planning capital facilities conform to the assumptions contained in the reg ional air quality management plan adopted as part of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) when federal funding or approval is sought. The federal government gives priority to implementing those programs that conform to the SIP and will not fund those that d o not. Capital improvements also have regional implications. The growing interrelatedness of planning issues among local governments applies directly to local capital improvement projects. The location of major roads, sewer facilities, water trunk lines, a nd emergency service buildings within the city or county can affect surrounding communities by encouraging or deflecting the direction of growth. Although the LAFCO exists to encourage Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 282 the orderly provision of services within cities and special districts, it is seldom an effective substitute for every city and the county consulting and cooperating with its neighbors. DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS A development agreement is a contractual agreement between a city or county and a developer that identifies vested ri ghts that apply to a specific development project. By its nature, it offers opportunities for a city or county to assure that general plan objectives, policies, and plan proposals will be implemented as development occurs within an area. A development agr eement provides that, for a specified time period, the rules, regulations, and policies that are applicable to a particular development will not change. This gives developers who have otherwise yet to attain a vested right to develop a degree of assurance that their project preparations will not be nullified by some future local policy or regulation change (e.g., the rezoning of a commercial project site to residential), with limited exceptions. In exchange for the privilege of a regulation \"freeze,\" the ci ty or county usually will obtain certain concessions from the developer. For example, the developer might provide extra affordable housing, open space, or public facilities. Development agreements must specify the duration of the agreement, the permitted uses of property, the density or intensity of use, the maximum height and size of proposed buildings, and the provisions for reservation or dedication of land for public purposes (\u00a765865.2 ). In addition, development agreements may include the conditions, terms, restrictions, and requirements for subsequent discretionary actions; provide that such stipulations shall not prevent development of the la nd with regard to the uses, densities, and intensities set forth in the agreement; specify the timing of project construction or completion; and set forth the terms and conditions relating to applicant financing of necessary public facilities and subsequen t reimbursement over time. One advantage of development agreements is that the developer may be asked to obligate the project to improvements that exceed the usual legal limits on exactions. The limits do not apply when the developer has voluntarily entere d into a contract with the city or county. A disadvantage of development agreements is that a city or county may be unable to Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 283 respond to a changing market or apply new regulations to a project that is controlled by a long-term development agreement. A city can enter into a development agreement covering unincorporated territory that is within its sphere of influence. This allows for planning in advance of an annexation. Such an agreement is not operative unless annexation proceedings are completed within th e period of time specified by the agreement ( \u00a765865 ). If territory covered by a county development agreement becomes part of a newly incorporated city or is annexed to a city, the agreement is valid for its original duration or eight years from the date of incorporation, whichever is earlier. It is important to stipulate the existing rules, regulations, and policies that will be subject to a devel opment agreement. In the absence of such specification, all development rules, regulations, and official policies noted in \u00a765866 that are in for ce upon the execution of a development agreement will be frozen. This could result in unanticipated consequences for both a developer and a city or county. A detailed specific plan prepared and adopted prior to a development agreement is one way to specify development details for a site, including the regulations and policies that would apply under the development agreement. Specific plan preparation can also facilitate further citizen participation in planning a development. BUILDING AND HOUSING CODES The enforcement of state building standards and housing codes are delegated by State Housing Law to the local building department. Codes and standards are intended to encourage uniformity and establish minimum standards to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public and occupants of residential buildings statewide. Local land use, housing element s, and additional health or safety elements are established by local ordinances. Building and housing codes have their greatest effect on new cons truction and rehabilitation, but certain parts of the codes apply to the use, maintenance, change in occupancy, and public health and safety hazards of existing buildings. State housing law ( Health and Safety Code \u00a717910 , et seq.) requires cities and counties to enforce state building standards and other regulations adopted by the Department of Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 284 Housing and Community Development. Local ordinances ma y modify state building standards to impose substantially the same requirements as those contained in the various industry codes: the Uniform Housing Code, the International Building Code, The International Residential Code, The International Existing Bui lding Code, the Uniform Plumbing Code, the National Electrical Code, and the Uniform Mechanical Code. Local government may amend state building standards that are reasonably necessary based upon local climatic, geological, or topographical conditions.. Th e State housing law applies to buildings such as apartments, hotels, motels, lodging houses, manufactured housing, and dwellings but not to mobilehomes. In addition to meetin g the requirements of state housing law, local codes must also comply with other s tate requirements related fire safety, noise insulation, soils reports, earthquake protection, energy insulation, and access for the disabled. State law allows a city or county, when adopting the California Building Standards Code, to make such changes \"as it determines ... are reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions\" ( Health and Safety Code \u00a717958.5 ). Further, the local building department can authorize the use of materials and construction methods other than those specified in the California Building Standards Code where the department finds the proposed design satisfactory and the materials or metho ds at least equivalent to those prescribed by the California Building Standards Code with regard to performance, safety, and the protection of life and health ( Health and Safety Code \u00a717951 ). These provisions can be used to promote the construction of affordable housing and the rehabilitation of substandard housing. Other provisions are particularly useful where a community intends to encourage historic preservation. Health and Safety Code \u00a717958.8 allows the use of original materials and construction methods in existing buildings. Health and Safety Code \u00a717980(c)(2) requires local enforcement agencies to consider needs expressed in the housing element when deciding whether to re quire abandonment or repair of a substandard dwelling. In the reconstruction of existing buildings that would be hazardous in the event of an earthquake, the law allows cities and counties to use building standards that provide for the protection of the oc cupants but that are less rigorous in other respects than current building standards (Health and Safety Code \u00a719160, et seq .). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 285 Code enforcement and abatement procedures are another means of implementing the general plan, particularly the housing and safety elements. Various state laws and regulations spell out abatement procedures that local government may enforce upon buildings that, because they ar e substandard or unsafe, constitute a public nuisance. The most common procedures involve citation and misdemeanor action on the part of the city or county to mandate abatement by repair, abandonment, or demolition. ACQUISITION City and county acquisiti on of real property rights can help to implement the plan proposals of the land use, circulation and open -space elements. In implementing the land use element, cities and counties may acquire land designated for government offices, police and fire stations , parks, access easements, etc., or for public purposes such as urban redevelopment. With regard to the circulation element, local governments may acquire land for public rights -of-way (e.g., streets, sidewalks, bicycle paths, etc.), transit terminals, air ports, etc. Cities and counties may advance open -space element policies and proposals through the acquisition of open -space and conservation easements. Open-space acquisition has some advantages over purely regulatory approaches to implementation, such as zoning. Ownership ensures that the land will be controlled by either the city or county or another public agency. Ac quiring an open -space or conservation easement rather than full ownership ensures that development will be limit ed, while the private landowner who continues to hold the underlying rights is compensated for lost development opportunities. This avoids the question of whether regulatory limitations have unconstitutionally \"taken\" private property without just compensa tion. The primary disadvantage to acquisition is its cost. Land often is expensive, particularly when urbanization is imminent or where the supply of potentially developable land is limited. Funding sources, such as taxes and assessments, are limited in this post -Proposition 13 and post-Proposition 218 environment. A successful acquisition program often involves the resourceful blending of several funding sources. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 286 Acquisition can take various forms. An overall program can be tied to general plan consiste ncy or a capital imp rovements program. A city or county, in consultation with its legal counsel, may wish to consider the following: Fee simple absolute interests : A fee simple absolute estate in land consists of all the real property interests associat ed with the land, including the rights to se ll, lease, and develop the property. Conseq uently, fee simple absolute ownership entitles a city or county to develop or not develop the land as it chooses. Easement interests : An easement consists of a portion of the rights to real property, such as the right to travel over the property or the right to build structures. The seller retains all property rights not stipulated in the easement. Travelways , utilities and open space are some common uses of easements. Leasing : The lessee possesses and occupies leased real property for a determinable time period, although the landlord retains full ownership. A city or county may lease land from a property owner for access purposes, open -space preservation, etc. Lease-purchase agreements : Real property may be leased by a city or county and rental payments may be put toward purchasing the property. If a local jurisdiction does not have enough capital to buy the land outright, the lease -purchase method can spread payment s over time. Purchase and resale or lease : Once a city or county has purchased a parcel of land or the parcel's development rights, the jurisdiction may assist in the development of housing affordable to lower income households and preserve open space (or otherwise control land use) by selling the lan d or the development rights with deed restrictions specifying permitted land uses. A local jurisdiction may also lease property subject to a rental contract specifying permitted uses. These techniques enable the jurisdict ion to recover at least a portion of its purchasing expenses. Joint acquisition : Two or more local governments may combine their funding resources to acquire joint ownership of real property rights. Joint acquisition allows local governments to share the financial burden of purchasing land. Land swapping : Local g overnments may exchange some of their land for parcels owned by private landowners or other jurisdictions in order to obtain desirable open space, park sites, etc. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 287 Eminent domain : Eminent domain involves the compensated taking of property for a public us e or purpose, such as the acquisition of open space for a city greenbelt. This may include fee simple interest and less -than-fee interests such as easements. An owner whose property is taken is entitled to receive just compensation through the payment of fair market value for the loss (California Constitution, Article I, \u00a719). Cities and counties are authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain ( \u00a725350.5 for counties and \u00a737350.5 for cities) in accordance with eminent domain law ( Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a71230.010 to \u00a71230.020 ). PREFERENTIAL PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS Preferential assessment programs provide landowners an economic incentive to keep their land in agricultural, timber, open -space, or recreational use. This can help implement the land use, open -space, and conservation elements by protecting areas designated for such uses from premature development. State law provides local governments with several preferential ass essment programs, the most common of which are discussed below. Williamson Act The Legislature enacted the California Land Conservat ion Act (\u00a751200 , et seq.) in response to the rapid loss of agricultural land in areas of increasing land values. Typically, as development approaches an agricultural area, the price of land is driven upward by owners and buyers sp eculating on the future development pote ntial of the land. The increase in prices leads to a correspond ing increase in the assessed value of the land and to the owner's property taxes. At some point, the increased tax burden makes it uneconomical to continue farming and encourages the sale of th e land for development. The Williamson Act allows counties and cities to establish agricultural preserves and to assess agricultural and open -space land on the basis of its agricultural, rather than market, value. Owners of qualified land located in an agr icultural preserve contract with the county Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 288 or city to continue agricultural or compatible activities for a period of at least ten years. The state annually reimburses the local agency for a portion of its resultant tax losses. A Williamson Act contract au tomatically renews itself each year. Termination of the contract may be accomplished by one of three methods. The landowner or local government can file a notice of \"nonrenewal.\" The notice halts the yearly contract renewal, resulting in its expiration at the end of ten years. Alternatively, a local government may immediately cancel a contract after making certain strict findings. Such a cancellation requires the owner to pay penalty fees. A contract may be rescinded without penalty when the city or county has entered into an agreement with the landowner to simultaneously place an equal or greater amount of equally suitable agricultural land into an agricultural conservation easement (\u00a751256 ). The value of the proposed conservation easement must be at least 12.5 percent of the land subject to contract rescission and other restrictions apply. Nonrenewal is intended to be the normal route for ending a Williamson Act contract. Cancellation is meant to be reserved for special circumstances ( Lewis v. City of Hayward (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 103 ) and rescission is intended to prov ide more flexibility. Williamson Act contracts are voluntary, which is both their greatest strength and weakness. On the positive side, voluntary contracts lessen the potential for litigation over the uncompensated taking of land that is sometimes alleged when land uses are restricted. Also, because the owner is directly involved in entering the program, responsibility is imparted to the landowner for ensuring that the program works. On the other hand, the potential profits anticipated from future developme nt on the urban fringe may outweigh the tax advantages of the contract. Thus, in the very areas where it could be most effective in preventing the premature conversion of farmland, there are strong economic incentives not to join the program. In 1998, in r esponse to the perceived weaknesses of the Williamson Act program, the Legislature added additional nonregulatory protection in the form of farmland security zones for specific classifications of farmland, including prime farmland, farmland of statewide im portance, unique farmland, and farmland of local importance. Land can be entered into a farmland security zone contract for a 20 -year term rather than the 10 -year term of Williamson Act contracts. During this time, the land is assessed at 65 percent of either its Williamson Act valuation or its Proposition 13 valuation, whichever is lower, rather Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 289 than on the actual use of the land for agricultural purposes as is required under the Williamson Act. Cities and special districts that provide non -agricultural se rvices are generally prohibited from annexing land enrolled under a farmland security zone contract, with certain exceptions. Additionally, contracted land cannot be used for school facility purposes or acquired by school districts. Farmland Security Zone statute ( \u00a7 51296.5 and \u00a7 51296.6 ) prohibit a school district rendering inapplicable (\"overriding\") a local zoning ordinance or even acquiring lan d in a FSZ. Farmland security zone contracts also provide that any voter -approved special taxes levied after January 1, 1999, for urban -related services be levied upon the contracted land or the trees, vines, or crops on the land at a reduced rate, unless the urban service directly benefits the land or living improvements. For more information on the Williamson Act and farmland security zone contracts, contact the Department of Conservation 's Divis ion of Land Resource Protection. Timberland Productivity Act The Timberland Productivity Act of 1982 requires all counties and cities with productive private timberland to establish timberland production zones (TPZs) to discourage the premature co nversion of timberland to o ther uses (\u00a751100 , et seq.). The land use element must reflect the distribution of existing TPZs and have a land use cat egory that provides for timber production. A city or county also may use TPZs to implement the conservation element's timber resource provisions. Patterned after the Williamson Act, TPZs are rolling 10 -year contracts that provide preferential tax assessmen ts to qualified timberlands. Under this program, assessments on timber are based on the value of the timber at the time of harvest rather than on the market value of standing timber. Assessment of zoned timberland is based on a statutory value of land that is related to site capability and is annually indexed to changes in the periodic immediate harvest value. During the first two years of the Act, local governments could adopt TPZs on qualified parcels without approval of the property owner, provided that statutory procedures were followed. Currently, additions to local programs are limited to requests from property owners. Subject to approval by the local legislative body, land may be removed from a TPZ by rezoning. The effective date of the new zone gener ally must be deferred until expiration Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 290 of the 10 -year restriction. However, the local legislative body may, under special circumstances, approve immediate rezonings. The Tim berland Productivity Act did not rely on voluntary inclusion during its beginning stages. This was adv antageous because restrictions could be applied in a more comprehensive manner than Williamson Act contracts and could provide coherent preserves of timberland. The primary disadvantage is that there is greater potent ial for conflict bet ween property owners and local governments over the designation of lands. Conservation, Open -Space, and Scenic Easements State law provides several means of conserving open space through easements. Easements are attractive beca use they are less expensive than full -fee rights, can be more effective than zoning, do not displace property owners, and may yield property or inheritance tax advantages to the grantor. Recording the easement in the office of the County Recorder places fu ture owners on notice of the easement's provisions. The Conservation Easement Act Civil Code \u00a7815 -\u00a7816) enables a local government or a non - profit orga nization to acquire perpetual easements for the conservation of agricultural and open-space lands and for historic preservation. Granting of a conservation e asement may qualify as a charitable contribution for tax purposes. The easement may also qualify as an enforceable restriction for purposes of preferential assessment. The Open -Space Easement Act of 1974 (\u00a751070 -\u00a751097 ) authorizes local governments to accept easements granted to them or to non -profit organizations for the purpose of conserving agricultural and open -space lands. These easements are established for a 10 -year period and renew annually. They must be consistent with the general plan and are considered enforceable restrictions of land under a preferential taxation program. The local government is prohibited from granting building permits for land subject to such easements. Procedures for termination by nonrenewal and by ab andonment are set out in statute. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 291 The Agricultural Land Stewardship Program (ALSP) Act of 1995 (Public Resources Code \u00a710200 -\u00a710277 ) authorizes the Department of Conservation to pro vide grants to local governments and qualified non -profit land trusts to assist in the voluntary acquisition of agricultural conservation easements. In order to be eligible for consideration, the ALSP requires that a parcel be large enough and be located i n an area that is conducive to sustained commercial agricultural production. In addition, the local government within whose jurisdiction the parcel is located must support the easement acquisition and have a general plan that demonstrates a long -term commi tment to agricultural land conservation. Finally, there must be evidence that without protection, the parcel is likely to be converted to a nonagricultural use in the foreseeable future. There are other noteworthy open -space provisions in the Government Co de. The Scenic Easement Deed Act (\u00a76950 -\u00a76954 ) authorizes a local government to purchase fee rights or scenic easements but does not promote a specif ic mechanism for obtaining them. Government Code \u00a765870 through \u00a765875 enable local governments to adopt an ordinance for the purpose of establishi ng open -space covenants with property owners. These are deed restrictions regulating land uses. LAND TRUSTS A land trust is a private non -profit organization established for the purpose of preserving or conserving natural resource and agricultural lands t hrough acquisition. A city or county may establish cooperative policies with a local land trust or one of the national trusts, such as the Nature Conservancy, the Trust for Public Land, or the American Farmland Trust, to promote the objectives and policies of the land use, open -space, conservation, and safety elements of its general plan. Land trusts, whether local, statewide, or national, are often funded through membership dues and donations from individuals, businesses, and foundations. Working in coope ration with landowners and governmental agencies but outside of the structure of government, a land trust can quickly, flexibly, and confidentially obtain land or development rights that would otherwise enter the open market. In many cases, particularly wh ere natural lands are Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 292 being preserved, after obtaining the land or development rights the trust transfers its rights to a governmental agency at below -market rate for the agency to manage. TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MANAGEMENT Transportation system management (TSM) is a means of improving the efficiency of the existing transportation system through more effective utilization of facilities and selective reduction of user demand. TSM strategies, either individually or as a package of supportive programs, attempt to reduce existing traffic congestion and vehicle miles traveled and increase the person -carrying capacity of the transportation system. Other benefits of TSM include improved air quality, conservation of energy resources, reduction of new transportation and parking facility needs, and prolonged life of existing transportation facilities. Generally, TSM strategies cost less than traditional capacity -increasing capital projects. To achieve the highest degree of success, transportation and planning agencies , transit providers, developers, and employers should all coordinate in the planning and implementation of TSM. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 293 TSM policies can be used to help correlate the land use and circulation elements by assuring that planned street and highway capacities will ad equately accommodate traffic generated by planned land uses. TSM programs that discourage single -passenger car commutes and that promote flexible hours at places of employment may improve the levels of service of area streets and highways by reducing peak -hour flows. If a jurisdicti on's conservation element includes clean air or energy conservation policies, such provisions may be implemented through TSM programs that reduce motor vehicle trips and thereby air pollution and energy use. EXAMPLES OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES Listed below are various transportation system management (TSM) techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of circulation o n highway and transit systems by improving flow, reducing congestion, and increasing the carrying capacity of existing facilities. Caltrans has divided these techniques into seven categories, each containing particular measures that may be applied to speci fic TSM cases. Programs to Imp rove Traffic Flow - Signalization - Traffic signal synchronization - One-way streets - Changeable message signs - Computerized traffic systems - Integrated single -system traffic operations systems - Reversible lanes - Ramp meters - Intersection widening Provision for Pedestrians, Bicycles, and the Disabled - Bicycle lanes/paths - Bicycle storage - Pedestrian and/or transit malls - Pedestrian signals - Bicycle -actuated signals - Bicycle/transit integration - Weather - and theft -resistant bicycle parking facil ities at places of employment, shopping areas, etc. - Shower and locker facilities at places of employment for bicycling employees - Universal access improvements Actions to Reduce Motor Vehicle Use - Carpool/vanpool matching program - Carpool public info rmation - Carpool/vanpool incentives - Neighborhood ridesharing - Highway surveillance - Subsidized rideshare vehicles - Guaranteed ride home for carpoolers, transit riders, etc. - Transportation management associations - Inter-city urban commuter rail Preferential Treatment for Transit and Other High - Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Strategies - Exclusive highway bus or bus/carpool lanes - Contra -flow HOV lanes - Reserved lanes or dedicated streets for buses and HOVs - Bus turnouts - Bus-actuated signals - Ramp m eter bypass lanes for HOVs Changes in Work Schedules, Fares, and Tolls - Work hour management (compressed work week, flexible work hours) - Transit/HOV bypass at toll plazas - Bus fare restructuring/subsidies - Telecommuting Improved Public Transit - Feede r services improvements - Demand responsive system - Shelters and other passenger amenities - Rehabilitated/expanded bus fleet - Passenger information system improvements - Transit marketing Management/Control of Parking - On-street parking controls - Increase d parking fees - Park-and-ride facilities - Preferential parking for carpools/vanpools - Residential permit parking - Removal of on -street parking - Strict enforcement of on -street parking codes - Graduated parking fees with higher fees for single -occupant vehicles - Metered on -street parking Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 294 INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDI NG MECHANISMS The timing, type, and quality of development is often directly related to the availability of infrastructure and public services. The principal funding sources for local government infrastructure are taxes, benefit asse ssments, bonds, and ex actions (including impact fees). The following discussion briefly describes each of these. It is important t o remember that implementation m easures identified in the Ge neral Plan (and the mitigation m easures identified in its EIR) must be fiscally constra ined and feasible to implement in order to be vertically consistent and legally defensible. Cities and counties are advised to collaborate proactively with their regional public and private sector partners in order to develop and adopt multi -party fair sha re impact fee programs needed to finance planned transportation infrastructure improvements. In light of the legislati ve trends outlined in Appendix C , cities and counties are advised to base such impact fee programs on multi -modal system improvements with a demonstrated ability to reduce the VMT generated by new development. Taxes Taxes are either general or special. A general tax, such as the ad valorem property tax (which is capped at one percent of assessed valuation by Proposition 13), a utility tax, o r a hotel tax, is collected and placed in the city's or county's general fund. General taxes are not dedicated to any specific purpose and are usually imposed to pay for capital improvements or services that will used by the entire community. A special tax is a non -ad valorem tax that is either levied by a city or county and dedicated to a particular use or levied by a special district (e.g., a school district a transit district, etc.) to finance its activities. Special taxes often finance specific projects or services, such as flood control or ambulance service. The Mello -Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 authorizes a special tax that is primarily intended and commonly used to finance the infrastructure needs of new development. Under the Mello -Roos Act , cities, counti es, and special districts create \"community facilities Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 295 districts\" and levy special taxes within those districts to finance new public improvements, police and fire protection, and school construction (\u00a753311, et seq .). The Mello -Roos Act also authorizes the issuance of bonds. The Property Assessed Clean Energy Program (PACE), is a partnership with the federal government to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements in multifamily housing throughout the sta te. For more information on PACE, see here. Proposition 218, approved by voters in November 1996, requires a popular election in order to levy a local general tax (with a simple majority needed for approval) or a special tax (with a two -thirds majority needed for approval). It also requires a simple majority election in order to levy certain service fees, although generally not development impact fees. The effect of Proposition 218 on local financing has been p rofound. Prior to its passage, an election usually was not required in order to impose or increase taxes, so a jurisdiction could more easily raise needed revenue. Benefit Assessments Benefit assessments (also known as special assessments) are among the o ldest techniques for financing the construction and maintenance of such physical improvements as sidewalks, sewers, streets, storm drains, lighting, and flood control that benefit distinct areas. Most of the numerous assessment acts authorize the use of bo nds, paid for by an assessment. Unlike general taxes, benefit assessments are not subject to a two -thirds vote requirement. Instead, as a result of Proposition 218 of 1996, a proposed assessment is subject to a ballot procedure that enables property owner s to reject the proposal by majority protest among those returning ballots. Property owners' ballots are weighted: those who would pay a larger assessment have a greater vote. A benefit assessment cannot be levied on a parcel that does not receive a direc t benefit from the improvement or service being financed. The amount assessed to a parcel is strictly limited to the pro -rata share of benefit being received. The improvement must provide a special benefit to each assessed parcel, above and beyond any gene ral benefit that might accrue. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 296 Proposition 218 created important limitations on the use of benefit assessments. Prior to levying any such assessment, OPR recommends reviewing Proposition 218 and any implementing statutes. For more information, see the fol lowing sources: Proposition 218 Implementation Guide (League of California Cities, 1997), Understanding Proposition 218 (Office of the Legislative Analyst, 1996), and A Planner's Guide to Financing Public Improvements (OPR, 1997). Bonds Cities, counties, school districts, and other districts may issue general obligation (G.O.) bonds for the acquisition or improvement of real property, such as buildings, streets, sewers, water systems, and other infrastructure, upon approval by two -thirds of the voters cast ing ballots. G.O. bonds are secured by local governments' ability to levy property taxes but may also be repaid from other revenue sources as available. School district (K -12) and community college district bonds may be passed by a 55% vote rather than a t wo-thirds vote pursuant to Proposition 39 of 2000. Revenue bonds are secured by the future revenues of the facility or enterprise they are financing. Stadiums, wastewater treatment facilities, and parking facilities are three examples of the types of reve nue-producing facilities that are commonly financed by revenue bonds. The Revenue Bond Law of 1941 (\u00a754300, et seq.) provides for a source of funds for the construction of hospitals, water facilities, sewer plants, parking facilities, bridges, auditoriums, and other such public facilities. Because revenue bonds are secured by the proceeds from the enterprise they fund, they generally carry higher interest rates than general obligation bonds. Lease revenue bonds are a similar tool. Instead of being issued by the city or county, lease revenue bonds are issued by a non -profit corporation or a special authority that constructs a facility and leases it to the city or county. Lease payments provide the revenue to pay off the bond. When the bond is retired, the fac ility is turned over to the city or county. Some local agencies have used this method to finance administrative centers and schools . Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 297 Exactions Exactions are dedications of land, improvements, or impact fees imposed on new development to fund the constr uction of capital facilities. They cannot be used for operations and maintenance. The authority to impose exactions on development derives from the police power and statute. An exaction is levied to finance a specific activity, facility, or service and can only be levied once, at the time of project approval. Exactions may only be imposed where they will advance a legitimate state interest (e.g., health, safety, and welfare issues, such as smooth traffic flow, availability of recreational facilities, sewer and water service, etc.) and are necessary to mitigate the adverse impact to that interest that would otherwise result from the project Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987) 107 S.Ct. 3141 ). This principle is reflected in the Mitigation Fee Act (\u00a766000, et seq.), which lays out the groundrules for imposing development impact fees and other exactions. While the general plan may form a policy basis for exactions, keep in mind that it does not preempt constitutional limits on regulatory \"takings\" or e nable any exaction that would conflict with state law. The Nollan decision established that there must be a nexus between the exaction and the state interest being advanced. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994) 114 S.Ct. 2309, added a second step to the analysis: there must be a \"rough proportionality\" between the exaction being imposed and the relative need created by the project. Reducing Dolan to its simplest terms, the court overturned the city's requirements for bicycle path and fl oodway dedications because they were out of proportion to the impact on flooding and the contribution to bicycle traffic that would have resulted from the proposed expansion of a plumbing supply store, even though Tigard's comprehensive plan contained defi nitive policies relating to such dedications. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 298 The California Supreme Court clarified the Nollan and Dolan principles in Ehrlich v. City of Culver City (1996) 12 C4th 854 . The court made two key points: 1. Developers who wish to challenge a development fee on either statutory or constitutional grounds must do so under provisions of the Mitigation Fee Act (\u00a766020). 2. The two part Nollan/Dolan test applies only to ad hoc fees and dedications of land (as opposed to legislatively enacted fee ordinances). The \"rough proportionality\" component does not apply to legislatively enacted fees, such as Culver City's Art in Public Places (here the court also held that this ordinance, which was enacted to enhance aesthetics, was a reasonable use of the city's police pow er under Nollan ). In some jurisdictions, where development may adversely affect the availability of low - and moderate -income housing, exactions are levied upon developers to finance the construction of sufficient housing to alleviate that impact. San Fran cisco, for example, has an inclusionary housing program that mandates the construction of affordable housing or payment of in - lieu fees in accordance with a prescribed formula, which links projected employment to the number of housing units, as a condition of new downtown office development. Public Needs and Private Dollars , by William Abbott, Marian E. Moe, and Marilee Hansen (see the Bibliography) discusses the legal basis for development exactions and offers practical, California -specific advice about c alculating and imposing them. Privatization Recent years have seen a growth in the popularity of privatization --the use of private contractors or private ownership --to provide local services, such as garbage collection, fire protection, and street mainten ance. Although not strictly a financing measure, privatization is a strategy that can help stretch limited public funds. Privatization has certain advantages: local governments need not purchase and maintain specialized machinery, personnel for specialized or seasonal tasks need not be maintained on salary, and the costs to local governments of providing services may be reduced. It also has disadvantages: special skills are needed to establish and manage the contract with the private -service provider, quali ty is beyond the direct control of the local government and elected officials, and, if it is necessary to replace the contractor, residents may face a period of interrupted service. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 299 TRANSPORTATION FINANCING METHODS Caltrans' Division of Transportation P lanning has provided the following descriptions of general categories and examples of measures to generate additional funds for transportation projects: Business license taxes, which are often based upon gross receipts or number of employees, since business activity and employment concentration affect traffic congestion. San Francisco has used this method to provide funds for the operation of its municip al railway. Parking regulations, such as neighborhood parking stickers, parking meters, and daily tickets, which can bring in substantial funds in urban areas. These revenues can be used for a variety of local transportation programs. Transportation impact fees (also called traffic impac t mitigation fees, system development charges, and adequate public facilities fees) based upon the traffic projected to be generated and/or the cost estimates of public transportation fac ilities necessitated by development. In the Westchester area of Los Angeles, a one -time fee is collected for each p.m. peak -hour trip generated by new commercial and office development to cover needed areawide improvements. In Thousand Oaks, the city requi res traffic mitigation fees to pay for signals, the cost of paving adjacent arterials, and off -site improvements, all of which are made necessary by the traffic resulting from new development. To offset development impacts on the local transit system, San Francisco charges a tra nsit impact fee based on building square footage. Airspace leasing, which taps the value of public rights -of-way in urban areas. A governmental agency may capitalize on that value by leasing to the private sector unoccupied space over, under, or within the right -of-way. This has been used for a variety of purposes, including parks, parking lots, cellular communications, office buildings, restaurants, and public facilities. Public/private partnerships, development agreements, and cost -sharing, which involve developing agreem ents between the private and public sectors that split responsibilities for the cost of infrastructure provision, operation, and Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 300 maintenance. This technique tends to be more flexible and less bound by legal constrain ts than other measures. Privatization, which may reduce or eliminat e the need for public funds for transportation infrastructure if the prospect of profit exists. California's first modern toll roads were built in Orange County by private funds. Private provision of transit services is becoming more common as it is connec ted to specific developments. Individual developers and employers have designed and initiated traffic mitigation programs, such as traffic flow improvements, flexible work hours, and bicycle facilities. In addition, recent trends show groups of developers, employers, and businesses banding together in transportation management associations to address mutual traffic concerns in a specific area and developing programs such as those mentioned above. Such measures have been established in the cities of El Segun do, Pleasanton, and Berkeley (in cooperation with the University of California). CONSISTENCY IN IMPLEMENTATION The general plan is largely implemented through zoning and subdivision decisions. In 1971, the Legislature made consistency with the general pl an a determinative factor for subdivision approvals. Since then, lawmakers have continued to add consistency requirements to California's planning and land use laws. Other statutes, while not mandating consistency, require findings or a report on whether v arious local actions conform to the general plan. Consistency statutes and legal precedents are detailed below. In order for zoning and other measures to comply with consistency requirements, the general plan itself must first be complete and adequate (i.e ., it must address all locally relevant issues and be internally consistent). In 1984, the Court of Appeal ruled that a finding of consistency based on an inadequate general plan was a legal impossibility (Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1184 , based on 58 Opps. Cal.Atty.Gen 21, 24 (1975) ). More recently, the appeals court ruled that a subordinate land use approval, such as a subdivision map, can only be challenged on the basis of an internal general plan inconsistency when there is a nexus between the particular Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 301 approval and the claimed inconsistency in the general plan ( Garat v. Riverside (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 259 ). The California Attorney General has opined that \"the term 'consistent with' is used interchangeably 58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 21, 25 (1975) ). A general rule for consistency determinations can be stated as follows: \"An action, program, or project is consistent with the general plan if, con sidering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the general plan and will support their attainment.\" The city or county is responsible for determining whether an activity is consistent with the general plan. A city council's findin g of a project's consistency with the plan would be reversed by a court if, based on the evidence before the council, a reasonable person could not have reached the same conclusion ( No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 223 ). In Familie s Unafraid t o Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. El Dorado County Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332 , the court held that \"[The] nature of the policy and the nature of the inconsistency are critical factors to consider.\" A project is clearly inconsistent when it conflicts with one or more specific, fundamental, and mandatory policies of the general plan ( Families Unafraid, supra ). However, any given project need not be in perfect conformity with each and every policy of the general plan if those policies are not releva nt or leave the city or county room for interpretation ( Sequoayah Hills Homeowners Association v. City of Oakland, (1998) 23 Cal.App 4th 704 (1993) ). Placer County's Online General Plan is one method to help ensure consistency. Upon receiving a development proposal or other entitlement request, county staff enters distinguishing project features into a computer program. The program analyzes the proposal by checking for general plan and community plan consistency, identifying goals and policies by topic, and preparing a report of its results. The software can compare project characteristics to the goals and policies of the general plan and each of its elements, providing an unbiased consistency analysis. ZONING CONSISTENCY Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 302 Counties, ge neral law cities, and charter cities with populations of more than two million are required to maintai n consi stency between their zoning ordinance and their adopted general plan (\u00a765860). Charter cities with populations under two million are not subject to this mandate but should choose to enact their own code requirements fo r consistency (\u00a765803 and \u00a765860). Where the consistency requirement applies, every zoning action, such as the adoption of new zoning ordinance text or the amendment of a zoning ordina nce map, must be consistent with the general plan. A zoning ordinance that is inconsistent with the general plan at the time it is enacted is \"invalid when passed\" ( Lesher Communications v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531; Sierra Club v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698 ). By the same token, when a general plan amendment makes the zoning inconsistent, the zoning must be changed to re -establish consistency \"within a reasonable time\" (\u00a7 65860(c)). According to the California Supreme Court, \"[t]he Planning and Zoning Law does not contemplate that general plans will be amended to conform to zoning ordinances. The tail does not wag the dog.\" ( Lesher Communications v. City of Walnut Creek, su pra). State law does not prescribe what constitutes \"a reasonable time\" for reconciling the zoning ordinance with the general plan. OPR suggests that when possible, general plan amendments and necessary related zoning changes be heard concurrently (\u00a765862) . When concurrent hearings are not feasible, OPR suggests the following time periods: For minor general plan amendments (those involving a relatively small area), six months. For extensive amendments to the general plan (such as a revision that results in the inconsistency of large areas), two years. Zoning -related initiatives and refe renda must also maintain general plan consistency. An initiative seeking to impose growth management regulations was invalidated when it was found to be inconsistent with the general plan ( Lesher Communications v. City of Walnut Creek, supra ). A referendum that sought to overturn a rezoning approval was invalidated because the rezoning was necessary to maintain or achieve consistency with the general plan ( deBottari v. City of Norco (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204 ; City of Irvine v. Irvine Citizens Against Overd evelopment (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 868 ). Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 303 Assessing and Achieving Zoning Consistency Zoning consistency can be broken down into three parts: uses and standards, spatial patterns, and timing. These are described below. The local agency's general plan and zon ing ordinance contain text and maps that specify development standards and the proposed location of uses for the community. The development standards and uses specified for all land use categories in the zoning ordinance \u2014density, lot size, height, and the like\u2014must be consistent with the development standards and uses specified in the general plan's text and diagram of proposed land use. This has several implications. The zoning scheme, with its range of zoning districts and their associated development standards or regulations, must be broad enough to implement the general plan. For example, if a general plan contains three residential land use designations, each with its own residential intensity and density standard, then the zoning ordinance should typically have at least as many zoning districts with appropriate standards. Similarly, if the general plan identifies seismic hazard areas and calls for zoning measures to implement safety policies, the zoning ordinance must contain appropriate provisions, suc h as a hazard overlay zone, or specific development standards. When a new element or major revision to a general plan is adopted, the zoning scheme should be thoroughly reviewed for consistency. It must be amended if necessary to ensure that it is adequate to carry out the new element or revisions. When rezoning occurs, the newly adopted zoning must be appropriate and consistent with all elements of the general plan. This includes not only the land uses and development standards, but also the transportatio n, safety, open -space, and other objectives and policies contained in the plan. Both the general plan diagram of proposed land use and the zoning map should set forth similar patterns of land use distribution. However, the maps need not be identical if th e general plan text provides for flexibility of interpretation or for future development ( Las Virgenes Homeowners v. County of Los Angeles (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 312 ). For example, a Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 304 land use diagram may designate an area for residential development while t he zoning map may show the same area as predominantly residential with a few pockets of commercial use. Despite the residential designation, the commercial zoning could be consistent with the general plan if the plan's policies and standards allow for neig hborhood commercial development within residential areas. Likewise, more than one zoning classification may be consistent with any one of the general plan's land use categories. For example, both R -1 (residential) and PUD (planned unit development) may be consistent zoning for a low - density residential category in the plan. The timing of development is closely linked to the question of consistency of spatial patterns. A general plan is long term in nature, while zoning responds to shorter -term needs and con ditions. In many cases, zoning will only gradually fulfill the prescriptions of the general plan. Timing may be particularly important in rural areas designated for future urbanization. If the general plan contains policies regarding orderly development, a dequate public services, and compact urban growth, rez oning a large area from a low -intensity use (e.g., agriculture) to a more intensive one (e.g., residential) before urban services are available would be inconsistent with the general plan. Conversely, an inconsistency may be created when general plan policies promote hig h- intensity development in an area but the jurisdiction instead permits low -intensity uses. Since timing can be a problem, general plans should provide clear guidance for the pace of future development, perhaps by using five -year increments or by establishing a set of conditions to be met before consistent zoning would be considered timely. Local governments have devised a number of ways to evaluate and achieve zoning consistency. A fairly common approach is to employ a matrix comparing the general plan's land use categories and associated development standards with the zoning districts and their corresponding zoning ordinance development standards. To indicate the degree of zoning consiste ncy with the pl an, many matrices feature categories ranging from \"highly compatible\" to \"clearly incompatible.\" An intermediate category, \"conditionally compatible,\" could reflect zoning that by itself is not compatible but could beco me compatible if measu res such as a PUD overlay were imposed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts. The chart on the previous page illustrates a hypothetical matrix. It may be modified to match local conditions. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 305 The matrix approach has its limitations. By itself, a matrix cannot answer questions about the zoning's compatibility with the objectives, policies, and programs of the general plan, nor can it answer questions about timing. A number of local governments use a checklist to evaluate the consistency of individual zoni ng proposals. The checklist repeats the major goals and policies of the general plan and rates the degree to which the proposed zoning conforms to each of them (e.g., \"furthers,\" \"deters,\" \"no effect\"). A point system that rates development projects by the ir level of consistency with the goals, objectives, and policies of the general plan is a similar approach. Subdivision Consistency Before a city or county may approve a subdivision map (including parcel maps) and its provisions for design and improvement , the city or county must find that the proposed subdivision map is consistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plans (\u00a766473.5). These findings can only be made when the local agency has officially adopted a general plan and the proposed subdivision is \"compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses and programs specified in such a plan.\" Section 66474 and \u00a766474.61 require a city or county to deny approval of a tentative map if it makes either of the following findings: the p roposed map is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans or the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans. The checklist on the following pag e demonstrates one way to evaluate subdivision consistency. ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES Any resident, property owner, or other aggrieved party, including a public agency, may sue to enforce the requirements for the adoption of an adequate general plan ( 58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 21 (1975) ). The same is true for zoning consistency with the general plan (\u00a765860(b)), and for subdivisions (\u00a766499.33). As the state's chief law enforcement officer, Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 306 the Attorney General may do the same (\u00a712606 and California Constitution , Article V, \u00a713). Additionally, persons living outside a city have standing to sue if the city's zoning practices exclude them from residing in the city or raise their housing costs by adversely affecting the regional housing market ( Stocks v. City of Irv ine (1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 520 ). The courts may impose various remedies for failure to have a complete and ad equate general plan or for inconsistency of zoning and subdivision actions and public works projects (\u00a765750, et seq.) . One is a writ of mandate to compel a local government to adopt a legally adequate general plan. The courts also have general authority to issue an injunction to limit approvals of additional subdivision maps, parcel maps, rezonings, and public works proj ects or (under limited circumstances) the issuance of building permits pending adoption of a complete and adequate general plan ( 58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 21 (1975) , Friends of \"B\" Street v. City of Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988 , Camp v. Mendocino (1981) 12 3 Cal.App.3d 334 ). Where a court finds that specific zoning or subdivision actions or public works projects are inconsistent with the general plan, it may set aside such actions or projects. Under certain circumstances, the court may impose any of these fo rms of relief prior to a judicial determination of a general plan's inadequacy (\u00a765757). These provisions, however, do not limit the court's authority to impose other appropriate remedies. ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS After the g eneral plan has been adopted, \u00a765400(b) requires th e planning agency to provide an annual report to their legislative body, OPR, and HCD on the status of the plan and progress in its implementation. The report must detail progress in meeting the jurisdicti on's share of regional housing needs determined pursuant to \u00a765584 and local efforts to remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing pursuant to \u00a765583(c)(3). The annual progress report must be provided to the legislative body, OPR, and HCD on or before April 1 of each year. Jurisdictions must report on a calendar -year basis (January 1 through December 31). Jurisdiction s are able to complete the housing element portion of the APR online through the Department of housing and Community Development's online Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 307 portal. While there is a standard format for the housing element portion of the annual report, there is no standardized format for the preparation of the annual progress report for the rest of the general plan. The form and content of the rep ort may vary based on the circumstances, resources, and constraints of each jurisdiction. This section is meant to provide general guidance to cities and counti es in the preparation of their annual progress reports. Purpose of the Report To provide enough information to allow local legislative bodies to assess how the general plan is being implemented in accordance with adopted goals, policies, and implementatio n measures. To provide enough information to identify necessary course adjustments or modifications to the general plan as a means to improve local implementation. To provide a clear correlation between land use decis ions that have been made during the 12-month reporting period and the goals, policies, and implementation measures contained in the general plan. To provide information regarding local agency progress in meeting its share of regional housing needs and local efforts to remove governmental constraints to the development of housing (as defined in \u00a765584 and \u00a765583(c)(3)). Format of the Report (General) The following describes ways in which various cities and counties have organized and formatted their annual progress reports: Focus on indi vidual policies and implementation measures: Provide a comprehensive listing of all general plan policies, categorized by element, with a commentary on how each policy was implemented during the reporting period (i.e., a description of the activities under way or completed for Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 308 implementation of each policy). This listing can most easily be accomplished by using a table format. (Examples: Carlsbad, Citrus Heights) Focus on development activities and projects approved: Provide comprehensive listing of all de velopment applications that the planning agency received and processed with commentary on how the agency's actions on these development applications further the goals, policies, and/or implementation measures of the general plan. Link the major projects, including public projects, to the general plan using policy numbers or by element. (Examples: Placer County, Signal Hill) Focus on general plan elements: Provide a general summary of each of the mandatory and optional elements of the general plan with a b rief description of various actions taken by the agency (e.g., development application approvals, adoption of ordinances or plans, agency -initiated planning studies, etc.) that advanced specific goals and policies of each element. (Examples: Camarillo, San Luis Obispo, Redlands) Broad annual report format: Incorporate the annual progress report into a broadly focused annual report o n all of the activities and programs of the jurisdiction, drawing upon data and sources such as an annual performance report on budgeting, processing of land use entitlements, redevelopment activities, housing construction, or other programs or \"state of the city/county\" reports. Format of the Report (Housing Element ) In 2010, the State Department of Housing and Community Deve lopment adopted regulations on the preparation of the annual report on the housing element portion of the general plan. All APRs must conform to these regulations. Forms, instructions, and a copy of the regulations can be found at the HCD's website at http://www.hcd.ca.gov/regulations/ . In general the following information is required for housing element reporting. A listing of building permits issued for the calendar year by income category. Demonstrat ion of the progress towards meeting the regional housing need. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 309 A description of the progress in implementation of the policies and programs in the housing element. The report must be considered at an annual public meeting before the legislative body where members of the public shall be allowed to provide oral testimony and written comments. As an addendum to the APR a city or county housing successor agency must report on housing financial and activity information pursuant to Health and Safety Code 34176.1 : Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 310 CONSISTENCY PROVISIONS IN STATE LAW AND LEGAL PRECEDENTS All statutory references are to the California Government Code unless otherwise noted. Agricultural Preserves \u00a8 \u00a751234 requires that agricultural preserves established under the Williamson Act be consistent with the general plan. \u00a8 \u00a751282 requires a city or county, when approving a Williamson Act contract cancellation, to make a finding that the proposed alternate use is consistent with the general plan. Capital Improvements \u00a8 \u00a765401 and \u00a765402 require planning agencies to review and report on the consistency with the applicable general plan of proposed city, county, and special district capital projects, including land acquisition and disposal. \u00a8 \u00a765103(c) r equires planning agencies to review annually their city or county capital improvement programs and other local agencies' public works projects for consistency with the general plan. \u00a8 Friends of B Street v. City of Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988 held th at governmental capital facilities projects must be consistent with the general plan. \u00a8 \u00a753090, et seq., require that most public works projects undertaken by special districts, including school districts, must be consistent with local zoning, which in tur n must be consistent with the general plan. A special district governing board may render the zoning ordinance inapplicable if it makes a finding after a public hearing that there is no feasible alternative t o the project (\u00a753096). State entities are an ex ception to this consistency requirement ( Rapid Transit Advocates, Inc. v. Southern California Rapid Transit District (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 996 ). Condominium Conversion \u00a8 \u00a766427.2 requires that when the general plan contains objectives and policies addressi ng the conversion of rental units to condominiums, any conversion must be consistent with those objectives and policies. Development Agreements \u00a8 \u00a765867.5 requires development agreements to be consistent with the general plan. Housing Authority Projects \u00a8 Health and Safety Code \u00a734326 declares that all housing projects undertaken by housing authorities are subject to local planning and zoning laws. Integrated Waste Management \u00a8 Public Resources Code \u00a74170 states that if a county determines that the existing capacity of a solid waste facility will be exhausted within 15 years or if the county desires additional capacity, then the countywide siting element of the county's hazardous waste management plan must identify an area or areas, consistent with the appli cable general plan, for the location of new solid waste transformation or disposal facilities or for the expansion of existing facilities. \u00a8 Public Resources Code \u00a741702 states that an area is consistent with the city or county general plan if: 1. The city or county has adopted a general plan. 2. The area reserved for the new or expanded facility is located in, or coextensive with, a land use area designated or authorized by the applicable general plan for solid waste facilities. 3. The adjacent or nearby l and use authorized by the applicable general plan is compatible with the establishment or expansion of the solid w aste facility. On-Site Wastewater Disposal Zones \u00a8 Health and Safety Code \u00a76965 requires a finding that the operation of an on -site wastewater disposal zone created under Health and Safety Code \u00a76950, et seq., will not result in land uses that are inconsistent with the applicable general plan. Open Space \u00a8 \u00a765566 requires that acquisition, disposal, restriction, or regulation of open -space land by a city or county be consistent with the open -space element of the general plan. \u00a8 \u00a765567 prohibits the issuance of building permits, approval of subdivision maps, and adoption of open -space zoning ordinances that are inconsistent with the open -space ele ment of the general plan. \u00a8 \u00a765910 specifies that every city and county must adopt an open -space zoning ordinance consistent with the open -space element of the general plan. \u00a8 \u00a751084 requires cities and counties accepting or approving an open -space easemen t to make a finding that preservation of the open -space land is consistent with the general plan. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 311 Consistency Provisions in State Law and Legal Precedents, Continued Park Dedications \u00a8 \u00a766477 enables local governments to require as a condition of subdiv ision and parcel map approval the dedication of land or the payment of in lieu fees for parks and recreational purposes if the parks and recreational facilities are consistent wi th adopted general or specific plan policies and standards. Parking Authority Projects \u00a8 Streets and Highway Code \u00a732503 specifies that parking authorities, in planning and locating any parking facility, are subject to the relationship of the facility to any officially adopted master plan or sections of such master plan for the deve lopment of the area in which the authority functions to the same extent as if it were a private entity. Planning Commission Recommendations \u00a8 \u00a765855 requires that the planning commission's written recommendation to the legislative body on the adoption or a mendment of a zoning ordinance include a report on the relationship of the proposed adoption or amendment to the general plan. Reservations of Land Within Subdivisions \u00a8 \u00a766479 specifies that reservations of land for parks, recreational facilities, fire st ations, libraries, and other public uses within a subdivision must conform to the general plan. Special Housing Programs \u00a8 Health and Safety Code \u00a750689.5 specifies that housing and housing programs developed under Health and Safety Code \u00a750680, et seq., f or the developmentally disabled, mentally disordered, and physically disabled must be consistent with the housing element of the general plan. Specific Plans \u00a8 \u00a765359 requires that a specific plan be reviewed and amended as necessary to make it consistent with the applicable general plan. \u00a8 \u00a765454 specifies that a specific plan may not be adopted or amended unless the proposed plan is consistent with the general plan. Street, Highway, and Service Easement Abandonments \u00a8 Streets and Highways Code \u00a78313 speci fies that prior to vacating a street, highway, or public service easement, the legislative body must consider the applicable general plan. Transit Village Development Plan \u00a8 \u00a765460.8 states that a transit village plan prepared under the Transit Village Dev elopment Planning Act of 1994 must be consistent with the city or county general plan. Project Review Under CEQA \u00a8 Title 14, California Code of Regulations, \u00a715125(b) (CEQA Guidelines) requires examination of projects subject to the provisions of CEQA for consistency with the general plan. \u00a8 Public Resources Code \u00a721080.10 and 21080.14 exempt specified housing projects from the requirements of CEQA, but only when consistent with the general plan and meeting other criteria. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 312 Contents of the Report Each jurisdiction should determine which locally relevant issues are important to include in the annual report. The following items may be useful in the annual progress report: Introduction. Table of contents. Date of pr esentation to and acceptance by the local legislative body. List of major agency -initiated planning activities that were initiated, in progress, or completed during the reporting period (i.e., master plans, specific plans, master environmental assessment s, annexation studies, and other studies or plans carried out in support of specific general plan implementation measures). Include a brief comment on how each of these activities advances the goals, policies, and/or implementation measures contained in th e general plan. Provide specific reference to individual elements where applicable. List each of the general plan amendments that have been processed, along with a brief description and the action taken (e.g., approval, denial, etc.). This listing should include agency -initiated as well as applicant -driven amendments. List each o f the development applications that have been processed, along with a brief description, the action taken (e.g., approval, denial, etc.), and a brief comment on how each action furthers the goals, policies, and/or implementation measures of the general plan. Pr ovide specific reference to indiv idual elements where ap plicable. Identify significant projects built within jurisdiction but not approved by jurisdiction, such as large school facilities not approved by city or county, but affecting general plan. Identify priorities for land use decision -making that have been establ ished by the local legislative body (e.g., passage of moratoria, emergency ordinances, development of community or specific plans, etc.). Quantify, where appropriate, existing and projected housing needs for all income levels pursuant to housing element l aw (\u00a765583) with regard to: The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the attainment of state housing goals. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 313 The effectiveness of the housing element in attaining the community's housing goals and objectives . The progress in implementing the housing element . The annual progress report should identify goals, policies, objectives, standards, or other plan proposals that need to be added, deleted, amended, or otherwise adjusted. If the jurisdiction is in the process of a comprehensive general plan update, the progress report can be limited to a brief letter describing the scope of work and anticipated completion date. Suggested Reporting Methods on Regional Hou sing Needs HCD recommends the following step -by-step approach for cities and counties to report their progress in meeting their share of the regional housing needs. First, determine the total net housing units added in the reporting year. If the progre ss report is based on the calendar year, one approach is to report the change in the Department of Finance's (DO F) total units estimate o ver the year. If the progress report is based on the fiscal year or other t ime period, local estimates will need to be prepared using DOF and local data. A local estimate of net units added should reflect the following: An estimate or records for total units completed. If unit completion data is not available, units completed may be estimated from permit issuance data with the use of an est imate of the average time lag between permit issuance and completion and an estimate of the percentage of permits issued that were not used. An estimate or records for total units removed. A definition of what constitutes a new unit for regional share purposes. On the latter point, for example, shared housing arrangements do not produce new dwelling units as the term is used in DOF estimates and in regional projected needs shares Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 314 and should not be included. In general, a unit should be counted if it meets DOF's functional definition for inclusion in its annual unit estimates. Second, determine affordability characteristics of units added in the reporting year. Third, compare units added to regional share objectives. Submitting the Report to OPR and HCD Annual progress reports can be submitted to OPR in either electronic or paper format. If you wish to submit your annual report to OPR electronically, e -mail it to state.clearinghouse@opr.ca.gov and limit the file size to 2 KB or less. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, text, RTF, PDF, or PageMak er are the only acceptable file formats. Printed copies of the annual report should be sent to Governor's Office of Planning and Research, State Clearinghouse and Planning Unit, P.O. Box 3044, Sacramento, CA 95812 -3044. A copy of the report must also be se nt to the Department of Housing and Community Development, Housing Policy Division, 1800 Third St., Rm. 430, Sacramento, CA 95814. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 315 Chapter 10: CEQA Designing Healthy, Equitable, Resilient, and Economically Vibrant Places [quote] Introduction Becaus e general plans govern the type and location of new development, new or amended general plan policies may lead to significant changes in the environment. The California Environmental Quality Act, also known as \"CEQA,\" requires cities and counties to study those potential environmental impacts as part of the adoption or update process. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000, et seq.; see also CEQA Guidelines, \u00a7 15378.) Where those impacts may be significant, the city or county must prepare an environmental impact report (EIR). The primary purpose of an EIR is to inform decision -makers and the public of the potential significant environmental effects of a proposal, less damaging alternatives, and possible ways to reduce or avoid environmental damage. This informatio n enables environmental considerations to influence policy development, thereby ensuring that the plan's policies will address potential environmental impacts and the means to avoid them. This chapter addresses some key considerations for complying with CE QA in preparing a new general plan, a general plan update, or a general plan amendment. Some of those considerations include: Identifying major points of intersection between the general plan and CEQA processes; Comparing different types of EIRs to determ ine which might best suit the needs of the city or county and that would enable use of several streamlining mechanisms for later development approvals, and Mitigation Monitoring and General Plan Implementation Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 316 Key CEQA Policies to Remember Before descri bing specific considerations for CEQA review of general plans, it is useful to first review several key policies underlying CEQA that are relevant to the general plan process. - CEQA should be integrated into planning processes and guide development of the p lan itself. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21003(a), 21080.5.) Information developed as part of the CEQA process should influence the development of general plan policies. CEQA should not just be a post hoc rationalization of decisions that have already been made. ( Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 395 (\"the later the environmental review process begins, the more bureaucratic and financial momentum there is behind a proposed project, thus providing a strong incentive to ignore environmental concerns that could be dealt with more easily at an early stage of the project\").) - While the CEQA process should occur early enough to influence development of the general plan, it should not happen until environ mental review will produce meaningful information. (CEQA Guidelines \u00a7 15004.) For example, an EIR will not provide meaningful information if it is prepared before visioning or actual policy language is developed. - The CEQA process should be efficient . (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21003(f).) \"An EIR on a project such as the adoption or amendment of a ... local general plan should focus on the secondary effects that can be expected to follow from the adoption or amendment, but the EIR need not be as detailed as an EIR on the specific construction projects that might follow.\" (CEQA Guidelines, \u00a7 15146(b).) Further, once analysis occurs in connection with a general plan EIR, that information and analysis should be used to inform later project applications. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 317 These policies can help guide planners as they confront questions about precisely how to conduct environmental review for a general plan process. Considerations for General Plan EIRs The procedure for preparing and using an EIR is described in detail in the s tate CEQA Guidelines (Title 14, California Code of Regulations, \u00a715000, et seq.). A summary of the CEQA process is provided in the California Planning Guide (OPR, Dec. 2005). The f ollowing discussion highlights some of the key points that are particularly important when preparing an EIR for a new general plan, an element, or a comprehensive revision. A general plan for which an EIR is prepared is considered a project of statewide, regional, or areawide significance (CEQA Guidelines \u00a715206). This means that the lead agency must conduct at least one scoping meeting and the EIR must be circulated through the State Clearinghouse for review by relevant state agencies. In addition, the city or county must consult with transportation planning agencies during the development of the general plan and EIR. (Id. at \u00a7 15086(a)(5).) Further, \"any transportation information generated by a required monitoring or reporting program shall be submitt ed to the transportation planning agency in the region where the project is located and to the California Department of Transportation.\" ( See id . at \u00a7 15097(g).) The plan EIR, to a certain extent, can be seen as describing the relationship between the proposed density and intensity of land use described by the plan and the carrying capacity of the area. Baseline The EIR must describe the existing local and regional physical environment, emphasizing those features that are likely to be affected by the pla n and the environmental constraints and resources that are rare or unique to the area. It should describe existing infrastructure, such as roads, water systems, and sewage treatment facilities, along with their capacities and current levels of use. It shou ld also discuss any inconsistencies between the proposed plan and adopted regional plans as they may relate to environmental issues. (See CEQA Guidelines \u00a7 15125(d).) For example, cities and counties should evaluate any inconsistencies between the proposed general plan and the regional sustainable communities strategy. The Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 318 baseline or other cross -referenced component of the EIR must also describe the changes that would occur to the community as a result of the changin g climate . When a new general plan or a revision is being considered, the EIR must evaluate the proposed plans or revision's effects on both the existing physical environment and the environment envisioned by any adopted plan. ( Environmental Planning and Information Council v. County of El Dorado (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 354; see also CEQA Guidelines \u00a7 15125(e). ) When a city or county proposes to amend a general plan, the environmental analysis should focus on the changes proposed in the amendment. Reanalysi s of unchanged portions of the general plan is not required. ( Black Property Owners Assn. v. City of Berkeley (1994) 22 Cal. App. 4th 974.) Level of Detail in Analysis The general plan EIR need not be as detailed as an EIR for the specific projects that will follow. (CEQA Guidelines \u00a715146.) Its level of detail should reflect the level contained in the plan or plan element being considered. ( Rio Vista Farm Bureau Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351 .) At the same time, however, the lead age ncy cannot defer to later tiered EIRs its analysis of any significant effect of the general plan. ( Stanislaus Natural Heritage Project, Sierra Club v. County of Stanislaus (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 182. ) \"With a good and detailed analysis of the [general plan] , many subsequent activities could be found to be within the scope of the project described in the [general plan] EIR, and no further environmental documents would be required.\" (CEQA Guidelines \u00a7 15168(c)(5); see also id. at \u00a7 15183.3 (streamlining for i nfill projects).) Mitigation The EIR must identify mitigation measures and alternatives to avoid or minimize potential impacts, to the extent feasible. The general plan EIR is a particularly useful tool for identifying measures to mitigate the cumulative effects of new development. For example, a general plan might anticipate a significant increase in industrial employment in the community. If this proposal would lead to increased automobile commuting, the EIR could identify measures to reduce peak -hour t raffic volumes, such as new transit routes or improved bicycle facilities. Where other agencies are responsible for mitigating the effects of the general plan, they should be identified in the EIR. Pursuant to Public Resources Code Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 319 \u00a721081.6, the general pl an must incorporate the approved mitigation measures identified in the EIR into its policies and plan proposals. Alternatives Several alternative draft plans are typically considered en route to adopting a general plan. Similarly, the EIR for the plan must describe a reasonable range of alternatives and analyze each of their effects. (CEQA Guidelines \u00a715126.6.) Consistent with CEQA, the alternative plans should share most of the same objectives. Each of the alternatives should avoi d or lessen one or more of the significant effects identified as resulting from the proposed plan. A reasonable range of alternatives would typically include different levels of density and compactness, as well as different locations and types of uses for future development. In a situation where the proposal is yet to be selected from among the alternatives, the competing alternatives should not all have the same level of impacts. This discussion of alternatives will enable environmental considerations to influence the ultimate design of the general plan. The EIR must also evaluate the \"no project\" alternative. This would describe what physical changes might reasonably be expected to occur in the foreseeable future if the new or revised general plan were n ot adopted, based on the existing general plan (if any) and available infrastructure and services. This \"no project\" alternative must also evaluate how the changing environment, such as through climate change and drought, may affect the community if a new or revised general plan were not adopted. Cumulative Impacts The EIR must analyze the cumulative effects of the plan's policies and proposals on the environment. For example, a planning policy authorizing rural residential uses in or near wild lands coul d cumulatively increase the potential severity of fire damage by hindering wildfire suppression efforts. Increasing reliance on automobile use in a general plan, through dispersed land uses for example, could contribute not only to cumulative air quality i mpacts in non -attainment areas and increased energy use, but also indirect effects such as increased water pollution (due to runoff from roads) and adverse effects to public health (due to decreased physical activity). When cumulative impacts are adequatel y addressed in a Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 320 general plan EIR, further analysis should not be needed at the project level. (See CEQA Guidelines \u00a7 15183(j).) Growth Inducing Impacts Growth -inducing impacts must also be analyzed. These may include any policies, proposals, and progra ms of the general plan likely to stimulate community growth and development. Examples include plans for street and highway improvements in undeveloped areas, a proposal for wastewater treatment plant expansion, and proposals for the expansion of employment in basic industries, any of which is likely to increase pressure for or facilitate residential and other development. Irreversible Environmental Change s The environmental analysis for a general plan must address any irreversible environmental changes. Fo r example, once general plan policies designate certain areas for development, such areas are unlikely to ever be returned to a natural condition. Thus, the environmental effects of locking in certain uses for the foreseeable future must be analyzed in a general plan's environmental analysis. \"Irretrievable commitments of resources should be evaluated to assure that such current consumption is justified.\" (See Public Resources Code \u00a7 21100.1; see also id . at \u00a7 21000(a) (\"maintenance of a quality environmen t for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide concern\") (emphasis added).) Timing The purpose of preparing an environmental analysis is not only to inform decision -makers and the public of a general plan's potential adverse environmental impacts, but also to allow environmental considerations to influence the design of the plan itself. To accomplish this purpose, the CEQA analysis should be prepared in coordination with the development of the general plan. The following ta ble suggests several points of intersection between the CEQA and general plan update process. Careful coordination between the CEQA process and the general plan process can also minimize unnecessary duplication of work. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 321 PUBLIC REVIEW OF THE EIR AND CONSULTATION Both CEQA and the Government Code require extensive consultation and the public and other public agencies during the development of a general plan. For example, Government Code section 65352 requires consultation with, among others: A city or county, within o r abutting the area covered by the proposal, General Plan Tasks Steps in EIR Process Work plan Notice of Preparation Visioning, Goals Development Project Description Project Objectives Collect and analyze data Initial Study Scoping Refine goals Environmental Analysis Alternatives Analysis Alternatives Analysis Identify a preferred alternative Release draft EIR Further Refinement of Goals Responses to Comments Plan Adoption Final EIR, MMRP, Findings and SOC Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 322 Any special district that may be significantly affected by the proposed action An elementary, high school, or unified school district within the area covered by the proposed action. The local agency formatio n commission. An areawide planning agency whose operations may be significantly affected by the proposed action A federal agency if its operations or lands within its jurisdiction may be significantly affected by the proposed action The military Public water systems The Bay Area Air Quality Management District for a proposed action within the boundaries of the district A California Native American tribe that is on the contact list maintained by the Native American Heritage Commission, with tradition al lands located within the city or county's jurisdiction. The Central Valley Flood Protection Board for a proposed action within the boundaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Drainage District. In addition, the city or county must provide for at leas t one scoping meeting to receive input on the scope and content of the draft EIR. (Public Resources Code \u00a721083.9.) Refer to Chapter 3: Public Engagement and Outreach, for methods to seek meaningful community input. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 323 Adoption and Certificatio n Before adopting the general plan, element, or revision for which the EIR was prepared, the city council or county board of supervisors must consider the final EIR, certify its adequacy, and make explicit findings explaining how the significant environme ntal effects identified in the EIR have been or should be mitigated or explain why mitigation measures and identified alternatives are not feasible. (CEQA Guidelines \u00a715091.) The city or county cannot approve the general plan unless the approved plan will not result in a significant effect on the environment or, more commonly, the city or county has eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects where feasible and made a written statement of overriding considerations explaining the reasons why any remaining unavoidable significant effects are acceptable. (CEQA Guidelines \u00a715093.) The jurisdiction must also adopt a mitigation monitoring or reporting program to ensure that the mitigation incorporated into the plan in accordance with the EIR will be implemented. Program and Master EIRs In order to minimize the need to reanalyze a series of projects related to the general plan, CEQA and the state CEQA Guidelines encourage using a general plan EIR to address subsequent discretionary projects, such a s adopting zoning ordinances and approving specific capital improvement or development projects that are consistent with the general plan. By using a programmatic approach, the environmental review for a subsequent project can be limited to those project -specific significant effects that either were not examined or not examined fully in the general plan EIR. Later environmental analysis for more specific actions can use analysis from the general plan EIR in several ways. The following paragraphs present a brief discussion of program EIRs, master EIRs, streamlining under Public Resources Code sections 21083.3 and 21094.5, and the use of certain statutory exemptions. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 324 Program EIRs The program EIR prepared for a general plan examines broad policy alternatives, considers the cumulative effects and alternatives to later individual activities where known, and contains plan -level mitigation measures. Later activities that have been described adequa tely under the program EIR will not require additional environmental documents. (CEQA Guidelines \u00a7 15168(c)(2).) When necessary, new environmental documents, such as a subsequent or supplemental EIR or a negative declaration, will focus on the project -specific impacts of later activities, filling in the information and analysis missing from the program EIR. (Id. at subd. (d).) The \"project\" being examined in the program EIR is the general plan, element, or revision. The CEQA Guidelines recommend that progr am EIRs deal with the potential effects of a general plan, element, or revision \"as specifically and comprehensively as possible.\" The program EIR's level of detail should be commensurate with the level of detail contained in the general plan element. ( See Rio Vista Farm Bureau Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351 .) A program EIR should pay particular attention to the following EIR components: The significant environmental effects, including cumulative effects of anticipated later activities under the plan or element. Mitigation measures, including plan -wide measures. Alternatives to the basic policy considerations set forth by the plan or element. When evaluating a later activity to determine whether it is eligible for consideration under a program EIR, OPR suggests the following sequential approach. First, the lead agency must determine whether the subsequent activity meets both of the following criteria: 1. It is consistent with the plan or element for which the program EIR was certified. (A general plan amendment obviously would not qualify. (See, Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307).) Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 325 2. It incorporates the feasible mitigation measures and alternatives developed in the program EIR. (Additional mitigation measures an d alternatives may also be applied when a subsequent or supplemental EIR is prepared.) Second, the lead agency must evaluate the later activity and its location to determine whether the environmental effects of that activity were adequately described in t he program EIR. If there are any new effects from the later activity, the lead agency must prepare an initial study to determine the significance of those effects. No subsequent EIR is necessary for a project that is essentially part of the \"project\" descr ibed by the general plan's program EIR unless: 1. The later project would propose substantial changes in the plan that were not described in the program EIR, requiring revisions to the program EIR due to the involvement of a new significant effect or a su bstantial increase in the severity of a previously identified effect. 2. Substantial changes have occurred in the circumstances under which the general plan was undertaken, requiring revisions to the program EIR due to the involvement of a new significant effect or a substantial increase in the severity of a previously identified effect. 3. New information of substantial importance that was not known and could not have been known at the time the program EIR was certified indicates that significant effects w ere not adequately analyzed or that mitigation measures or alternatives should be revisited. (See CEQA Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 15162, 15168(c).) If no subsequent EIR is required, the project is deemed to be within the scope of the program EIR and no additional envi ronmental document would be required. Case law provides good examples of when further environmental review may, or may not, be required. For example, the City of San Diego's redevelopment agency was not required to conduct additional environmental review of a hotel project because it had previously prepared a program EIR addressing development in its downtown. ( See Citizens for Responsible Equitable Envt'l Dev. v. San Diego R.A. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 598.) On the other hand, additional environmental rev iew was required for a proposal to use land that had previously been identified as agricultural for mining purposes because that new use was Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 326 not \"within the scope\" of the program EIR. ( See Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307.) If a subsequen t EIR must be prepared, it is subject to the standard EIR content requirements (i.e., project description, environmental setting, significant effects, mitigation measures, etc.). However, the subsequent EIR need not duplicate information and anal ysis that is already included in the program EIR. This may include such areas as environmental setting, project alternatives, and cumulative impacts. Pertinent discussions from the program EIR, to the extent that it examines regional influences, secondary effects, cumulative effects, broad alternatives, and other factors that apply to the later project, should be incorporated by reference into the subsequent EIR. (CEQA Guidelines \u00a7 15168(d).) Master EIRs Another option for conducting programmatic review is to prepare and certify a master EIR (MEIR). (Public Resources Code \u00a721157, et seq. and CEQA Guidelines \u00a715175, et seq.) The MEIR is intended to be the foundation for a nalyzing the environmental effects of subsequent projects. Those projects that have been described in some detail in the MEIR may avoid the need for a later EIR or negative declaration. Other projects will need to be analyzed in a focused EIR that examines project -specific impacts while referencing the MEIR's analysis of cumulative and growth -inducing impacts. Section 15178 of the CEQA Guidelines specifically allows later projects that are consistent with the land use designations and the permissible densit ies and intensities of use described in the general plan to proceed under the MEIR. This avoids the need for another EIR or negative declaration. The OPR publication Focusing on Master EIRs offers detailed technical information about using MEIRs. In practi ce, an MEIR is similar to a program EIR. However, there are at least three differences worth noting. First, the requirements for preparing and applying an MEIR and its associated focused EIRs are described in detail in both statute and the CEQA Guidelines . The program EIR is less specifically described in the CEQA Guidelines. Second, once a subsequent project is determined to be within the scope of the MEIR, a focused EIR must be prepared whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 327 substantial eviden ce in the record that the project may have a significant effect, even if evidence exists to the contrary. Third, MEIRs must be re -examined and, if necessary, supplemented at least once every five years. This ensures that the analysis contained in an MEIR remains topical. Streamlining in Public Resources Code Section 21083.3 Public Resources Code section 21083.3 contains a specific limitation on CEQA for projects that are consistent with a general plan. When an EIR has been certified for a ge neral plan, the CEQA analysis of later projects can be limited to those significant effects that \"are peculiar to the project\" and that either were not addressed as significant effects in the plan's EIR or that new information shows will be more significan t than when the plan's EIR was certified. The requirements of this option are detailed in CEQA Guidelines \u00a715183. Streamlining for Infill Projects in Public Resources Code Section 21094.5 Similar to the provision described above, section 21094.5 of the Pub lic Resources Code limits the CEQA analysis of infill projects. Specific rules on this provision are contained in Section 15183.3 and Appendix M of the CEQA Guidelines. As a general matter, section 21094.5 allows a lead agency a large degree of flexibilit y in using existing environmental documents to approve later projects. Because the primary criteria for eligibility is proximity to transit, cities can maximize the streamlining benefit of a general plan EIR by carefully analyzing residential, commercial and school uses in transit corridors. Comparing Existing Streamlining Mechanisms Program EIRs Master EIRs Section 21083.3 Streamlining Under Section 21094.5 Time Limit on Prior EIR None 5 Years None None Plan Consistency General Plan and Silent Requires Project may Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 328 zoning consistency not explicitly required, but if project is not consistent, it may not be \"within the scope\" of the PEIR. consistency with General Plan and Zoning include general plan amendments or zoning variances, provided that ne w effects would need to be analyzed Project -Level Description Not required, but a PEIR \"will be most helpful in dealing with subsequent activities if it deals with the effects of the program as specifically and comprehensively as possible.\" Projects r elying on the Master EIR must have been specifically identified Not required in general plan or zoning EIR Not required in EIR for a planning level decision Project Contribution to Significant Effects Analysis does not need to be repeated at the project level if the project is \"within the scope\" of the PEIR.

The city or county should coordinate general plan policies and environmental mitigation measures during the planning process so that the mitigation measures will be reflected in the plan policies and those policies realistically can be implemented. The city or county must adopt a specific program that will enable it to track compliance with the mitigation measures. One approach is to use the yearly \"state of the plan\" report prepared for the city council or board of supervisors pursuant to \u00a765400(b) as the reporting program for a n ew general plan. See OPR's publication Tracking Mitigation Measures Under AB 3180 for more information about designing a mitigation monitoring program. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 330 Transportation information resulting from the mitigation monitoring program must be submitted to the loc al transportation planning agency and to Caltrans (CEQA Guidelines \u00a715206). A general plan can be measured by how well its objectives, policies, and programs are implemented. The same is true for the mitigation measures identified in the plan's EIR. When drafting mitigation measures, consider how they can be reflected in plan objectives, policies, and programs and how they will be implemented. The mitigation measures should be an integral part of the plan, not an afterthought.

The fundamental goals of the noise element are: \u00a8 To provide sufficient information concerning the community noise environment so that noise may be effectively considered in the la nd use planning process. In so doing, the necessary groundwork will have been developed so that a community noise ordinance may be utilized to resolve noise complaints. \u00a8 To develop strategies for abating excessive noise exposure through cost -effective mitigating measures in combination with zoning, as appropriate, to avoid incompatible land uses. \u00a8 To protect those existing regions of the planning area whose noise environments are deemed acceptable and also those locations throughout the community deemed \"noise sensitive.\" \u00a8 To utilize the definition of the community noise environment in the form of CNEL or Ldn noise contours as provided in the noise element for local compliance with the State Noise Insulation Standards. These standards require specified levels of outdoor to indoor noise reduction for new multifamily residential constructions in areas where the outdoor noise exposure exceeds CNEL (or Ldn) 60 dB. The 1976 edition of the Noise Element Guidelines , prepared by the California Department of Health Services (DHS), was a result of SB 860 (Beilenson, 1975), which became effective January 1, 1976. SB 860, among other things, revised and clarified the requirements for the noise element of each city and county general plan and gave DHS the authority to issue guidelines for compliance thereto. Compliance with the 1976 version of these guidelines was mandated only Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 384 for those noise elements that were not submitted to the Office of Planning and Research by the effective date of SB 860 and to subsequent rev isions of previously submitted noise elements. A comparison between the 1976 Noise Element Guidelines and this revised edition will not reveal substantial changes. The basic methodology advanced by that previous edition remains topical. Where necessary, c ode references have been updated and the text revised to reflect statutory changes. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 385 NOISE ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS Government Code Section 65302(f): A noise element shall identify and appraise noise problems in the communit y. The noise element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and projecte d noise levels for all of the following sources: DEFINITIONS Decibel, dB : A unit of measurement describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons per square meter) . A-Weighted Level : The sound level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter using the A -weighting filter network. The A -weighting filter de -emphasizes the very low and very high frequency components of the sound in a manner similar to the response of the human ear and gives good c orrelation with subjective reactions to noise. L10: The A -weighted sound level that is exceeded ten percent of the sample time. Similarly, L50, L90, etc. Leq: Equivalent energy level. The sound level corresponding to a st eady-state sound level containing the same total energy as a time -varying signal over a given sample period. Leq is typically computed over 1 -, 8-, and 24 -hour sample periods. CNEL: Community Noise Equivalent Level. The average equivalent A -weighted sound level during a 24 -hour day, obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. Ldn: Day-Night Average Level. The average equ ivalent A -weighted sound level during a 24 -hour day, obtained after the addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night after 10 p.m. and before 7 a.m. (Note: CNEL and Ldn represent daily levels of noise exposure averaged on an annual or daily basis, while Leq represents the equivalent energy noise exposure for a shorter time period, typically one hour.) Noise Contours : Lines drawn about a noise source indicating equal levels of noise exposure. CNEL and Ldn are the metrics utilized herein to describe a nnoyance due to noise and to establish land use planning criteria for noise. Ambient Noise : The composite of noise from all sources near and far. In this context, the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location. Intrusive Noise : That noise which intrudes over and above the existing ambient noise at a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound depends upon its amplitude, duration, frequency, and time of occurrence, and tonal or informati onal content as well as the prevailing noise level. Noisiness Zones : Defined areas within a community wherein the ambient noise levels are generally similar (within a range of 5 dB, for example). Typically, all other things being equal, sites within any g iven noise zone will be of comparable proximity to major noise Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 386 1. Highways and freeways. 2. Primary arterials and major local streets. 3. Passenger and freight online railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems. 4. Commercial, general aviation, heliport, heli stop, and military airport operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation. 5. Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards. 6. Other ground stationary sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment. Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in terms of community noise equivalent level (CNEL) or day -night average level (Ldn). The noise contours shall be prepared on the basis of noise monitoring or following generally accepted noise modeling techniques for the various sources identified in paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive. The noise contours shall be used a s a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise. The noise element shall include implementation measures and possible solutions that address existing and fores eeable noise problems, if any. The adopted noise element shall serve as a guideline for compliance with the state's noise insulation standards. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 387 NOISE ELEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS The sequential steps for developme nt of a noise element as an integral part of a community's total noise control program are illustrated in the flow diagrams of figures 1A and 1B. The concept presented herein utilizes the noise element as the central focus of the community's program and pr ovides the groundwork for all subsequent enforcement efforts. The process may be described in terms of four phases: Phase A: Noise Environment Definition Phase B: Noise -Compatible Land Use Planning Phase C: Noise Mitigation Measures Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 388 Phase D: Enforcement These phases encompass a total of eighteen defined tasks, the first thirteen of which relate directly to the statutory requirements contained in Government Code \u00a765302(f). The remainder relate to critical supportive programs (noise ordinances, etc.). Cit ations from \u00a765302(f) are contained within quotation marks. Phase A: Noise Environment Definition The purpose of this phase is to adequately identify and appraise the existing and future noise environment of the community in terms of Community Noise Equi valent Level (CNEL) or Day - Night Average Level (Ldn) noise contours for each major noise source and to divide the city or county into noise zones for subsequent noise ordinance application. Step 1: Identify a specific individual or lead agency within the local government to be responsible for coordination of local noise control activities. This individual or agency should be responsible for coordinating all intergovernmental activities and subsequent enforcement efforts. Step 2: Review n oise complaint f iles as compiled by all local agencies (police, animal control, health, airport, traffic department, etc.) in order to assess the following: 1. Location an d types of major offending noise sources. 2. Noise -sensitive areas and land uses. 3. Community atti tudes towards specific sources of noise pollution. 4. Degree of severity of noise problems in the community. 5. Relative significance of noise as a pollutant. Step 3: Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 389 Specifically identify major sources of community noise based upon the review of compl aint files and interagency discussion and the following statutory subjects: 1. Highways and freeways. 2. Primary arterials and major local streets. 3. Passenger and freight online railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems. 4. Commercial, gene ral aviation, heliport, helistop, and military a irport operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation. 5. Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards. 6. Other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment. (\u00a765302(f)) In addition, the land uses and areas within the community that are noise sensitive s hould be identified at the same time. Step 4: Given the identification of major noise sources and an indication of the community's attitude toward noise pollution (when available), it is advisable to conduct a community noise survey. The purposes of the survey are threefold: First and foremost, to define by measurement the current noise levels at those sites deemed noise sources and to e stablish noise level contours around them. The noise contours must be expressed in terms of CNEL or Ldn. Secon d, the collected data will form the basis for an analysis of noise exposure from major sources. Finally, the survey should define the existing ambient noise level throughout the community. Intrusive noises over and above this general predetermined ambient level may then be controlled through implementation of a noise ordinance. Step 5: Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 390 Given the definition of existing ambient noise levels throughout the community, one may proceed with a classification of the community into broad regions of generally consistent land uses and similar noise environments. Because these regions will be varying distances from identified major noise sources, the relative levels of environmental noise will be different from one another. Therefore, subsequent enforcement efforts and miti gating measures may be oriented towards maintaining quiet areas and improving noisy ones. Step 6: Directing attention once again to the major noise sources previously identified, it is essential to gather operations and activity data in order to proceed with the analytical noise exposure prediction. This data is somewhat source -specific but generally should consist of the following information and be supplied by the owner/operator of the source: 1. Average daily level of activity (traffic volume, flights per day, hours of operation, etc.). 2. Distribution of activity over day and night time periods, days of the week, and seasonal variations. 3. Average noise level emitted by the source at various levels of activity. 4. Precise source location and proximi ty to noise -impacted land uses. 5. Composition of noise sources (percentage of trucks on highway, aircraft fleet mix, industrial machinery type, etc.). Step 7: In addition to collecting data on the variables affecting noise -source emission for the existin g case, future values for these parameters need to be assessed. This is best accomplished by correlating the noise element with other general plan elements (i.e. land use, circulation, housing, etc.) and regional transportation plans and by coordination wi th other responsible agencies (Airport Land Use Commission, Caltrans, etc.). Step 8: Analytical noise exposure modeling techniques may be utilized to develop source -specific noise contours around major noise sources in the community. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 391 \"The noise contour s shall be prepared on the basis of noise monitoring or following generally accepted noise modeling techniques...\" (\u00a765302(f)) Simplified noise prediction methodologies are available through the Department of Health Services for highway and freeway noise, railroad noise, simple fixed stationary and industrial sites, and general aviation aircraft (with less than twenty percent commercial jet aircraft activity \u2014 two engine jet only). Noise contours for larger airport facilities and major industrial sites are sufficiently complex that they must be developed via sophisticated computer techniques available through recognized acoustical consulting firms. (Airport contours generally have already been developed in accordance with requirements promulgated by Caltrans' Division of Aeronautics: Noise Standards, Title 21, Section 5000, et seq., California Code of Regulations.) Although considerable effort may go into developing noise contours that, in some instances, utilize rather sophisticated digital programming techni ques, the present state of the art is such that their accuracy is usually no better than +/ - 3 dB. In fact, the accuracy of the noise exposure prediction decreases with increasing distance from the noise source. In the near vicinity of the source, predicti on accuracy may be within the range of +/ - 1 dB, while at greater distances this may deteriorate to +/ - 5 dB or more. At greater distances, meteorological and topographic effects, typically not totally accounted for in most models, may have significant inf luence. Thus , while dealing with the concept of noise contours, it is best not to think of them as absolute lines of demarcation on a map (such as topographical contours), but rather as bands of similar noise exposure. In addition to assessment of the pres ent-day noise environment, it is recommended that the noise exposure data be projected through the time horizon of the general plan. The noise element should be updated and corrected every five years, or sooner as is necessary, and, at that time, the forec asted noise exposure should be projected an additional five years. Phase B: Noise -Compatible Land Use Planning A noise planning policy needs to be rather flexible and dynamic to reflect not only technological advances in noise control, but also economic constraints governing application of noise -control technology and anticipated regional growth and demands of the community. In the final analysis, each community must decide the level of noise exposure its residents are willing to tolerate within a limited range of values below the known levels of health impairment. Step 9: Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 392 Given the definition of the existing and forecasted noise environment provided by the Phase A efforts, the locality preparing the noise element must now approach the problem of definin g how much noise is too much. Guidelines for noise -compatible land use are presented in Figure 2. The adjustment factors given in Table 1 may be used in order to arrive at noise -acceptability standards that reflect the noise -control goals of the community, the particular community's sensitivity to noise (as determined in Step 2), and the community's assessment of the relative importance of noise pollution. Step 10: As a prerequisite to establishing an effective noise -control program, it is essential to k now, in quantitative terms, the extent of noise problems in the community. This is best accomplished by determining, for each major noise source around which noise contours have been developed, the number of community residents exposed and to what extent. It is also useful to identify those noise -sensitive land uses whose noise exposure exceeds the recommended standards given in Figure 2. The exposure inventory can be accomplished by using recent census data, adjusted for regional growth, and tabulating the population census blocks within given noise contours. Step 11: Once the noise exposure inventory is completed, the relative significance of specific noise sources in the community (in terms of population affected) will become apparent. The local agencies involved may wish to use this information to orient their noise -control and abatement efforts to achieve the most good. Clearly, control of certain major offending sources will be beyond the jurisdiction of local agencies; however, recognition of these li mitations should prompt more effective land use planning strategies. Step 12: A major objective of the noise element is to utilize this information to ensure noise -compatible land use planning: \"The noise contours shall be used as a guide for establishi ng a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise.\" (\u00a765302(f)) The intent of such planning is to: Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 393 (1) Maintain those areas deemed acceptable in terms of noise exposure. (2) Use zoning o r other land use controls in areas with excessive noise exposure to limit uses to those which are noise compatible and to restrict other, less compatible uses. Phase C: Noise Mitigation Measures Step 13: Based upon the relative importance of noise source s in order of community impact and local attitudes towards these sources, \"[t]he noise element shall include implementation measures and possible solutions that address existing and foreseeable noise problems, if any\" (\u00a765302(f)). Selection of these noise -mitigating measures should be coordinated through all local agencies in order to be most effective. Minimization of noise emissions from all local government -controlled or sanctioned activities should be a priority item. This includes low noise specificati ons for new city or county owned and operated vehicles (and noise reduction retrofitting where economically possible) and noise emission limits on public works projects. Local governments should insure that public buildings (especially schools) are suffici ently insulated to allow their intended function to be uninterrupted by exterior noise. Local agencies can work with state and federal bodies to minimize transportation noise, primarily through transitway design, location, or configuration modifications. Additional measures might include such policies as limitation of siren usage by police, fire, and ambulance units within populated areas. Animal control units may be encouraged to minimize barking dog complaints through use of an improved public relations campaign termed \"Animal Philosophy.\" This involves working with pet owners to determine why the dog barks and attempting solutions rather than just issuing citations. Local zoning and subdivision ordinances may require the use of noise -reducing building ma terials or the installation of sound -insulating walls along major roads in new construction and subdivisions. In general, local noise reduction programs need to address the problems specific to each community, with the ultimate goals being the reduction o f complaint frequency and the provision of a healthful noise environment for all residents of the community. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 394 The remaining steps are beyond the scope of the noise element requirements, but pertain to coordination with other state noise -control programs an d achievement of the goals set forth in the noise element through development of an active local noise -control effort. Step 14: While the noise element identifies problem areas and seeks to develop medium - and long -range solutions to them, a community n oise ordinance is the only viable instrument for short -term or immediate solutions to intru sive noise. A model noise ordinance that can be tailored to the specific needs of a given community by simply incorporating those sections deemed most applicable has been developed by the Department of Health Ser vices. The model ordinance also suggests a cure for non -stationary or transient types of noise events, for which noise contours are generally meaningless. Phase D: Enforcement To adequately carry out the prog rams identified in the noise element and to comply with state requirements for certain other noise -control programs, specific enforcement programs are recommended at the local level. Step 15: Adopt and apply a community noise ordinance for resolution of noise complaints. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 395 Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 396 Step 16: Recent studies have shown that the most objectionable feature of traffic noise is the sound produced by vehicles equipped with illegal or faulty exhaust systems. In addition, such hot rod vehicles are often operated in a m anner that causes tire squeal and excessively loud exhaust noise. There are a number of statewide vehicle noise regulations that can be enforced by local authorities as well as the California Highway Patrol. Specifically, Sections 23130, 23130.5, 27150, Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 397 27151, and 38275 of the California Vehicle Code, as well as excessive speed laws, may be applied to curtail this problem. Both the Highway Patrol and the Department of Health Services (through local health departments) are available to aid local authorities in code enforcement and training pursuant to proper vehicle sound -level measurements. Step 17: Commercial and public airports operating under a permit from Caltrans' Aeronautics Program are required to comply with both state aeronautics standards govern ing aircraft noise and all applicable legislation governing the formation and activities of a local Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC). The function of the ALUC is, among other things, to develop a plan for noise-compatible land use in the immediate proxim ity of the airport. The local general plan must be reviewed for compatibility with this Airport Land Use Plan and amended if necessary (Public Utilities Code \u00a721676). Therefore, the developers of the noise element will need to coordinate their activities w ith the local ALUC to ensure that compatible standards are utilized throughout the community and that the noise element develops as part of a coherent master plan, of which the ALUP forms an integral component. Step 18: \"The adopted noise element shall serve as a guideline for compliance with the State's noise insulation standards.\" (\u00a765302(f)) Recognizing the need to provide acceptable habitation environments, state law requires noise insulation of new m ultifamily dwellings constructed within the 60 dB (CNEL or Ldn) noise exposure contours. It is a function of the noise element to provide noise contour information around all major sources in support of the sound transmission control standards (Appendix, Chapter 2 -35, Part 2, T itle 24, California Code of Regulations). RELATIONSHIP OF THE NOISE ELEMENT TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS The noise element is related to the land use, housing, circulation, and open -space elements. Recognition o f the interrelationship of noise and these four other mandated elements is Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 398 necessary in order to prepare an integrated general plan. The relationship between noise and these four elements is briefly discussed below. \u00a8 Land Use \u2014A key objective of the noise element is to provide noise exposure information for use in the land use element. When integrated with the noise element, the land use element will show acceptable land uses in relation to existing and projected noise contours. Section 65302(f) states tha t: \"The noise contours shall be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise.\" \u00a8 Housing \u2014The housing element considers the provision of adequate sites for new housing and standards for housing stock. Since residential land use is among the most noise sensitive, the noise exposure information provided in the noise element must be considered when planning the location of new housing. Also, state law requir es special noise insulation of new multifamily dwellings constructed within the 60 dB (CNEL or Ldn) noise exposure contour. This requirement may influence the location and cost of this housing type. In some cases, the noise environment may be a constraint on housing opportunities. \u00a8 Circulation \u2014The circulation system must be correlated with the land use element and is one of the major sources of noise. Noise exposure will thus be a decisive factor in the location and design of new transportation facilities and the possible mitigation of noise from existing facilities in relation to existing and planned land uses. The local planning agency may wish to review the circulation and land use elements simultaneously to assess their compatibility with the noise ele ment. \u00a8 Open Space \u2014Excessive noise can adversely affect the enjoyment of recreational pursuits in designated open space. Thus, noise exposure levels should be considered when planning for this kind of open -space use. Conversely, open space can be used to buffer sensitive land uses from noise source s through the use of setbacks and landscaping. Open -space designation can also effectively exclude other land uses from excessively noisy areas. SELECTION OF THE NOISE METRIC The community noise metrics to be used in noise elements are either CNEL or Ldn (as specified in \u00a765302(f)). A significant factor in the selection of these scales was compatibility with existing Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 399 quantifications of noise exposure currently in use in Califo rnia. CNEL is the noise metric currently specified in the State Aeronautics Code for evaluation of noise impacts at specific airports that have been declared to have a noise problem. Local compliance with state airport noise standards necessitates that com munity noise be specified in CNEL. The Ldn represents a logical simplification of CNEL. It divides the day into two weighted time periods (Day \u20147 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Night \u201410 p.m. to 7 a.m.) rather than the three used in the CNEL measure (Day \u20147 a.m. to 7 p.m., Evening \u20147 p.m. to 10 p.m., and Night \u201410 p.m. to 7 a.m.) with no significant loss in accuracy. CRITERIA FOR NOISE -COMPATIBLE LAND USE Figure 2 summarizes the suggested use of the CNEL/Ldn metrics for evaluati ng land use noise compatibility. Such criteria require a rather broad interpretation, as illustrated by the ranges of acceptability for a given land use within a defined range of noise exposures. Denotation of a land use as \"normally acceptable\" on Figure 2 implies that the highest noise level in that band is the maximum desirable for existing or conventional construction that does not incorporate any special acoustic treatment. In general, evaluation of land use that falls into the \"normally acceptable\" o r \"normally unacceptable\" noise environments should include consideration of the type of noise source, the sensitivity of the noise receptor, the noise reduction likely to be provided by structures, and the degree to which the noise source may interfere wi th speech, sleep, or other activities characteristic of the land use. Figure 2 also provides an interpretation as to the suitability of various types of construction with respect to the range of outdoor noise exposure. The objective of the noise compatibi lity guidelines in Figure 2 is to provide the community with a means of judging the noise environment it deems to be generally acceptable. Many efforts have been made to account for the variability in perceptions of environmental noise that exist between c ommunities and within a given community. Beyond the basic CNEL or Ldn quantification of noise exposure, one can apply correction factors to the measured or calculated values of these metrics in order to account for some of the factors that may cause the n oise to be more or less acceptable than the mean response. Significant among these factors are seasonal variations in noise source levels, existing outdoor ambient levels (i.e., relative intrusiveness of the source), general societal attitudes towards the Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 400 noise source, prior history of the source, and tonal characteristics of the source. When it is possible to evaluate some or all of these factors, the measured or computed noise exposure values may be adjusted by means of the correction factors listed in T able 1 in order to more accurately assess local sentiments towards acceptable noise exposure. In developing these acceptability recommendations, efforts were made to maintain consistency with the goals defined in the federal EPA's \"Levels Document\" and th e State Sound Transmission Control Standards for multifamily housing. In both of these documents, an interior noise exposure of 45 dB CNEL (or Ldn) is recommended to permit normal residential activity. If one considers the typical range of noise reduction provided by residential dwellings (12 to 18 dB with windows partially open), the 60 dB outdoor value identified as \"clearly acceptable\" for residential land use would provide the recommended interior environment. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 401 Figure 3 has been included in order to better explain the qualitative nature of community noise environments expressed in terms of Ldn. It is apparent that noise environments cover a broad range and that, in general, it may be observed that the quality of the environment improves as one moves f urther away from major transportation noise sources.

Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 403 Appendix E: Tools and Resources Appendix F: Glossary: Defining the Parts of a General Plan A general plan is made up of text describin g goals and objectives, principles, standards, and plan proposals, as well as a set of maps and diagrams. Together, these constituent parts paint a picture of the community's future development. The following discussions help to clarify the meanings of the se and other important terms. Development Policy A development policy is a general plan statement that guides action. In a broad sense, development policies include goals and objectives, principles, policies, standards, and plan proposals. Diagram A diagram is a graphic expression of a general plan's development policies, particularly its plan proposals. Many types of development policies lend themselves well to graphic treatment, such as the distribution of land use s, urban design, infrastructure, and geologic and other natural hazards. A diagram must be consistent with the general plan text (\u00a765300.5) and should have the same long -term planning perspective as the rest of the general plan. The Attorney General has ob served that \"...when the Legislature has used the term 'map,' it has required preciseness, exact location, and detailed boundaries....\" as in the case of the Subdivision Map Act. No such precision is required of a general plan dia gram ( 67 Cal.Ops.Atty.Gen. 75,77 ). As a general rule, a diagram or diagrams, along with the general plan's text, should be detailed enough so that the users of the plan, whether staff, elected and appointed officials, or the public, can reach the same gene ral conclusion on the appropriate use of any parcel of land at a particular phase of a city's or county's physical development. Decision -makers should also be able to use a general plan, including its diagram or diagrams, in coordinating day-to-day land us e and infrastructure decisions with the city's or county's future physical development scheme. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 404 At the same time, given the long -term nature of a general plan, its diagram or diagrams and text should be general enough to allow a degree of flexibility in dec ision-making as times change. For example, a general plan may recognize the need for and desirability of a community park in a proposed residential area, but the precise location of the park may not be known when the plan is adopted. The plan would not nee d to pinpoint the location, but it should have a generalized diagram along with policies saying that the park site will be selected and appropriate zoning applied at the time the area is subdivided. In this sense, while zoning must be consistent with the g eneral plan, the plan's diagram or diagrams and the zoning map are not required to be identical. Goal A goal is a general direction -setter. It is an ideal future end related to the public health, safety, or general welfare. A goal is a general expression of community values and, therefore, may be abstract in nature. Consequently, a goal is generally not quantifiable or time-dependent. Although goals are not mentioned in the description of general plan contents in \u00a765302, they are included here f or several reasons. First, defining goals is often the initial step of a comprehensive planning process, with more specific objectives defined later, as discussed in Chapter 3. Second, goals are specifically mentioned in the statutes governing housing element contents (\u00a765583). Third, while the terms \"goal\" and \"objective\" are used interchangeably in some general plans, many plans differentiate between broad, unquantifiable goals and specific objectives. Either approach is allowable, as flexibility is a characteristic of the general plan. Examples of goals: Quiet residential streets A diversified economic base for the city An aesthetically pleasing community A safe community Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 405 Goals should be expressed as ends, not actions. For instance, the first example a bove expresses an end, namely, \"quiet residential streets.\" It does not say, \"Establish quiet residential streets\" or \"To establish quiet residential streets.\" Objective An objective is a specified end, condition, or state that is an inter mediate step toward attaining a goal. It should be achievable and, when possible, measurable and time -specific. An objective may pertain to one particular aspect of a goal or it may be one of several successive steps toward goal achievement. Consequently, there may be more than one objective for each goal. Examples of objectives: The addition of 100 affordable housing units over the next five years. A 25 percent increase in downtown office space by 20 30. A 50 percent reduction in the rate of farmland con version over the next ten years. A reduction in stormwater runoff from streets and parking lots. Principle A principle is an assumption, fundamental rule, or doctrine guiding general plan policies, proposals, standards, and implementation measures. Principles are based on community values, generally accepted planning doctrine, current technology, and the general plan's objectives. In practice, principles underlie the process of developing the plan but seldom need to be explicitly stated in the plan itself. Examples of principles: Mixed use encourages urban vitality. The residential neighborhoods within a city should be within a convenient and safe walking distance of an elementary school. Parks provide recreational and aesthetic benefits. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 406 Risks from natural hazards should be identified and avoided to the extent practicable. Policy A policy is a specific statement that guides decision -making. It indicates a commitment of the local legislative body to a particular course of actio n. A policy is based on and helps implement a general plan's objectives. A policy is carried out by implementation measures. For a policy to be useful as a guide to action it must be clear and unambiguous. Adopting broadly drawn and vague policies is poor practice. Clear policies are particularly important when it comes to judging whether or not zoning decisions, subdivisions, public works projects, etc., are consistent with the general plan. When writing policies, be aware of the difference between \"shall \" and \"should.\" \"Shall\" indicates an unequivocal directive. \"Should\" signifies a less rigid directive, to be honored in the absence of compelling or contravening considerations. Use of the word \"should\" to give the impression of more commitment than actual ly intended is a common but unacceptable practice. It is better to adopt no policy than to adopt a policy with no backbone. Solid policy is based on solid information. The analysis of data collected during the planning process provides local officials wit h the knowledge about trends, existing conditions, and projections that they need to formulate policy. If projected community conditions are not in line with a general plan's objectives, local legislative bodies may adopt policies that will help bring abou t a more desirable future. Examples of policies: The city shall not approve a parking ordinance variance unless the variance pertains to the rebuilding of an unintentionally destroyed non -conforming use. The city shall not approve plans for the downtown s hopping center until an independently conducted market study indicates that the center would be economically feasible. Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 407 The ci ty shall give favorable consideration to conditional use permit proposals involving adaptive reuse o f buildings that are designated as \"architecturally significant\" by the cultural resources element. Standards A standard is a rule or measure establishing a level of quality or quantity that must be complied with or satisfied. Standards define the abstract terms of objectives and policies with concrete specifications. The Government Code makes various references to general plan standards. For example, \u00a765302(a) states in part that the land use element must \"...include a statement of the standards of population density an d building intensity recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan.\" Other examples of statutory references to general plan standards include those found in \u00a766477 (the Quimby Act) and \u00a766479 (reservations o f land within subdivisions). Of course, a local legislature may adopt any other general plan standards it deems desirable. Examples of standards: High-density residential means 20 to 30 dwelling units per acre and up to 41 dwelling units per acre with a d ensity bonus. The first floor of all new construction shall be at least two feet above the base flood elevation. Plan Proposal A plan proposal describes the development intended to take place in an area. Plan proposals are often expres sed on the general plan diagram. Examples of plan proposals: Draft Document Draft for Public Comment 408 First Street and Harbor Avenue are designated as arterials. The proposed downtown shopping center will be located within the area bound by D and G Avenues and Third and Fourth Streets. A new par king structure shall be located in the vicinities of each of the following downtown intersections: First Street and A Avenue, and Fifth Street and D Avenue. Implementation Measure An implementation measure is an action, procedure, program, or technique that carries out general plan policy. Each policy must have at least one corresponding implementation measure. Examples of implementation measures: The city shall adopt a specific plan for the indus trial park. Areas designated by the land use element for agriculture shall be placed in the agricultural zone.
