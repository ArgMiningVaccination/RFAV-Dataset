[Ramdev](/topic/ramdev), who invited wrath from several quarters last year over his remarks on [allopathy](/topic/allopathy), has once again questioned the efficacy of [allopathic medicines](/topic/allopathic-medicines)against Ramdev said that vaccination alone is not enough to protect people from the virus and that they need to be supplemented with yoga and Ayurveda. \"Without the support of yoga and Ayurveda, no vaccine can immunise you permanently against coronavirus, no matter how big you are, a president or a big doctor yourself,\" Ramdev said. \"Top officials of WHO have also fallen victims to COVID,\" he said, PTI reported. He also claimed the world is being misled by medical science in the name of [vaccines](/topic/vaccines). \"The world will return to yoga and ayurveda again. People are growing tulsi, aloe vera and giloy in their kitchen gardens and reaping their health benefits,\" Ramdev said. He made the remarks on the sidelines of an event in response to a question on why US President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID even after taking the booster dose of the vaccine. The Yoga guru had come under sharp criticism last year and drew flak from the medical fraternity for his remarks against the allopathic medicines. Ramdev, however, had withdrawn his statements later after receiving a letter from then Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan who had called his remarks as \"inappropriate\". In a strongly-worded letter to Ramdev on Sunday, Vardhan had said his remarks on allopathic medicine were \"extremely unfortunate\". \"The statement disrespects the corona warriors and hurt the sentiments of the country. Your statement on allopathy can break the morale of healthcare workers and weaken our fight against COVID-19,\" he said. Vardhan further said allopathic medicines have saved lives of crores and comments that the drugs are responsible for death of lakhs is \"extremely unfortunate\". Withdrawing his remarks, Ramdev said he respects all forms of medical science and allopathy doctors have saved people during the pandemic by risking their own lives. \"I accept that allopathy has shown remarkable progress in life-saving system (jeevan raksha pranali) and surgery and has served humanity,\" he said. Commenting on the video in question, Ramdev said he was actually reading out messages forwarded on WhatsApp. \"...if that has hurt sentiments of anyone, then I regret it,\" he added. Several FIRs were also lodged against the yoga guru by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Bihar and Chhattisgarh.
