Key Facts Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory infection that typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but can lead to serious lung infections\u2014children, older adults and those with underlying health conditions are the most susceptible, [according](https://medlineplus.gov/respiratorysyncytialvirusinfections.html) to MedlinePlus. The virus gained momentum during the winter season, causing 47.9 for every 100,000 [hospitalizations](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/dashboard.html) during the 2022-2023 season, and over 126,000 detected [cases](https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/rsv-surges-early-in-2022-but-appears-to-make-early-retreat) between October 2022 and November 2022. Prominent [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/about/symptoms.html) include a runny nose, cough, fever, wheezing, decrease in appetite and sneezing, but infants may only show irritability, have breathing difficulties or decreased activity. No RSV vaccine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the first [attempt](https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-policy-and-standards/standards-and-specifications/vaccine-standardization/respiratory-syncytial-virus-disease) was made in the 1960s, which was unsuccessful as it led to severe and lethal cases of lung inflammatory response in infants. [According](https://www.path.org/resources/rsv-and-mab-trial-tracker/) to public health nonprofit PATH, there are 11 RSV vaccines being studied in trials\u2014four are designed for infants and seven are for older adults. [According](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-rsv-vaccine-82-effective-vs-severe-infection-infants-final-data-shows-2023-04-05/) to findings published in early April, Pfizer's RSV vaccine is 82% effective at protecting infants from severe infections when given to pregnant mothers in the second half of their pregnancies. Pfizer and GSK's RSV vaccines were approved by the FDA in May, and the CDC recommended them for seniors 60 years and up on June 29, [citing](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/acip-scdm-faqs.html#scdm) \"shared clinical decision-making.\" The CDC stated these vaccines are expected to be available this fall, when RSV cases are predicted to rise. News Peg Nirsevimab, Sanofi and AstraZeneca's RSV shot for infants received [unanimous backing](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2023-08-3.html) from an advisory committee to the CDC on August 3. This comes almost two months after an FDA advisory committee unanimously [recommended](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2023/2023-06-08-21-19-00-2685235) the shot. A Sanofi spokesperson told NBC News the company was ready to release the shot before RSV season this fall. Surprising Fact Almost all children will have had an RSV infection by their second birthday, and most infections go away on their own, [according](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/about/symptoms.html) to the CDC. Crucial Quote Dr. Barney Graham, a senior adviser for global health equity at Morehouse School of Medicine, told NBC News he believes all the vaccines \"are going to work well enough to be approved, depending on the side effect profiles.\" Vaccines For Older Adults (60 And Up) - GLAXOSMITHKLINE'S phase three trial [study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2209604)on the GSK vaccine's efficiency, as published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, found the shot lowered the risk of severe illness by 94% and of symptomatic illness by 83% in adults 60 years and older. Participants with [comorbidities](https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/data_statistics/comorbidities.htm)(having more than one disease or illness at a time), who are at an increased risk of severe outcome from RSV, also saw positive results from the vaccine. The most common adverse events from the shot were pain at injection site, fatigue, headache and [myalgia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/myalgia)(muscle aches and pain). - Johnson & Johnson's vaccine phase two trial [report](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2207566)published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday saw an 80% vaccine efficiency rate in adults 65 years and older. The study's main goal was preventing the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infection as a result of RSV, and the protection ranged from 80% in preventing lower respiratory tract infections, and 70% for milder cases. Serious adverse events were reported in 4.6% of vaccine participants and 4.7% of the placebo group. - Moderna's vaccine for older adults is a [messenger RNA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00126-w)(mRNA) vaccine, similar to its Covid shot. The vaccine uses mRNA, which helps give instructions to the body's cells, allowing them to create small parts of the RSV virus that creates an immune response in the body. In January, Moderna [announce](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Announces-mRNA-1345-an-Investigational-Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-RSV-Vaccine-Has-Met-Primary-Efficacy-Endpoints-in-Phase-3-Trial-in-Older-Adults/default.aspx)d findings from a trial, which found the vaccine to be 83.7% effective at protecting against RSV-related lower respiratory tract infection. The FDA [granted](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-Granted-FDA-Breakthrough-Therapy-Designation-for-mRNA-1345-An-Investigational-Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-RSV-Vaccine-Candidate/default.aspx)the shot breakthrough therapy designation at the end of January. Vaccines For The Elderly And Infants - Pfizer [reports](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-positive-top-line-data-phase-3-trial-older)its RSV vaccine reduced the risk of severe illness in older adults by 86%. In November 2022, the company [announced](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-positive-top-line-data-phase-3-global)findings from a trial that instead administered the shot to pregnant people. The vaccine was 82% effective against severe illness in infants during their first 90 days of life, and 69% effective for up to six months. Pfizer is the only company preparing an RSV vaccine for older adults and for infants through maternal immunization. The FDA accepted Pfizer's bid for priority review of its RSV vaccine in December 2022. Vaccines/treatment For Infants - Sanofi and AstraZeneca's injection isn't technically a vaccine, however, it would work the same. It is a [monoclonal antibody injection](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/monoclonal-antibody)(a lab made protein used to bind to certain targets of the body to fight infection) for infants up to 24 months. The vaccine (labeled as Beyfortus and generic name nirsevimab) [showed](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2023/2023-01-05-07-00-00-2583365)an 80% protection rate against severe illness in babies. It was granted [approval](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2022/2022-11-04-07-00-00-2548492)by the European Commission in November 2022, and the FDA [accepted](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2023/nirsevimab-us-regulatory-submission-accepted-for-the-prevention-of-rsv-lower-respiratory-tract-disease-in-infants-and-children.html)its submission for biologics license application in January. - SOBI's monoclonal antibody injection Synagis (generic name palivizumab) is similar to Sanofi and AstraZeneca because it also technically isn't a vaccine, though it's administered to high risk infants to protect against RSV. It was [approved](https://cms.centerwatch.com/directories/1067-fda-approved-drugs/listing/4243-synagis-palivizumab)by the FDA in 1998 while it was still manufactured by AstraZeneca (the company [transferred](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2018/astrazeneca-to-divest-us-synagis-rights-to-sobi131120180.html#modal-historic-confirmation)vaccine rights to SOBI in 2019). Infants are only [qualified](https://www.synagis.com/index.html)for treatment if they meet at least one of these requirements: they were born prematurely and are six months old or less at the start of RSV season, they were born with certain types of heart conditions and are 24 months or less at the start of RSV season, or they have a chronic lung condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia, that needed medical attention within the last six months and they are 24 months or less at the start of RSV season.
