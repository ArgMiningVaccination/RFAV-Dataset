Recorded May 18, 2017. Updated November 28, 2017. Contact the Montana Asthma Control Program at asthmainfo@mt.gov for more information. Dr. George: ( recording starts mid -sentence) a topic that we talk about, complementary and alternative medicines for asthma and allergy, because when our patients feel that the things that we're offering them don't provi de a solution for their symptoms, their discomfort, or their, you know, preferences, then they go ahead and they reach out to other kinds of things. So, I think it will be interesting to talk about what patients are using while they're using complementary and alternative medicines and could or should you do anything about it. S o, for conflict -of-interest, I have one to declare, which will not have anything to do with today's presentation, the objectives for today are listed here, we're going to look at what is meant by the different terms complementary alternative and integrative medicine, look at the most recent data that we have in terms of trends for CAM use for asthma, and the most common types of CAM used for asthma and allergic rhinitis. We'll look at resources that I'm working on right now to assist providers in taking a comprehensive CAM history and then wind up with a few strategies for how you might consider supporting the use of complementary alternative medicine within a patient -centered care model, as well as resources that are available to you to evaluate safety and effectiveness of different things that your patients may be using. So, to start, what's in a name when we're talking about complementary medicine. We're typically talking about those things that are unconventional non -prescription practices that have some kind of an evidence -base and are used along with conventional biomedical or pharmacologic approaches. We reserved the term alternative medicine to describe unconventional non -prescription practices that may or may not have been evidence -based, but they are primarily characterized by the fact that they're used instead of or to replace conventional biomedical or pharmacologic management approaches. The term that's really kind of hot now , in the buzz, is integrative medicine. I provided a definition here for you from the Bravewell Organization saying that it is healing -oriented care that puts the patient at the center and addresses the full range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and environmental influences that affect that person's health, and when we use it in terms of our clinical practice we're really describing the purposeful coordination of the use of our conventional pharmacologics and behavioral approaches along w ith complimentary or evidence -based complimentary practices. So, just to kind of set the stage I'm going to go all the way back to some early work from a medical anthropologist who hails from Harvard who reminds us that patients have more than just a heal thcare professional option when they develop a cluster of symptoms or have a new diagnosis. They may have their own cultural or traditional healing that really is influenced by their worldview, or they may be influenced by what they see in the popular cult ure, so what is on social media or what they see on TV or other kinds of methods of communication. And, the most important thing to remember is that although Page 2 o f 10 we live in a country in which there is a lot of biomedical or pharmacologic management, the World Health Organization estimated in 2002 that about 80% of the world healthcare is alternative and only 20% is pharmacologic or biomedically oriented. So, that means that as we're seeing increasing diversity in our patient populations we are more likely to be interacting with patients who have an orientation to health that would fall on the more alternative spectrum. The other thing that's also important to be reminded about is that Dr. Kleinman not only tells us that there's three different ways that we may - four options rather- that we might have available to us in terms of healthcare. The healthcare professional, the traditional or cultural or alternative, what we see on social media, but we need to remember that often patients will turn first to their comm unity or what they see in social media and only when that fails will they turn to the healthcare professional. So, the hierarchy of resort, meaning who do you go to first and who do you go to when you exhaust all of your approaches that you've used to mana ge it yourself, may be two different things. So, the most recent information that we have on the prevalence of CAM use comes from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey data and for this survey, data are collected every five years. We can see for adult s they've been asking about the frequency of CAM use for the last three surveys and there's been no statistically significant differences. About one third of the adult population in the United States uses complementary or alternative medicine. They didn't ask that question in 2002 for children but what we know from 2007 into 2012 survey data is that about 11% of children, again holding steady, are reporting that they use CAM. But, what's really interesting comes from some of this new 2012 deep dive into the NHIS data. If you simply ask a healthy child in the first column on the far left whether or not they've used any CAM in the last year, about 12% said yes, they did, and if they had at least one medical condition this goes up to about 15%, or if they had two or more medical conditions this went up to 17%. Then, they change the question slightly and for those children who reported respiratory, eczema, allergies, pain, or GI problems, and again these are specifically included, the pain and GI is specifically around food allergy questions, you can see that if you asked if you have these conditions have you used any CAM in the last year to treat these conditions, the numbers shoot up to about 60, 65%. So, by slightly changing the question we get a much greater a ppreciation for the extent of CAM use, and this is in children and we expect to see the same in adults. I'm going to kind of go through a bunch of the NHIS survey data and then try and spend the majority of the time concentrating on those therapies that ar e specific to asthma, so if you bear with me through some of the next few slides - What you can see here is the ten most common complimentary health care approaches among adults in 2012 and you can see that the top six are natural products, deep breathing things that would use movement or meditation, mind -body l ike yoga, tai chi, chiropractic care, meditation, and massage, and when we look at the top 10 most common a pproach issues by children many of them are the same natural products, chiropractic care, yog a, tai chi, but here you start to see deep breathing homeopathy and meditation coming in, but these numbers are much smaller. Page 3 of 10 If we look at adults again, we're seeing that as many as 18 percent are using natural products, but for children when we ask that question it's only about 5 percent of children. When you look a t the types of natural products that adults and children are using, the ones that we're going to be talking about today that are specific to asthma and allergies include omega 3 fatty acids, p robiotics, echinacea, and ginseng. And for children again y ou see smaller numbers with the same pattern of natural product use. In terms of mind -body therapies, you can see that a dults are using primarily yoga, chiropractic care, medi tation, and massage, and tw o smaller numbers but a similar pattern for children. Now, this is not really an insignificant out -of-pocket cost t o the family, although about 50 billion dollars was spent in out-of-pocket physician visits, about a third o f that amount, about $15 bil lion with complementary practitioners, and out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs is about $55 billion, and again not inco nsequential natural products is about $13 billion, and when we consider adults and children, adults here on the left and childre n on the right, not only are their out-of-pocket costs on practitioner visit and natural products suppl ement but also on self -care, on procedure s, and when we're talking about self - care we're really talking about vitamins and herbs, special diets, group members hip, things like that, so about another $2 billion for self- care in adult and 500 million for children. You might think that this is something that is so costly that only those individ uals with expendable income can pay for it, but surprisingly, even the lowest levels of family income are spendi ng significant amount of money, $435 on average, on complementary health approach es, which is not much less than what indi viduals with the highest income levels are spending, and the problem with that when we th ink about that is that means th at there is a risk that they're spending money on complementary ther apies and not on co -pays to get pharmacologic prescription therapies. So, let's now turn to the specific asthma and allerg y treatment. About 8% of adults and 1% o f US children report the use of omega -3 fatty acids. Omega- 3 fatty acids are a group of polyunsaturated fatty acids in fatty fis h, and that's the salmon, tuna, sardin es, mackerel, trout, as well as vegetabl e oils. Now most vegetable oils are omega -6 like avocado, corn, and sunflow er, so when we're talking about omeg a- 3 we're talking more like the canola oils or olive oil, which has a better ratio of omega -3 to omega -6. It also includes the dietary consumption of things like walnuts, flaxseed, and leafy veget ables. The omega - 3 supplements, primarily fish oil supplements, have been studied for both prevention and treatment of allergies and asthma, but no conclus ions can be drawn about whether they' re helpful for these conditions based on w hat we currently know, and this come s from the website noted on the right han d side, the National Center for Comple mentary and Integrative Health, which is part of the National Institutes of Healt h. Although we have moderate evid ence for the health benefits of eating s eafood and we know that omega -3 fatty acids usually don't have much in the way of negative side effects, when side effects occur they tend to be things of a GI nature like diarrhea, burping, heartburn, bloating, maybe some abdomi nal pain, we know that we don 't want ind ividuals to be using fish liver oils, which are not the same as fish oils. The fish liver oils contain high levels of vitamin A and D which could be toxic, and w e're not certain Page 4 of 10 whether people w ith fish or shellfish allergies ca n safely consume these fish oil supplem ents, and we know that they may interact with nonsteroidals and blood t hinners to increase the risk of ble eding. We don't have, as I said before, the evidence that they really are helpful in asthma and allergy. Something else that a lot of individuals are turning to in the way of asthma and allergies are probiotics and prebiotics. About 1.5% of adults and about 0.5% of children are using pro or prebiotics. These are live microo rganisms like bacteria that are the same as or very similar to the normal organisms in the human body, and when we're talking about prebiotics we're talking about the dietary subs tances that favor the growth of t hese good bacteria over the bad bacter ia. Another term you may not be fam iliar with is synbiotics, whi ch are pro ducts that contain both pro and prebio tics. They've been specifically focusing on the examination of the role of probiotics in the prevention or treatment o f atopic dermatitis, eczema, or allergic rhinitis. They have a good safety re cord and they have, again, mild digestive symptoms . In particular, here gas seem s to be a common complaint, and we also h ave information mostly from two strains of probiotic, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. If you're going to use these probiotics most people recomme nd the live refrigerated strains, or there 's one over -the- counter product that has a lot of Lactobacillus GG, which goes by the trade name Culturelle. The typical way that it is gi ven I can describe when we look at how th ey've been studied in pregnancy and breastfeeding. In these studies , typically pregnant women were, breastfeedi ng women, were given one to ten billion units three to four times a day for two to four weeks pre -delivery and up to six months after delivery during the period of exclusive breas tfeeding, and w e have some information that in this one study, 159 pregnant women who had fa mily history of eczema who were randomized to receive either lactobacillus or placebo befo re their delivery date and then chose to bre astfeed for at least six month s exclu sively noted a 50% reduction in eczema in the first two years and now follow ing them four years after birth they h ave significantly, again in the lactob acillus GG group, significantly lowe r rates of atopic dermatitis or eczema. Some other smaller st udies that you c an find either in MEDLINE or in this review by Golden and Gorbach inc lude a study of 27 infants with eczema randomized to two different strains of the probiotics versus a placebo and given a supplemental formula had improv ed eczema. 31 infants with atopic dermatitis eliminated the cow's milk and then received probiotic verses a placebo in a supplemental formula and again those who got the lactobacillus had significantly improved atopic dermatitis. A smaller study of bifidobacterium animalis reduced the severity of eczema, an d a combination of freeze -dried lactobac illus reduced atopic dermatitis symptom s in children b etween the ages of 1 and 13, so what to make of that? Although previous studies have shown that probiotics are likely effective for the prevention of diarrhea, the MEDLINE national libraries of medi cine website is indicating that there's a signal suggesting that probioti cs may be possibly effective in atopic dermatitis. Another interesting natural treatment includes the us e of Ech inacea. About one percent of adults and 0.4%of children in the US report the use of Echinacea, which is made from the common coneflower. Typically, it's given as an oral preparation to treat upper respiratory infections or topically for skin Page 5 of 10 problems and u sually when it's taken by mouth it doesn't cause any problems, although there have been some allergic reactions like rashes, asthma attacks, and even anaphylaxis. The reason for this seems to be in those individuals who are ragweed -sensitive because Echina cea is in the sa me daisy family, which includes ragwee d. They're at increased risk of these severe side effects. Asian ginseng was also one of the most common natural products use and it's believed mechanism o f action is the immune response stimul ation. I ts short -term use in recommended amounts appears be safe, and this is specific to Asian g inseng and does not include the Ameri can or Siberian varieties. Some experts recommend against its use by infants, children, pregnant, or breastfeeding women, and some evidence suggests that it might have deleterious effects on blood su gar and blood pressure as well. As for long -term use, currently there's no conclusive evidence sup porting any health benefits and particularly not any in allergy or asthma. And t he last s pecific intervention I want to talk about is the use of differe nt breathing techniques and one in particular is an approach called hyperv entilation reduction breathing. Ther e's been -- AHRQ, the Agency for Health and Research Q uality, which is a gove rnmenta l agency, has released a systema tic review that identified that in adults the techniques to train individuals who are chronically hyperventilating to decrease their respiratory rate has resulted in fewer asthma symptoms and less use of albuterol rescue inh aler with no changes in PFTs. The two most common hyperv entilation reduction techniques are known as But eyko, which is more popular in the US, and Papworth, which is more popu lar in the UK and in Australia. In a ddition, this systematic review identified th at for adults, yoga may be helpfu l in improving primary function and in decreasing asthma symptoms but none of thes e findings have been replicated in children. There are drug herb interactions to consider if you have individuals who are using traditional Chinese medicin e and going to an herbalist who is actually giving the raw root. There is a traditional Chinese medicine root called ma huang which actually contains natural ephedra, which can have synergistic cardiovascular effects when used with albuterol or with caffeine, and we just saw just this week that a child and teenager died from the overuse of caffeinated beverages, and I be lieve it was the southeast US. Ephedr a compound would increase these kinds of risks. And, if you're using licorice root, n ot the candy but the actual root, we k now that there is the risk th at the use of licorice root can prolong the half -life of cortisone, potentia ting the systemic effect. Other risks for C AM and asthma are the ones that I'm particularly intereste d in, including risky home and traditional remed ies. So, there are case reports of individuals and cultural approaches to the tr eatment of asthma that includes the ingestion of thin gs like turpentine and , very commonly in African- American and Latino populations , the ingestion of Vicks Vapor ub. There's been at least three c hild deaths associated with the ingestion of things like camphorated menthol products. In indigenous American Indian populations there have been acute asthma exaggerations as a result of being expose d to smokehouses or sweating ceremonies. Page 6 of 10 But the thing that we' re primarily concerned about is that when we know that individuals have other approaches to managing asthma they often d elay initiating their albuterol do sing for acute asthma. They may actually substitute their alternative medicine s for either their albuterol or inh aled corticosteroids, and other studies have shown that if you're a CAM user you're more likely to use less of your prescription medicine and keep less of your appointments with you r medical provider. Now a few things specific to CAM and allergic rhinitis. One of the treatments that has gotten a lot of interest lately is t he use of butterbur, which is a natural product. They have been reporting the use of the root or leaf extracts as helpful for allergic rhinitis, but it has not been pr oven in the clinical trials that we have to date to be helpful for eith er eczema or asthma, so this is spe cific to allergic rhinitis. The butter bur must be processed to remove these specific pyrrolizidine alkaloids which can cause liver damage and result in serious illness, s o the product has to be labeled as or certified as PA -free. Several studies, including some that included children and adolescents, found that the short -term use of butterbur was wel l tolerated and safe. It's typically prescribe d as a leaf extract, dose 8 milligrams three times a day, or as a whole root extract, dose 50 milligrams two times a day. But, you d o need to be careful because we don't have much information about its use afte r about four months of treatment and we do know that butterbur is also in\\ the Daisy family so there's the pot ential for the exacerbations or anaphylaxis as we've seen with Echinacea . Anothe r area of interest for allergic rhinitis has bee n grapeseed extrac t. It c ontains an antioxidant and its presumed mechanism of action is an anti -inflammatory mechanism. It seems to be well t olerated when taken in moderate amounts for up to 14 weeks but there's only one single randomized control trial in allergic rhinitis, which did not demonstrate any efficacy. Quercetin is a plant pigment or a flavonoid that is found in lots of different products and it ha s antioxidant anti- inflammatory effects. Typically, people will use this for allergic rhinitis at a dose of 500 millig rams once a day to twice a day. There is only one pre/post open -label trial, which used it in a combination with food supplements in 23 adults. Everyth ing else that appears in public PubMed is really on the basic science so we really don't have much knowl edge abou t it, its use, and particularly its safet y and efficacy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. One last area of interest has been on the use of capsaicin. For ca psaicin, the trade name for the nas al spray is Sinus Blast Buster, capsaicin is derive d from red peppers and it's known for its desensitizing peptidergic sensory C -fibers and nasal hyperreactivity reduction. There's so me information about its use. A small trial, again randomized, of 42 patients with allergic and non -allergic rhinitis. It was compared in addition with a menthol eucalyptus twice a day for two weeks and c ompared to placebo in the study by Dr. Bernstein. He was able to show that there was a statistically significant greater reduction in total nasal symptoms score, which include d nasal c ongestion, improvement in sinus pain, press ure, and headache. It was given as one spray in each nostril twice daily. In addition, treatment with the capsaicin was associated with no greater risk of adverse effects and these include d things like na sal congestion, headaches, p ost-nasal drainage, rhinorrhea, stinging, burning, blood, and mucus. Page 7 of 10 It should be said that in this one study, although there was improvement in the total nasal symptom score, there was no reduct ion in sneezing, rhinorrhea, or post nasal drip. In a syste matic review from the Cochrane group, capsaicin appears to have a ben eficial effect on overall nasal symptoms up to 36 weeks after treatment, based on a few low quality small studies. So, some c ommon -sense recommendations. If you don't know what to do with all of this kind of complicated information I'm gi ving you today, always say that having a healthy diet is a good idea. There's be en lots of correlational s tudies looking at low levels of vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals like magnesium, low levels of those omega -3 fatty acids, and higher rates of asthma and allergic rhinitis and eczema. The studies that have examined the useful ness of dietary supplementation haven't consistently shown to prevent or treat disease but I would s ay that it's always a re asonable approach to tell patients to eat a whole food diet that's high in antioxidants, in omega -3 fatty acids. In countries where they have diets that are naturally high in omega -3 fatty acids and antioxidants, like Italy and in Greece with the Mediterranean diets, we know that they have lower rates of asthma and allergic diseases. The other thing that individuals might want to con sider specifically for allergic sympt oms is the use of nasal saline, either with a bottle or a neti p ot, and so I pr ovided some direct instructions from the manufacturers here if you 're interested in following those or making those recommendations to a patient. The most impo rtant thing to remind people is to make certain that they know that they never put the tip of the neti pot or the bulb syringe of a nasal spray further into the nostril then a fingers width. The last couple of slides that I wan ted to share with you have some g eneral ideas about what we know about why patients are coming to complementar y therapies and what you can do to find out what they're using, and why maybe you might want to consid er supporting those things that are safe , even if we don't know whether they're effective. Primarily, patients who use CAM fall into two broad categories, either because they have a worldview, they're an individual who favors natural therapie s over -pres cription biomedical approaches, or you can see it as a marker for some level of the satisfaction with the care th at they're getting. It might be philosophica l or cultural, which would kind o f put them into that worldview category, or it might be because they're afraid of the medication, they're disappo inted with the lack of response they've gotten from the medication, or they're disappointed with a side effect they expe rienced from the medication, or that the cost seemed to be too prohibitive for them. Hopeful ly as I've been presenting this information you 've gotten the sense of urgency that I feel about the need to ask our pat ients about what they're using. Anytime that you're taking a health history, particularly when the individual is new and when symptoms are newly develo ped, or if their asthma control or allergy seems to have a loss or a deterio ration in their quality of life or their c ontrol. And, I alway s support a patien t's use of medications that are safe, even if I can't provide you with any evidence of them being effective. Page 8 of 10 I'm work ing with some colleagues now to create what we're calling integrative medicine i ntake forms, and these are some screensh ots from three different intake forms we've developed and have under review at the journal JACI: In Pract ice. We are suggesting that you might want to give your patient a chec klist to complete while they're waiting in the office, which gets broader looks a t different mind - body practices, natural p roducts, or other complementary a pproaches, and that they would self -repo rt, and if they check something \" yes\" to that then we're suggesting we have this second form which is an index of all n atural products that are herbs, vitamins, and foods in alphabetical order that an individual could also check off, so t hat you could have more focused inform ation about what they're using. Anytime you were to use these you would obviously need to collect information on dose a nd frequency and the reason why they are using these particular products. In our paper under review right now we offer a third intake form that we're calling a cultural health history taking aid, whi ch really is kind of focused on trying t o get at an underst anding of an individual who has a different orientation to the symptoms that they'r e experiencing, who they want to trea t them, and how they want to be treated. So, we hope that we'll have some good news about having that out available shortly. The Institute of Me dicine has d efined patient -centered care as respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and value s, ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions. So, when we think about the Venn diagram that is evidenc e-based medicine we often think about the best external evidence, our asth ma guidelines for instance, and our ow n individual clinical expertise that comes from years of practice and following guidelines. But, what we often forget is that patient preferences for care shou ld be given equal weight to the clinician expertise into the standards, the evid ence -based standards, because a lot of p eople think that you can't give h igh quality health care without incorpo rating the patient's values and expectations. In the Institute of Medicine 's \"Crossing the Quality Chasm\" report, th ey had identified ten rules for improved health care and I have a paper that's referenced here that identifies seven of those ten rules being appro priate for our consideration of quality care a nd integrative medicine. For instan ce, care is based on continuous healing r elationships. One of the things that we know is that patients are often more satis fied with their yoga teacher or their naturopath than their primary care provider or nurse because those compl ementary practitioners excel at touch, time , and talk, and if we are going to improve patient satisfaction we're going t o need to figure out how we can devel op new continuous relationships that are more holistic with our patient. In order to ha ve greater patient sati sfaction, anothe r IOM quality rule is that care needs to become customized according to what patients need and what pa tients value, so that means, as I said previously, we need to a ccept what they 're doing and accommodate their non -medical worldviews, as long as what they're doing i s not harmful. The third rule, the patient is the source of control. One of the reasons that patients often turn to complementary or integrative medicine is because they don't feel that they have a voice in the visit with Page 9 of 10 their nurse or doctor, and that's why I'm now examining what can happen in a brief intervention around shared decision -making where we negotiate what asthma management will be for indi viduals who have persistent and uncontrolled asthma. The fourth rule is knowled ge is shared, information flows freely, which means that we need to be better communicators and better collaborators, reaching out to the complem entary practitioners as part of an extend ed health care team. We need to remember that, although decision -making should be based on evidence, just simply presen ting our patients with what the guideli nes say or what the truth is is often not compelling enough for them to actually feel that the recommendation we're ma king for inhaled corticosteroid or for so me other treatment is something that they feel is actually going to be helpful for them. The sixth rule around safety is making certain that you get to know when patients are doing something that is dangerous, and offer them an alte rnative complementary treatment as long as they do not do the thing that is dangerous. And remember that finally, needs need to be anticipated . Patients often turn to complementary medicine because they see it as a way that they can personalize their own me dical management. I've included here a couple of resources that I've referenced in the slides. The N atural Center for Complementary Integra tive Health, and MEDLINE, but I also want to point out that there is something called the Natural Medicines Data base. If we are a member of the American Academy of Asthma and Allergy we get a complimentary subscription to this, otherwise it is by subscription only, but it's a great place to get information that grades the safety and efficacy of all these different treatment s. For example, it g ives butte rbur a C for asthma and a B for allergic rhinitis, meaning that it's unclear whether it's helpful for asthma but there's pretty good evidence th at it's good for allergic rhinitis. It gives you inform ation on all of these different produc ts mechanism of action, adverse events, interactions with other drugs or with other herbs. It's an excellent resource that might be of interest. That concludes my talk today, thank you! I think if there were any questions that people can put in to, type into the chat feature, and I'll turn it back over to you . MACP: Thank you so much, that was a really informative presentation, I hope that everybody got something new out of that. I'm not seeing any questions pop up in the chat box. Well , Maureen I actually maybe just thought of one myself. We just had the Big Sk y Pulmonary Conference, which I know you're a little familiar with, out here and one of the things that someb ody said about a breathing technique was a yogic breathing technique called kapalabhati. Have you heard anything about that? I was surprised to see that as a recommendation for asthma. Dr. George: That might be a specific type of breathing technique or pranayama, but I, based on the report it's certainly not harmful and there is weak evidence but a signal that in adults yogic breathing may decrease symptoms and improve pulmonary function tests, you know, pulmonary function values, so I would strongly suggest it as you know, grade A for safety, h igh evidence that it's safe and even if it's Page 10 of 10 unclear if it's effective I think it's a really good approach. And, just like Pilates, people who have the sense of controlling their breathing have a lot less anxiety when they have an asthma attack, and it really does, I found that people have been very responsive to breath training, and my preference is yog ic breathing over these hypervent ilation reduction techniques. MACP: Got it, thank you for that! So, I'm not seeing any questions pop up, Maureen, I think that we're probably done! Thank you so much for your time today. Dr. George: Yeah, I appreciate it and I hope that I was able to touch on at least a fe w things t hat people have already seen in their practice or they will now be ready to see an d respon d to in their practice. It's really fascinating and I think that if we all come together around the fact that our patients are using this , that the onus is on us to be prepared to respond and to really meet our pat ients where they're at in order to deliver the kind of care that they 're really looking for, so that we keep them within the medical system and don't drive them only to doing those alternative practices.
