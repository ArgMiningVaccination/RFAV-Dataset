All vaccines carry a small risk of an allergic reaction. Shortly after the introduction of the first available Covid19 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech, there were reports of a small number of patients with a prior history of anaphylaxis who developed a serious allergic reaction following administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Although further, reassuring, evidence of safe vaccine administration has emerged, guidance has been issued on administering Covid19 vaccines to patients with a history of allergic reactions. On current data, the risk of a serious allergic reaction/anaphylaxis to the currently available vaccines is estimated at between 1 to 2 episodes per 100,000 vaccinations. This is similar to rates for other vaccines programmes administered in the UK, such as the influenza vaccine. The risk of a serious reaction is therefore low, and should be balanced with the risk of Covid19 infection in vulnerable groups that include patients with a history of allergy. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (and the Moderna vaccine) contains polyethylene glycol (PEG). This is a known allergen, and can be responsible for reactions to other therapies such as biologic monoclonal antibodies. Although PEG has not been established as the cause of the serious reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the accompanying algorithm recognises the potential for PEG to cause allergy in patients with history of unexplained anaphylaxis, or anaphylaxis to multiple drugs. PEG containing drug/compounds can include methylprednisolone; contraceptive injections; laxatives; biologics; cosmetics The AstraZeneca/Oxford and Janssen vaccines contain Polysorbate 80. This has some structural similarity with PEG, but risk of cross-reaction in a clinical setting appears to be rare. The AstraZeneca/Oxford or Janssen vaccine can therefore be administered to patients with an actual or possible history of allergy to PEG, but in a hospital setting with observation. Polysorbate 80 containing drug/compounds can include some influenza vaccines, HPV, Hep B vaccines; soft ice cream; custard; biologics; cosmetics. Key Principles: - The majority of patients with previous allergy can be safely vaccinated in a community setting - Patients with a history of anaphylaxis to food, an identified drug, or an insect sting can be safely vaccinated in the community - Patients with history of fainting/panic attacks or localised reactions with previous vaccines can be safely vaccinated in the community - For patients with a history of allergic reactions, please follow the algorithm Booster Covid19 Vaccination and Allergy The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended that a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is offered to: - those living in residential care homes for older adults - frontline health and social care workers - all adults aged 50 years or over - adults aged 16 to 49 years with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 - adult carers (aged 16 or over) - household contacts (aged 16 or over) of immunosuppressed individuals. The booster vaccine dose should be offered no earlier than 6 months after completion of the primary vaccine course, in the same order as during Phase 1. The JCVI advises a preference for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the booster programme, regardless of which vaccine brand someone received for their primary doses. This follows data from the COV-BOOST trial that indicates the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is well tolerated as a third dose and provides a strong booster response. Alternatively, a half dose of the Moderna vaccine may be offered. Where mRNA vaccines cannot be offered, for example due to allergies, the AstraZeneca vaccine may be considered for those who received it previously. FOR PATIENTS WITH A CURRENT OR HISTORIC CONCERN ABOUT POSSIBLE COVID19 VACCINE ALLERGY we would recommend the following: - Patients with previous allergy concerns who were recommended and tolerated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination without incident should receive a booster in the community with Pfizer or half dose Moderna vaccine - Patients with previous allergy concerns who were recommended and tolerated Astra-Zeneca vaccination without incident should receive a booster in the community with Astra-Zeneca vaccine If there are new allergy concerns subsequent to 1st or 2nd dose vaccination, please follow the Covid19 vaccine allergy pathway for 1st and subsequent dose administration. Who to refer: For 1st dose: - Unexplained anaphylaxis or anaphylaxis to multiple drug classes - Systemic reaction/anaphylaxis to vaccine excipients For 2nd dose: - Immediate (within 2 hours) Systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis to 1st dose - Immediate (within 2 hours) Localised urticarial reaction to 1st dose - Persistent, delayed reaction requiring medical attention Please do not refer patients with mild or non-specific symptoms such as tingling, headache, fatigue; or localised symptoms such as arm pain. Concerns regarding non-allergic symptoms, including blood clots should not be directed to the allergy service. Who not to refer: - Patients who do not have a clear history of systemic allergy symptoms (i.e. non specific symptoms such as tingling, headache, fatigue, arm pain etc.) - Patients with a history of fainting when having injections - Patients with panic symptoms related to vaccination - Children under the age of 18 - Concerns regarding non-allergic symptoms, including blood clots should not be directed to the allergy service How to Refer : Sci gateway: Lauriston building-dermatology-Urgent-Advice Only referral-Mark attention of Dr McKAY ALLERGY CLINIC.
