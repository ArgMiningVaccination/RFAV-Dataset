By August 15 of each year, each State agency shall submit to FNS for approval a State Plan for the following fiscal year as a prerequisite to receiving funds under this section. (11) A copy of the procedure manual developed by the State agency for guidance to local agencies in operating the Program. The manual shall include \u2014 (i) Certification procedures, including: (A) A list of the specific nutritional risk criteria by priority level which explains how a person's nutritional risk is deter mined; (2) Nutritional risk criteria. The following are examples of nutritional risk conditions which may be used as a basis for certification. These examples include \u2014 (i) Detrimental or abnormal nutritional conditions detectable by biochemical or anthropometric measurements, such as anemia, underweight, overweight, abnormal patterns of weight gain in a pregnant woman, low birth weight in an infant, or stunting in an inf ant or child; (ii) Other documented nutritionally related medical conditions, such as clinical signs of nutritional deficiencies, metabolic disorders, pre -eclampsia in pregnant women, failure to thrive in an infant, chronic infections in any person, alcoho l or drug abuse or mental retardation in women, lead poisoning, history of high risk pregnancies or factors associated with high risk pregnancies (such as smoking; conception before 16 months postpartum; history of low birth weight, premature births, or ne onatal loss; adolescent pregnancy; or current multiple pregnancy) in pregnant women, or congenital malformations in infants or children, or infants born of women with alcohol or drug abuse histories or mental retardation. (iii) Dietary deficiencies that im pair or endanger health, such as inadequate dietary patterns assessed by a 24 -hour dietary recall, dietary history, or food frequency checklist; and (iv) Conditions that predispose persons to inadequate nutritional patterns or nutritionally related medical conditions, such as homelessness or migrancy. Authority 7 CFRPart 246.4(a)(11)(i)(A) excerpt 7 CFR Part 246.7(e)(2)(i -iv) Procedures This policy provides the abbreviated definitions for the risk criteria used by the Iowa WIC Program as well as the risk codes in numerical order using USDA numbers, priority assignments and the participant categories covered by each risk. For selected medi cal risks and selected dietary risks, an alpha character also appears with the USDA number. This character has been added to facilitate state reporting and tracking of specific risks and nutrition practices. The full definitions for the risk criteria can b e found on the WIC web portal. https://idph.iowa.gov/wic -Certification, Eligibility and Coordination of Services February 2022 2 Iowa Department of Public Health/WIC Policy and Procedure Manual portal/resources -risks Some nutrition risk criteria, specified in the definition of each criterion, as appropriate, allow an applicant or caregiver to tell the CPA at the local WIC office (self -report) that the applicant has a condition that was diagnosed by a physician. Self -reporting of a diagnosis by a physician or other recognized medical authority should not be confused with self -diagnosis, where a person simply claims to have or has had a medical condition, without any reference to professional diagnosis of that condition. A self -reported medical diagnosis should prompt the CPA to validate the presence of the condition by asking more probing questions related to the self -reported professional diagnosis, such as: Whether the condition is being managed by a medical professiona l; The name and contact information for that medical professional (to allow communication and verification if necessary); Whether it is being controlled by diet, medication, or other therapy; and What types of medications, if any have been prescribed, are being taken to address the condition. Self-reporting for \"History of...\" conditions should be treated in the same manner as self - reporting for current conditions requiring a physician's diagnosis, i.e., the applicant may report to the CPA that s/he was di agnosed by a physician with a given condition at some point in the past. As with current conditions, self -diagnosis of a past condition should never be confused with self - reporting. Some definitions of nutrition -related medical conditions include a non -exhaustive list of potential conditions (e.g., 348=Central nervous system disorders). If a WIC applicant reports a condition that is not included in the WIC data system, the Competent P rofessional Authority (CPA) must do the following: Document in the applicant's record risk 360 \"Other Medical Conditions, severe enough to affect nutritional status\" and then select \"Other as defined in the care plan\" from the drop down list. The CPA will then document the condition and how it interferes with food consumption, nutrient absorption or compromises nutritional status in the care plan. (While most medical conditions have an impact on nutritional status, some conditions do not. For purposes of e ligibility, the impact of the medical condition on nutritional status must be clearly documented.) High -Risk Conditions The WIC data system automatically identifies some participants as high -risk based on their assigned risks. High risk conditions are iden tified in the definitions listed below by a +. Certification, Eligibility and Coordination of Services February 2022 3 Iowa Department of Public Health/WIC Policy and Procedure Manual The Iowa WIC Program defines high risk as a nutrition problem or the potential for developing a nutrition problem that requires additional assessment, intervention, monitoring and evaluation by a licensed dietitian (Journal of the American Dietetic Associa tion 2003; 103(6):1061 -1072). Participants who are at high -risk must have at least one individual education contact by a registered, licensed dietitian and have a nutrition care plan. This contact may take place at certification or at the second education contact. All second education contacts for high -risk participants must include a one -to-one contact and an updated care plan (Eg. The participant can complete wichealth.org for their second nutrition education contact but they must also have a phone or in person contact with a CPA (A d ietitian if not seen at certification by one or any CPA if they were.)).Certification, Eligibility and Coordination of Services February 2022 4 Iowa Department of Public Health/WIC Policy and Procedure Manual + next to the X indicates that the participant category is high risk for that condition.
