Requests that cover multiple areas below will be given higher priority: - Communities with a high rank on the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) for COVID-19. - Social vulnerability refers to the potential negative effects on communities caused by external stresses on human health. Such stresses include natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks. Reducing social vulnerability can decrease both human suffering and economic loss. Learn more about [how the CDC uses the SVI](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html). Learn more about the [DOH Social Vulnerability COVID-19 Map](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/820-158-SocialVulnerabilityMapGuide.pdf?uid=627066718b1e5). - Social vulnerability refers to the potential negative effects on communities caused by external stresses on human health. Such stresses include natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks. Reducing social vulnerability can decrease both human suffering and economic loss. Learn more about - Demographic groups with lower vaccination rates compared to other groups. - Groups not represented or underrepresented in current DOH data systems that have likely experienced COVID-19 health disparities and vaccine inequities. (Elderly, children, unhoused populations, group home settings) - Areas that have not had a visit from the DOH Care-a-Van. - Requests submitted at least 14 days prior to the date of the event. - Requestors who are a 501 c(3) Non-Profit, LHJ, tribal partner, and/or serve BIPOC communities. Frequently Asked Questions - Where can I find a Care-a-Van clinic? - - Who can request a Care-a-Van? - Any organization can request a Care-a-Van. However, priority is given to community-based organizations, especially those that reach communities and groups most impacted by COVID-19. - Will every request receive a Care-a-Van? - Requests will be fulfilled based on Care-a-Van staff and vaccinator availability. Please note that although we would like to support every request by providing the Care-a-Van: - Requests may be fulfilled by the local health jurisdiction (LHJ) or health department as part of our practice of collaboration and coordination. - Requests may be fulfilled solely by one of our vaccine contractors. - Requests may not be fulfilled if they are submitted with less than two weeks' notice. - Requests may not be fulfilled if multiple clinics are already available in that geographic area. - Requests may not be fulfilled if we have multiple conflicting events. - Requests may not be fulfilled if they do not meet the criteria to be supported by a DOH Care-a-Van. (See [Site Prioritization](https://doh.wa.gov/emergencies/covid-19/vaccine-information/care-van#siteprioritization)) - Requests may not be fulfilled if the requested length is more than four hours. If a requested clinic is longer than four hours, a Care-a-Van member will evaluate the request and determine if there is a need for extended time. To help increase the likelihood of being supported by the Care-a-Van, please submit your requests at least 14 days in advance of the event. - How will I know if my request will be fulfilled by the Care-a-Van? - Within 3-4 business days you will receive an email confirming we have received your request and are beginning planning. This email confirms that your event will likely be supported, but the type of support you will receive (Care-a-Van, vaccine contractor, or local health jurisdiction/department) will be confirmed in 5-10 business days. If the Care-a-Van supports your event, we will then coordinate a brief planning call to discuss the logistics of your event and make sure we have all the information we need to plan for a successful clinic. - How many attendees are required to host a Care-a-Van? - We choose events by prioritizing communities and groups who are most impacted by COVID-19. Please fill out a request form regardless of how many people you think may attend your event. If the Care-a-Van is not the ideal option based on the event size, we will work with you to find vaccine options that will work. - What type of space is needed to host a Care-a-Van? - The Care-a-Van comes with all the necessary equipment and supplies to host indoor and outdoor events. For outdoor events, we require enough space for at least two 10x10 canopies/tents and some extra space for patient observation. For indoor clinics Care-a-Van may show up without the van if the venue can supply tables and chairs. This way the van can be sent to clinics that need the equipment. Indoor clinics will need space for at least 3-4 tables and minimum 14 chairs. If you are unsure if you can provide this, please schedule a planning meeting after your event is confirmed to further discuss. - What services are provided through the Care-a-Van? - The Care-a-Van offers COVID-19 vaccines, flu vaccines, mpox vaccines, childhood vaccines, blood pressure screenings, and blood glucose screenings. Pfizer and Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccinations for ages 6 months and older are available. We provide first, second, and booster doses.

The DOH staff are responsible for driving the van (when needed), bringing supplies, providing incentives, assessing community member needs, and helping set up and break down the clinic. The contracted vaccine providers are made up of doctors, nurses, and medical assistants that administer the vaccines. Additional contracted staff handle administrative duties, such as patient registration, filling out vaccine cards, and overseeing the observation area. - What additional support is provided by the Care-a-Van? - The Care-a-Van Community Outreach Workers can help develop promotional materials for the event and conduct outreach to community partners in the area. The Care-a-Van team can also bring incentives to the events (upon availability) to help increase attendance. - What support is needed from the requesting organization/host? - The Care-a-Van is self-sufficient in its ability to operate a mobile clinic; however, support is always appreciated. Requesting organizations play a vital role by providing the clinic space/venue and promoting the event. Requesting organizations can also support by providing volunteers, assisting with translating/interpreting, and having accessible restrooms, electricity, and drinking water. Upcoming Care-a-Van Events Upon availability, Care-a-Van clinics will have: - Pfizer and Moderna products for ages 6 months and up - Monkeypox vaccine availability will be for ages 18 years old and up - Childhood vaccine availability will be for ages 6 months through 18 years - Blood pressure screening availability for ages 3 years and up - Blood glucose screening availability for ages 10 years and up If no registration link is available, clinics will see patients on a walk-in basis.
