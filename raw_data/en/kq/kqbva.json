SAFE Delivers molecules in a natural, non-toxic and non-destructive manner without provoking an immune response. TARGETED Physiologically targets \"activated\" cells and enters them directly, helping to maximize efficacy. ORALLY BIOAVAILABLE Enables oral administration and easy absorption into the circulatory system through the lymphatics. STABLE Resists water penetration, environmental attacks and degradation in the GI tract; increases the stability of drug molecules. FLEXIBLE Can administer a wide range of small and large molecules through multiple routes: oral, intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. We intend to accomplish three primary goals through our LNC technology - the first being the improvement of the safety profile of drugs that cause excessive off-target organ toxicity. We are additionally facilitating targeted intracellular delivery - an essential method for complex gene therapies. Finally, we are reformulating efficacious, yet inconvenient and/or otherwise toxic IV-administered drugs as oral agents. "}
