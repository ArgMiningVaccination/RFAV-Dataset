As a skilled and compassionate Chiropractic Internist, Dr. Robert Arne, along with his friendly and knowledgeable wellness team, is here to help you find lasting relief from pain, inflammation, and other symptoms that can keep you from doing the things you love most. Through the practice of natural medicine, Dr. Arne and his team can target and treat your specific condition delivered through various therapeutic treatments and supplements that combine traditional, modern, and scientific methods. The goal of natural medicine is to treat the whole person \u2014 that means mind, body, and spirit. Natural medicine also aims to diagnose and discover the root of a health concern and treat that versus the symptom. The benefit of looking at the whole body and treating the root cause is much more progress in your healing journey, versus treating the symptom where you are essentially putting a \"bandaid\" on the actual problem only for it to likely return later on. What to Expect from A Natural Medicine Consult? One of our doctors will spend about 1 hour examining and consulting you. Our natural medicine consultations are very thorough and include a deep dive into medical and health history, an exam, as well as an assessment of what they may suspect could be creating these health concerns and what treatment plan would benefit you moving forward. The doctor should have a very good understanding of where to get started and could include: bloodwork, comprehensive diagnostic testing, conducting a [Body Scan, ](https://arnewellnesscentercolorado.com/body-scan/)or other various assessments that will give us a baseline for treatment. During our consultation and following appointments, they will typically discuss your personal health plan. Holistic medicine focuses on education and prevention, so your doctor may give you diet, exercise, or stress management tips. They might use complementary medicine \u2014 like homeopathy, herbal medicine, and acupuncture \u2014 in addition to natural treatments. Will Natural Medicine Work for My Condition? Natural medicine is used for a wide range of health concerns and is conducive with most people, but some of the top concerns we see at our clinic are: - Lyme Disease - Auto-Immune Disorders - GI Issues/IBS - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - Parasitic infections - Mold Toxicity - Hormonal Imbalances - Sleep Issues - General toxicity (heavy metals, chemicals, etc) - Chronic lung infections/cough Littleton's Top Rated Local\u00ae Chiropractic Internist At Arne Wellness Center, we are dedicated to helping you optimize your whole-body health so you can live life to its fullest. Dr. Robert Arne is a Chiropractic Internist who has been practicing natural medicine for more than 23 years. His experience dealing with chronic health conditions, along with his advanced education and diagnostic training in internal disorders, allows him to be effective in achieving results. But great results are only obtained by treating \"the cause\" of the condition, rather than the symptoms. What Is Natural Medicine? Natural medicine emphasizes the diagnoses, prevention, and treatment of various acute and chronic health conditions, injuries, and musculoskeletal conditions using a natural approach delivered through therapeutic techniques and substances. Our team's extensive knowledge in natural medicine treatments such as homeopathy, herbal therapy, nutritional therapy, and detoxification allow him to use non-toxic natural medicine and other pain relief options to treat the cause of your condition naturally.

An in-depth health history, followed by a thorough health screening of blood, urine, saliva, and other diagnostic testing helps him identify \"the cause\" of the condition you're experiencing, so that he can accurately create a treatment plan. Our Doctors use standard labs (Lab Corp and Quest) as well as specialized functional medicine labs to assess your condition.
