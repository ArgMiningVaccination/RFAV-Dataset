People apply snake skin to the skin for skin disorders, including sores, abscesses, boils, itching, scaly and itchy skin (psoriasis), and scabies, as well as eye infections, cloudy spots in the eye, sore throat, and hemorrhoids. Snake skin is also used in ointments and creams to reduce pain and stiffness. How does it work? Snake skin contains cholesterol and other fats. It is often used as a model for human skin in drug research due to its thickness and fat content.

Taking a combination of snake skin and six other Chinese herbs by mouth, in addition to standard sodium iodide injections, seems to improve cloudiness in the eye faster than standard care alone.

Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate [(detailed description of each of the ratings).](#) [](https://www.rxlist.com/quiz_vitamins_and_supplements/quiz.htm) QUESTIONSee Answer The appropriate dose of snake skin depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for snake skin (in children/in adults). Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using.
