Talk to your doctor before starting any complementary therapies, especially while you are pregnant. Complementary therapies should not replace necessary conventional medicine. What are complementary therapies? Complementary therapies are therapies that are not part of the standard medical care usually prescribed by medical doctors. There are many types of complementary therapies, including [acupuncture](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/acupuncture), [massage](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/massage-therapy) and naturopathy. They are also sometimes referred to as 'integrative medicine'. Sometimes these therapies may be described as 'alternative'. Alternative therapies are used in place of conventional treatment from your doctor or healthcare provider, rather than alongside \u2014 as is the case with complementary therapies. Thet can be harmful if there is no evidence for these therapies, if they replace or delay treatments that are evidence-based and advisable, or if they have side effects. Why do women use complementary therapy during pregnancy? Some women turn to complementary therapies during pregnancy to help reduce symptoms such as [nausea and vomiting](/dealing-with-morning-sickness) and [low back pain](/backache-in-pregnancy). Some women might also use these therapies to prepare for labour and to increase their chances of an uncomplicated birth. Is complementary therapy right for you? Ask your doctor or midwife about the effectiveness and safety of any complementary therapy, and whether they would support you trying it. You can also ask your doctor or nurse for recommendations of complementary health practitioners. What questions should I ask complementary health practitioners? - What are your qualifications? How long have you been practising? - How does this treatment work? Is there evidence this treatment is effective? - What risks or side effects are involved? - How long should this treatment be used for? How will I know if it's working? - What's the cost of the treatment? Can I claim the cost on Medicare or from my health fund? What are types of complementary therapies? Acupuncture or acupressure Some studies suggest acupuncture may help to reduce backache or [pelvic pain](/pelvic-pain-during-pregnancy) in pregnant women. Acupuncture or acupressure is also used to bring on labour, although its effectiveness is uncertain. Acupuncture or acupressure is generally safe when performed by a trained acupuncturist. Mild pain from the needles is the most common side effect. Chiropractic and osteopathy [Chiropractic](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/chiropractors-chiropractic-treatment) and osteopathy are used to reduce low back and pelvic pain in pregnant women. The effectiveness of these treatments is uncertain but they are generally thought to be safe for pregnant women. Massage Many women use [pregnancy massage](/pregnancy-massage) to help them cope with changes in their body, reduce stress and improve sleep. Usually the abdomen is not massaged at all or massaged very lightly. Massages are usually avoided in the [first trimester](/first-trimester) and it's best not to lie flat on your back in the second half of your pregnancy since this puts too much pressure on the vein that runs from your legs to your heart. Reflexology Pregnant women might use [reflexology](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/massage-therapy) \u2014 where a therapist uses hands, fingers and thumbs to stimulate certain areas of the feet \u2014 to reduce low back or pelvic pain. It is reported to be safe. Naturopathy Naturopathy is based on the belief in 'nature's healing power'. Treatments aim to support good health through things like diet, herbal supplements or exercise. There isn't much research on the use of naturopathic treatments in pregnant women. Hypnotherapy Hypnosis has been used to help with labour pain or to reduce stress. However, hypnotherapy techniques need to be practised to be effective during childbirth. Biofeedback training Biofeedback training aims to help women recognise body signals such as heart rate or tensed muscles and to change their physical responses during labour. There isn't enough high-quality evidence to prove it's effective at [reducing labour pain](/pain-relief-during-labour). What are types of complementary medicines? Supplements Pregnant women are encouraged to take only certain [supplements](/vitamins-and-supplements-during-pregnancy) during pregnancy, such as those containing [iron](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/foods-high-in-iron), [folate](/folate-and-pregnancy) and [iodine](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/iodine). Speak to your doctor before you take any supplements during your pregnancy. Herbs Herbal preparations commonly taken during pregnancy include raspberry leaf, ginger and chamomile, often in the form of [herbal teas](/herbal-teas-during-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding). Raspberry leaf is usually consumed in the last trimester as it's thought to help prepare the body for birth. Ginger may help reduce nausea while chamomile is said to be relaxing. Ask your [doctor](/the-role-of-your-gp) or [midwife](/the-role-of-your-midwife) about any herbal preparations you plan to take. Homeopathy [Homeopathy](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/homeopathy) is based on the idea that if a substance causes symptoms in a healthy person, tiny doses of the substance can treat the symptoms in someone who is unwell. According to the [National Health and Medical Research Council](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-advice/all-topics/complementary-medicines), there are no health conditions for which there is reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective. What other therapies are there? Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) [TENS](/tens) is sometimes used to help relieve labour pain, but it's uncertain whether TENS actually alleviates pain or simply distracts a woman from the pain. TENS is generally considered safe although there's a risk of local skin irritation.
