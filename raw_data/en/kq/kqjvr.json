In China, HCC rep- resents 50% of the diagnosed cases and deaths.2HCC is associated with several risk factors dhepatitis viral infec- tion, environmental toxins, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, hepatotoxic drugs dand is involved in the development of chronic inflammation, brosis, and carci-nogenesis. 3,4Western medicine and therapies are the pri- mary strategies for the treatment of HCC (e.g., surgical resection, liver transplantation, radiofrequency, chemo-therapy, and targeted molecular therapy), but the general prognosis for HCC patients is still dismal. 5With roots in ancient China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has beenused for the treatment of cancers, including HCC. TCM is based on empirically accumulated knowledge and has achieved curative effects. 6In modern China, TCM is the most widely used form of complementary and alternative medicine that benets HCC patients, either alone or in combination therapies.6e9 TCM encompasses a wealth of documented therapeutic resources, with two main parts: the TCM theoretical system and Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). \"Preventative treat- ment\" is the principle of TCM for controlling disease, whichwas recorded in Huang-di-nei-jing , the authoritative book of TCM written over 2000 years ago. Etiology is central to TCM theory which studies the zheng (syndromes) of cancers based on holism (the whole condition). In TCM theory, cancers are related to the disequilibrium of yinand yang and deciency of vital qi(energy). Holism holds that the liver is the soul of the human body, which stores the blood,controls the sinews, and maintains a smooth and uninter- rupted flow of qi. 10The causes of HCC are yu(stasis), du (toxicity) and xu(deciency). Strategies of treatments include huo-xue-hua-yu (removing blood stasis) , jian-pi-li- qi(regulating the flow of qiand strengthening the spleen), or qing-re-jie-du (clearing heat and detoxifying).11 The system of TCM came into being in the Spring and Autumn period and reached its peak in the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties ( Fig. 1 ). Although TCM has been questioned throughout history and even neglected in modern times, it still plays an important role in the treatment of chronic diseases, especially for tumor therapy. Chinese practi-tioners of TCM focus on the inherent balance of body, 12 therefore, TCM works not just by directly inhibiting can- cer itself, but also by playing an indirect role by treating the patient as a whole.13,14For HCC, many effective fang-ji (formulas) have been clinically proven to retard HCC pro- gression and prevent HCC occurrence.10,15e20The fang-ji were designed on the TCM theory of disequilibrium of yin and yang and qiand xue. In this review, we rst summarize the herbs and ancient formulas with therapeutic effects on HCC. Then, we reviewthe research status of TCM in modern medicine and raiseexisting problems in the development of TCM. Finally, we speculate about the future of TCM in the context of pre- cision medicine and integrated medicine. After reviewingthe literature, we believe that TCM, though developed in ancient times, is an advanced method of cancer treatmentthat, although not without some controversy, has positivecurative effects. Precise analysis and systematic research methods are still needed to verify the TCM theory. History of TCM for HCC prevention and therapy Classical herbal formulas, which were used for preventing and treating hepatic diseases thousands of years ago, arethe most common application of TCM. Herbs were classied by function: toning qi,invigorating blood, nourishing yin, soothing liver qistagnation, clearing heat, detoxifying, and dissolving stasis, all of which were potential sources forprevention and treatment of HCC. Although CHM has been demonstrated and documented to be effective for the treatment of HCC, 21e23critics point out that the toxicity of CHM is unclear.24Also, the TCM theory for prevention and treatment is more widely accepted in China than abroad. Modern medicine requires a clear understanding of theeffector compounds, toxic ingredients, and the associated signaling pathways of CHM. After years of research, great progress has been discerning the active compounds andassociated signaling pathways in CHM, 25but the active compounds are not a substitute for the complete CHM formula. TCM therapy treats HCC holistically, but the actualanticancer mechanism of the CHM formula is still unknown.In recent years, systems pharmacology, in particular, the subeld of network pharmacology, has emerged as a promising approach to elucidate the CHM's mechanisms ofaction and promote methodical drug discovery, thus facil- itating the modernization of TCM. 26,27 Curative effects drove development of TCM for HCC in ancient times Herbs for prevention and therapy of HCC TCM covers thousands of species of plants, and for HCC therapy, many of these herbs are commonly used. The ten most commonly used Additional herbs have been used for HCC therapy since ancient times, as detailed in Table 1 . Formulas for prevention and therapy of HCC Formulas are the most common application of CHM, and some classical herbal formulas have remarkable prevention and treatment effects on HCC. Ren-shen-bie-jia-jian and xiao-chai-hu-tang are formulas used for inhibiting hep- atocarcinogenesis through nourishing qiand soothing liver qistagnation. In the TCM theory, the liver and kidney share the same origin, so the formulas of zi-yin-tang and fu- zheng-hua-yu-tang were used for prevention of HCC by toning the liver and kidney. Strengthening the spleen is another important principle for HCC therapy, and jian-pi-Traditional medicine for liver cancer 371jie-du recipe was a famous herbal formula for strength- ening the spleen and for detoxication. In addition to toning treatments, directly eliminating pathogenic factors is another principle of HCC using formulas such as qing-re- jie-du-tang and zao-lian mixture. Danshen and Jianghuang are anti-HCC herbs effective at inhibiting HCC by dissolving stasis. Additional formulas have been validated since ancient times, and details are described in Table 2 . The shortcomings of TCM theory and CHM TCM practice relies on a combination of TCM theory and thepersonal experience of physicians, without standardized protocols for anti-HCC treatment. TCM theory is not widely accepted, which is a major obstacle for modernizing TCM.Molecular and cell biology in contemporary medicine haveprovided important insights into the pathogenesis of HCC and offer anti-HCC strategies. In addition, some toxic in- gredients of CHM were reported, which further hinderedthe development of TCM. Therefore, exploration of the molecular signaling mechanisms of CHM as well as removal of toxic ingredients may provide support for the modernacceptance of TCM. 28Application and research status of TCM for HCC patients in modern medicine Status of CHM in HCC patients CHM for HCC prevention .The cure rate of HCC is unsat- isfactory, so prevention is particularly important.29In China, TCM has long been used for HCC prevention andare viewed as effective preventative treatments. One clinical trial showed that the herb-derived compound oxymatrine had a hepatitis B virus-suppressing effect in216 chronic hepatitis B patients. 30Glycyrrhizin and silymarin (also herb-derived compounds) have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of HCC in patientswith chronic hepatitis C virus infection and brosis. 31,32 The classic formulas such as jian-pi-huo-xue and xiao- chai-hu-tang are also effective at inhibiting hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with hepatitis (B and Cviruses) and cirrhosis. 33,34 CHM for anti-HCC therapy .Based on TCM theory, the clinical use of CHM is commonly prescribed as an herbal Figure 1 Development of traditional Chinese medicine . TCM started in the Spring and Autumn period, reaching its peak in the Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Although TCM has been questioned continuously throughout its history and even discounted in modern times, it still plays an important role in the treatment of chronic diseases, especially in the eld of tumor therapy. In 1950,the idea of unifying TCM and Western medicine was proposed, and TCM has been gaining in popularity ever since. In 2015, Tu Youyou won the rst Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, a high-prole breakthrough for TCM, and attracted the Types of herbal treatments for HCC patients.

The regimen of jian-pi-jie-du granules combined with hua-chan-su injection was associated with diminished risk when compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy in a small ai-di ,40,41hua-chan- therapy for advanced-stage HCC patients. CHM for improving symptoms of HCC patients .TCM is often considered as alternative therapy once HCC patients cannot benet from radical therapy.7Jineijin and Maiya were the most commonly used herbs for treatinganorexia; Dangshen and Huangqi for fatigue; Zhuru and Banxia for nausea and vomiting. 45Cancer pain is also a common complication of advanced-stage HCC. Chanwupowder and modied Jinhuang powder can be externallyapplied to alleviate cancer-induced pain. Also, topical application of Chanwu powder avoids some side effects and reduces the patient's dependence on analgesics. 46 Research status of anti-HCC mechanisms of TCMDiverse herbal formulas are commonly described in TCMtheory. Herbs have many active components that make them effective. 47Many herbal formulas and their active in- gredients are effective at inhibiting cell proliferation andinducing cell senescence, inducing apoptosis and autophagy,inhibiting metastasis and angiogenesis, improving drug resistance, and regulating immune function 48(Fig. 2 ). Inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell senescence .HCC is characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation.49Formulas such as son-you-yin12and so- cheong-ryong-tang50as well as herbs including Danshen51 and Huangyaozi52signicantly inhibit cell proliferation and tumor growth in HCC. The compounds isolated from herbs Raddeanin A,53and Ardipusilloside-I54also showed anti-proliferative effects in HCC cells. Cell senescenceinduction is a novel approach for HCC treatment. 55 Ganoderiol F induces cell senescence by activating theextracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway andup-regulating the expression p16. 56L. lucidum Ait. fruit down-regulates (RB) in HCC.57 Induction of apoptosis and autophagy .Apoptosis is one of the most thoroughly studied cell processes in HCC.58,59 Many herbal compounds are effective at inducing apoptosis in HCC including Gypenoside, Isorhamnetin,Liquiritigenin, and N-Butylidenephthalide. 60e63Anoikis is another apoptotic process that from matrix.64,65Arecoline, Cuspidatum, Emodin, related signaling pathways.66,67 Autophagy is a process that promotes cell death and is recognized as a target for HCC therapy because autophagy can contribute to anticancer therapeutic responses.68,69Tetrandrine and Shikonin promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and activate the ERKsignaling pathway to induce autophagy in HCC cells. 70,71 Conversely, Epigallocatechin-3- O-gallate strengthens Figure 2 CHM herbal formulas contain multiple components to for holistic treatment . Herbal formulas are composed of many active components that make up the fundamental units of herbal action, such as the diverse mechanisms of anti-HCC formulas.374 X. Liao et al.doxorubicin (DOX)-mediated Inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis .Chinese herbal demonstrated potency in regulation of TIMP2 and E-cadherin. The combination of multiple herbal ingredients comprising astragalosides,Astragalus polysaccharide, and salvianolic acids inhibitTGF- b1-mediated invasion in HCC cells. 77Angiogenesis (the process of new blood vessels generating from existing vessels) plays a crucial role in tumor growth andmetastasis and is a potential target for HCC therapy. 78,79 formulas HCC, acting through the heparin/heparan sulfate receptor. 81 Improving drug resistance .Drug resistance is one of the characteristics of HCC contributing to the poor prognosis.82 Some herbal compounds have direct effects against drug resistance in HCC cells. Astragalus membranaceus polysaccharides another component from A. membranaceus , is effective in enhancing the cytotoxicity apoptosis doxorubicin-resistant human HCC cells.85 Regulation of immune function .T-lymphocyte activation plays a pivotal role in HCC malignancy.86e88Polysaccharides isolated from A. annua L increase CD4\u00feand CD8\u00feT as well as IFN- IL-4 up- regulates NF- and BCL-2 in CD4\u00feT cells and enhances cytotoxic activities of CD8\u00feT cells against HCC.90Regulatory T cells (Tregs) function as negative immune regulators, and Astragalus polysaccharides inhibit FOXP3 expression and the proliferation of Tregs.91 of TCM for HCC treatmentSafety of TCM for HCC patients .CHM represents a huge and noteworthy reservoir for novel drug discovery, but CHMsafety evaluation is necessary. Oral CHM formulas have developed rapidly, and their variety has increased. Many clinical studies by Chinese and Western medical researchershave veried the efcacy and safety of oral Chinese-patented medicines for liver cancer. 92e95In addition, much attention has been paid to the clinical application of CHM injections.96,97However, the safety of CHM is still questioned because of the uncertainty of the ingredients in CHM, and the presence of toxic ingredients in CHM has also been reported.98Aristolochic acid (AA), an abundant and possibly toxic compound in Aristolochia plants and various natural herbs, was widely implicated in HCC.98,99Some researchers believe long-term use of CHM remains risky, and CHM still needs extensive basic and clinicalexperiments to evaluate safety. 100,101 The efcacy of CHM in ant-HCC is still being questioned. Much progress of TCM has been made in the research of anti-HCC, and some clinical studies have encouragingresults. 102e106However, some formulas worked well on HCC, but monotherapy or use of isolated ingredients weakened effects or had no impact entirely.107The composition of CHM is very complex, and many bioactivecomponents of CHM only exhibit powerful anticancer effects in vitro, or the anticancer effect is weak or lost when puried from the formula. Additionally, lack ofhigh-level clinical research evidence severely limits the development of CHM. 108 Molecular network integration to modernize TCM for HCC treatment TCM formulas are composed of multiple herbs to achieve the highest efcacy with the fewest side effects for HCC prevention and treatment. Despite the widespread use offormulas in clinical practice of CHM, the combinationprinciples based on the TCM theory were very challenging to discern. A variety of targeted molecular drugs have emerged in tumor therapy, but the limited efcacy showsthat a single target is not enough to shift the outcome of HCC. Changing the focus of anti-tumor therapy from pre- cision to integration should benet patients, and webelieve CHM has the inherent advantages for a multi- component strategy. 109 TCM is a complex, mixed system with multiple compo- nents and multiple targets, and identifying potentialbioactive molecules and the underlying mechanisms of combinations are essential tasks for TCM. Network phar- macology has emerged as a promising approach to accel-erate drug development and elucidate the mechanisms of action of CHM and understanding the complex interactions among biological systems, drugs, and complex dis-eases. 110,111Network pharmacology provides a novel approach to promote drug discovery in a precise manner and at the systems level, modernizing TCM for thefuture. 112,113With the aid of systems pharmacology, the \"drug-to-gene-to-target-to-disease subtype\" network will be established, and the fang-ji design principles guided by TCM theory will be illuminated. Conclusions and prospects There are many obstacles to developing TCM in the context of modern medicine. Owing to its complexity, the holistic concept, and the study of zheng , TCM theory is often questioned; the unknown quality of herbs is a drawback forTCM; precise analyses needed for pharmacodynamic and toxicological mechanisms hinders the modern acceptance of TCM; and synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects ofthe ingredients in CHM remains unclear. TCM views the human body as a complex, dynamic system and focuses on the balance of the human body, both internally and with itsTraditional medicine for liver cancer 375external environment. Only by solving the issues mentioned above can TCM truly go global. TCM is an important featureof traditional Chinese culture. Like Zhaoyou Tang, anacademician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, described, \"only when Western medicine learns from China can we create a new strategy for tumor therapy.\" Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
