It is not yet known whether giving Boswellia serrata together with standard treatment is more effective than standard treatment alone in treating high-grade gliomas. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is the study of a combination of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) herbal supplement intervention as an adjuvant to standard treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGG). The central hypothesis of this application is that a herbal preparation that inhibits 5-LO activity, will produce measurable biologically meaningful decrease in 5-LO eicosanoid production and brain edema that will be associated with improved survival and quality of life in patients with HGG. |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment||Phase| |Brain and Central Nervous extract Dietary Supplement: cyanocobalamin||Phase 2| OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine whether a herbal approach to decreasing 5-LO eicosanoid production reduces peritumoral brain edema in patients with HGG. Secondary - To determine if this adjuvant approach improves the quality of life and progression free and overall survival of patients with HGG. OUTLINE: This a randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (intervention): Patients receive oral Boswellia serrata herbal extract 4 times a day and oral cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) once a day for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II (control): Patients receive oral vitamin B-12 once a day for 6 months. All patients are encouraged to eat a regular balanced diet (as recommended by the American Cancer Society for cancer prevention) with limited consumption of red and processed meats. Quality of life will be assessed at baseline and then at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months. After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed every 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients (35 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study. |Study Type 5-Lipoxygenase Inhibition by Herbal Complementary and Alternative Medicine Approach Compared to Control as an Adjuvant Therapy in Newly Diagnosed and Recurrent High-grade Gliomas| |Study Start | Patients receive oral Boswellia serrata extract 4 times a day and oral cyanocobalamin (vitamin B 12) once a day for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. | Drug: Boswellia serrata extract | given orally Dietary Supplement: cyanocobalamin given orally Other Name: Vitamin B12 | Active Comparator: Arm II (control) | Patients in the control arm receive oral cyanocobalamin (vitamin B 12) once a day for 6 months. | Dietary Supplement: cyanocobalamin | given orally Other Name: Vitamin B12 - Change From Pooled Baseline in Peritumoral Brain Edema [ Time Frame: at 2 months ]The relative change from baseline will be assessed longitudinally, however, the main comparison of interest is the relative change at the 4-month evaluation.

The method used to calculate the time to tumor progression was Kaplan Meier test method to define the 95% confidence levels. - Time-to-tumor-progression: Percentage of Patients With Tumor Progression at 1 Year [ Time Frame: 1 year ]Percentage of participants with tumor progression (>25% increase in tumor volume compared to time 0) will be measured from enrollment to documented progression or death whichever comes first. The method used to calculate the time to tumor progression was Kaplan Meier test method to define the 95% confidence levels. - Overall Survival: Percentage of Patients That Were Alive at 1 Year [ Time Frame: 1 year. ]Overall survival will be measured from the date of enrollment to date of death or last contact. Survival will be evaluated by the Kaplan Meier method to evaluate the median survival and 1 year survival rates. - Food Intake as Assessed by the Block 98 Food Frequency Questionnaire and a 3-day Food Record [ Time Frame: At 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months ]The 3-day food diary will be used to assess the dietary intake and to increase eating awareness of patients.
