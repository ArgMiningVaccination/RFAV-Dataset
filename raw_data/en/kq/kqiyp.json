It may be scripted by a practitioner or audio tape. This may be used for pre-op preparation, pain management, relaxation, sleep, smoking cessation etc. Integrative imagery is a process where a practitioner guides the client through an imagery experience and then dialogues with the client throughout the experience. This is imagery on a deeper level as the client has deep interactions with their own images. It involves trust in the practitioner and assumes you have an inner knowledge from the mind & innate intelligence of the body. This process may be used to assist with healing, decrease pain, resolve conflicts, and expand awareness. We have partnered with Health Journeys to offer guided imagery: - To help you relieve stress.
