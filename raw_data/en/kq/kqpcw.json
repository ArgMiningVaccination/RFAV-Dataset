Today we all face issues on a global scale that are fundamentall y technical \u2014climat e change, ener gy resour ces, food production, genetic modification, and so on\u2014 and as such demand basic scientific literacy throughout our population so that wise decisions can be reached about how to addr ess these issues. Efforts have been made from both governmental and non-go vernmental platf orms to enhance the public understanding of science. The idea is to help science and a scientific cultur e penetr ate India 's socio- cultur ally diverse society , and to transf orm it into a nation of scientificall y thinking and scientificall y aware people. India has an impr essive scientific heritage. Scientific resear ch \u2014 in fields such as mathematics, astr onom y, medicine and material science \u2014 has been carried out in the Indian sub-continent since ancient times. However, a remar kable gap has persist ed betw een this scientific knowledge and the 'common ' man. It is important to build 'Scientific temper' in our country . 'Scientific temper'\u2014 a phrase mean an enquiring attitude and anal ytical appr oach that leads to rational thinking and the pursuit of truth without prejudice. Accor ding ly, the constitution of India has a special provision \"to develop the scientific temper , humanism and spirit of enquiry \". Resear ch in science education is of prime importance, as it leads to 'progress' in science education, which further leads to 'progress in science. ' The objecti ve of resear ch in science is essentiall y to achie ve progress in economic growth, social development and environmental protection. The vision of how 21stCentury skills primaril y focuses on student work to solve comple x problems, and on multiple forms of learning activity perf ormed by students such as gathering relevant information, collecting data, testing models, learning new concepts needed to understand the problem, etc. for producing an evidence-based solution to a problem rather than to labor atory-based science environments. It is important to provide interactive, participat ory, hands-on, inno vative and creative learning experiences to our students as real learning occurs outside classr ooms, text book s are only facilitat ors. Science exhibitions intend to provide a medium for popularizing science and incr ease awareness among the stak eholders about the close relationships betw een science, technology and society and encour age scientific and technological creativity among students. These exhibitions also entails sharing of cultur es other than inculcating a scientific temper among students by providing a common platf orm to schools, teachers and students to give shape to their inno vative ideas and learn from each other's experiences. These exhibitions must be based on creativity by culti vating knowledge and intelligence of the learners as ther e is no alternat e of practical knowledge to gain proper education in the field of Science and Technology . I am sure the students of schools affiliat ed to CBSE will go miles ahead in their quest for inno vation. Sh. V ineet Joshi, IA S Chairman, CBSEPrefaceScience ExhibitionCarl Sagan once said \"Some where, something incr edible is waiting to be kno wn.\" Nation 's progress depends on its population who could reason, think, experiment , anal yze and explor e. It is the role of school to inculcat e in their students skills to question, reason and think beyond their text book s. Creating a \"Wh y School\" where childr en have the freedom to ask why is the need of this century . Such schools can play an important role in building a progressive nation with scientific mind who has the spirit and will to challenge all religious or cultur al evils and practices. CBSE organizes science fair every year with this strong belief that something incr edible is waiting to happen and become visible through disco very, explor ation and experimentation. Every student should be moti vated and challenged. Schools are the right place to develop and retain this quest for enquiry . st Developing scientific temper in the student is the requir ement of 21 century and important for the growth of any nation. Our students are the nations' futur e and it is very important that they must learn to reason, question, test and anal yze problems in the right way. Albert Einstien once said that \"A person who never made a mist ake never tried anything new\" . Childr en should be given freedom and at the same time guided in right direction so that they can experiment , frame hypothesis and challenge existing hypothesis. Teachers must encour age, moti vate and guide childr en to perf orm experiments in the right way without fear of failur e. It is important to prepar e project under the guidance of a guide - who could be a teacher or parent/guar dian or may even be a resear ch scholar / scientist . Science exhibitions are important milest ones to develop such scientific temper in our students. Every project guide must ask students to select an appr opriat e topic for a science project , a topic that interests the student . Libr aries, book stores and definit ely internet can prove to be a great resour ce under guided supervision. R ecor ding inf ormation, making a good w ork plan and adhering t o time fr ames ar e other important steps. A well resear ched and well writt en explain, exhibit mak es all the difference. Presentation of exhibit to judges as well as to visit ors is most important and crucial part of any exhibition. Such exhibitions provide good exposur e and platf orm to learn and exchange ideas hence childr en should be encour aged to visit all exhibits and learn from others. As a teacher ment or it is very important , that we guide our students not to worry or get upset if they are not able to win a prize at the Science Exhibition. The skills they have gained are worth all the effort. Ascientist should be honest and fair to his findings and hence it is not the winning but the participation that also adds value. As a school head one must always encour age, support , and guide students to resear ch on the topic select ed. At the end I would like to highlight that all schools should keep all safety norms in mind and also adher e to all rules and guidelines provided by the Boar d at all times. Wishing you success at all times. Dr. Sadhana P arashar Director (A cademic, R esear Science Exhibition 2013-Themes 1-14 Organisation at R egional Le vel 2.

One such initiative refers to the organisation of Science Exhibitions at Regional and National levels every year. The activity aims at providing a common platform to schools, teachers and students to give shape to their innovate ideas and learn from each other's experiences. These exhibitions also intend to provide a medium for popularising Science and increase awareness among the stakeholders about close relationship between Science, Technology and Society. The main objectives of organising Science exhibitions can be summarised as: promoting interest in Science and Technology among younger generation. encouraging scientific and technological creativity among students and inculcating a sense of pride in their talent. providing exploratory experiences, encouraging creative thinking and promoting psychomotor skills among school students through self designed models or simple apparatus. encouraging problem solving approach and developing appropriate technologies, especially for rural areas and integrating scientific ideas with daily life situations. popularising Science and technology among masses and creating an awareness regarding its impact on socio-economic and sustainable development of the country. Taking into consideration the enthusiastic response from participating schools in the past, it was again decided to organise Science exhibitions for the year 2013. These exhibitions were organised in different parts of the country at Regional level in the month of August/Sept. and at National Level in the month of October, 2013. CBSE announced the dates for its Regional level Science Exhibition by publishing the circular at CBSE website www.cbseacadmic.in on 13th May, 2013. The main theme and sub- themes for this year's exhibition are: MAIN THEME - SCIENCE AND SOCIETY The six sub-themes were: Industry Natural resources and their Conservation Transport and Communication Information and Education Technology Community Health and Environment and Mathematical Modeling. Sub Theme - 1: Industry India has abundant natural resources and its economy depends largely on the proper utilisation of the resources. The industrial development of India over the past six decades of planned progress is indeed spectacular. The country is now, more or less, se lf-sufficient in the production of consumer goods and some basic items like iron, steel, and aluminium. Service industries like tourism and 16 banking are also growing. Power generation has been substantially stepped-up to fuel a variety of industries and infrastructure adequately built-up for the future progress. The potential for generating hydroelectric power in north-eastern part of the country has not developed because the region falls within a major earthquake zone. Among India's major large scale ind ustries are: Cotton and silk leather goods; paper, chemicals and fertilisers; pharmaceuticals; handicrafts etc. The knowledge based information technology industry is one of the most promising sectors in India. Sub Theme - 2: Natural Resources and their Conservations Earth natural resources are finite. It means that if we use them continuously we will eventually exhaust them. Conservation of natural resources preserves the ecological diversity and out life supporting systems - water, air and soil. India has abundant natural resources and its economy depends largely on the proper utilisation of these resources. Deforestation, overgrazing, indiscriminate mining and faulty tillage practices have led to serve soil erosion. Over irrigation and harvesting of agricultural lands have resulted into salinity of soil, water logging and land degradation. Overuse of tube-wells has substantially lowered down the underground water table. Industrial effluents, forest fire and unplanned growth have led to sever water and air pollution. Over 2.4 billion people lack access to proper sanitation facilities and 1.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water. Shortage of natural resources cripples public health system also. All conventional sources of energy are exhaustible. Development of conventional forms of energy for meeting the growing needs is the main task. In this scenario, we need to design, develop and innovate new and economically viable technologies to harness and conserve natural resources. This sub-theme is expected to made the children think of various ways and means for making efficient use of available natural resources. Sub Theme - 3: Transport and Communication The scientific and technological information available today has revolutionised worldwide means of communication, which plays a key-role in the growth and development in all walks of life. Tremendous developments in the field of transport and communication have been made to meet the growing demands due to increasing number of users. The communication network in the world has under gone a sea change with the use of satellite and other communication systems. These global changes have influenced the quality of life in our country. There has been a global expansion of electronic information in recent times. Use of Internet, fax, mobile phone, e-mail, have become a common day affair in all walks of life. The convergence of multiple communication systems have revolutionised learning and knowledge sharing. The objective of this sub-theme is promoting innovations in knowledge networks involving transport and communication technology in all segments of the society. Children need to reason and communicate to solve problems and to understand effective use of information and communication technology for a variety of purposes. 17 Sub Theme - 4: Information and Education Technology We live in a highly globalised and interconnected world. There has been a global expansion of electronic information in recent times. This has greatly helped in improving upon the quality of life. Today, computers and other electronic gadgets are being increasingly connected with each other through local area as well as global networks. Millions of computers in this world are connected to the Internet, facilitating the accessibility to information within a very short time. The task of management of information and its processing for development oriented information and inclusive society requires a fairly good amount of skill. With the use of information technology, education has become global. The objective of this sub-theme is promoting innovations in knowledge networks involving information and education technology in all segments of the society. Children need to reason and communicate to solve problems and to understand effective use of information and education technology for a variety of purposes. Sub Theme - 5: Community Health & Environment Health is an overall state of body, mind and social well being that implies to an individual and people. Out health is continuously under the influence of both endogenous (within) and exogenous (around) environment and therefore a matter of great concern especially in the rapidly growing society to cope up with newer scientific and technological inventions. When people are healthy, they are more efficient at work. The health is broadly affected by genetic disorders, infections and lifestyle but multi-factorial causes are more prevalent in case of many diseases The present sub-theme is proposed with the objectives to bring awareness among the youth about health and factors affecting our health, to explore new scientific, technological and bio-medical interventions in prevention and cure, to analyse the role of self and society in keeping our environment healthy in order to maintain good health and promote innovative ideas for better management. Sub Theme - 6: Mathematical Modeling Mathematical modeling is the process of transformation of a physical situation into mathematical analogies with appropriate conditions. Physical situation need some physical insight into the problem. It is a multi-step process involving identifying the problem, constructing or selecting appropriate models lighting out what data need to be collected, deciding number of variables and predictors to be chosen for greater accuracy, testing validity of models, calculating solution and implementing the models. It is an art, as there can be a variety of distinct approaches to the modeling, as well as science, for being tentative in nature. The process of registration for participation at Regional level Exhibition was initiated in the month of May, 2013. All 8 regional offices got tremendous response from the CBSE affiliated schools in their region. 18 S. No Name of the Region No. of Schools participated 1. Ajmer 145 2. Allahabad 182 3.

This will lead to conservation of raw materials like coal and petroleum for the production of electricity. As we are using an unlimited and an enormous source of energy i.e. lightning so only few strikes are enough for running a country 24X7. By receiving a continuous supply of electricity countries and states will become more developed which will make a better world. Advantages: The resource we are using is unlimited in quantity. By using this system a lot of fossil fuel could be conserved for other uses. The storage plant is highly efficient without any losses. There is a very low production cost. The property of storage system allows us to store electricity for long period of time. The processing system is highly stable that is it can stabilize large amount of electric current without any damage. Working: The system starts when lightning strike is received by the lightning receiving tower. This is just a simple tower with a thick copper antenna attached to a multi-stranded copper wire of minimum 10 cm in radius. The tower can be connected at the top of any building. Then the wire goes to the processing plant which processes it for storing it. The affinity of lightning strike falling on the tower is dependent on long the tower is. The longer the tower, it is more likely for the lightning to fall on the antenna. The storage system stores the electricity received from the processing system. After that we can utilize the electricity as per our needs. Future Use : This system can be setup in lightning prone areas like Meghalaya, India and Venezuela where 40,000 lightning strikes occur per night. If we can store even 10 Terawatts of electricity using that we can run whole India for about two years. Conclusion : Since a large amount of electricity is generated using lightning' many of the natural resources are conserved. It is also very cost effective as the cost required for making the power plant is the same as for a thermal power plant but also conserves the natural resources. Also the industries require a large amount of electricity for their progress and our project provide them with a lot energy to run their industries.

Name of the School: Rayan International School, Sector-39, Noida. 79 EXHIBIT No. 4 Theme: Industry Write Up: Objective/Aim: To demonstrate the working of an induction furnace by using the concept of electromagnetic induction and eddy currents. Scientific Principle Involved: ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION: When a piece of bulky metal is exposed to a varying magnetic field, which in turn changes the magnetic flux, then a voltage is generated in the piece of metal. Eddy Currents: When a piece of bulky metal is exposed to a varying magnetic field, causing a change in magnetic flux, then currents are induced in the piece of metal, in the form of loops, all over the volume of the metal, causing a heating effect in the metal. The induced currents oppose the cause producing it. Material Used: Copper Wire 18/20 no, soft iron rods, frame to support, porcelain pot, metal piece, magnets, connection wire, etc. Working/Investigation/Findings: When the magnetic flux is varied (by changing the magnetic field) through a region bounded by a soft iron core, then eddy currents are produced which oppose the cause of the changing flux. These currents produce a heating effect, which helps in melting the metal substance, enclosed in the vessel placed in the region of changing magnetic flux. Utility and further scope of the project: This model visualizes a better way to melt metals for industrial use without polluting the environment, and making minimal use of energy sources viz. fossil fuels and time.

Name of the School: Divine Child School, Mehsana. EXHIBIT No. 7 Theme: Industry Aim: To manage the plastic waste from microbial degradation. Preparation of carbon nano-tubes through plastic waste. Conversion of plastic waste into useful fuels. Cleaning the environment through plastic waste management. Problems: Plastic is required everywhere, that is in electronics, home appliances and many more. But plastic is harmful for flora, fauna and life. Current Solution: As we have seen that the rate of consumption of plastic has increased drastically it has given rise to another problem of plastic disposal. It has affected our environment to a great extent as: It is dumped in the marine sources. It is used in landfills. It is burned in the incinerator. Scientific principle: Microbial Degradation : Low density polyethylene (LDPE) is one of the major sources of environmental pollution. In the present study, the pieces of LDPE plastic bags were inoculated with bacterial strain, Bacillus subtilis and observed microscopically after 4 months. The breakdown of polymers result in formation of Carbon Dioxide which was examined using lime water. Carbon Nanotubes : Plastic is exposed to temperature of 700 C in presence of a catalyst Cobalt Acetate in an autogenic pressure tube which converts it into carbon nanotubes. The Chemical bonds within the plastic is completely broken down causing carbon in the plastic to grow as nanotubes. Pyrolysis : Mechanism behind pyrolysis is Initiation, propogation and termination. 82 Innovation: While isolating the bacteria it was observed that the bacteria has a degradation property. When put is soil it was noted that the bacteria forms a coating over plastic and gradually breaks the chemical bonds by utilizing the carbon present in the plastic. Carbon nanotubes are the backbone of nanotechnology and are very costly to produce but can be produced at only at a fraction of cost if produced with the help of waste plastic and have a wide range of uses. Further scope of the project: Saving environment is very important for the growth of any country and plastic has already polluted and degraded our environment. So use of plastic would be necessary in should be managed properly. Plastic can be modified to Organoplast which will be ecofreindly. Conclusion : Industrial production of Carbon Nanotubes and Bacterial Strain powder will provide fast and easy access to plastic waste management. If Bacterial strain powder is mixed with raw plast ics like PE, PVC etc. then we can produce organoplast which can be used industrially for further use. If the government initializes the construction of SSI (Small Scale Industries) for multipurpose plastic waste management then it would be a revolution in the history of plastic. Setup of Multipurpose plastic waste management industries will be very beneficial in future for generation of revenue.

Name of the School: Dalmia Vidya Write Up: GarbageManagement Poor garbage management is one of the biggest problems faced by the people of India these days. India is ranked at 71st position for the best place to live on earth. Our garbage disposal methods are one of the significant factors which contribute to the less attractive image of our country. Garbage: It is the waste material of any product household or industrial but the word refers more to household waste. Scientifically, these are those things which are not used since last six months, it could be anything. Garbage can be divided into two types: - Biodegradable and Non Biodegradable Biodegradable Garbage: These include those materials which can be decomposed. Non Biodegradable Garbage: These include those materials which cannot be decomposed. Cases showing generation of garbage and its process of recycling and usage of garbage CASE -1: Quintals of flowers and fruits gets wasted in worshipping; spreading diseases. The good thing about this is it is all bio-degradable. So, we will dig all those flowers and fruits making a patch over it which is connected to the dynamo with the help of pipe and also barometer to check the pressure of gases which would help to make electricity. Therefore when the waste gets completely decomposed, decaying gases will arises and get collected in the dome and by checking the ___ pressure of the gas we could generate a minimum of electricity to meet their monthly requirement of electricity. CASE 2: Gallons of milk wasted at Shiv temple in worshipping. According to the structure of Shivling at the outlet from where the milk goes out we will connect a pipe with two filters which will take out the impurities. Further this pipe will be connected to a tank in which we will save it for further use. 85 CASE 3: The endless plastic garbage Since it is a non biodegradable material we have to deal with it in a different manner. First, we will separate soft and hard plastics from the garbage. Afterwards they shall be washed properly and captain separate containers. Then we will add kerosene in both the containers and heat it by using animal waste such as cow dung which can be easily collected from the road sides. The plastic will be heated till it is melted. The melted plastic in both the containers will be then mixed together. This mixture will be then poured into silicon or any general moulds to give any desired useful shape. Suggested Model of Garbage Uses: Below we describe how we plan to execute the three scenarios of garbage recycling and its uses that we have discussed earlier in the project. Following is the said blueprint (set up) of our proposed ideas. We will take a table and attach metal planks of 4 inches to the sides of the table making a compartment. Then we will fill one-third of the compartment with water. The next step is to attach plastic bottles by sticking them so that they cover the complete area of the compartment and place them over the water in the compartment making them float. For the above, we can use old and used plastic bottles. After this we will place a plank of the same length and breadth of the compartment above the bottles. This will form a floating platform for our project. Then we will divide the platform into two equal sections. In the two compartments we will build two similar societies. One of the societies will be build showing the present conditions of our society and the other one showing a society after implying the suggested garbage recycling and usage methods in this project. Also, we will keep the soil containing decomposed flowers and fruits. This soil shall be made earlier as it is a slow process requiring a large amount of time. Name of the School: St. Paul's Sr. Sec.

Scientific Principle Involved : This system involves the usage of many bacteria, the process of sulphation, nitrification, reduction of BOD and chlorination along with standard process of sedimentation. Materials Used : Used plastic bottles, Cups, waste spring pipes, used wooden sticks, cut mica plates, lemon juice bleaching powder, motors, switches, wires. Working Investigation: The industrial effluents run into the pseudomonas tank that has perforated strands containing pseudomonas bacteria and E- coli bacteria's that break the hydrogen -carbon bond in the petroleum parts present in the effluents. Then the whole bacteria treated water runs into blender where the bacteria is mixed thoroughly and then the mixed water goes into sulphator where the effluent's sulphur compounds get solidified that settle down in the next sedimentation tank while the rest of the effluents move to the nitrobacter tube where the similar method used in pseudomonas tank is used here to mix the half-treated effluents to get converted into nitric acid and then to gaseous nitrogen and nitrates with the help of nitrobacter and nitrosomonas bacteria. Following this, the effluents are last treated in a chlorine tank that kill all bacteria in the water that next moves to the detector which if detects the bacteria sends the water for chlorination again and if not the water is used for non-domestical purposes like reusing in the industry, watering plants and in cleaning roads etc.,. Utility and Further Scope : This Effective Effluent Treatment System can be utilized in all industries to minimize and treat their effluents properly giving a new life to the waste water further to be used for non domestic purposes. The bacteria used up here also get killed during the process and therefore the remains will add humus to the soil. Nothing remains as a waste in this process.

EXHIBIT No. 18 Theme: Industry Write Up: MERCURY ABSORPING PAPERS Idea behind why we selected this Project: We decided to do this project to find a way to prevent the release of mercury into the environment from CFLs, industries and other man-made sources of mercury. The Problem we Face: The present world has become conscious of the impact we are having on the environment. We have stated using CFLs, and other instruments which are said to be more environmentally friendly than the old incandescent bulb. But the CFLs have mercury in them which makes them extremely hazardous to handle. The coal industry is the biggest producer of waste mercury, and with the increasing demand of electricity this problem will just keep worsening. To prevent the widespread damage caused by mercury on the environment we have prepared an innovative solution. Aim: To safely absorb mercury from its various sources and complex to form Cu2HgI4 (Copper Tetraiodomercurate). Chemicals Required : Copper sulphate, Potassium iodide Bunsen , Air-tight reaction unit. Related Principle: The principle related to this experiment is to prepare coordinate compounds. The mercury first reacts to form HgI 2. Then it further reacts forming HgI 42- ions. These ions react with the Cu+ in the solution to form Cu 2HgI 4. Procedure: Take 1:2 ratio of copper sulphate and potassium iodide respectively. Put the copper sulphate in a beaker with water and heat it on a Bunsen burner till it boils. Then add the potassium iodide to the boiling solution. Keep stirring till all the iodine vapours (violet gas) is completely removed. Then filter the solution present in the beaker. The filtrate obtained is copper iodide, and it is applied on any available paper. These papers are known as copper iodide papers. Then react this copper iodide paper with mercury vapours. We find that the copper iodide reacts to form brick red coordination complex compound called Copper Tetraiodomercurate (Cu2HgI4) Safety Measures: We must wear gloves, face-shields, respirator cartridge. Properties: PROPERTIES Compound Formula Mol. Wt. Appearance Melting Point Boili ng Point Density Exact Mass Utility o f the Project: Copper iodide paper can be used in factories for effective treatment and disposal of cfc bulbs. We can paste the copper iodide paper inside a heavy bottomed vessel which is air tight and when we keep a fused cfc bulb in it and it is crushed with the help of a crusher and heated, we find that mercury starts leaking and it is absorbed by the paper. Compared to the usual absorption with sulphur, this method is much faster.

Scientific Principle Involved: When plastic is heated to about 3750C-4150C in the absence of oxygen (pyrolysis), it becomes vapour which can later be condensed to obtain a liquid. When this liquid is distilled at around 800C, petrol like liquid is obtained. Materials Used: Steel reactor, Heaters, Distillation unit, Control panel, vapour delivery tubes, copper condenser tube, glass jars, Mineral wool for insulation and Supporting frame. Working I nvestigation/Findings: It is observed that, the unit performs efficiently and the final product obtained after fractional distillation can be used to run internal combustion engines. Half a kg of plastic yields around 200-250 ml of petrol like liquid. Utility and Further Scope of the Project: It proves to be a useful method for disposal of waste plastics locally and also helps to solve the problem of scarcity of automobile fuel. If the systemis produced on a large scale, the cost of manufacturing can be reduced. Also, the left over crude oil can be further distilled at round 2500C-3500C to obtain diesel like liquid. The chemical composition of various non-condensable gases released can be tested and suitable remedial measures could be taken to avoid environmental pollution. Other products like grease and tar can be separated and used for various applications. Name of the School: Jnanadeepa School, Shimoga, Karnataka. EXHIBIT No. 20 Theme: Industry Write Up: Project Overview: Refrigeration is defined as lowering the temperature of an enclosed space by removing heat from that space and transferring it elsewhere. Vapor- compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators as well as in many large commercial, industrial and automotive refrigeration systems. Following are some of the major problems with today's refrigeration systems: Many of these systems use HFC and HCFC refrigerants, which contribute to greenhouse gases and depletion of Earth's ozone layer. HFC refrigerants tend to be slightly less efficient than systems using HCFCs. HFCs have an extremely large global warming potential as they remain in 94 the atmosphere for many years and trap heat more effectively than carbon dioxide. Non- haloalkane refrigerants are gaining popularity and once-abandoned refrigerants, hydrocarbons (e.g. butane) and CO2 are being extensively used. Due to many moving parts, refrigeration systems need regular maintenance to fix leaks and icing, icemaker malfunction, cooling problems and replacement of fan motors. A modern energy-efficient model uses 350 kWh per year with ice maker turned OFF. When the icemaker is ON, then usage would double. Today's systems need a constant power supply. They are bulky, not easily portable and have limitations for use. These systems use air that is trapped inside when it is closed as a medium to cool the items. When the door is opened, the cool air is lost and the whole process has to repeat again, thus being energy intensive. The project aims to design an emission free, energy efficient, self-sustaining, light weight and cost effective refrigeration system that could be used for a longer period of time. Method and Experiments: The research and investigation into the above topics have helped to conceptualize, design and develop a working prototype model of an innovative system that has been used to test the key hypotheses of the project. The model leverages and combines modern eco-friendly technologies including nanotechnology, thermoelectric effects and solar energy into a single system. 95 Prototype Model: Cross section view The prototype model has been designed to utilize the following innovative concepts: 1. Thermoelectric Cooler/Peltier Cooler (TEC) and Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) technologies be combined into a single module and considered as an alternate for the vapor-compression unit. A lead acid rechargeable battery is used to power up the Peltier Cooler. Solar power will be used to as an external energy source to charge the portable lead acid battery. 2. A heat sink is used to prevent overheating of the Peltier Cooler and also helps to quickly conduct the generated heat to the Thermoelectric Generator. Heat dissipated from the Peltier Cooler is re-cycled by the Thermoelectric Generator to generate electricity and continuously charge the portable lead-acid rechargeable battery. This mechanism provides a self- sustaining energy cycle. 3. A Voltage Stabilizer is used to stabilize the power from the Thermoelectric Generator before it is supplied to the Peltier Cooler. 4. Water is used as a natural, eco-friendly coolant and a replacement for the harmful HCFCs and HFCs. A water pipeline runs all around the food storage compartment. Through convection, water will automatically circulate throughout the two layers of the food storage compartment. 5. The food storage compartment area is used to store food items. As the cooled water flows in between the two layers, the food storage compartment also cools down, therefore cooling down the food items stored inside the unit. An initial prototype model was developed and several experiments/trial runs were carried out using this model. The results/observations captured from the initial prototype were used to enhance and develop a second prototype. Trial runs using the second prototype are currently in progress. Name of the School: Delhi Public School, Bangalore. EXHIBIT No. 21 Theme: Industry Write Up: The objective behind this project is to create an ECO-FRIENDLY and a cheap refrigeration system which will be easily accessible to the rural people where electricity is not available or accessible in abundance. This project will be a positive step towards reducing carbon footprints. The project brings refreshment to the people of the rural areas. Scientific principles: Water heating is a thermodynamic process that uses an energy source to heat water above its initial temperature. Typical domestic uses of hot water include cooking, cleaning, bathing, and space heating. In industry, hot water and water heated to steam have many uses. 96 Evaporation is a type of vaporization of a liquid that occurs from the surface of a liquid into a gaseous phase that is not saturated with the evaporating substance. The other type of vaporization is boiling , which, instead, occurs within the entire mass of the liquid and can also take place when the vapor phase is saturated, such as when steam is produced in a boiler. Absorption is a physical or chemical phenomenon or a process in which atoms , molecules , or ions enter some bulk phase - gas, liquid , or solid material. Refrigeration is a process in which work is done to move heat from one location to another. The work of heat transport is traditionally driven by mechanical work , but can also be driven by heat, magnetism , electricity , laser , or other means. Materials required : condenser, generator, evaporator, absorber, separator, pipes, refrigerator case and iron plate. Working process of the refrigerator: Heat will be supplied to the generator. The heat would come from burning spirit lamp In the generator there will be a solution of ammonia and water. The heat would raise the temperature of the solution to the boiling point of ammonia. The boiling solution would flow to the separator. In the separator the water separates from ammonia gas. The ammonia gas will now flow upwards to the condenser. The condenser would be composed of metal coils and fins that would allow the ammonia gas to dissipate its heat and condense into liquid. The liquid ammonia would make its way to the evaporator, where it would mix with hydrogen gas & would evaporate, and would produce cold temperatures inside the refrigerator. The ammonia and hydrogen gas would flow to the absorber. Here, the water that has collected in the separator will be mixed with ammonia and hydrogen gas. The ammonia would form a solution with the water and would release the hydrogen gas, which would flow back to the evaporator .The ammonia and water solution would flow towards the generator to repeat the cycle Further Scope: This project ensures high coefficient of performance in absorption refrigeration system. This project is a unique gift to the people who live in areas with no electricity also the project is eco friendly and low cost which makes it affordable for even weaker sections of the society. The insulation process which is one of the main reasons for global warming will not be harmful for environment as we can use cyclopentane for insulating doors and cases of the refrigerator. This would cut its equivalent C02 emissions by 400,000 metric tons every year this change means that. This would cut greenhouse emissions by more than 80%, thus makes an appliance that ensures greener safer and healthier future earth. Unique Features: The unique features of this project (refrigerating system) are the following: This kind of refrigeration system can work without electricity The use of ammonia in absorption refrigeration is environmentally friendly as it has no cumulative effects on environment and has very limited atmospheric life time. The construction of the assembly is relatively simple and does not take much time.

Due to the technical limitations or inconvenience of recycling, only a fraction of that material resurfaces in new plastic products.The shifting of the resource base for organic chemicals from fossil fuels to renewable resources creates a unique opportunity for shifting plastics from their current unsustainable course to a more sustainable life cycle. Scientific principle involved : The process involves pyrolysis of waste plastics at high temperatures for breaking molecules and catalytic conversion followed by condensation to liquefy to get gasoline or diesel or aromatics. 99 Material Used : We require simple material to transform plastic to black gold which are a nichrome wire, a closed container with an opening on the top, a covering for the container with a hole to pass the vapor, some rubber tubes, another container to keep in the formed plastofuel, and an electricity port for the plastic to heat. The main thing which is required is HDPE plastic which is High Density Polyethylene Procedure followed : A non oxygen environment is created to melt plastic. Once it is melted i t creates vapours, the vapours are then sent through a cooling tube and it will condense to form fuel .The exit of the cooling pipe is taken to a bubbler containing water to capture the fuel. On the bottom of the cooling tube is a steel reservoir that will collect all the liquid and has a release valve on the bottom so that a liquid fuel can be poured out. Unique features of the exhibit : This device works on electricity and has six nichrome wires as heating elements. This process makes a liquid fuel that ca n be used as a multifuel, that means it can be used on diesel engines and also on gasoline engines. From 1 kg polyolefin plastic, 650 -700ml petrol along with LPG or 450 -500 ml aromatics along with LPG could be produced. Applications in different domains o f life : The shifting of resource base for organic chemicals from fossil fuels to renewable resources creates a unique opportunity for shifting plastics from their current unsustainable course to a more sustainable life cycle. It can be also used in the pri nciple of green chemistry. Using this a very high percentage of post consumer recycled content into safe and usable organic matter .Petroleum is considered as black gold because of its various uses in the life of common man, by generating fuel we can treat the waste which is generated from plastic industries which will not only strive to save the environment but also prove to be beneficial for the man. Future Scope of the Project : It has great scope in future. It generates the usable form of fuel which will prove to be a substitute of non renewable petroleum.

EXHIBIT No. 25 Theme: Industry Write Up: Reuse of waste and phytoextraction Subtheme: Portable cooler, e compost pit and phytoextraction of cadmium, copper and zinc using Indian Mustard ( Brassica juncea) Objective/Aim: Our project basically deals with e- waste management. Under this we have taken up two topics- reduction of the harmful impacts of e waste and the reuse of e waste to construct something useful. The aim of our project is to provide a cost effective way for the remediation and clean up of sites contaminated with heavy metals like lead, cadmium, arsenic, copper, beryllium, zinc, etc. At the same time, we have focused on creating a daily utility product from the e waste that keeps lying useless in our homes. 100 Scientific Principle involved: There are certain genes that code for the transport system in plants. These are present in all kinds of plants. However, there are certain plants called as hyper accumulators where genes known to code for the transport systems of heavy metals are constantly over-expressed when they are exposed to heavy metals. This genetic evidence suggests that hyper- accumulators overdevelop their metal transport systems. This is to speed up the root- to-shoot process limiting the amount of time the metal is exposed to the plant systems before it is stored. Material Used: all kinds of e waste like pc fans, mother boards, etc, wood, batteries, beakers, artistic materials Working investigation/findings: Through our research we found out that phytoextraction could be used as an alternative cost effective technology for the remediation of sites contaminated with heavy metals and it shows results within 30-35 days of plantation. At the same time we came to know that e waste can be turned into an asset through careful recycling and reutilization. Utility and further scope of the project: Our project has great scope for the future. With about 20 to 50 million metric tons of e waste discarded every year in our landfills and the increasing percentage of land being degraded due to the contamination by heavy metals, phytoextraction can come to our rescue. The plants like mustard, sunflower, etc. can be used for the remediation of degraded land, not only on large scale but also in private gardens and households. The cooler that we have made will provide you with cool air on a hot sunny day even if there is a power cut. At the same time, it encourages one that e waste could be turned into something productive instead of just being dumped into the bin. The e compost pit could be used for composting food and vegetable waste in our kitchens.

The machine is intended to be used in small scall industries, in villages and further in the kitchens of housewives in cities is highly expected to minimize the problem of husking, breaking and grinding coconut proficiently. Benefits of Coconut Coconut is fat free and therefore it can be used as a diet food for loosing weight. The amount of potassium present in coconut is twice that of banana. The coconut water is the purest liquid second to water; nothing can be so refreshing than the coconut water to beat the tropical summer. The coconut water is an excellent drink for the diabetic patients as it helps them to keep their sugar level in control. The risk of kidney failures is greatly reduced. If we drink coconut water regularly. It can also be applied to skin for a youthful look. It reduces hypertension and also helps our digestive system and excretion system to work efficiently. It is even good for heart and is advised to the heart patients to take regularly. It is the best natural remedy to improve perception and treat cancer. Benefits of the \"Nut Cracker\" The machine is an arrangement of husking, grinding and breaking coconut and extracting its water for commercial use. The machine would be made up of wood/bamboo or steel to lessen the utility of unbiodegradable substances. The source of energy would be either manual but effortless or automatic through electricity. The blades that would be inserted will be made up of steel or ion but will have a fine coating of grease to avoid rusting. Any size and type of the coconut could be cut simply through this machine. It is environment-friendly as no smoke or heat would be emitted by it. It is also economical less place occupying and less time consuming.

EXHIBIT No. 31 Theme: Industry Write Up: Management of Kitchen Waste of Hotels and Restaurants Title : Decomposition of biodegradable and non biodegradable things of hotels and restaurants Objective : To dispose off and utilization of materials like cooked food, uncooked food and plastic containers and packings of restaurants and hotels by converting them into manure and fuel respectively. 105 Scientific principle : The biodegradable garden waste cooked food and uncooked food of hotels and restaurants are converted into manure an d manure tea with the help of vermin composting (biological catalyst) and thermal decomposition The plastic waste such as plastic cans, pvc etc generated by hotels and restaurants containing petroleum plasticizers are converted into fuel by simply heating them and then condensing the vapors to form liquid which can be used for multiple purposes. To convert plastic waste into fuel we require -burner, conical flask, test tube and test tube holder, cock, bent tube and plastic pieces. Working : When we heat pla stic (pvc) in non oxygen environment it will melt not burn after it is melted it will start to boil and evaporate vapors of hydrogen chloride will be formed. Those vapors are to be passed through a pipe and when cooled vapor will condense to form liquid .w hile some vapors with shorter hydrogen chloride length will remain as gas. This makes a liquid fuel that can be used for multiple purposes and gas (hydrogen chloride) also has number of uses such as - production of HCL, production of detergent and cleaners and hydrogen chlorination of rubber etc. Material Used : For converting biodegradable waste such as cooked food and uncooked food into manure and manure tea we require - 3 containers carrying garden waste , cooked food , manure and manure tea respectively o ther than that we require citric acid , water burner , red worm, cloth , sunlight and connecting pipes. Working : first of all, the biodegradable waste such as cooked food, uncooked food is collected in a container. Then the other biodegradable materials such as mud, grass and soil is added. Some holes are made in the container as the decomposition of food requires oxygen and red worms are also used as they act as biological catalyst. The food gets converted into manure. The manure is kept in a sack and th e sack is kept in water. The nutrition from manure gets transferred to water. Which is being named as manure tea. The process does not lowers the nutritional level of manure similarly the manure tea can also be diluted which again does not lowers its nutri ents. Utility and future scope : The benefit of using cooked food, uncooked food and other biodegradable waste as compost material include reduction of overall waste and provide raw material and finished fertilizers. The benefit of using plastic for product ion of fuel gives results such as - conservation of non renewable of fossil fuels, reducing the consumption of energy used , reducing the amount of solid waste going to landfills , reducing the emissions of harmful gas like carbon dioxide into the atmospher e. 106 A campaign has also been started in our school under which, according to our model we are collecting the waste foil papers and bits of thrown food which gets accumulated in the school ground after the recess. The waste is being stored in separate containers and is being converted into non-refined petroleum and manure. Name of the School: Sri Aurobindo School of Integral Education, Sector-27A, Chandigarh. EXHIBIT No. 32 Theme: Industry Write Up: Optimum use of Industrial Exhausts gases Two main problems with petrol are: 1. It is non-renewable and will get exhausted very soon. 2. On burning petrol many harmful pollutants are released in the environment . 3. We need to find ways to reduce emission of carbon dioxide into atmosphere and a fuel which is renewable and causes no pollution that can replace petrol. Principle : The model is designed to separate and purify carbon dioxide from the main exhaust(rich in carbon dioxide).The carbon dioxide is purified and separated by the amine scrubbing proces s and can be used in various industrial processes and can be used to generate an alternate for petrol. Methodology: 1. Scrubber and separator are needed to separate and purify CO 2 from exhaust. 2. A storage tank to collect pure CO 2. 3. A bioreactor is needed to convert CO 2 into a fuel ( Isobutanol) . This conversion is possible with use of electricity, water, and a genetically modified bacteria (Ralstonia Eutropha H16) Apparatus: 1. Two large containers made of KALREZ material. 2. Monoethanolamine. 3. Glass bioreactor (with supply of electricity, water, and Ralstonia Eutropha H16). 4. Platinum mess as anode. 5. Anode surrounded by ceramic cup. Process: 1. The main industrial exhaust pipe of the industry is connected with the scrubber in which a cool solution of monoethanolamine is present. The CO 2 will be absorbed by amine solution and other gases will not react with it and other gases will be sent to the environment after pretreating. The solution left behind will be sent to the separator. The solution left behind will be sent to the separator and will be heated to significant temperature and pure co 2 will be collected in the storage tank. From this storage tank it can be used for various purposes. 107 2. The pure CO 2 will be sent to the bioreactor. Here a genetically modified bacteria Ralstonia Eutropha H16is present.

Name of the School: Shishu Niketan Model School, Write Up: Sagar Manthan-Oil spill collector Objective: An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially marine areas, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. The term is usually applied to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters . Crude oil and refined fuel spills from tanker ship accidents have damaged natural ecosystems in Alaska , the Gulf of Mexico , the Galapagos Islands , France and many other places . The quantity of oil spilled during accidents has ranged from a few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons Oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin oil slick which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. This can kill sea birds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms it coats. Oil penetrates into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Animals that rely on scent to find their babies or mothers fade away due to the strong scent of the oil. This causes a baby to be rejected and abandoned, leaving the babies to starve and eventually die. Oil can impair a bird's ability to fly, preventing it from foraging or escaping from predators. As they preen , birds may ingest the oil coating their feathers, irritating the digestive tract , altering liver function, and causing kidney damage. 108 Sagar Mantha n - Oil spill collector It Is based on different principles of Science: Chemical reaction Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen, and a thin passivation layer of aluminium oxide (4 nm thick) forms on any exposed aluminium surface. , Aluminium oxide is responsible for the resistance of metallic aluminium to weathering. This layer protects the metal from further oxidation. Law of floatation Law of floatation states that density of objects less than that of the liquid will float and the objects with density more than that of the liquid will sink. Viscosity Of fluids is the property of a fluid (liquid or gas) by virtue of which an internal frictional force comes into play when the fluid is in motion and opposes the relatiave motion of it's different layers. It is also called \"fluid friction\".The opposing force is called the internal frictional force or viscous force and this property of fluid is called viscity. Thick liquids like oil, honey,diesel etc., are more viscous . Thin liquids like water, alcohol, ol, are less viscous Causes of viscosity : It is due to the inter molecular forces which are effective when the different layers of the fluid are moving with different velocities. Thick liquids flow very slowly where as thin liquids liquids flow fast. Material Used: For making our project, we have taken a circular Aluminum disc of diameter approx 26 cm, a motor to rotate the disc, Aluminum strip to extract the oil from the plate. We have used all recycled things to make our project like old used cardboard, wood from old broken benches and aluminum from scrap. For the desired project: The prototype displayed here uses a plate of 26 cm diameter which rotates 50 times per minute collecting 980 ml (approx.) of oil. Working: In this project we require an aluminum plate which is attached to the sides of the ship, near the base so that it is half immersed in water. When the ship moves the coupled plates move along with it. The plates react with the oxygen in air and in water and turns to aluminum oxide making its surface rough, thus increasing friction on the surface. Oil being less dense floats on water. as viscosity of oil is far more as compared to water as oil is more viscous than water because of the strong intermolecular force of attraction in oil which causes more internal friction therefore more viscosity, it get attracted to the plate. As the plate rotates, a tunnel along with brushes at its sides collects the oil and pass it to the collector, where it can be reused. The unique feature of the project is a little step for the protection of our BEAUTIFUL ENVIORNMENT. 109 Utility: Sagar Manthan is a A low cost, Chemical free, Pollution free, Eco friendly and a Measure to save marine bio diversity. Name of the School: Delhi Public School, Sushant Lok, Gurgaon EXHIBIT No. 34 Theme: Industry Write Up: Ribbon retting-a cost effective and eco friendly technique for jute retting Objective : To produce improved quality and cost effective jute with integrated Mushroom Cultivation and Pisciculture. Scientific Principle: 1. Instead of stem retting process, ribbon retting is used as thin stripped ribbons of jute are much easier to ret than stems. Ribbon retting reduces time of normal retting by 4-5 days. Moreover, requirement of water for ribbon retting is almost half in comparison to conventional whole plant retting under normal condition. This also reduces environmental pollution to a great extent. But use of efficient pectinolytic microbial inoculums improves quality of fibre, further reduce the time of retting and the environment pollution. 2. The waste products of retting process is rich in cellulose and nitrogen, thus can be used as organic manure in the cultivation of mushroom. 3. The retting water is recycled by irrigating the jute fields with its. Material Used: Wooden base, Tray, artificial jute plants, soil, mushroom, artificial fishes and an aluminum sheet with holes signifying retting machine Working: Instead of conventional retting process, ribbon retting process is demonstrated in the model combined with mushroom cultivation and pisciculture in increase the overall profit of farmers and improve the quality of Jute. In ribbon retting, ribbons are stripped out from the stem of mature jute plants, coiled and allowed to ret under water bodies which farmers can create artificially by digging a hole and filling it with small amount of water. Ribbon retting ensures the overall quality, texture, and color of jute. Use of mixed bacterial cultures work as effective retting agents and help in reducing the time required as they have a measure of symbiosis. The saprophytic fungus (Sporotricchum) is capable of retting dry ribbons of jute under laboratory conditions. Lignocelluloses jute waste products viz. leaves, stick and caddis, can be used as substrates for the production of oyster mushroom due to their high cellulose and nitrogen content. 110 Retting-cum-pisciculture centre (CRPC) is demonstrated by the project. Fast growing cat fish can be raised to marketable size in four months-the period during which retting activities are undertaken. Retting is predominantly anaerobic and severe depletion of oxygen takes place, thus it has to restrict to air breathing species during retting time. Cultivation of the edible Mushroom is another potential field of utilizing lingo cellulosic waste for which a variety of agricultural and forestry residues are used. The easy availability and low cost of lingo cellulosic biomass has made it an important substrate for Mushroom production. Utility and Further Use of Project: 1. The ribbon retting method saves the farmers the cost of transporting jute to nearby water bodies as well as increased quantity of jute to be retted at a time than the conventional method. 2. This technique reduces dark coloring of fibres resulting from soil contamination and improves the poor retting practices which lowers the quality of fibres produced. 3. A number of low-cost bleaching agents like extracts from tamarind leaves, vinegar can be used. 4. In areas where there is shortage of retting waters, ribbon retting should be practiced. 5. The technique reduces water pollution. 6. Retting wastes can be used as a green manure, reduces handling and transport effort and thus lowers the costs. 7. Defoliation prior to retting in the field itself will reduce transport and increase the soil fertility. 8. Jute stick and caddies can be used in paper industry and biogas production.

Name of the School: Amrita Indo Canadian Academy, Ludhiana. EXHIBIT No. 38 Theme: Industry Write Up: Objective/Aim: Lifestyle changes in the modernized world have brought about a new era of waste generation. Waste management and recycling of resources has become the need of the hour. An exposure visit to the dumping ground of Chandigarh triggered questions in our mind regarding the recycling of waste PET bottles. The use and throw 113 plastic bottles in our water and cold drink industry is a major concern to the environmentalist. In fact 500,000 billion plastic bottles are thrown away each year across the world. Each bottle takes around 700 years to start to decompose and about 1000 years to get decomposed completely. The aims/objectives of our project are: To find a process that recycles PET bottles and reduces the load of solid waste on our planet. To propose a design for a textile spinning mill that produces polyester by recycling PET bottles thus, reducing the cost of production and conserving raw materials (PET) used. Scientific Principle Involved: Polyester, a common synthetic fibre used in the textile industry, is a category of polymers which contain the ester functional group in their main chain. Although there are many polyesters, the term \"polyester\" as a specific material most commonly refers to polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET consists of polymerized units of the monomer ethylene terephthalate, with repeating C10H8O4 units. The PET bottles used in beverages industry, being non-biodegradable add to the waste on the planet. But, since the bottles and polyester fibre belong to the same parent compound, the PET bottles can be recycled or re-polymerised to form polyester fibre. This reduces the cost of production in a polyester spinning industry and helps conserve raw materials (PET). Material Used: Plywood (for base), used thermocol sheets, used tins, bottles, paper cups, transparency sheet, PVC pipes, broken toys, 6V battery, switch, wire, paint, etc. Working Investigation/ Findings: PET used in the bottling industry amounts to about 30% of the total PET produced, while that used in textile polyester production is about 65% as shown in the table below: This 30% can be recycled into the textile industry by a simple process: The process involves the following steps: 1. Collection of waste bottles 2. Cleaning them (wash ing with caustic soda at 90\u00ba -95\u00baC) 3. Crushing them to produce PET flakes 4. Drying them to remove moisture (as PET is hygroscopic and absorbs moisture from the atmosphere) using a Vacuum drier at 180\u00baC for 5 -6 hours. 5. Gradual heating and melting in an e xtruder (260\u00ba -280\u00baC) (POLYMERISATION) 6. Forming synthetic PET fibres by passing through spinerette (4 denier) 7. Drawing and stretching them to produce thin fibres with the desired tenacity (1.5 denier) 8. Crimping them to avoid tangling of fibres 114 9. Cutting them to a pre-defined length 10. Spinning them on spinning mills to produce polyester yarn The main advantages of this process: 1. This reduces cost of production as used PET bottles are cheaper than buying textile PET from market source. 2. It recycles PET (used in bottles), thus helping in solid waste management and keeping the earth clean and green by saving landfill space, reducing greenhouse emissions and conserving oil needed to produce virgin PET. 3. PET used in beverage bottles is of a very good, food grade quality. This, in turn improves the quality of yarn produced. 4. Recycling waste properly helps improve health and economic conditions of waste collectors. Utility and Further Scope of the Project: The project finds immense utility in the textile industry. Recycling PET reduces the demand for virgin PET production. The caps that are removed from bottles can also be recycled to get coarse fibre that can be used for making carpets, mats, blankets etc. It can also be used to make other PET products like toys, pens etc. Increased awareness about PET recycling can help in organized collection, sorting at source and ensure a continuous supply of bottles to the mill.

EXHIBIT No. 14 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Name of harvesting also known as power harvesting or energy scavenging is the process by which energy is derived from external sources (e.g., solar, thermal energy, wind energy, salinity gradients, and kinetic energy), captured, and stored for small, wireless autonomous devices, like those used in wearable electronics and wireless sensor networks. Energy harvesters provide a very small amount of power for low -energy electronics. While the input fuel to some large-scale generation costs money (oil, coal, etc.), the energy source for energy harvesters is present as ambient background and is free. For example, temperature gradients exist from the operation of a combustion engine and in urban areas; there is a large amount of electromagnetic energy in the environment because or radio and television broadcasting. Scientific Principle: Conversion and Accumulation of Energy, Energy Harvesting is the process by which energy is derived from external sources like: Ambient Radiation Sources Photo Voltaic Piezo Electric Pyro Electric Thermal Magnetic Electrostatic Bio-fuels Bio-Energy Harvesting 127 Unique Features: One driving force behind the search for new energy harvesting devices is the desire to power sensor networks and mobile devices without batteries. Energy harvesting is also motivated by a desire to address the issue of climate change and global warming. Applications and Future Scope: Much of the effort in energy harvesting has focused on the transducer, to determine how to obtain as much energy as possible from a given energy field. As the technology matures the focus will shift to the new application enabled by energy harvesters. Low power electronics: New low power electronics will enable applications that were previously out of bounds. Large microelectronics companies such as. Texas Instruments are developing specialised power conditions chips that minimise power losses and make it easier for energy harvesting to be used as a source of power. Smart cities: Energy harvesting powered wireless will become ubiquitous, providing ever more valuable information that is used to enable improvement to transport, health, and infrastructure. Biological systems: Power from breathing or blood pressure could power ultra low power medical implants. Researchers at Southampton University hospital have developed an experimental pace maker that is able to draw 1/3 of the power if requires from blood flow.

EXHIBIT No. 21 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Bio Reator Algae - An ideal Fuel Supplement Aim & Objective: Algae can be used as an alternative resource for fuel. They consume CO 2 and regulate global warming and bring down omissions to 0% Wastewater can be utilized. 131 Oil, Environmental, economic, food and employment crises can e reduced. Scientific Concept: Locally available species can be used for this purpose. It is not useful for consumption. They have a faster growth rate. It has lipid content of about 2%-4%. The algae have the potential to supplement the demands of fuel in the modern era. The lipid content can be extracted and converted into biofuel in the similar methods used fo r extraction of vegetable oils. Algae are an excellent source of bioremediation. The residue can be used as feedstock in the form of cakes. Principle: Algae, like other oil yielding products, use photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. They store this energy in the form of oils, carbohydrates and proteins. Algae are among the most photo synthetically efficiently plants on earth. The plant oil can be converted to biodiesel. The annual productivity and oil content of algae is far greater than seed crops. It contains between 2% to 40% of lipids or oils by weight. It can grow anywhere in freshwater as well as salt water. The Rhodophyta (Red Algae) are a good source of oil and ecologically significant as primary producers. They even are the providers of structural habitat for other aquatic organisms. Steps Followed: Algal spores are grown in photobiorectos where suitable conditions are provided to them to grow. Then, after they grow in size. they are transferred to the open ponds where natural nutrients are provided to them in the form of sewage. This waste water in turn gets treated and is sent for purification. In the next step, the algae are harvested and are dried with the help of stack system. After the algae are dried, they are collected and the oil is extracted by using screw press which produces 70%-75% of the oil from the plant. This oil is suitable for use but can be refined even further by using certain chemicals which can either be acids, bases or alkoxides. Now finally the oil is ready to use in diesel engines but in our case, in the thermal power plants The green house gases released are collected by incinerators and converted to unable forms. Conclusion & Further Scope: The production of biodiesel by synthesizing algae has a bright future in the nearest future and can be an effective and efficient way to counter the oil crisis. It has multiple benefits both in the direct and indirect ways. The residue so formed can be a nutritional feed for the cattle as well as fertilizers. The carbon emissions can be collected and synthesized to 132 form carboxylic acids and even to CO can be oxidized to form CO 2 for providing the same to the growing algae. Now, this fuel is being used for industrial purpose but with further research and government support, this fuel can be diverted helps in growing them well as they belong to the concerned ecosystem and are seldom harmful to the other flora and fauna. Moreover, this is cost- effective and can help overcome the oil/energy as well as the economic crisis. Name of the School: DAV Public School, Ganjam, Odisha. EXHIBIT No. 22 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Water- the elixir of life Water scarcity is fast becoming urban India's number one woe, with government's own data revealing that residents in 22 out of 32 major cities have to deal with daily shortages. More than 80% of water needs of the country are met by exploiting the ground water resources of India. This has aggravated the depletion of water table, and led to an unprecedented water shortage. More than 75% of the water resources available in India are used for agricultural purposes. Since most of the modern technologies are in its nascent stage in India, irrigation is still carried out in the traditional way. Lack of planning and coordination has led to the failure of numerous water treatment projects. Reclamation Process: Wastewater must pass through numerous systems before being making it available for use. Here is a partial listing from one particular plant system: Barscreens - Bar screens remove large solids that are sent into a grinder. All solids are then dumped into a sewer pipe at a Treatment Plant. Primary Settling Tanks - Readily settable and floatable solids are removed from the wastewater. These solids are skimmed from the top and bottom of the tanks and sent to the Treatment Plant where it'll be turned into fertilizer. Biological Treatment - The wastewater is cleaned through a biological treatment method that uses microorganisms, bacteria which digest the sludge and reduce the nutrient content. Air bubbles up to keep the organisms suspended and to supply oxygen to the aerobic bacteria so they can metabolize the food, convert it to energy, CO 2, and water, and reproduce more microorganisms. This helps to remove ammonia also through nitrification. Secondary Settling Tanks - The force of the flow slows down as sewage enters these tanks, allowing the microorganisms to settle to the bottom. As they settle, other small particles suspended in the water are picked up, leaving behind clear wastewater. Some of the microorganisms that settle to the bottom are returned to the system to be used again. Tertiary Treatment - Deep-bed, single-media, gravity sand filters receive water from the secondary basins and filter out the remaining solids. As this is the final process to remove solids, the water in these filters is almost completely clear. 133 Chlorine Contact Tanks - Three chlorine contact tanks disinfect the water to decrease the risks associated with discharging wastewater containing human pathogens. This step protects the quality of the waters that receive the wastewater discharge. One of two procedures is then followed according to the future disposal site: 1. Reclaimed Water Pump Station - The pump station distributes reclaimed water to users around the City. This may include cricket pitches, agricultural uses, cooling towers, industries, houses or in land fills. 2. Water is passed through high level purification- Reverse Osmosis to make it fit for portable purpose s. Conclusion : The project in itself is an effort by the students to reduce and provide a solution to the shortage of water in India. This project, through the means of science, can help solve one of the biggest issues of worry of not just the nation, but the entire globe. Benefits: Water reclamation provides enormous environmental benefits. It also provides an additional source of water for various purposes. This a list of some benefits that water recycling can present. Water reclamation decreases the extraction of water form sources that may be dwindling and may stop being viable as habitats for valuable and endangered wildlife. Reclaiming wastewater can decrease the discharge of effluents that may damage and pollute the ecosystems of the sensitive bodies of water. Reclaimed water can be used to create new wetlands or to enhance and improve the quality of existing ones. Water reclaimed can reduce and prevent pollution by leaving damaging pollutants at the treatment plant. Even though this project involves a huge investment cost in the initial stages, but the recurring maintenance costs is less as there is only one time investment of setting up the apparatus. The only cost required is the cost of cleaning the chambers, refilling the chemicals etc. This cost is worth investing as it helps solve the problem of water scarcity of an entire city in one setup.

EXHIBIT No. 24 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Eco Friendly House Introduction: The prosperity of human civilization is based on harnessing the natural resources that Mother Nature has blessed us with. Since last few decades the competition amongst different nations to excel in various fields has resulted in the over exploitation of these precious resources. Time has come to harness these resources in a judicious manner. Our model of modern house consists of doubled walls (inner is thin layer of good conductors of heat) in between these two walls runs a network of water pipes containing thermo-regulated water to maintain the room temperature. Objective/Aim: The aim of this model is to increase the use of self generated solar electricity within a house, its practical application in various domestic activities, rain water harvesting and using the harvested water for various purposes like watering kitchen garden, supplying water fo r daily use and regulating the temperature of the house by an innovative mechanism. A setup of earthquake shock absorber has also been installed in this house which will minimize the tremors and destruction caused by the shock waves. It is a model of self sufficient eco friendly house which contains roof top solar panels to meet the energy requirement of the house. Roof top rain water harvesting installation not only provides water for daily usage but also it has been used in n innovative manner to regulate the temperature of the house. Scientific Principles Involved: Scientific principles followed in this project are as follows: Co-efficient of thermal expansion of different metalsare different which is used to make bimetallic strip for fire alarm. Water has high specific heat capacity due to which it can withdraw or impart more heat energy which helps to regulate room temperature. Rainwater harvesting is the practice of collection, storage and usage of roof top rain water for daily house hold purposes as well as for agricultural purposes. 135 Filtration is commonly the mechanical or physical operation which is used for the separation of solids from fluids (liquids or gases) by interposing a medium through which only the fluid can pass. Oversize solids in the fluid are retained, but the separation is not complete; solids will be contaminated with some fluid and filtrate will contain fine particles (depending on the pore size and filter thickness). Filtration is also used to describe some biological processes, especially in water treatment and sewage treatment in which undesirable constituents are removed by absorption into a biological film grown on or in the filter medium as in slow sand filtration. A shock absorber is a mechanical device designed to smooth out or damp shock impulse, and dissipate kinetic energy. It reduces the destruction caused by the shock waves of an earthquake. Photovoltaic modules, commonly called solar modules, are the key components used to covert sunlight into electricity. Solar modules are made of semiconductors that are very similar to those used to create integrated circuits for electronic equipment. The most common type of semiconductor currently in use is made of silicon crystal. A greenhouse is a structural building with different types of covering materials, such as a glass or plastic roof and frequently glass or plastic walls; it heats up because incoming visible solar radiation (for which the glass is transparent) from the sun is absorbed by plants, soil, and other things inside the building. Air warmed by the heat from hot interior surfaces is retained in the building by the roof and wall. In addition, the warmed structures and plants inside the greenhouse re-radiate some of their thermal energy in the infrared spectrum, to which glass is partly opaque, so some of this energy is also trapped inside the glasshouse. However, this latter process is a minor player compared with the former (convective) process. Thus, the primary heating mechanism of a greenhouse is convection. Lightening conductor works on the principle that whenever a charged cloud (-ve) comes near to a conductor, it induces an opposite charge (+ve) into it. Due to small area of the spikes, the charge density becomes very high which ionizes the air above it. The positive charge moves towards the cloud and neutralizes it. Materials used: 1. Plywood 2.

EXHIBIT No. 25 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Generation of electricity using pressure on mechanical bumpers Objective/Aim: Production of Electricity by application of pressure on a bumper on the high ways. Scientific Principle Involved: Generation of electricity by rotating a DC Generator with the help of spring and gear system. Material used: LDR Circuit, Wooden Board, LED, Choke, DC Generator, Gera System. Working: A small mechanical bumper is designed in such a way that when a vehicle goes over it, it pressurizes a small spring system which rotates to move an armature (in about 2400 rpm) coil to generate electricity. The electricity generated is passed through DC voltage filtering unit and is used to charge a battery. A shadow sensing unit is so designed that when shadow falls in it (at night generally) the circuit is completed with the battery and the street light glows. That electricity we can use in many purposes. Calculations (Power Generated by a single bumper): At each pressure applied the axil of the DC motor rotates with 2400 rpm It produces a current of 12mA (Mili Ampere) Therefore when each car passes electricity generated = 24 mA. In about 1 minute about 10 car passes. In 60 minutes (1 HR), No. of card passes = 60x10=600 In one day (24 hours) No. of cars passing = 24x600=14400 Therefore electricity produced = 14400 x 24mA=345600mA=345.6A Therefore power generated in one day (P) = I x V (Electric Current x Voltage) (If the battery is of 4V) = 1.5x345.6 watt = 518.4 watt 137 Utility and further scope of the project: 1.

EXHIBIT No. 26 Theme: Resource & their Conservation Title: Multistoried Hydroponic Farming Objective: To develop an alternative agricultural method for area containing less fertile soil. Related Principle: Hydroponics is a method of cultivating plants using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil. Terrestrial plants may be grown with their roots in the mineral nutrient solution only or in an inert medium (coconut husk, gravel). Working: In Hydroponics, Mineral nutrient solution (tailor made for each plant for their maximum growth) is introduced to the plant roots by various means. The plant roots directly absorb the requisite amount of nutrient required for their growth from the water. As the plant gets the exact amount of all the 20 macro and micro nutrients it requires for maximum growth, we get maximum yield from each plant, much more than what we get in traditional soil agriculture (Geoponics). In a multistoried building, the environment is partially controlled. The hydroponic tanks or pots are placed at the sides of the building floors enabling them to get direct sunlight for a part of the day. Any deficiency in sunlight (if any) is met by artificial lights. In Tube Hydroponics, a constant flow of nutrient solution is maintained, at a very slow rate. In Tank Hydroponics, nutrient solution is placed and the plants are placed on a wire mesh such that their roots can absorb the nutrients. When the solution is used up, it is replaced. The water used in hydroponics is recycled and reused for the same purpose. Diagram/ Photo utility: Cost and Further Scope: The profit generated by each floor is firstly huge. The profit per floor, as established before is huge, and with this multistoried farm, it is multiplied 10 times. Hydroponics can be safely termed as the Farm of the Future. With the ever increasing population explosion, land 138 shortage, destruction of fertile lands, in the near future, we will be left without any fertile land for agriculture. The food crops produced by traditional soil agriculture will not be enough to feed the world populations. Hydroponics is a safe, cheap and effective solution. In the future vast stretches of desert land, Arctic wastelands, inhabitable places like Antarctica, parts of Greenland can hous e Multistoried Hydroponic Farms.

EXHIBIT No. 32 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Black Gold Cultivation Objective/Aim: To improve the fertility of the soil, increasing the nutritious quantity in the plants and last but not the least enhancing the water binding capacity of the soil. Why this project? Our India is an agricultural based country. Large no. of farmers are depending on the agriculture, but due to the repeated production of the crop the life span of the soil (Max. 2 yrs.) and water holding capacity of the soil is decreasing day by day, this is because the plants feed on the minerals and nutrients present in the soil. This will make the soil to loose its fertility and the soil becomes loose and finally this effects the crop production. Now days in order to overcome this problem and to get more crop production farmers are depending on the artificial fertilizers. These artificial fertilizers in long run will still degrade the soil fertility, make's the soil to loose water retaining capacity and in no matter of time the soil (land) will become barren, which will be unfit for agriculture. So, here is my natural! and low price solution to the above cited problem (i.e.,) my project on the CHARCOAL. How does the nutrition levels in Plants & Soil fertility increases? During the short life span of time, microbes into the soil release the different types of organic enzymes which increases the fertility. After their life span, microbes dies in the soil itself only degrades and become rich organic manure for the soil, that will contains high quantities of H, CH & O. There will help to increases the nutritious levels of the plants_______ But the problem is that plants cannot observe & fix H, N, C & O directly from the atmosphere. By this process we can make the plants to fix there required things though the soil. Hence by this the nutrition's levels in the plants enhances like never befoul. 142 Conclusion: Hence we can conclude that by opting this innovative & low cost method farmers can gain huge profits, life time of the soil will increases, there will be no degrade in the fertility of the soil. Water can be retained by the soil for longer periods of time. And quality of the production will be increased. Name of the School: Delhi Public School, R.R. District, A.P. EXHIBIT No. 33 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Effective Use Of Solar Energy/Automated Street Light Objective: To operate the street lights automatically. Principle: Motion sensing and light sen sing . Working: The light sensor checks the light intensity in the atmosphere, and depending on the amount present in the surrounding, it sends an input to the micro -controller whether light is needed or not. This is then followed by the next stage of the process, when it receives an input from the motion sensor as well, telling the micro -controller if there is motion on the road. Thus, the street lights only switch on when both the conditions are satisfied. When either one is not satisfied, the lights are not switched on.

The project was also educative to understand the intricacies of the refrigeration cycle. The project also brought out the various complexities of work and energy transmission. It also taught the nuances of engineering design process, wherein every step involved saving energy and cost at every stage and avoid inefficiencies and wastages.

EXHIBIT No. 35 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Water sensitive urban design to mitigate water shortage Project Objective : Our project is to redesign the water closet/flush to reduce the consumption of water, currently at 6 to 12 litres per flush to just 3 litres per flush. We make this possible with a simple mechanism added to the conventional closet that will create a partial vacuum when the user pushes down the flush lever (a foot operated lever/pedal may be needed to use this). This vacuum will partially suck the excreta out any thereby reducing the dependence on the flushing action to remove the excreta. Working Investigation/Findings: Summary : From our experiment, We found that in order to create a 50% drop in the overall water used in the toilet per flush, the amount of water needed to force out the excrement and the amount of water required to replace the water in the extended U -tube both had to be taken into account, and we found that the volume of water required for the full scale model of the extended U -tube was 1600 cubic centimeters or rather 1.5 litres, which would allow for the flushing out of 1.4 litres with the excrement if a 50% drop is intended, bringing down the overall consumption from 6 litres to a mere 3 litres. Observations : The experiment we conducted were immensely insightful and helped us understand the various complexities in an otherwise simple-seeming design. Although the design may seem rather straight forward, we found there to be a lot of variables involved in the actual practical working of such a design: Diameter of the flush outlet: Timing the release of the right quantity of water with the suction action of the piston. We found through our experiments that the outlet of the water from the flush tank into the bowl played a crucial role in the flushing of the matter. If the hole was too big, all the water would be released too quickly and would not be timed with the suction action of the piston, therefore proving to be rather inefficient in terms of flushing larger loads. But if 145 the hole were to be too small, the overall volume of the water entering the bowl at the crucial moment of the descending of the piston would not be enough, again proving to be inefficient in terms of flushing loads Style of water flowing into the bowl: The conventional spiral style of water flowing into the bowl proved to be the best, because it cleaned the walls of the toilet along with serving the purpose of providing a 'pushing' force. Various other types were tried, like directly letting the water down; none of them were as effective at both tasks as the above. Consistency of the excrement: it's commonly accepted thing that excrement comes in various different densities and consistencies, from the 'bristol stool chart' we were able to test the prototype with various close substitutes for the excrement. Some of which floated, some suspended and some sunk, this made the whole ordeal rather hard to flush down with the same efficiency, but eventually this problem was overcome by widening the piston chamber and adding some more water to the flush system. (still under 3 litres) Quantity of the excrement: We also tested our prototype with various quantities of excrement substitutes and even matched it to the standard of that of conventional toilet manufacturers. Although, this aspect of it may need a little more development. Conclusion: In conclusion, the Eco-Toilet can drop the water consumption of a toilet by roughly 50% and still prove to be just as efficient. With a little more research and development, the \"Eco-Toilet\" design can be modified in such a way that it doesn't use water at all with the help of bio-fertilizers. The various manufacturers of water closets can incorporate this design and phase out the old design to eventually completely get rid of all the old wasteful designs. In a span of 20 years, close to 60-70% of the world's toilets can be of this design and eventually one day, practically all toilets will be \"Eco-Toilet\". This will reduce the load on water on our sewage systems & water recycling plants in each city and conserve water. It will also reduce the amount of polluted water entering our water ways & seas from city drains. Name of the School: Bala Vidya Mandir Sr. Sec. School, Chennai, T.N.

This method does not use any kind of conventional source of energy. The presence of sunlight in abundance makes this model both ecologically and economically viable. This model aims at improving the existing sewage/impure water treatment plants by developing an alternate way of water purification. Scientific Principle Involved : The principle of this model is basically divided into two parts. The first part uses the principle of filtration and adsorption based on the difference in the particle sizes. The second part uses the principle of solar concentration using a concave mosaic mirror. The concentration of sunlight creates enough heat required to distill the sewage/impure water. The distillation flask is placed at the focus of the mirror which creates a temperature of about 160 \u00b0C. Materials Used: The Mosaic Mirror: Constructed using a dish antenna on which several pieces of plane mirror each measuring 2\"x2\" are stuck using adhesives forming a concave mosaic mirror. Support system : The support system comprises of a stand made out of pipes for the filtration unit, 2 wooden planks for filtration bottles and mosaic mirror respectively. Filtration unit: Comprises of 2 filtration bottles in which activated charcoal and sand are placed respectively, to act as natural filters. Distillation unit: Comprises of a specially designed flask made of borosil glass with a rubber cork held into place with the help of an iron stand. The spout of the flask is attached a rubber pipe which is connected to a condenser which is again connected to the mouth of a flask which acts as the collector. Extra Materials Used : Rubber pipes, bottles, M-seal, tape, rubber corks, etc. Working of the Model : The model consists of following units: 1) Filtration unit; 2) Distillation unit; 3) Condensation unit; 4) Solar Concentration unit. The working of the model begins by pouring of sewage/impure water into the filtration unit, which is placed at a certain height. The filtration unit consists of 2 step filtration, by activated charcoal and by sand. After filtration, the water passes through transparent rubber pipes and flows into the distillation unit. The distillation unit comprises of a distillation flask, whose base is placed at the principle focus of the solar concentration unit for heating by solar concentration. The solar concentration unit consists of a mosaic concave mirror to which is fixed an iron rod for holding the distillation unit; and a stand. After heating the pure water leaves the distillation unit in the form of 150 vapor leaving behind the impure residues in the distillation flask, and then enters the condensation unit. We finally collect this water in the collector placed at the bottom of the solar concentrator. Research and Findings: Few important parameters for testing purity of water: pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Organisations As per the KSPCB, distilled water satisfies the above parameters: pH - 7, TDS - <5, BOD - Nil, Total Hardness - Nil , E-Coli - Nil, Coliform Organisms - Nil This water can be tested from KSPCB authorized centres like EnviPro for further verification. Utility: This model is an improved version of the current sewage/impure water treatment plant. As this model uses solar energy, it does not require any kind of fuel. This model can be used in industries, government projects, apartments etc. for the recycling and purification of sewage or impure water. The purified water can be used in automobiles, laboratories, etc. The mineral residues left after distillation can be used for industrial purposes. The organic residues left can be used as manure for agriculture. Further Scope for Improvement: 1) Model can be made automatic to reduce manual labour. 2) Model could be improved so as to accommodate larger volumes of water. 3) The concave mosaic mirror can be converted to a large parabolic reflector for efficient and faster heating. 4) The tracking system can be made automatic so as to keep track of the Sun. 5) Water can be mineralised so as to make the water potable. 6) Apparatus can be made of copper and can be blackened to increase the heating.

We also wish to investigate some simple methods of converting the stalk into solid fuel source that is, production of bio-energy in the form of ethanol and electricity from the lignocelluosic component of the halophytes. Utility and Further scope of the Project: 1. Unique Features of the Exhibit Seawater farming is a relatively unknown facility in India although, various ventures have been started off the coast of Abudhabi, Mexico. It is still in its infancy stage. India being a Peninsula has excellent potential to harness seawater for farming. Our project will thus illustrate the hitherto less known technique of seawater farming. 2. Application in Different Domains of Life Seawater farming has immense benefits. Salicornia, also known as sea asparagus is hardy, grows well in extreme heat and requires only saltwater. They absorb the salt from the water and reduce the salinity of the soil. They fix the carbon in the air by photosynthesis thus helping in reducing pollution and maintaining ecological balance. Biodiesel production from Salicornia has immense benefits. They do not consume valuable freshwater or take up cultivable land, which are the common criticisms against other biofuels like corn oil or palm oil. Development of biofuel from Salicornia is also beneficial as it releases less carbon than it consumes through photosynthesis. 3. Future Scope The world's biofuel market is expected to grow by 20% annually and the shift towards the use of environmental friendly biofuels has already started. Corn oil and other biofuels obtained from crops grown in arable land have face criticism that they use up the agricultural land. Thus salicornia farming using sea water and biodiesel production can help the world make a transition to low carbon fuel usage while still protecting the environment. a) Cellulose hydrolysis: the crystalline structure of cellulose makes it difficult to hydrolyse it to simple sugars. Researchers are developing enzymes which breakdown cellulose easily. b) Pentose fermentation: Yeast and bacteria ferment most 6 carbon sugars but 5 carbon sugars like Pentose cannot be fermented easily. Researchers are using genetic engineering to design microorganisms that can effectively ferment both 5 and 6 molecule sugars at the same time. Conclusion : At this stage biofuel from halophyte seeds is already being produced. So once all these roadblocks in the process of bioenergy (biogas, biofuel, electricity) production from the cellulosic components of halophytes are removed, this will create a revolution in the production of biofuel and bioenergy, using only seawater as the raw material.

EXHIBIT No. 59 Theme : Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Zero Energy Buildings in India Aim: To prove the relevance of autonomous energy generation on site along with natural resources and energy conservation through HVAC and passive systems, i.e. Net zero energy concept in India. Scientific Principle: Passive systems, HVAC, photo-voltaic and wind power generation, gray water recycling, energy conservations through insulation and green roofing, usage of energy efficient devices. Material Used: Solar panels, acrylic (plastics), wood, glass, steel, paint, wires, foam, LED's, concrete, sand filter layers Findings: The project on Net - Zero turned out to be successful. the concept of net zero is a viable one but our downscale calculations show that perfect net zero is still not very achievable but can be approximated to a great extent. 165 Solar panel costs have reduced by 72% over a period of 7 years (2005-12). Only 4% of the global area needs to tapped for solar energy to fuel the entire world. HVAC (Heating Ventilation Air Conditions Systems) like insulation of wall and glass, help conserve power by reducing total heat loss and maintaining an average temperature at all times. Wind energy contributes to 1.6% of overall power generated and has great potential for development over large area in India. Energy saving devices, especially LEDs, help reduce our energy consumption and have a longer lifespan, ensuring that over a period of time we have to spend lesser on electricity as well as on actually buying them. They are becoming more pre - dominant in markets today. Gray water recycling aims to substantially reduce our water consumption by a mechanical filter for reuse in non - contact activities like irrigation, toiletry and cooling. Utility and Further Scope: At the present rates of fuel consumption, global warming and pollution, the concept of Net Zero Energy will be a very viable solution to high electricity and fossil fuel costs and the need for a clean energy revolution. Awareness must be spread to make people realize the necessity of such a style of living in the future. They must be assured that though the initial costs are high, it will repay itself through savings within a few years and then only profits follows.

EXHIBIT No. 60 Theme : Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: MotorGen Technology Abstract : We have developed a technology that can free of cost electricity (at a setup cost only) for a long period of time. This is the \"Motor Gen Technology\". It has the capability to produce an electric output by a generator which is driven by a smaller motor. Nor if we start the motor it rotates the generator which produces a voltage and is stored. After some time when the battery is fully charged it powers the motor again and again the output is stored. This cycle goes on, and to prevent energy loss's we have applied some ingenious methods. Working : First we provide current the coils of the motor. They create a magnetic field perpendicular to the magnetic field lines of the permanent magnets and according to the left hand rule, there is motion produced. We call it RPM (rounds per minute). Now this motion is transferred to the generator. The coils in the generator move in a rotary fashion. Theses coils cut the magnetic field lines of the permanent magnets in the generator so that an induced EMF (electromotive force) is seen. This induced EMF is larger than the input electricity. 166 If we see the electrical input and output it seems impossible but if we consider the working there are more than one inputs working inside the mechanism. Future improvements and scope : Right now this device is very bulky and very heavy to carry also the amount of energy produced is very less. Name of the School: Gyan Bharti School, Saket, New Delhi.

Definitely we are taking benefit from these natural resources. Bio - degradable Non - biodegradable Which degraded easily Which is not degraded easily For Ex. Wood, plants, paper etc. For Ex. Plastic, acids etc. To treat the wastage we have to separate it and that takes huge amount of money. Working: In this model we show that how we can manage the household wastages solid and liquid separated by bar screen. First of all from household garbage water and solid waste is separated by bar screen. In this water is allow moving forward but the solid wastage stop here and send into the vermi composting tank where earthworms are used to prepare the manure for fields. The liquid gone in the water purifier tank where water is purified. (This is the very low cost but effective filter filled with a charcoal and garble sand. Impurities in the water settle down and microbes are killed by charcoal and this filter can be clean by back flow and after some time it is again ready to use). Impure water send into the earth through the layers to increase the water level. Thus pure water we can use for domestic purpose like bathing, washing cloths etc. Then the water store in the tank again pass through the ceramic candle type filter that absorb all the impurities of liquid and make it comfort for drinking purpose. The soil erosion also cause land pollution that only reduce by planting more and more trees. The rain water can be store and can be used for agriculture and various domestic purposes.

Agriculture industry is also suffering from this profit thinking. For short term gains we are ignoring along term ill effects of this profit oriented agriculture. Our country with 1.04 billion people is one of the world's largest nations in term of population being second to only China. According to an estimate, by the year 2020, Indian population would grow to an enormous 1.343 billion. To feed such a huge population, we require 241 million tones of grain production per annum. Therefore, it has become a necessity to maximize food production from both plants and animals. To meet this demand we are constantly using crop boosters in significant amounts. These crop booster are proving very harmful for human beings. Due to excessive use of fertilizer and pesticides which also provide increased levels of yield, quantity of food is going up but quality is going the other way around. Our environment is on the verge of degradation. These chemical enter the plants and lead to Biological Magnification of toxic substances. Moreover these are also responsible for over utilization of the resources. Thus it has become the need of hour to stop the damage being done to our environment. This is exactly where sustainable agriculture kicks in. Sustainable agriculture is the act of farming using principles of ecology, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. It can be defined as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term. So, to play our part, here we present a project on Organic farming, which is the most successful form of sustainable agriculture. This project is all about producing a complete pack for organic farming which included different manures, pesticides, and organic fertilizers made from very easily available organic matter. The main principle involved in producing these items is Fermentation . The pack of Organic five contains: Vermiwash along with vermicompost Organic Injection Butter Milk Insecticide 174 Organic DAP (Cattle urine + Ash) Herbal 5 Application & Further scope of the exhibit: 1.

Scientific Principle Involved: Allelopathy refers to the effect(s) both positive and negative of one plant over the other through release of chemical compounds (allelochemicals) in the environment, Research has shown that allelopathic vegetation can be used as effective herbicides. Material Used: apparatus, HNO3, NH4CL, K4FeCn6, ammonium, diphenly, CaCo3. Yellow colour confirms the presences of sulphates. Investigation: To study the existing practices of leaf litter disposal in residential area and public gardens To compare the leaf litter of allelopathic and non allelopathic plants with respect to their physical and chemical composition. The differences in their pH, water, alcohol, magnesium, aldehydes, ketones and phenol content were tested by the students in the school laboratory. One kg of lead litter gives 2.5 to 3 ml oil which can be used as herbicide. Visit to P.U. to study working of clavenger's apparatus and effect of oil and water extracts of leaf litter on plants. Analysis of Data: Around 124 people were surveyed in the tricity which included 74% residential garden, 20% public places and 6% schools. Leaf litter was present in 85% of these cases. Leaf litter was collected daily in 35% cases and weekly in 38% cases. 183 Inspite of 92% people being aware of the harmful effects caused burning of leaves nearly 34% still opted for this mode of disposal. The season of maximum litter was found to be September - October. Nearly 38% people depended on the collection of litter by municipal van and 58% people felt that fallen leaves could be used as organic manure. Of all the samples taken Eucalyptus and Lantana were found to contain phenols thus making them appropriate choice as herbicides. Majority of them contain nitrates, sulphates, phosphates, aldehydes, magnesium, ammonium and iron ions. Leaf litter of mango and Tecoma was found to be basic in nature where as th e others were acidic. Conclusions: Leaf litter of both allelopathic and non - allelopathic plants can serve as effective compost due to their nutrient content. Additionally the former can probably be used as natural herbicides due to their phenol content. As well mulching can prove to be useful for retaining moisture content of the soil as well as growth of weeds can be checked. This will be an environment friendly method of recycling leaf litter. Utility and Further scope of the project : We can have a leaf litter processing unit to extract the herbicidal content from the leaves. The left over matter can be used as manure. We are sure that, if our model is implemented it will not only solve as major problem of our city but also go a long way in creating ecobalance which is highly disturbed by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers Name of the School: Carmel Convent School, Chandigarh. EXHIBIT No. 80 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Water Conservation Water conservation means: 1) Proper utilization of water i.e. minimizing its wastage 2) To catch or harvest even a single drop of Rainwater 3) Waste water treatment for reuse In rural areas, people throw domestic waste in river water causing pollution. Certain new techniques should be introduced in village like Ecosan toilets. 184 These toilets are provided with concrete bottom so that these will be no contact between the human excreta & soil. The villages must known rainwater harvesting techniques. Farmers should opt for drip irrigation and sprinkles system in their fields for irrigation their crops. Moreover, MULCHING can increase water holding capacity of soil. In cities, industrial units are contaminating the water which can be hazardous for aquatic life. In urban areas, water retention ponds are created which store run off water of rainfall. These ponds serve 2 purposes: 1) Limit flooding 2) Remove the pollutants These are well aerated to support aquatic life. Proper aeration is vital for retention pond, settle, filler and use up the pollutant that enter during run off. The organic material called sludge is removed and can be sued as fertilizers. After this, the water is passed through poly alpha. Sponges, which absorb, H 2S gas the dissolved heavy metals, are removed by BIOSORPTION. Then water is chlorinated and supplied to cities. So, let us a pledge to conserve water to Support Life. Name of the School: Guru Nanak International Public School, Ludhiana.

Utility: In today's era of energy crisis appliances based on solar energy can be used. A solar cooler can be used in hot rural areas where supply of power in not regular. 185 Further Scope : In the years to come these devices will have great importance in day to day life as these are based on a renewable source of energy i. e solar energy. Name of the School: Nankana Sahib Public High School, Patiala, Punjab. EXHIBIT No. 82 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Saving Natural Resources Objective/Aim: Our aim is to save Natural Resources Scientific Principle Involved: Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Biomass Energy, Solar Laltains, Tensiometer and Magnetic Repulsion. Material Used: Artificial houses and trees, motor, fan, rigid support, steamer, turbine, pipe, waste material, solar panels, bulbs, charging cell, two pipes, ceramic cup, speaker magnets, wooden base, generator type motor. Observation/Findings : We found to save and conserve our Natural Resources Name of the School: S. Teja Singh Kandhari Public School, Patiala, Punjab. EXHIBIT No. 83 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: The S.M.A.R.T. School, where the future is powered by us! Objectives: 1. To generate electricity by sound, movement and trash during school working days and to use renewable sources like solar energy and wind energy after school working hours and during vacations. 2. To reduce the risk of spreading bacterial diseases by using anti bacterial desks and chairs. Scientific Principle: Conversion of Sound Energy, Kinetic Energy and Trash Energy into Electrical Energy. Project Details: 1. Materials used: Ply board (base and building), Paints (silver, black, red, white), Ribbon wire (5 mtrs), Led's (21 units), Led's stand (21 pcs) Solar Panels (2 pcs), Tin (used to make wind turbines), D.C. Motors (used in windmills & speed breakers), Saw dust (green colour), PVC 186 pipe (used to make speed breakers, O.H.P. sheets (for windows glass), Fevicol, Feviquick, Fevibond, Screws, Nails, Tapes (black & white), Straws, Cardboard (used for trash part), Toy Cars, Circuit of Clap Switch, 9 volt Batteries (6 pcs), Battery Clamp (6 pcs) Scrap iron. Working: 1. Sound Tiles: Sound waves create vibrations and hit the special gold plated tiles. The waves travel through Zinc Oxide Nano wires and then converted to electricity. 2. Piezoelectric Crystals with Cork Layer: When the people step on the floor, the crystals react to the movement and produce power. Wires under this layer will lead the power to power house. The springy material of the cork layer above the piezoelectric layer helps in effective compression and hence more generation of electricity. Antibacterial Tables and Chairs: The school can have tables and chairs coated with plastic sharklet material that bacteria cannot stick to or grow on. This prevents the spread of cold and flu amongst students and keeps them healthy and fit. 4. Renewable sources of energy: During school working hours, electricity is being produced by sound and movement, However, after the school working hours and during the holidays, energy of our conventional renewable sources i.e. wind and sun are used to generate electrical power, which is clean, cost effective and efficient. For this, solar panels and windmills can be installed in the school premises. 5. Trash: Biomass materials such as wood, sawdust, dried leaves and garbage can be used as renewable sources of energy by burning it, turning it into a liquid or gas called biogas to heat schools, cook food, and even produce electricity. Utility - Calculations: The idea dubbed as \"Crowd Farming\" is to install a flooring system that would take advantage of piezoelectric principles by harvesting power from footsteps in school. Although the power output from the single piezo-films is low, the voltage output produced is in the range of 1.2 volts. This can be easily stored in the small nickel metal hydride batteries. The fully charged battery can then provide with a steady current of 760 mA and potential difference of 1.2 volts. This gives us an estimated power of 1 watt approximately. 1. For 2 seconds lighting of one bulb, we need 5 watts (1 footstep) 2. For six working hours per day i.e. 21600 seconds, we need, 5/2* 21600 = 54000 watts 3. If there are 2000 students in a school who have an average footstep fall of 500, then Total footsteps = 2000 * 500 = 1000000 4. Power generated in a day = 5 * 1000000 = 5000000 watts 5. No. of bulbs which can be lighted in a day = 5000000/54000 = 92 approximate. Further Scope: The same concept can be used in crowded places such as railway stations, malls, concerts and anywhere where large groups of people move. The key is the crowd. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that: 1) Approximately 28,500 footsteps generate energy to power a train for one second. 187 2) In the clubs, an individual club -goer could generate roughly 5 to 10 watts, and on a night where the dance floor is packed with moving bodies, the energy from the floor could supply about 60 percent of the club's total energy needs. 3) Similarly 84,162,203 steps could generate enough power to launch a space shuttle.

EXHIBIT No. 84 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: Conservation of Natural Resources (Evergreen Future City Planning) Under-theme: Natural Resources and their Conservation Sub-theme: To use various natural resources spread around our environment and which get wasted every year. Aim/Objective: To do useful work for mankind by utilizing waste water, farming without soil, poultry and dairy farming, psi culture, biogas power plant, generation of electricity in one lawn. Scientific Principle Involved: Hydroponics method-Farming without soil Rain water harvesting Poultry, psi and dairy farming Sanitation planning Biogas plant Generation of electricity from roads Materials Used: Thermocol, Fevicol, Plastic pipes, Water motor of 18v, Railway toy set, Posture color, wooden base, wooden bit, Toy cars, chick, Plaster of Paris, Distemper, Glue, Connecting wires and LED. Working Investigation and Findings: Hydroponics method-Farming without Soil The term hydroponics originates from the ancient Greek \"hydros\", meaning water, and \"ponos\", meaning work. As the population of our planet soars and arable land available for crop production declines, hydroponics will offer us a lifeline of sorts and allow us to produce crops in greenhouses or in multilevel buildings dedicated to agriculture. 188 Rain water harvesting The world is passing through a state of serious crunch of resources, both non-renewable and renewable. Water constitutes the major renewable resource. Freshwater available on earth is 2.5% of the total 1386 million cubic kilolitres and only one-third of this small quantity is available for human use. Heavy demand of water has resulted in a three-fold increases in the withdrawal of ground water during the last five decades and is projected to increases further by 2025. Solar Energy Photovoltaic panels absorb the energy from sunlight from sunlight and convert the energy to electricity. The light excited electrons in the panel and these electrons are collected by wires embedded in the panel. As electric current is produced, it is sent through your home's electrical system to provide power. Piezoelectric Effect and Electromagnetic Induction Piezo electric effect is extensively used to convert electric energy into mechanical energy and vice versa so. This is an electromechanically phenomenon, Certain crystal like quartz, tourmaline crystal, Rochelle salt become electrically polarized when stress is applied on them. This phenomena of polarization of a solid crystal on which forces are acting is called Piezo electric effect. In piezoelectric crystals those having no centre of symmetry displacement due to stress distort the original charge distribution in such a way that it is no longer symmetry. A net polarisation results in such crystals and we observe the piezoelectric effect. Poultry and Dairy Forming Waste water from poultry farm and animal excreta passed through charcoal mix as a pre- treatment of waste into pond, where it is a better breeding place for pciculture. Water is now taken to the filter plant for further purification and recycling of water to use in homes. Water supply and Proper Sanitation The drain water from several places are collected at one chamber and it was passed through Cl pipe of more than 30 inches. Now, drain water will allow to fall from higher altitude on the blades of a turbine to generate electricity. Name of the School: Swami Shraddh anand DAV Centenary Public School, Khunti, Jharkhand. EXHIBIT No. 85 Theme: Natural Resource & their Conservation Write Up: \"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\" (Some creative innovation energy with Notified common experiments) Sub-theme: \"Natural Resources and their Conservation\". Aim: Our main motto is to control energy crisis and water crisis by the use of some uncommon scientific 189 innovations and technology in everyday life. Secondly to promote organic farming, use of water sensors in agriculture to save water and energy. Ultimately, we aim to prevent rail accidents at the railway crossings by the use of light sensors. Scientific Principle Involved: We have used the basic principle of photoconductivity in light sensors, conduction of electricity by water and also the principle of decomposition of biomass to produce natural gas to generate electrical energy for a better tomorrow. Materials Used: Light sensors (LDRs), LED bulbs, conducting wires, 9V cells, thermo cols, aluminum pieces, sliding lens, paint, sticks, fevicol, toys, ply and POP. Working Investigation and Findings: According to our survey, in Jharkhand we have many open cast Kujama Village, Jama Dobha, etc.] which are now left vacant after extraction, also these areas have frequent water shortage. For which we have decided to turn those useless mines into water reservoirs. In addition, the state has enormous potential for cultivation of a number of horticultural crops; however, the productivity is low due to non- availability of quality planting material and irrigation. The cultivation of crops is heavily dependent on rainfall. According to our survey, 20.68% of the land of farmers has access to irrigation. 65.56% farmers use wells, 26.67% use life irrigation, 4.44% use ponds and 3.33% use other sources of irrigation. In the state, the percentage of area under irrigation is 28.3%. With emphasis on achieving self sufficiency in food grains, Jharkhand should give top priority to increase the coverage under assured irrigation and this provides the scope for farm mechanization for increasing productivity via water sensors and use of water reservoirs. In urban sector, energy utilization and waste generation in very large so, balancing this two aspects we have done a survey in our locality manipulating the total waste generation per day. We found that from an average society (of 50 families) we can easily have 100-150 kg of waste daily which is enough to lighten up the whole society for 3-4 days free of cost. In metropolitan cities, our smart tower can harvest 66% of energy required for this entire skyscraper and in small towns like our hometown Hazari bag use of LDR in street lights can save 40-45% of energy which is simply wasted due to our negligence and the installation of our genuine anti rail accident system can save millions of life!!! Utility and Further Scope of the Model: This model has been carefully designed and evaluated thinking about is present and future uses and how it can be brought to practical uses in the future. Once successfully brought to practical use the idea behind this project will not only prove to be energy efficient but will also contribute towards a greener tomorrow... In context to further scope of this model, we aim at establishing our water sensors in forms with automatic motor on/off facility, light sensors in homes, street lights and in security. Our anti rail accident system in roads and runways, etc. with few modifications.

Project At Glance: 1. Anti Collision Device 2. Automatic Railway Crossing Gate 3. Automatic Signals 4. Automatic switch on/off the light inside the tunnel at the time of crossing the train. Principle Of The Project: To stop supply of the electric current in the Train engine through IR electronic sensor and OAPM-IC, Functioning of Automatic Railway Crossing Gate , on the basis of electromagnetic induction phenomenon and functioning of Automatic Signals and Automatic switch on/off the light inside the tunnel at the time of crossing the train are based on two relay. Main Parts: IR (Infrared rays) sensor , OPAM 325 IC , relay , LED (light emitting diode) , Variable resistors Function of Different Parts: Ir Sensor: Its function is to detect any object which comes in its region, normally it provides zero voltage but when any object comes in its field it provides 3-5 V as an output. Opam 325 IC: It operates with set point voltage level like 1V when trigger crosses 1V than IC operates automatically and provides output. 6 V Relay: Here Relay is functioning as a switch only which is connected between output of OAPM and electric motor and according to Sensor level current supply will continue or off by this relay Transistor: Transistor is functioning as a relay driver because IC output gives very small current while relay required current approx. 1A.Hence Transistor amplifies the current. Variable Resistors: All resistors are used only for controlling the electric current. Working: Our project is working on fully electronic control logic system. In this project we have two main parts one is IR Sensor and other is OPAM IC . OPAM IC operates with IR Sensor. As we know that IR Sensor provides Zero voltage, when any object comes in the field of IR Sensor its output voltage becomes high; approx. 3-5 V due to this OPAM - IC operates with trigger voltage at any level between 3-5 V and finally electric current stops flowing through electric motor. Automatic Railway Crossing Gate is functioning on the basis of Electromagnetic induction phenomenon.

Name of the School : Anand Vidya Vihar School, Bhopal (M.P.) EXHIBIT No. 8 Theme: Transport & Communicatio n Write Up: Over Road Transport System (Maglev) Over Road Transport System is a new concept for the transportation in the metropolitan cities of India and could help a lot to make intra -city transport easier by saving time. It could also be used as metros in cities or connecting different cities. Principle : In this principle of maglev train will be utilized to move the transport system. Maglev is a method of propulsion that uses magnetic levitation to propel vehicles with magnets rather than with wheels, axles and bearings. Using maglev a vehicle could be lifted a short distance using magnets and creates both lift and thrust. Working : The tracks of the transport system will be installed on both the side of the road. Then on these magnetic tracks the dome sh aped or reversed \"U\" shaped structure would be installed on which after that cubicle for seating of the passengers would be installed. Magnetic tracks when switched on will levitate the dome shaped structure by magnetic levitation and will allow it to move in any direction. There would be overhead stations for the passengers to get into the transport system. Advantages: This would save the money for laying down of more track and clearing of space as its tracks are built on the sides of road and will require the base of road as foundation. It will require less space as in comparison for the creating of new transport system. It will reduce the maintenance expense as the conventional wheel vehicle produce lot of friction and get wearied off. 200 It would be silent and save a lot of fuel as it would be run on electricity which could be produced through solar energy. The energy utilized while accelerating the system would be regenerated while slowing down by using the process of regenerative braking. It can move on high speed which is restricted in wheel based vehicle in traffic. Due to being levitated in air they do not experience any rolling friction leaving only the air friction which improves its power efficiency thus saving fuel. It could be utilized in all the weather as it will be unaffected by high or low temperatures, snow, ice, rain etc. It would be computer operated so the possibility of human error would also be reduced to a minimum.

Tilting trains can be divided in two by an actuator, usually hydraulic or electric. Tilt as such has normally not an impact on safety curves. Car body roll inwards reduces the centrifugal force felt by the passengers allowing the gravity of the car body. In a curve, under the influence of centrifugal force, the lower part of groups: the passively tilted trains, called naturally 202 tilted trains in Japan, and the actively tilted of actively tilted train, as the centre of gravity does not essentially change its (lateral) position. reduce the lateral force perceived by the passenger safety due to the lateral shift of the centre of gravity of the car body. The active tilt relies on active technology, controlled by sensors and electronics and executed the basic concept of tilting trains is the roll of the car bodies inwards the curve in order to the car body then swings out wards track cant, or when the track cant is insufficient, car body tilt. Trains capable of tilting the train to pass curves at enhanced speed with maintained ride comfort. Roll may be achieved by trains (active tilt is called forced tilt in certain publications). Materials Used : Microcontroller , Motor driver Thermocol sheets , Fevi quick glue , Pcb, Soldering kit Working : The method for obtaining the tilt is that as soon as curve arises the sensors will detect it and send information to the digital display present in the engine coach. The drivers will respond to it by activating the hydraulic system which will tilt the train coach & hence skidding of train will be avoided. The trains need not to be decelerated on curves. Since, at our level we are just giving the principle for this theory. We have prepared a prot otype model which works on Rx -Tx module. We are using Tx module for tilting the train either side by pressing the two push buttons for left & right tilt. Rx module receives the transmitted signal and responds to it accordingly using the micro -controller based circuitry. Utility and Further Scope of the Project : Theory of the tilting train aims at providing superfast means of transportation to the passengers as well as increasing the comfort level of the passengers. Thus, the theory of tilting trains has wid e range of application in the transportation system as it aims at providing modernized, improved, technologically advanced, faster & better means of transportation. Hence, the tilting train theory is a very useful project for the Indian Railways to work up on in the upcoming future.

Conversion of wind Energy to Electrical Energy. 2. Working of D.C. Motor as a dynamo Materials Used: Models of Different Heavy Vehicles, Cells, Turbine, Dc Motor, Rechargeable Battery Working Investigation or Findings : Utilisation of Air Friction Produced by Running Vehicles for Producing Electricity. Working and Investigation in Four Wheelers : In four wheelers speeding vehicles like cars, buses, racing cars etc, the installation of this model is highly preferable. The maximum speed and momentum of those vehicles helps in producing maximum power due to air friction. It also does not affect the aerodynamics of the vehicles rather support their motion. Working of the Model in Aircrafts: This technique can be efficiently used in aircrafts like airplane, high speed jets etc which could convert huge amount of air friction to electrical energy. In those vehicles the amount of energy produced could be more than the thermal plants and hydro electric power plants and will be very useful for avoiding energy crisis. Working of this Technique in Water Vehicles: This technique can be efficiently used in bullet trains, common trains etc to produce huge power. The amount of power produced in all these cases depends on the speed of the vehicle, weight of the turbine and the place where it is fixed. Utility and Further Scope of the Project : The first and foremost use of the exhibit is power production. The exhibit can also be used to reduce the effect of air friction on heavy vehicles. The power stored in the rechargeable batteries can be used for various purposes within and outside the vehicle. It can also be a substitute of fuels in vehicles. It can be useful in maintaining better energy status. Name of the School: Modern English School, Karaput (Odisha). EXHIBIT No. 13 Theme : Transport & Communication Write Up: Scientific Principle: Utilising the concept of steam engines. Method Procedure This cycle has three major components: (1) Boiler (in this case the water cylinder). 204 (2) Turbine to which the piston is connected. (3) Condenser. (4) Pump. When we speed up a car intense heat is produced inside the silencer of the main engine which can easily boil water at 1 atm. We have prepared a model to reduce this wastage of heat. Mechanism: (1) The heat from the silencer of the main engine (kept inside the water cylinder of the supporting engine) enters the water cylinder. (2) The water is heated into steam in the boiler (water cylinder). (3) The water gets converted into super heated steam, with intense pressure inside it, just like our home pressure cookers. (4) The enthalpy of the water increases. (5) The kinetic energy of the steam also increases. (6) This kinetic energy is utilised to rotate the turbine of the car. (7) Now, to the turbine the shaft is connected, to which the piston is connected. (8) To the piston the axle of the wheel is connected. (9) The steam does some work through the turbine. (10) So the enthalpy of the steam decreases. (11) Now this steam is made to pass through a condenser. (12) Here this steam is converted back to water (liquid). (13) The enthalpy of the steam decreases as heat is taken out of the steam. (14) Now this liquid is pumped from a low pressure area to a high pressure area through the pump. (15) Here a s work is done on the liquid the enthalpy of the liquid increases. (16) The liquid is made to enter into the boiler (water cylinder), gets heated, the gets converted into steam, and the process continues... Now as the blades of the turbine rotate so the shaft connected to the turbine rotates, making the piston rotate, making the axle of the wheel to rotate. So the speed of the car increases. The car's speed gets boosted up ,and as a result the car can travel the same distance in less time thus making the petrol/diesel consumption less. The original concept come from steam engine, the onl y difference being that here the water is reused unlike in steam engine where the steam gets wasted. Advantage:-This is a self sufficient and self adjusting technique, as the water gets reused again and again. This process starts automatically when the silencer's heat gets increased when the speed of the car increases to about 70-80 km/hr. We can also use this system according to our need. The petrol is also conserved in this case. the process is also thermal efficient. Suppose we could travel 30 km in 2 litres of petrol in 2 hours initially. Now buy implementing this system the speed of the cars can be increased. Thus we can now travel 30 km in just (suppose)1 hour and automatically the petrol consumption will reduce, and so will the price get reduced. So this process can prove very advantageous for us if we implement this in the cars, for both us and the environment. 205 Unique Features of the Project: (1) Heat generated by the system is used. (2) Reducing petrol usage (3) Reusing of water. (4) Self-adjusting system. Applications in real life: Basically it could be used in vehicles for example in cars, buses. Also it could be used in various machines in factories where heat production is large and the heat is not utilised. Further scope of the project: With the advent of lighter (alloys) weight vehicles these components of the subsidiary engine could be used out there as due to in vehicles nowadays this system might be heavier. Also it could be used in various machines where heat generated gets wasted.. Name of the School: Aditya Academy Sr. Sec. School, Parganas, Kolkata. EXHIBIT No. 14 Theme: Transport & Communication Write Up: Janatha A.C (Air Cooled) Coach Objective/Aim: To provide comfort and hygienic conditions is Railway compartments Scientific Principle Involved: Evaporation causes reduction in temperature Material Used: Cardboard, Paper, Water Colours We have observed that there is gap of 10 cms between the outer iron casing and interior panel. This space is provided to the shutters of the windows and also to reduce inside temperature. We plan to cut the outer iron casing and install a porous membrane between outer iron casing and interior panel. Above the porous membrane we run a water pipe with holes. Below the membrane a channel is placed to collect the excess water to the reservoir placed beneath the compartment. This water is circulated again into the water pipe with the help of a pump which is connected to the wheels placed beneath the compartment. By providing flaps outside, the outside hot dry air is dragged into the compartment when the train is moving. This hot air as it travels through the porous membrane the water droplets in the membrane evaporates and the temperature of the air decreases considerably, hence, cool air flows into the compartment. This cool air is circulated into every part of the compartment by the fans. This working is similar to the air coolers at our house. The waste collected in the dustbins can be removed by opening a door provided outside the compartment.

Objective : To reduce the space required for take-off by increasing the lift, thereby making the aircrafts viable to reach the disaster affected areas. Scientific Principle: A thicker airfoil (conventional airfoil) generates more lift but also has drag as penalty. A stepped airfoil traps a vortex at rear end generating greater lift but vortex is blown off at high speed. Convertible airfoil employs a system of integrated flaps to convert a stepped airfoil to a conventional airfoil during flight allowing independent high lift and high speed profiles with greater efficiency. Materials Used/Procedure: Corrugated Plastic for Wingspan and Chord Length , Wooden Dowels , Carbon Fibre , Epoxy and CA Wooden Ribs , Servo Motors , Connection Wires Working/Investigation/Findings: Hybrid between conventional and KFM airfoil. Provides best of both configurations, decreases flight time (wing air travel) Greatly increases lift and air penetration. Provides opportunity to take off on small air strips. Utility and Further Scope of the Project: Disaster Management: reduces space required for takeoff by increasing the lift generated making it possible for planes to help those in needs. Fuel Efficiency: easily switches between high lift and high speed profiles, reducing flight time and increasing efficiency. Generating Employment: construction of airfields and air strips in villages and remote areas, providing avenues for employment in these regions. Greater Pay Load Capacity: flexible range of centre of gravity and high lift allows the planes to support much greater payload as compared to conventional air craft, thus increasing efficiency of transport of large load via air.

EXHIBIT No. 22 Theme : Transport & Communication Write Up: Aim : To run a train on electricity generated by it. Abstract: As the stocks of fossil fuel are getting depleted rapidly, there is an urgent need of trapping alternate energy resources. In our present model, we try to bring out an alternate method of running a train with alternate resources. It uses the simple principle of physics like electromagnetic induction; conversion of energy and its storage are mentioned. In short, it is a self sustained energy train. 213 Introduction : The train runs on some of the basic principles of Physics. They are as follows: Electromagnetism. Photovoltaic effect. The train is totally eco-friendly and generates electricity for its own use and can run for long. Its total need of electricity is generated by itself and hence does not need any external supply for its run. The train generates electricity in four different ways. Material Required : 1. Magnets (Ferrite disc magnet), Model Train Set, Solar Panels, Storage Unit (battery), Coil, Motor , LED (light emitting diode), Connecting Wires, Adhesive, Air Turbine, Switch, Soldering Equipment, Tools (screwdriver, screws, etc.) , Weights Observation: The functioning of the train is as follows: The train runs with the help of motors fitted in the main dragger. There are 2 main draggers in total each dragger having 2 to 4 powerful motors. And each bogey has 4 dynamos fitted with their wheels for the generation of electricity and is sent to the storage unit. On the roof of the train solar panels are fitted for harnessing the solar energy and after its generation it is sent to the storage unit and this energy can be used while starting. The train has a slit in the main dragger in front of it, through which the air can pass, while it's run. Inside the slit there is a turbine fitted to dynamo, so when the train runs the air will come inside the slit and will make the turbine rotate resulting in the generation of electricity and this electricity will be stored in the storage unit and will be used later for running the train. On the wheels of the train coils are kept and on the body of the train just adjacent to the wheels where the coils are fitted and in this way when the wheels rotate the coil also rotates, since magnet kept near to the wheels electricity is generated and brushes are there to the shaft and by the process of electromagnetism and the electricity generated is sent to the storage unit for charging. The train's body is made out of SMC (Sheet Moulding Composite) instead of metal which is lighter than metal and it also increases the safety of the passengers. Suppose, there is a collision between the SMC trains, the bogey won't absorb the impact of force but it will break down thereby not harming the passengers and hence increasing their safety. 214 Humus compartment , Ventilation pipe , Toilet seat , Urinal Urine collection and dehydration Second floor , First floor , Ground floor It is very important to note that the train produces more than enough of energy required since it generates electricity in 4 ways so it does not have deficiency of it.

As the engine used in this car is fully self modified from a defective generator. This engine runs on LPG fuel and gives enough power to drive a car on roads as well as on water. Material used: Wooden board (3 x 4 feet), angles of iron, \u00bd kg nut and bolts (1 inch),\u00bd kg nut bolts (1.5 inch), 4 tyre and 4 tubes,2 small axles,1 large axle, clutch drum, clutch bush, clutch pulley, clutch rotator, chain, gear (teeth), 2 rub gear (verm), 8 ball bearing, gas can, brake wire ,accelerator wire,2 outers,4 universal bearing1 kinetic gearbox,2,4inch nut bolt,4,3.5inch nut bolt,8 l key skrew, gas pipe, gear oil, engine oil, 2 thrust bearing', grease and silicon, steering rod, iron plate (steering), fan rod, verm gear (fan), propeler, 2 bars, ball bearing 2 (fan), steering, steel rod thick, steel rod thin,1 socket, iron strips (40 feet),translucent fibre, transparent fibre, engine, paint, lights, wooden ply, brake and accelerator, seat, truck tube, disk brake set Principle: The principle of this car is to use a vehicle with a 'green' fuel, as it decrease exhaust emissions. In particular, it reduces CO2 emissions by around 35% compared to petrol. This car has reduced oil consumption and waste oil is less toxic than any other engined vehicle. This small engine can also be fitted on the cycles and can prove a boon to the elderly people who cannot paddle the cycle and can prove to be most convenient means of transport in the rural area of India Working of the Engine: The LPG is passed through a narrow pipe to the engine and the air ventury of the engine mixes the air, for the complete combustion of gas having negligible pollutant. This air mixed gas is then passed to the burning chamber where igniting spark plug is placed, and when we turn on the engine, the spark plug ignites the gas, creating high pressure inside the chamber. Through this pressure the pistons of the engine starts moving up and down which leads to the rotation of the inner drum. With the inner drum there are clutch bushes attached which gets increased in their size when we accelerate the engine. This increase in their size holds the clutch cup and the cup rotates, there is a clutch drum also attached on the cup of pulley so that the cup does not come out on high speed causing any severe accident. The car is balanced and can float on water through the truck tubes fitted under the car, which can be filled with air and can be put to work when we want to drive this car on water, through a foot pump which takes less than 1 minute to fill the whole tube. The steering can be used for driving this car on roads as well as on water to take sharp turns. Utility: Running any vehicle either on LPG or CNG is much cheaper as compared to Fossil Fuel I.e. petrol or diesel. Natural gas is also an economic alternative to gasoline and other transportation fuels. Traditionally, natural gas vehicles have been around 30 percent cheaper than gasoline vehicles to refuel, and in many cases the maintenance costs for NGVs is lower than traditional gasoline vehicles 217 It is an eco friendly, pollution free, that is why all the buses are being run on CNG/LPG to reduce pollution in the city. While the Gas is available in abundance, the availability of the fossil fuel is only for limited period say for- 25-years. Future scope: This concept if launched commercially in the market could turn out to be revolutionary. It is not only energy efficient but also affordable proving a boon for common man, its maintenance charge is negligible. If everyone start using this vehicle, alone in India on an estimate rupees 200crore fuel can be saved per day. And it is a very efficient vehicle which has a maximum speed of about 30km/h, and gives the mileage of 70 km per litre of LPG gas and has a dimension of about 3X4 ft. We have designed this four wheeler LPG car which we can drive on roads and water too. It's a very eco -friendly, pollution free, sustainable, portable and a very cheap device which can be used in our day to day life and the best part is keeping the conservation of natural resources in mind. It's a very efficient vehicle for rural areas and big cities. Name of the School : Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi.

EXHIBIT No. 32 Theme : Transport & Communication Write Up: Magnetism and i ts applictions Magnetism : Magnetism is a force of attraction or repulsion between magnets or magnetic materials that acts at a distance (through a magnetic field), and is ultimately due to the movement of electrons. Types of magnets : Permanent Magnets can be classified into four types based on their composition: (i) Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB or NIB) (ii) Samarium Cobalt (SmCo) (iii) Alnico (iv) Ceramic or Ferrite Theme of model : This is a simple model which works on the principle of magnetism. It can be used: (i) To generate electricity (ii) To generate mechanical energy (iii) To pull out water from wells in rural areas (iv) To power fans or cooling devices in desert areas (v) To replace some mechanical devices from machines like compressors, etc. 222 Working: Through this model we are converting the potential energy of a magnet into kinetic energy. Let us consider a two cylindered engine. Now in this Engine, replace the pistons by magnetic pistons(say P1 and P2) such that P1 have North pole facing upwards and P2 having south pole facing upward. Replace the ignition spark, valves by a cylindrical magnets (say M). On attaching this magnet (M) with a pulley which is attached to crank shaft of the engine directly through chain. Let the piston P1 be at the bottom most edge of the cylinder and piston P2 at the top most edge of the cylinder with the magnet M placed such that it have north pole facing upward and south facing downwards. Now if see, the magnet M will apply force of attraction over magnetic piston P1 and force of repulsion over magnetic piston P2. This will result in the pulling of piston P1 and pushing of piston P2. As change in the position of pistons, make the crank shaft rotate and crank shaft rotates the magnet M. Now piston P1 is at the top most edge of the cylinder and piston P2 is at the bottom most edge of the cylinder with the magnet M in such a position that it is having north pole facing downwards and south pole facing upwards. This position of magnet will apply the force of repulsion on piston P1 and force of attraction on piston P2. This will lead to the movement in the pistons and therefore rotation of crank shaft. So, in this way the cycle will go on and will have perpetual amount of mechanical energy without using any sort of fuel. Name of the School : Colonel's Central Academy, Urban Estate, Gurgaon.

EXHIBIT No. 38 Theme: Transport & Communication Write Up: Solar Roads & ANPR - A Vision for the Future Objective/Aim: (A) To create environment friendly transport system based on modern technology (B) To reduce the demand of fuels (C) Single solution to various problems Scientific Principle Involved: (A) A solar roadway is a series of structurally engineered solar panels that are driven upon. The idea is to replace current petroleum-based asphalt roads, parking lots, and driveways with solar road panels that collect energy to be used by homes and businesses, and ultimately to be able to store excess energy in or alongside the solar roadways. (B) Thus renewable energy replaces the need for the current fossil fuels used for the generations of electricity, which cuts greenhouse gases. (C) Parking lots, driveways, and eventually highways are all targets for the panels. If the entire National Highways system were surfaced with Solar Roadways panels. It would produce more than three times the amount of electricity currently used in the country. 227 Material used: Wood, Glass, Plastic, Colours, LED's, Wires, Battery Construction and Working of the Model: 1. Existing prototype panels consist of three layers- (A) Road surface layer - translucent and high - strength, it is rough enough to provide sufficient traction, yet still passes sunlight through to the solar collector cells embedded within, along with LED's and a heating element. This layer needs to be capable of handling today's heaviest loads under the worst of conditions and to be weatherproof, to protect the electronics layer beneath it. (B) Electronics layer - Contains a microprocessor board with support circuitry for sensing loads on the surface and controlling a heating element with a view to reducing or eliminating snow and ice removal as well as school and business closing due to inclement weather. The microprocessor controls lighting, communications, monitoring, etc. With a communications device every 12 feet, a solar roadway can be an intelligent highway system. (C) Base plate layer - While the electronics layer collects energy from the sun, it is the base plate that distributes that power as well as signals (phone, TV, internet, etc.) down the line to all homes and businesses connected to the solar roadway. It needs to be weatherproof to protect the electronics layer above it. Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) is mass surveillance method that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates. Application in Different Domains of Life: Renewability and life-span The main advantage of the solar roadway concept is that it utilizes a renewable source of energy to produce electricity. It has the potential to reduce dependence on conventional sources of energy. Military and rescue assistance In the event of an environment disaster or military emergency, solar roadways would provide power when it is needed most. Roadways already in place Another advantage of solar roadways is that they do not require the development of unused and potentially environmentally sensitive lands. Transmission lines could simply be run along already established roadways.

EXHIBIT No. 21 Theme : Information and Education Technology Write Up: What is MagRail? MagRail is Magnetic levitated Coil Rail. It is not just an improvement of Maglev, but is a whole new generation of Transportation that can create a revolution. With the use of Hydrogen fuel cells, Solar energy, Vacuum tubes & Superconductors, it is not just efficient but has potential to reach speeds from *4000km/hr to 8500km/hr. Most important of all, it is not just a fantasy system but can be implemented in real life. Salient Component of MagRail: Tracks : MagRail does not utilize traditional laid tracks but uses vacuum tubes combined with coil guns. MagRail just requires building up of loops supported by some structure interconnected with each other via Vacuum Tubes. Although MagRail has aerodynamically perfect structure, but it utilizes vacuum tubes in order to remove air resistance which current generating maglev suffer causing a lot of loss useful energy. Loops: The Loops are the key components of the MagRail. They are not only supporting structures, but actually provide acceleration to the train. 246 They compose of Superconductor loops which use a fraction of energy used by today's electric trains and create super strong magnetic fields as compared to ordinary electromagnets and enable the train to reach such supersonic speed. For attraction, a small amount of current is passed through it to start the magnetic effect of loop and goes on until it is stopped. Loops are sequentially activated and deactivated to give train a forward push. Magnetic Leviation : MagRail features super cooled superconductors at its base which cause leviation of the train when they come over the loops. Since Magrail at any instant of time is supported by three loops, they efficiently levitate it giving a smooth drive. Body: MagRail is made up Light materials and its surface is covered with solar cells which allow it to fulfill its energy needs. Also it consists of a Hydrogen fuel cell for extra energy needs. Control : Since MagRail can only move forward or backward by alternatively activating and deactivating loops which can be controlled efficiently by smart computer system, it removes chances of brake failure or slipping or accidents due to human error. Cost : Since it does not requires laying up of tracks and utilizes less energy and is self sustained for a long run, they are very cost and fuel efficient. Rail Model : The efficient structure of MagRail allows its storage in form of stacks instead of having a places for storing of trains. Name of the School : Blue Bells Model Sr. Sec.

Name of the School : Amity International School, Sector-46, Gurgaon. 248 EXHIBIT No. 23 Theme : Information and Education Technology Write Up: Title: Brialle Printer Objective: Make a BRAILLE PRINTER to make their life even more Comfortable Scientific Principle involved : We at POLICE DAV have come up with the concept of a unique printer - A Braille Printer that would not only be easy to use but also easy on the pockets. We come up with the idea of using an ordinary printer (Dot Matrix Printer). The dot matrix printer usually contains a printing head with pins, a roller and a ribbon. When the printing command is given the pins strike the paper (Ink ribbon is placed in between the paper and pins), placed on the roller. In this way the text (Dots) gets printed. To make a dot matrix printer work as a Braille printer we removed the ribbon in between the head and the paper .Roller is also removed and it is sheathed in a soft cover (we have used cycle tube for this) and we place roller back in its position. To get Braille printing, just type anything on MS Word, change its font to Braille (which is freely available on net ). If we give printing command , than it will print the mirror image of the letters but it can be solved by using 3D rotation feature of power point(180 degrees).Now give the print command. When the pins strike on paper, they would produce an emboss effect on the paper because of the cushion provided by the sheath on the roller. We experimented with different types, thickness and qualities of paper. Aluminum foil paper gave best sense of reading for the blind. Based on the experiments done by us in lab, we conclude that font size of 24 gives the best embossed result. These embossed alphabets can then be felt on the paper and are easily readable for the blind. Future scope of ghe project: This can be implemented in various blind institutions. Also as it's manufacturing is very cheap, therefore it can be used commercially also. Name of the School : Police DAV Public School, Jalandhar Cantt. Jalandhar.

EXHIBIT No. 17 Theme : Community Health & Environment Write Up: Aim: To produce Eco friendly electricity in rural areas and Extract Silica for industrial purposes Materials Required: Rice Husk, Bio mass Gasifier, Electric Generator, Silica Precipitator, Filters Scientific Principle Involved: Rice husk can be used as a source of electricity through: Biomass Gasification - Process in which biomass is heated to very high temperatures in an atmosphere of < 1% oxygen where it does not burn in flames, but turns into a 'producer gas.' 263 Large piles of rice husk are used for feeding the machine, and the solid waste produced is black rice husk ash (RHA). Next to the gasifier are filters for cleaning, and a generator in which the producer gas is used to drive a turbine and create electricity. So, electricity is generated from the rice but solid waste is produced in the form of RHA Workings/Findings: Among the different types of biomass used for gasification, rice husk has a high ash content varying from 18 - 20 %. Silica is the major constituent of rice husk ash. With such a large ash content and silica content in the ash it becomes economical to extract silica from the ash, which has wide market and also takes care of ash disposal. Silica is the major constituent of the rice husk ash. Experiments have been carried out successfully under lab scale to extract the silica from the rice husk ash. Despite the loss of 10-20 % of ash on ignition, this not only provides value addition but also solves the problem of large amount of ash disposal. Utility/Scope: Several rural households can have access to electricity 24x7. Cheaper than using conventional methods. Highly environment-friendly as compared to fossil fuels.

Name of the School : St. Michael's School, Ahmednagar EXHIBIT N o. 21 Theme: Community Health & Environment Write Up: Title : Sansodhan Urja With drastically change in climatic conditions in recent years; demand for air conditioning is spreading all over the world. In order to provide best indoor air quality and thermal comfort with minimum consumption of energy, hybrid desiccant cooling systems are an approach to effectively manage humidity under challenging conditions such as buildings with high outdoor air (OA) requirements located in humid regions. The hybrid desiccant cooling system helps in removing moisture and latent heat (and possibly sensible heat) from process air. Thus, the incoming fresh air becomes totally dry and increases the overall cooling efficienc y. Hybrid desiccant cooling system has two essential components, an absorber and a regenerator. In a basic configuration, strong i.e....concentrated and cooled liquid desiccant flows into the absorber and down through a packed bed of granular particles (or other enhanced mass transfer surface or packing). Counter flowing return air passes through the bed, transferring both moisture and heat to the liquid desiccant. The water absorbed from the air dilutes the liquid desiccant leaving the bottom of the packed bed, and flows into the regenerator. In the regenerator, the heat source (gas or oil - 268 fired, waste heat, solar) heats the weak liquid desiccant solution, increasing the vapor pressure of the water. When the weak desiccant is sprayed on another packed bed, the absorbed moisture migrates to a counter flowing scavenger air stream to regenerate a concentrated liquid desiccant solution. Subsequently the return feed from the regenerator passes through a cooling tower to remove the heat input from the regenerator. Finally, the cooled liquid desiccant solution returns to the absorber to complete the cycle. In the present investigations, an experimental study has been conducted on hybrid desiccant cooling system, where the latent heat and sensible heat of air are removed by mixing it with the - desiccant solution in a counter flow manner. This makes air totally dry and thus saves the energy to cool the air in refrigeration system. The desiccant chosen here is the aqueous solution of calcium chloride. The packed bed inside the absorber as well as regenerator consists of polypropylene, cascade ring for the better mixing of air and desiccant solution. The effect of various parameters such as desiccant inlet temperature, air inlet temperature, mass flow rate of air and desiccant solution has been studied to investigate the performance of the system. Comparing the results with previous studies, a fair agreement has been reported. Name of the School : Darbari Lal DAV Model School, Pitampura, New Delhi.

EXHIBIT No. 25 Theme : Community Health & Environment Write Up: Treating Sewage with Sewage Objective/Aim : To obviate the use of externally added chemicals by utilizing the coagulating power of chemically reactive trade effluents in treatment of sewage and effluents. Scientific Principles Involved: Coagulation : It is a process which involves destabilization of waste-water particles so that they precipitate out of the sol during the process of chemical flocculation. Flocculation: It is the process of formation of flocs(or flakes) due to the aggregation of colloidal particles when destabilized. Coagulating ions: These are the ions which are responsible for neutralization of charge on the colloidal particles of an electrolyte (in millimoles per litre), which is required to cause the coagulation or flocculation of a sol. Mutual Coagulation: Oppositely charged sols when mixed in almost equal proportions, neutralize each other's charge and get partially or completely precipitated. This is referred to as \"Mutual Coagulation\". Hardy-Schulze Rule: Greater the charge on the coagulating ion, greater is its power to cause the precipitation of a sol. Materials Used : Burette, Beakers, Lego NXT Kit, Chemicals (Ferric Microscope, Wastewater Samples, Stirrer, Funnels, Pipe Tubing, Laptop(for programming) Working Investigations/ Findings: The color of a waste-water sample/mixture depends directly upon the concentration of coagulant added and so can be used as one of the parameters to determine Flocculation Value. Not only do sand particles get entrapped in the flocs formed, but they also attract these flocs towards themselves as is explained by the downward movement of the floating flocs sometime after the addition of sand particles. Therefore, suspension particles in sewage can expedite the precipitation process by aiding in the formation of larger flocs. By the process of \"Mutual Coagulation\" - multiple sewages (oppositely charged sols) can be made to counteract one another, if studied thoroughly. Proposed Design of Treatment Plants: 272 Utility and further scope of the project: 1. Effluents/waste-waters from different industries can mutually coagulate one another without the use of externally added toxic chemicals (coagulants/flocculants) . 2. As no external chemicals are used to carry out coagulation, sludge (free of chemicals) generated from such a system can be put to use as manures in farms. 3. Since sewage and effluents can mutually counteract one another, their treatment processes can be clubbed together in a single unit. Thus, instead of two different plants (STPs and ETPs), there can be just one integrated plant. 4. A huge amount of power and money can be saved if the inefficient biological process is shunned and replaced with a unified treatment plant which makes use of sewage to treat nothing else but sewage.

Name of the School : Springdales School, Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi. 273 EXHIBIT N o. 27 Theme : Community Health & Environment Write Up: Objective: To detect the presence of Urinary TractInfections (UTIs) by performing nitrite and esterase tests Scientific Principle Involved: PART I: Test for Nitrites Under normal conditions nitrites are not present in the urine, while nitrates are present from the intake of vegetables. The presence of gram negative bacteria in the urine for several hours will reduce the nitrates to nitrites. The more important of the nitrate-reducing micro-organisms are Escherichia coli and Salmonellae. Our aim is to devise tests that are easy to use and can accurately detect the presence of nitrites in not just bodily fluids but also in possibly contaminated water. The practical significance of the test is enhanced by the fact that E. coli is the organism that is most often encountered in UTIs. Principle: When nitrites are added to the colour developing solution, the sulphanilamide undergoes diazotization. The diazonium salt thus formed reacts with N-1-naphthyl ethylenediamine by electrophilic substitution reaction to form magenta colour. Sulphanilamide N-1-naphthylethylenediamine Red Azo dye PART II- Test for Esterase Principle: This test is based on esters of -naphthol as substrates for estimating the activity of esterase. After the oxidation of esters by the esterase enzymes to alcohol, colour is developed by adding diazonium salt to produce an azo dye. In this experiment we will use Sulphanilic acid to make the diazonium salt as it undergoes diazotization easily. A positive result, which would indicate infection, would be a red color obtained within 10 seconds of adding the azo salt solution. Chemicals Used: 1. Sulphanilamide 2. N-1-naphthylethylenediamine 274 3. Sulphanilic Acid 4. -naphthyl acetate Utility and further scope: There is as immense need to come up with inexpensive and convenient techniques so as to provide optimal health care in the rural areas of India. While methods like microbiology are extremely accurate in detecting infections, they are, more often than not, too expensive and cumbersome to be effective in the interiors of our country where technology is massively underdeveloped and carrying bulky equipment is impossible. The solution to this problem would be to develop methods that can not just be easily employed but are largely effective. Possible Applications: These processes can prove to be very beneficial for women health especially in rural areas. They can also be used to detect the presence of pathogen in water. The nitrite test can be applied in many aspects, including determining the nitrite concentrations in sewage or other biological samples such as intracellular fluids, given that the samples are clear and colorless. The nitrite test coupled with the test for esterase activity would be very precise and helpful in detecting infections.The nitrite test could also be used to detect nitrite concentrations in sewage and other biological fluids. Conclusion: It is quite clear that this method has multiple advantages and is an extremely effective preliminary test for the detection of pathogen. Since UTIs is a common problem in India, and the current procedure takes time, this test can very quickly detect the presence of possible UTIs in humans.

It can be used in our homes as well as in the garden too. Its basic function is to maintain cleanliness, indoors as well outdoors. It can broom and mop the house. In the garden it can cut the grass and apply water, fertilizers and pesticides. Now a thought may arise.....\"How is it eco -friendly?\" First - of-all, it uses solar panel for its power. The pesticide that it uses is an organic one. Besides that, provision has been made for a soil pH level indicator to check the pH of the soil so that we can apply adequate amount of fertilizer and pesticide. This will prevent the degradation of the valuable soil due to over-application of pesticides soil due to over-application of pesticides and fertilizers which is a very common case. Moreover, the prototype that we have made is of biodegradable materials. So now we can realize that it has justified its name. Conclusion: Health is wealth and a clean and green environment is the key to it. The robot helps us in keeping our surrounding / environment clean and green. This will definitely lead to a good health. Moreover it does not totally reduce human effort or else it will make us idle. So we have put the robot under the topic 'Community Health and Environment'. We hope the robot proves to be useful and contributes to a healthy Environment.

EXHIBIT No. 33 Theme : Community Health & Environment Write Up: Transgenic Plants Material Used: Green Tape, Cotton, Plastic Sheet, Colour Stone, Decorative Plant, LED's (Small), Fire Flies, Thermocol (3' X 6'), Plywood (3' X 6') Principle: This model is based upon the principle of recombinant DNA technology which involves two techniques. First is, genetic engineering in which the genetic material from out side is introduced inside the another host organism to change its phenotype. Working: LUX LUCI TRANSGENIC PLANTS 1. Isolation of the DNA from Fireflies. DNA carrying lux gene has to be isolated from fireflies. This purified DNA is to be precipitated by chilled ethanol. It's seen as the fine threads. 2. Fragmentation of DNA. It is done with the help of restriction endonuclease enzyme. 279 3. Isolation of lux gene from target DNA. DNA fragments are negatively charged and are separated by the process known as gel electrophoresis. 4. Transfer of lux gene into suitable vector. First of all, multiple copies of DNA fragments are produced inside vitro. Then the lux gene i s transferred into the suitable vector i.e., plasmid with the help of promoter. This technology is known as recombinant DNA technology and this DNA is known as recombinant DNA. Here ligation of DNA is done with the help of DNA ligase enzyme. Now markers have been used to identify and eliminate non- transformants. 5. Now the target gene along with the vector is transferred into the bacteria and this process is known as transformation. It is done with the help of several methods like 1. Heat shock 2. Microinjection 3. Biolistics 4. Divalent calcium2+. 6. Isolation of bacteria carrying the lux gene along with the vector is done by culturing the bacteria on media. They will form the colonies and this is called the master plate. The bacteria which are capable enough to hold these genes will stay alive and the rest of them will become dead. Then the bacteria is cultured on the growth media to increase their number. 7. Extraction of desire products. First of all, lysis of bacterial cell is done with the help of centrifugation method to isolate plasmid DNA. Then the lux gene is separated from the vector with the help of restriction endonuclease enzyme. Now, promoter is added to the lux gene. This lux gene along with the strong promoter is transferred into the plant tissue with the help of gene transfer method or agrobacterium mediated gene transfer method. 8. Grow the plants by plant tissue culture method. Here a small piece of callus is transferred into the media containing auxins and cytokinins which are growth hormones. The plantlets having the small shoots and roots will grow. These plantlets are then transferred into the pots having the sterilized soil. There the plantlets will grow into the plants. Finally the plants are ready to be exposed to the external environment. Now the plants having the lux gene will glow in dark. Outcome: These plants provide us with lot of benefits such as : 1. They reduce the electricity consumption as they can be replaced by the electric poles on the roadside. Also they minimize night accidents. 2. They help to reduce various types of pollutions such as air pollution, noise pollution and soil pollution. 3. Global warming, which is a major problem these days can also be minimized by growing more and more trees as trees maintain the level of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment. 4. These plants can also be used as the ornamental plants which will provide asthetic value to our homes and gardens. We hope this project is clear and defined and promotes greenery and reduces pollution. With this we come to the end of our project. Name of the School : RBDAV Sr. Sec.

School, Ludhiana, Punjb. EXHIBIT No. 37 Theme : Community Health & Environment Write Up: What in tobacco smoke is harmful? Cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tobacco are made from dried tobacco leaves, as well as ingredients added for flavor and to make smoking more pleasant. The smoke from these products is a complex mixture of chemicals produced by the burning of tobacco and its additives. The smoke is made up of more than 7,000 chemicals, including over 60 known to cause cancer (carcinogens). Some of the chemicals found in tobacco smoke include : Cyanide Benzene Formaldehyde Methanol (wood alcohol) Acetylene (the fuel used in welding torches) Ammonia Does smoking cause cancer? Smoking also causes cancers of the nasopharynx (upper throat), nasal cavity, par nasal sinuses, lip, larynx (voice box), mouth, pharynx (throat), esophagus (swallowing tube), and bladder. It also has been linked to the development of cancers of the pancreas, cervix, ovary, colorectum, kidney, stomach, and some types of leukemia. How does tobacco smoke affect the lungs? Damage to the lungs begins early in smokers, and cigarette smokers have a lower level of lung function than non-smokers of the same age. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a name for long-term lung disease which includes both chronic bronchitis and emphysema (discussed below). Chronic bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is a disease where the airways make too much mucus, forcing the person to cough it out. 283 Emphysema Smoking is also the major cause of emphysema , a disease that slowly destroys a person's ability to breathe. Why do smokers have \"smoker's cough?\" Tobacco smoke has many chemicals and particles that irritate the airways and lungs. Does smoking tobacco affect your heart? Yes. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of heart disease, which is the number one cause of death. How does smoking affect pregnant women and their babies? Pregnant women who smoke risk the health and lives of their unborn babies. Smoking during pregnancy is linked with a greater chance of miscarriage, premature delivery, stillbirth, infant death, low birth-weight, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Some research has also suggested that children whose mothers smoked while pregnant or who have been exposed to secondhand smoke, even in small amounts, may be slower learners in school. What are some of the short- and long-term effects of smoking tobacco? Smoking causes many types of cancer. Long-term, smoking is also a major cause of heart disease, aneurysms, bronchitis, emphysema, and stroke. It also makes pneumonia and asthma worse. Smoking can harm you...and it harms the environment too Traditional tobacco cigarettes contain around 4000 known chemicals, which can greatly harm the smoker, those who breathe in the second hand smoke. Harming the atmosphere The actual creation of cigarettes is even more harmful to the environment. Tobacco is known as a \"heavy feeder\" plant, meaning that it requires high levels of nitrogen compounds in order to reach maturity. Passive smoking Passive s moking is the inhalation of smoke, called second -hand smoke (SHS ), or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS ), by persons other than the intended \"active\" smoker.

EXHIBIT No. 23 Theme : Mathematics Modelling Write Up: A safe and efficient evacuation scheme Once the lines are in position, they start moving towards the exit with speed v. We will later derive an expression for this required velocity. The distance between 2 consecutive rows is d, and therefore, the person leaving the topmost row (marked 1 in the last figure) has to travel a distance of (N-1)d to reach the last row, and another D units to get his CSphere clear of the rows. Therefore, he travels a distance of (N-1)d + D before more people can join the line. Since everybody travels with velocity v, it takes ((N-1)d + D)/v units of time before N more people can join the line.

Essentially a city is dependent upon the following factors: Energy Communication Transport In this model, essentially all three factors have been taken into consideration and evolved upon as required. Unique features: The city is circular in shape, where the transport system is fully water-custom-ed. The industrial zone is of radius 2.5 Km which is an industrial park, meaning a few industries waste materials are the other industries raw materials. The city is slightly tilted at an angle of 6 to 12 deg. so that the water flows from the diverted river and through the city and finally back to the river again. Since this will take a long time therefore any heated water will automatically cool down and not harm the ecological balance. Utility and further scope of the project: The scope of this project is vast and with a little more scientific thought, governmental support and proper funding this project can be immediately implemented on a pilot scheme. This model has been based on current and very basic technology and on the usage of natural forces to the benefit of the model. Name of the School : Delhi Public chool, Chirang, Assam.

To study the mathematics of brain cell. 2. To find out the level of secretio n of dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain and corr elate it with fractals. 3. To study the fractal dimension by box counting method of nucleus/ neuron of brain cell in normal person, Parkinson's sufferer and Alzheimer's sufferer. 4. To find out a proper way of diagnosing Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disea se. Scientific Principle Involved: 1. The secretion of dopamine level and acetylcholine level is reduced after being inflicted with Parkinson's disease. 2. Higher the stage of disease more the fractal dimension. The fractal dimension was found by the m ethod of box counting using MS Excel, Geogebra and Graphmatica. 3. As the complexity of the figure increases i.e. the disease becomes more severe, then the FD also increases. Materials Used: Geogebra, MS Excel, MS Word etc. Working Investigations/Findings : The project is based on discussion and research about the working of the brain cells in normal conditions and in neurological diseases, precisely, Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second largest neuro -degenerative disorder estimated to afflict approximately 3% of the population over the age of 65. It is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system. PD is a chronic condition that occurs when brain cells (neurons) deteriorate. This causes an inadequate supply of the chemical, d opamine, which controls the muscle activity Utility and further scope of the p roject : In future, if we are able to invent a drug which decreases the fractal dimension of the brain cell, then we may be able to find a cure for the disease. We would like to carry on the same research with different idiopathic diseases and find a diagnosis for the same .

The initial cost of laying the solar panels is high, because a typical household requires 5 kWh per year energy whereas a con ventional set of the solar panel produces around 1 kWh per year, with the initial laying cost of around ` 4 lacs approx. Mathematical Principles Involved: The mathematics is used everywhere in this project; costing, working time, total energy production, i ncrease percent in energy production etc. The speed of the rotating panel is equal to .000069 meter per second, which is so small that the axis on which it's rotating will not feel the pressure, and the system will work without any problem. Sun has a major impact on the amount of power received by a solar collector. When the sun's rays are perpendicular to the absorbing surface, the power density on the surface is equal to the incident power density. However, as the angle between the sun and the absorbing surface changes, the intensity on the surface is reduced. When the module is parallel to the sun's rays (and the angleto the module normal = 90\u00b0) the intensity of light essentially falls to zero. For intermediate angles, the relative power density is cos() where is the angle between the sun's rays and the module normal. 309 Material Used: For making our model, we have a preset in the integrated circuit, a skeletal wooden structure for depicting a typical building, few wires (for circuit), a transistor and a resistor, solar panels and bulbs (which glow to show that the circuit is complete). Light sensitive sensors are also placed on the cardboard beside the solar panel. Batteries are used. Working: We aim to make the solar panels rotate in the direction of the sun and move with the suns further movements. This will highly increase energy production per panel as it will be receiving the maximum solar radiation. The movement of the solar panel will be ensured by the installation of solar light sensors. When they are installed they will move at the angle where they receive the maximum radiation and assure maximum consumption of solar energy. The angle of installation can be altered as per the location. Utility: Our project has a A simple model based on the working of a solar tracker. Low setting up cost. Less number of solar panels decrease the foundation cost. DC motors are cheaply available and can be installed/integrated easily in the pre-existing setups. Scope: This is an eco-friendly project, which is very helpful for the society. It has large scope in the society. Wherever there is an installation of solar panel system, they just need to be upgraded or modifies into this model which will increase the energy output for the particular consuming unit. Also our project is based on one axis rotation but with the further enhancement in field of Mathematics & Science, it can be made a two axis rotating model which would increase energy output and further decrease costing.

To ensure efficient space utilization. 2. Making our structures safer and stronger. 3. Removing flaws of conventional designs, out of the box structure. Scientific Principle: The Hexa-Parking-Lot is a mathematical model which could prove to be very useful in practical life. It is based on the following principles: Symmetry Maximum usage by Minimum wastage of space in a given area. Less normal force experienced in case of earthquakes and tremors by the structure when implemented with such a design. Materials used: Polycarbonate Fiber Sheets , Plastic rods and wire casing , Springs , Wires(to hold the springs in place), Clay, Araldite(as adhesive) Working investigation/Findings: The Hexa-Parking-Lot is better than the existing conventional quadrilateral designs, out of which Square is the most common. The Hexa Parking lot occupies less area and accommodates a larger number of cars. Its design makes it easier to drive out from the parking as most positions provide nearly equal proximity to the main entry/exit lane. A single lane for entry and exit saves the space \"wasted\" in conventional designs, where separate lanes are required for entry and exit. This design offers better seismic stability as compared to other designs. It thus, has a better probability of resisting damage when earthquake or other similar events occur. The unique design of the ramp reduces its chances of falling onto the structure, thus enhancing the overall safety factor of the structure. Utility and Further scope of the project: With rapid deforestation and land reclamation from the sea already creating havoc in the environment, it is important for us to make use of all the space we already have in the best possible way, rather than further disturbing ecological balance. 311 If implemented effectively, this structure is capable of accommodating an extra of 6 cars per lane in outer rings and about 4-5 extra cars in innermost ring on a small scale. If implemented on a large scale, it can increase the capacity of the parking manifold, as can be guessed from the above mentioned figures. Better seismic performance can reduce damage to the structure in case disasters strike, thus making rebuilding easier. Name of the School : Dayanand Public School, The Mall, Shimla, H.P.
