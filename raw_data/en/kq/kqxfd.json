Naturopathic medicine is based on the principle that the body has the ability to heal itself by using the supplementation of herbs, nutritional therapy, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, and lifestyle management. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) promote wellness using safe, effective, and the least invasive therapies available. NDs are primary care doctors who attend accredited four-year naturopathic medical schools and trained in the same sciences as MDs with a focus on natural approaches to treating diseases. When deemed appropriate, NDs may prescribe medication when required based on their scope practice. NDs can work with other health care providers and advocates for a collaborative approach to patient health. Chinese Medicine Chinese medicine refers to a range of ancient medical practices developed in China over 2000 years ago. It includes herbal medicine, acupuncture, bodywork, and dietary therapy based on the theory of harmonious energy flow or qi in our bodies. If the qi is blocked, symptoms and disease manifest. In order to determine which organ systems in the body are affected, a Chinese medicine practitioner will look at the appearance of your tongue and feel the quality of your hand pulses for proper treatment. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a treatment based on Chinese medicine that uses fine needles inserted into specific points along the body or energy pathways called meridians that flow to all the organs. When the meridians are blocked, the body's energy or qi will become imbalanced and cause disease. Insertion of the acupuncture needles will restore balance to the qi. Depending on a health condition, a series of acupuncture sessions may be necessary. Briefly, needling of acupuncture points will release certain chemicals from the brain, spinal cord, and muscles. The chemicals known as endorphins will cause a signal to trigger other chemicals to be released from the body to optimize health. Some common conditions besides pain treated with acupuncture include the following: chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, menstruation issues, headaches, fibromyalgia, and asthma.
