Defining CAM is difficult, because the field is very broad and constantly changing. The National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines CAM as a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. Conventional medicine (also called Western or allopathic medicine) is medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) and D.O. (doctor of osteopathic medicine) degrees and by allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. The boundaries between CAM and conventional medicine are not absolute, and specific CAM practices may, over time, become widely accepted. \"Complementary medicine\" refers to use of CAM together with conventional medicine, such as using acupuncture or massage in addition to usual care to help lessen pain. Most use of CAM by Americans is complementary. \"Alternative medicine\" refers to use of CAM in place of conventional medicine. \"Integrative medicine\" combines treatments from conventional medicine and CAM for which there is some high-quality evidence of safety and effectiveness. It is also called integrated medicine. (Source: Taken "}
