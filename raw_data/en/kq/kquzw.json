Read more about some of these schemes on Page 3. The RDO now manages a reporting calendar, designed to aid management of annual reporting and follow -on funds release on grants. Read more abou t these activities on Page 4. With an increasing number of new grants being activated across the campus, it is becoming imperative for PIs to have the necessary regulatory approvals in place. We request all grant applicants (or laboratory heads for early career researchers) to either have the approvals in place or in the pipeline prior to submitting new grant.

We wish all the investigators well for their proposed programmes of research. NCBS/inSTEM PI name Title and inStem Satyajit Mayor and S Ramaswamy Targeting Head & Neck Cancer Stem Cells SANOFI HI>II Awardee perspective This collaborative grant is between three departments of the Christian Medical College, Vellore and my group at NCBS. It began with an i n t e r e s t f r o m P r o f . Ma t h e w Al e x a n d e r ( He a d o f t h e De p t o f Ne u r o l o g y ) i n h e l p i n g u s identify possible changes in intracellular calcium signaling in the peripheral blood monocytes of pre -symptomatic and symptomatic spino -cerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients. Th e idea stems from the \"calcium hypothesis\" of neurodegeneration in SCA patients. The hypothesis proposes the existence of early changes in intracellular calcium homeostasis as a key causative feature leading to neurodegeneration. Prof. Alexander helped my graduate student Dhanya and myself meet up with the Community Health Department in CMC (also collaborators on the grant), who in turn introduced us to a community of villagers in the vicinity of CMC, Vellore where there is a high incidence of a geneticall y inherited dominant form of SCA. Our preliminary work, funded by a small grant from NCBS, first confirmed the SCA subtype as SCA1, and then went onto identify the presence of the SCA1 polyQ repeat amongst the villagers. Analysis of the preliminary human g enetic data was helped considerably by Dr. Odity Mukherjee from NCBS, and our third CMC collaborator, Prof. Sumita Danda who heads the Dept of Clinical Genetics. The current grant aims to measure changes in transcripts and miRNA profiles of pre -symptomati c and symptomatic individuals over a five year time scale, and correlate these changes with disease progression. In parallel we hope to measure calcium signals in freshly isolated PBMCs of the same individuals to ascertain if changes in neuronal function are reflected in blood cells. The long term aim is to understand the extent of calcium signaling changes during the process of neurodegeneration with the hope of providing drugs that can alleviate these changes and thus slow down or prevent neurodegenerat ion.

The RDO has now started managing the collation and dispatch of scientific and financi al progress reports to agencies . In addition, Agencies may require copies of ethical approval documents from our committees dealing with Biosafety, Animal ethics and Stem cell ethics prior to releasing follow -on funds. In these cases, the RDO will request these docume nts from PIs for inclusion with the paperwork. To aid management of grant reporting , we have generated a reporting calendar for all PI -based extramural grants and competitive post -doctoral fellowships at NCBS and inStem. A copy of this calendar is availab le for viewing on request from the RDO. Based on the dates in this calendar, new starter Aruna (see below) has started writing to the Principal applicants on these grants to verify details and request copies of the appropriate scientific report s. In para llel, PIs receiving any communication from awarding agencies regarding their follow -on reporting requirements are requested to be in touch with the RDO and we can coordinate the process internally. PIs are requested to review grant spend data with colleag ues in Accounts prior to finalizing the UC/SoEs. It would be advisable to run down available funds and work towards reporting a \"zero -balance\" on all extramural reports going out to the Agencies. All financial management on grants will continue to be the responsibility of our Accounts Teams, who should be contacted for queries in this regard. The RDO will only be providing due diligence and oversight on the reporting process to Agencies. If you have any queries , suggestions or concerns regarding the pro cess for reporting, please contact Savita Ayyar at ayyars@ncbs.res.in.
