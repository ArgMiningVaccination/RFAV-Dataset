Snehapana or ghee drinking is the key component of an Ayurvedic detox. Snehapana involves drinking special formulations of Ayurvedic ghee that seek to (i) promote full-body detoxification, (ii) enhance essential bodily functions, such as digestion and gastrointestinal function, and (iii) alleviate ailments such as back pain, neck pain, joint point, inflammation, and general aches and pains linked to toxicity in the body. Note: Snehapana is meant to be performed under the supervision of an Ayurvedic doctor and in an environment that is conducive to rest, relaxation, and rejuvenation. Snehapana is not meant to be performed at home. Only those who are in generally good health and who have done panchakarma before, multiple times, may attempt to do so snehapana at home, which should then be followed by virechana (purgation) or the castor oil cleanse.

How to prepare for detox Prior to the ghee drinking days, it is important to prepare the body for the consumption and proper digestion of ghee. This means that we have to strengthen the body's agni (digestive fire) and adopt certain routines to take advantage of the body's natural detoxification mechanisms. The following are some generic guidelines to prepare the body for detoxing at home: 1. Adopt a pure vegetarian diet, at least two days in advance of Day 1 of snehapana (ghee drinking). If possible, start a vegetarian diet one week prior to snehapana. 2. Drink warm water or hot water throughout the day, especially upon waking first thing in the morning. Waters that are supportive of detox and digestion include: lemon water, ginger water, tulsi water, and mint water. Boiled water with jeera (cumin), ajwain (bishop's weed) and cinnamon is also encouraged. The basic premise is that hot water cleans the body, much the same as we use hot water to clean dishes or a car or something that is really dirty. Drinking herbal water also promotes digestion which is important prior to starting snehapana. 3. Avoid all forms of cold drinks, including ice water, colas, red bull, and other variations of cold water. 4. Avoid smoking. If you are a smoker, try to reduce the frequency of smoke breaks taken throughout the day; smoke half a cigarrette and then put it out; and switch to a lighter brand of cigarettes or tobacco. 5. Avoid alcohol. If you drink alcohol, try to avoid hard alcohol, beer and other cold alcoholic drinks. If you must drink, then opt for red wine or brandy. But it is better to abstain altogether. The liver and the body in general utilizes a lot of energy in order to remove alcohol from the body. When we consume alcohol, we take away energy from other bodily processes, such as digestion of food, because our liver is busy getting rid of alcohol. 7. Start going to bed earlier at least 30 minutes earlier every single day, until you are in the habit of going to sleep at 9:30 pm. This is essential for supporting your body's natural detoxification cycle, which starts at roughly 10:00 pm everday. To reiterate: cigarettes, alcohol, and non-vegetarian food must absolutely be curtailed, if not rigorously avoided, if one is hoping for a very deep and effective detox. Exercise rules for detox On the ghee drinking days, it is important to focus on rest, relaxation, mental quietude, and recuperation. It is equally important to avoid excessive stimuli, whether artificial or natural. For exercise during snehapana, the following is recommended: 1. No weigh-lifting. 2. No cardio. Light walking is acceptable. 3. Light yoga is encouraged but not power yoga, hot yoga, or aerobic forms of yoga. 4. Gentle stretching is strongly encouraged. 5. Sitting with good posture, upright, back straight, and knees below the hips (if possible) is ideal. Any yogic sitting posture that supports good digestion is encouraged. 6. Favour reading over television. 7. If you must resort to Netflix or other forms of entertainment, avoid images and stories involving negativity, violence, death, sadness, destruction, and darkness. Focus on material that is light, energizing, inspiring, humorous, and educational. Remember that what disturbs the mind and the senses ultimately inhibits digestion and detoxification. 1.

Caffeine and cold drinks Prior to starting any pancharkama program, and particularly ahead of snehapana, it is important to avoid or reduce the consumption of caffeinated drinks. Caffeinated cold drinks, such as Coke and Pepsi, are to be rigorously avoided before, during, and after detox. Energy drinks are to be eliminated altogether from one's diet. During the 1. No coffee 2. No black tea 3. No green tea 4. No lemon water As a substitute for the above, herbal teas that are caffeine-free may be consumed. Home-made preparations of herbal teas are best. See the \"preparation\" section above for suggestions. While there are some health benefits to drinking tea and coffee, these are to be avoided during snehapana. Consumption of tea and coffee may be resumed three days after virechana (purgation). During the [Five Day Home Detox](https://www.ayurooms.com/detox-at-home.html#home), the following is strongly recommended: 1. No coffee 2. No black tea 3. No green tea 4.

The Five-Day Detox The five-day detox involves three days of ghee drinking with a strict diet consisting of only kanji, that is, a traditional Indian soup made from red rice or brown rice. Following three days of ghee drinking and kanji, there is a day of rest. A normal vegetarian diet may be enjoyed on Day 4, but no coffee, tea, fruits, or raw foods. Only cooked foods. No salads. Day 5 is the day of reckoning. Purgation. Virechana. This involves drinking castor oil (around 60 ml) , mixed with either fresh orange juice or fresh grapefruit juice, on empty stomach, early in the morning.

Panchakarma is an ancient, time-tested and structured process of removing toxins from the body. Panchakarma is a seasonal routine recommended by Ayurveda, the world's oldest living system of holistic health. Ayurveda offers various kinds of internal treatments, external treatments, diet and exercise, to rid the body of toxins. Internal treatments include herbal medicines that are consumed orally as well as special enemas, known as bastis. External body treatments involve full body massages, local massages, scrubs, milk baths, oil baths, and other processes and treatments. In panchakarma, one of the core methods of detoxication is snehapana or ghee drinking, which has been explained above. Why is panchakarma necessary? According to Ayurveda, physical and mental ailments are linked to, and caused by, the accumulation of toxins in the body. Toxins or ama disturb the body's natural balance of the three doshas - vata, pitta, and kapha - the energy systems that govern the external world and the inner workings of the body. Toxins and toxicity are unavoidable in modern life - they exist in the air we breathe, the food we consume, the drinks we drink, and even the thoughts we think. Panchakarma is necessary to correct imbalances in the body, prevent ill health, slow down the aging process and, ultimately, promote mental well-being. What is included in a panchakarma package? A panckarma package from Ayurooms includes: - Private accommodations - Airport pickup and drop-off - Detailed health consultation on arrival - All meals and medicines for duration of stay - Body treatments (at least 90 minutes daily) - Yoga (at least 60 minutes daily) - Daily health checkups at the resort - Nutritional advice and post-visit counselling - Assistance with visa process - Assistance with planning your flights - All applicable taxes - Free wifi Why type of food during panchakarma? Most of our detox resorts serve only vegetarian food. However, if you require a detox resort that will provide you with non-vegetarian food, send us an email at [info@ayurooms.com](mailto:info@ayurooms.com)or submit your request via our contact form.
