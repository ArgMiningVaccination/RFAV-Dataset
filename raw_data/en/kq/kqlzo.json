On the other hand, given their long years of education, residency, and training, western medicine doctors are expected to successfully treat most of their patients. Because of this expectation, if something were to go wrong, it often results in the blame of the doctor, personal attacks, or even legal action. The typical biological causes of health problems, according to western medicine, make illnesses seem more controllable, in comparison to the abstract spiritual causes of the Hmong. This is what gives rise to the difference in patient reaction to failed medical Every culture is different, and are unique by their beliefs, values, remedies, and many people live by that, many people believe in all these topics, and many people also think that everything is a lie. The most common customs of Zacatecas are the Festivals, Festivals, and Fairs of Zacatecas. The main festivals in Zacatecas are the religious ones that are celebrated in each one of the municipalities in honor to the patron of the place, also the regional celebrations, in the capital of the state the celebrations are celebrated in the month of September, being day 8 when The Virgin of Patronage is also commemorated. There are also various events in the fair 's cultural and artistic facilities, such as bullfights, Palenque, exhibitions, dances, horse races and gastronomic exhibitions. Also, there are There are many different cultures in the world and how they approach medical needs may not all be the same. As a Vietnamese American I know both ways how American people and Vietnamese people approach for healthcare. Most American when we are sick we go to the doctors and they diagnose us with whatever and give us a prescription for medication or would refer us out to a specialist that would be able to help us. While Asians or better yet Vietnamese when we get sick we sometimes do not just go to the doctors we try herbal medications at home on our own and on what knowledge we know and from our friends and families. Also we believe in that acupuncture can help us from a lot of different things it can help with trembling, aches and such. Americans Herbal remedies are not as simple as just determining the illness and giving the prescribed medicine, without having knowledge of the body. The fundamental element of medicine in the Medieval time period is the theory of humours. This theory followed through until they reach the 19th century where more modern analysis could conducted. Humours also known as principle fluids are made up of four different fluid found in each individual: black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm. Each of the fluids are found in different organ of the body, black bile resides in the spleen and is the cause for melancholy, yellow bile is secreted by the liver and can cause irascibility, phlegm comes from the lungs and can be denounced to sluggishness, and the final This relevant data about Native American substance abuse is just a remark that these communities still have a long way to go in terms of health and healing treatment, but it shows that even though they have communities ravaged by alcohol, drugs and diseases like smallpox they are still here and will make their voices heard. Locura is a culture bound syndrome that affects Latin Americans and Hispanics, regardless of where they are born, in the United States or South America (Jilek 2001:5,9). Locura has also been documented in immigrants from the Caribbean Islands (Razzouk 2011:517). In Columbia, Locura is also known as \"ataques de locura\" madness attacks, it is attributed to a spell known as \"maleficio\". Locura is commonly associated with other culture bound syndromes thru out Central and South America, such as ataques de nervious (nervios) and possession syndromes (Pi\u00f1eros 1998:1425). Up until the Communist revolution, Taoism was a very prominent religion within the nation. Originating in China about 2000 years ago, Taoism focuses on a theme known as \"The Tao\". In English, this translates to \"The Way\". The Tao is impossible to perceive but we are able to observe its effects on the world around us. People of the Taoist faith believe that all beings are unified or interconnected. As part of this faith, there is no worship of one divine being but, Taoism does permit many deities. However, the deities still remain connected to the universe and depend on The Tao. This aspect of Taoism contributes to one of the doctrines Taoism promotes, achieving harmony with nature. Another concept Taoism promotes is the concept of spiritual China's healthcare has been through a roller coaster of reform, impacting the health of every citizen throughout history. The country has endured many impactful changes with the large shifts in power, eventually leading to its current healthcare system today. The Cultural Revolution of China was a starting point, with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) taking power in 1949. The CCP implemented a health system reflecting the Marxist communist ideology. Health care was universal. Due to almost free health care provided to every individual, no health insurance was necessary. All heath organizations and establishments were owned by the CPP, employing every healthcare worker (Blumenthal, 2015). The CCP initiated a program to address the healthcare The second image that I would like to focus on in this paper is the emerald green color that was emanating as light in my dream. The first, and most obvious association, is that green is simply my favorite color. It is one that I most often turn to when Taoism is an indigenous chinese religion and a philosophy which has roots from ancient shamanism. It has lived through centuries in China as a religion aside Confucianism and Buddhism and as a philosophy aside Confucianism. As a philosophy it is mainly the opposite of Confucianism, because Confucianism praised laws and order but Taoism is more about people having minimal restrictions in order to live happily. The Taoist religion was created from the Taoist philosophy and as a philosophy and religion it has had a huge influence in China and in eastern Asia. Although, as a religion it would outline all the seven dimensions it is debatable if it is more of a philosophy. Taoism's open-mindedness has kept it almost original and unchanged Western medicine is increasing the lives of many in different ways using advances in the medical field. Western medicine is the process of looking at the body like a machine it finds a problem and fixes that problem. Today Western medicine is superior and eastern medicine is considered taboo. Eastern medicine looks at the body as a garden and instead of giving you medication they try to start at the root of the problem by talking about what's going on in your life. Specific purpose: To inform my audience about Traditional Chinese Medicine's perspective on Emotions and how it can help overcome emotional problems. In a cold winter day, have you ever observed white smoke come out from your mouth when you exhale? Have you ever thoroughly felt the force pressing on your skin when wind blows? These are some of the states that \"qi\" appears in our daily lives. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TMC), qi plays as a fundamental component from time to time explaining its ideas. Theories of both Chinese and Western medicine exist for helping people maintain good health and away from deceases. Western medicine relies more on scientific proof \"Western medicine places strong emphasis on the physical structures of the body, which are made up of different organic and inorganic substances, proteins, tissues and cells.\" (Shen Lung Ltd, 2002) Unlike western medicine, TMC originates and relies very much on Chinese philosophical theories. And the theory of qi is one of them. This essay will be explaining what qi is in Chinese medicine, including its general concept, movement and flow in human body, functions, what would be \"Medications that impact the central nervous system and alter (slow down) they way our nerves think and our reflexes respond can put patients' at risk during physical therapy and certainly at risk for falls\".

For over 3000 years humankind has been developing a plant that has incited poems, led to the foundation of trade routes and molded human civilization. With its foundations in China, the tea plant has a rich history, and is encompassed by a fascinating culture. During my travel to Hangzhou, my Chinese friends told me interesting stories of China, and the legend of Shen Nong, the \"divine farmer\", who taught the Chinese the art of growing tea leaves and agriculture as a whole. The official origins of tea can be traced down to southwestern China in the Yunnan province, where it was first used "}
