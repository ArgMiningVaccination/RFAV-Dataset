It allows your stomach to empty, prevents acid reflux, and promotes overall good health. Early light dinner is also beneficial for natural detoxification, which occurs overnight. Add more fresh salads and soups to your dinner as it helps cleanse your system. Following this Ayurvedic practices promote sustainable weight loss.

You may also go swimming, cycling, and running. The best time of the day to exercise is early in the morning for the best benefits. Have Continuous, Sound Sleep at Night Improper sleeping patterns or disturbed sleep can impact your health and weight negatively. Inadequate sleep may make you put on undesirable weight. According to Ayurveda, you should have 8 hours of sound, and undisturbed sleep at night, ideally from 10 pm to 6 am. Go for Triphala Triphala powder is of great significance in Ayurveda for healthy digestion to get in shape. Triphala is effective in eliminating toxins from your body.
