Development of Vaccine 1954 -Dr. John F. Enders and Dr. Thomas C. Peebles of Boston Children's Hospital collected samples of infected children at a local private school in efforts to create a vaccine 13 yo David Edmonston was one of these children successful isolation of the virus from his blood 1958 -tested vaccine on mentally handicapped children -developed antibodies but also symptoms 1963 -Edmonston -B strain of measles virus, live vaccine was licensed for distribution in the US killed vaccine also licensed Development of Vaccine 1968 -the reformulated, more attenuated Edmonston -Enders strain continues to be the only vaccine used in the US still today Goal of Measles Elimination 1978 CDC declared a goal of eliminating measles by 1982 not accomplished 1981 -80% less cases than in 1980 1989 -1991 Resurgence of Measles in the US occurred 55,622 cases reported, 123 deaths 90% of fatal cases were in persons who were not vaccinatedResurgence unique demographics in regard to age and race 45% of cases were reported to be <5 years old incidence in infants <12months twice as high as other age groups highest incidence in minority groups hispanic and african american 4 -7x higher than for non - hispanic white children less likely to be age -apropriately vaccinated outbreak areas -vaccination rate as low as 50% by second birthday2 dose vaccine schedule 1989 -outbreak prompted the AAP, AAFP, and advisory committee on imunization practices to recommend a second dose of MMR vaccine in the preschool age population result= rapid decline of measles cases 1997 -2 year old vaccination rate was 91%Measles Elimination 2000 -United States declared Measles elimination absence of continuous disease transmission for 12 months in a specific geographic region different from eradication (zero prevalence) no longer endemic (constantly present) largely due to vaccine compliance (1) Goal Elimination Measles in sterile, preservative -free water human albumin, neomycin, sorbitol, gelatin MMR Vaccine live virus 95% of patients will develop antibodies with first dose at 12 months of age vaccine failure rate with single vaccine 2 -5% 2 dose efficacy 99% duration of immunity -lifelong foreign travel < 1year of age Vaccine Schedule Adverse Side Effects fever 5-15% rash 5% joint symptoms encephalopathy<1/1,000,000 dosesMMR V vs MMRV CDC recommends first dose as MMR + V in the age group 12 -15 mos second dose may be MMRV in older population MMR + V MMRV MMRV any adverse reactions?

To the contrary, there is a great wealth of evidence that they cause serious side effects.\" --Dr. Viera Scheibner \"My suspicion, which is shared by others in my profession, is that the nearly 10,000 SIDS deaths that occur in the United States each year are related to one or more of the vaccines that are routinely given children. The pertussis vaccine is the most likely villain, but it could also be one or more of the others.\" --Dr. Mendelsohn, M.D. QuickTime and a H.264 decompressor are needed to see this picture. megan's storyAnti-vaxer converts Pro-vaccine Media Autism Speaks urges vaccination Conclusion better understand history and clinical course of the Measles virus able to recognize Measles exanthem discuss recent outbreaks and safety profile of vaccine with future patients references http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Pages/Measles.aspx http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/measles Pediatrics PerspectiveThe First Measles Vaccine.
