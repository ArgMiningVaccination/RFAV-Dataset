Guests must provide proof of vaccination that they have received both vaccination doses prior embarkation. [Cruise Industry News ](https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/24410-crystal-cruises-to-require-covid-19-vaccine-for-guests.html)reports that Crystal recognizes that the widespread availability of vaccines will vary depending on each traveler's home country and / or state distribution plan. What about the crew? For now Crystal Cruises crew, will not be required to be vaccinated since this may not be a viable option at this time, however, this will be expected in future once there's widespread roll out of vaccines and availability. \"As part of the company's Crystal Clean+ 4.0 measures, crew members will be tested for COVID-19 prior to leaving their home location to join the ship and must receive a negative result. They also will take a COVID-19 test at embarkation; quarantine for seven days upon arrival; be tested again at the end of that seven-day period and must receive a negative result before beginning their duties,\" said Crystal Cruises CEO, Jack Anderson. \"When vaccines are widely available, they will be a requirement of employment for crew which must be completed at least 14 days prior to service.\" \"We are encouraged by the progress being made with the COVID-19 vaccines and what this means for our Crystal Family and the travel industry as a whole as we eagerly look forward to exploring the world again,\" Anderson noted. \"We know that peace of mind is the greatest luxury; and the vaccine requirement is simply the best way to ensure the safest possible Crystal Experience for all onboard. This sentiment is underscored by conversations with our guests and travel partners and a recent Cruise Critic survey of cruisers that revealed that more than 80 percent of respondents would cruise if a vaccine were required.\" The company also announced extension of pause in operations of its river fleet through May 2021, and through June for its ocean-going vessels, through August 1 for Crystal Esprit, and through August for Crystal Endeavor , to give most travelers ample time to relax before Crystal resumes to be fully vaccinated of sailing.
