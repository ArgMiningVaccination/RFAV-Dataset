St. Brigid assumed the persona of the pagan goddess Br\u00edd, or Brigid - a Celtic Goddess of inspiration, healing, and smith-craft with associations to fire, the hearth and poetry.' - Brigidine Sisters, Kildare Offered by Treacy O'Connor Location: Your nearest St Brigid's well - if you are unsure of where that might be, you are invited to connect with the elders in your community and make enquiries. John Willmott, The Woodland Bard, has begun a process of locating some of the Brigid wells, on the following link: [https://goo.gl/maps/GNEtifZBgEQi6mw99](https://goo.gl/maps/GNEtifZBgEQi6mw99?fbclid=IwAR1FsxunDdYgaGWTDyC5Dp-M31fnBYct3FMwgGGjiXcMHzBfEMk7qIwp_Ig) Intention: To bring healing to any inner or outer conflict. This may be individual and personal or on behalf of others in the local, wider or global community. Items to bring: Tea Light Candle and lighter and an empty jar. An offering to the land, such as rose petals or oats - something natural and organic, that is easily compostable or can feed the song birds of spring. This ceremony can be done in a group or individually. As you approach the well, bring yourself to a state of presence with your surroundings. Hear the sounds of nature, feel the air, breathe it in. Take time to centre yourself in your own presence and in your environment. Really notice the nature that surrounds you. In coming to your senses, you allow yourself to hear the nature of the land more fully and to be more fully immersed in her presence. Call on the energy of Brigid, the Divine Feminine presence of healing, and protection, to hold you and your intentions. As you reach the well, again take time to be present with the energy that flows from the source of the sacred water. Notice, the sounds, the movement of the water. Feel safe in this place. Feel safe in yourself, calling on Brigid to surround you with her energetic cloak of protection. Then drop into your heart. Feel all that your heart holds and invite any sensations of tension to come forward. Allow yourself to feel the depths of your heart, as you stand at the deep source of this well. You might notice any movement in the water calling you to breathe into your heart and allow any waters within you to flow through to release of tears, if necessary. Stay with your heart. Feel Brigid's protection and holding. Allow yourself to feel held and comforted. You might want to close your eyes. As you feel your feet on the ground, imagine that you are dropping energetic roots into the source of the well beneath the ground. Imagine the healing energetic water rising through your roots, cleansing, purifying, refreshing your energy. Imagine that this energetic cleanse continues through your body, cleansing your nervous system, revitalising you. It reaches your heart. Continues through to the top of your head and imagine a fountain of light falling down around you to the earth, as any tension or pain is released. Pause a while, allowing this flow. When it feels right, take a deep breath, draw your energetic roots back up from the water and bring some gentle movement to your body. Stretch or walk as you begin to feel lighter. Give thanks to Brigid for this healing cleanse and offer your gift, of rose petals or oats, to the earth. If you would like to, open your voice and allow a tune to emerge, just like the birds of spring, welcoming the returning light. Don't worry if you feel you \"can't sing\", just allow one note to emerge and allow your heart to do the rest. Then take your candle and invoke Brigid's flame as you light the candle and place it in the open jar. Feel the light, notice the flame, feel it ignite your heart flame anew. As you feel lighter in yourself, you might imagine sending this heart flame out to all others who are feeling conflict, loss, grief or pain at this time. Ask Brigid to help you spread this light, like her magical cloak across the land, available to anyone who could benefit in times of need. You may wish to carry your Brigid's flame in the jar for a while, feeling its warmth, before giving thanks and blowing it out. Knowing that as you relight this candle at any time, it holds the sacred presence of Brigid and your heart. Before you leave the space of the well, you may like to thank Brigid and the spirit of nature for holding you in this ceremony and thank yourself and your experiences that have led you to this point and any others involved. Thank you for connecting with Brigid's powerful energy. She is ever present, particularly as we move from winter to spring, from darkness to light, from despair to hope, from suffering to illumination. Many Bright Blessings of a New Dawn to you and yours.
