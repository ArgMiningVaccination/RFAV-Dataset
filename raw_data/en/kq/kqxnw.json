In order to transform it, we have to learn how to control our desires, unenlightened mind and anger. Some aids to achieving inner harmony are: positive thinking, good will, conscious speech and action, healthy lifestyle, self-control, vigilant awareness and meditation.

Let one teaspoon of herbal blend (cca 2g) simmer for 3-5 minutes or pour 250 ml of boiling water and allow 10 minutes infusion. Recommended Dosage 2-3 cups a day Use The Himalayan herbs are traditionally boiled for 3 to 5 minutes in case they serve as a remedy enhancing mental and bodily functions. Such decoction has stronger effect, milder taste and beneficially influences our digestion that enables proper assimilation of health-promoting extracts of the Himalayan herbs. The teas are drunk as a part of our daily drinking regime for a period of duration of health disorders. If you undertake a herbal therapy, the tea can be used for a period of 1 to 3 months in accordance with a daily dosage indicated on the particular label. Allow one week pause after finishing each tea box. It is recommended to use maximum of two kinds of teas at the same time. For reducing symptoms of common ailments, more of the teas can be switched in daily or weekly period. Such being the case, teas are drunk separately with one hour interval. When drinking as a preventive, stimulating or supportive remedy, herb infusion is sufficient with unlimited period of use. For stronger health affectivity teas are used warm before meal. The specific taste of each tea is a part of its therapeutic effect and corresponds to the ayurvedic health properties of six tastes. Thus any kind of sweetener is not recommended. Dietary supplement. Keep out of reach of children. Do not exceed the recommended dosage. Do not use as a substitute for a balanced diet. Store in a dry place under 25\u00b0C.

The Brahmi tea helped to calm the pinching that would happen where my calcified lesion is in my brain. I'm currently writing my thesis and will be done end of July. Having a cough I drank TULSI, I used to have severe coughs for long time and allopathic remedies did not help me. The tea improved my breathing immediately, I could sleep at night and in 14 days cough was gone.TULSI Good morning, I started to prepare SARPAGANDHA tea for high blood pressure for my husband. He uses pills and his bl.pressure kept increasing. After one week of tea use, the pressure reduced to 125. Thank you for importing the teas.SARPAGANDHA Hello, I`ve been drinking APANA tea, which helped me immensely with my painful menstruation. I threw away my pills, pain disappeared. Thanks! I drank your teas already as a teenage woman. The first experience with DALCHINI tea was incredible, especially during the flu season, when this tea literally opened my airways like a miracle. Later, unfortunately, I was diagnosed with borreliosis and you know how it is with doctors (strict monitoring and a lot of chemical drugs, which my body with sensitive digestion did not handle well) and therefore I also used MANJISHTA tea with the help of borreliosis tinctures from another natural manufacturer. One year after I was diagnosed with borreliosis, neither the doctor nor the infectious disease specialist understood how it was possible to cure it so quickly. With great determination and the strength of inner energy, I will continue to use these great products. Thank you very much.MANJISHTA I have tried APANA for menstrual problems for the first time. It was pain relieving and it restored my vitality. I drank it two times a day for three days before menstrual cycle and two days during the period. I recommend it! I only can recommend, absolutely fantastic teas and they work as they should. I was searching for natural remedies for my health problems and I have finally found them :-)SHATAPUSHPI CHYAWANPRASH helped me to get rid of constipation which I had been suffering from for 14 years! Already after three days I started to eliminate once a day. Now after two months my digestion is absolutely all right. My weight also reduced by 3 kg and the atopic eczema vanishes!CHYAWANPRASH I bought a tea for good sleep and it really works!!!! I recommend dearly. Hello, I am using NIMBA tea for my skin problems.
