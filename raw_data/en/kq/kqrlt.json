The look-back period is determined as follows: ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.05 Department of Health and Welfare Eligibilit y for Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled Section 287 Page 1624 01. Transfers Prior to February 8, 2006 . For any resource transferred prior to February 8, 2006, the look-back period is thirty-six (36) months. The look-back perio d is counted from the month prior to the month the application was submitted. ( ) 02. Transfers On or After February 8, 2006 . Any resource transferred on or after February 8, 2006, regardless of type, is subject to a look-back period of sixty ( 60) months. The look-back period is counted from the date of the application for cash , or the date of the transfer, whichever is later in time. ( ) 287. CALCULATING THE PERIOD OF INELIGIBILITY FOR RESOURCE TRANSF ERS. The period of ineligibility is the number of months computed by dividing the difference be tween the fair market value of the resource and the amount the participant received for the resource by the full AABD allowances for the participant's living arrangement. For an applicant, use the ful l AABD allowance for the application month. For a participant, use the full AABD allowances for the transfer mont h. For an AABD couple, the period of ineligibility is computed by dividing the differe nce between the fair market val ue of the resource and the amount the participant received for the resource by the full AABD allowances for the c ouple's living arrangement. The number of months of ineligibility is computed to two (2) decimal places and rounded down to the nearest whole number . If the amount transferred is less than the participant's AABD allowances for one (1) month, the participant is not subject to a period of ineligibility. ( ) 288. LENGTH OF PERIOD OF INELIGIBILITY. The period of ineligibility begins with the month after the mon th the transfer took place. The period of ineligibility continues whether or not the p articipant receives AABD. Ineligi bility continues until all the resources are returned to the participant or spouse, adequate consideration for all the r esources is received, sixty (60) months passes, or the penalty period ends. ( ) 289. SPOUSE APPLIES AFTER PERIOD OF INELIGIBILITY IS COMPUTED. If the spouse applies after the period of ineligibility is comp uted, compute the spouse's period of ineligibility by multiplying the number of months in the period of ineligibility already expired by the full AABD allowances for the couple's living arrangement. Subtract the total from the origin al difference between the fair market value of the resource and the amount the participant received for the resour ce. Divide the remaining di fference between the fair market value of the resource and the amount the participant rec eived for the resource by the full AABD allowances for the couple's living arrangement for the first month of inel igibility. ( ) 290. MULTIPLE RESOURCE TRANSFERS. If the participant makes more than one (1) resource transfer, t he difference between the fair market value of all the transferred resource's and the amount the participant received for all the transferred resources is used to determine the length of the period of ineligibility. The period of ineligibil ity begins with the month after the month of the first transfer. ( ) 291. TRANSFERS TO TRUSTS. A trust established from the participant's resources is a resou rce transfer for less than fair market value, unless it meets an exception in Section 292 of these rules. If the trust includes resources of another person, the resource transfer period of ineligibility applies to the participant's s hare of the trust. ( ) 01. Payment from Trust Not for Participant . If a payment is made to another individual from a trust counted as a resource, and the payment is not for the benefit o f the participant, the payment is a resource transfer for less than fair market value. ( ) 02. Payment from Trust Restricted . If the participant takes action so no payment from a trust co unted as a resource can be made for a ny reason, the trust is a resour ce transfer for less than fai r market value. By taking the action, the participant causes the trust to be no longer counte d as a resource and the participant is subject to the period of ineligibility. The date of the action restricting payment is the date of the transfer. ( ) 292. PERIOD OF INELIGIBILITY EXCEPTIONS. A participant or spouse is not subject to the resource transfer period of ineligibility if one (1) of the following conditions is satisfied.

FEDERAL SPOUSAL IMPOVERISHMENT (FSI) METHOD OF COUNTING INC OME AND RESOURCES OF A COUPLE. The FSI method must be used to compute income and resources of a married participant, who requires long-term care as defined in Section 010 of these rules, and who has a communi ty spouse. The participant must have entered long- term care on or after September 30, 1989. Terms used in the FSI method are listed in Subsections 735.01 through 735.05 of this rule. ( ) 01. Long-Term Care Spouse . The long-term care spouse must be in a medical institution or nursing facility, or be an HCBS participant, for thirty (30) consecutiv e days, or appear likely to meet the thirty (30) days requirement. ( ) 02. Community Spouse . The community spouse is the husband or wife of the long-term care participant. A community spouse is not in long-term care and is not an HCBS participant. ( ) 03. Continuous Period of Long-Term Care . A continuous period of long-term care is a period of residence either in a medical institution with nursing facility services, or at home with HCBS. A continuous period of long-term care is also a combination of institution and persona l care services likely to last at least thirty (30) consecutive days. Absence from th e institution, or a lapse in H CBS eligibility, of thirty (30) consecutive days breaks continuity. The thirty (30) consecutive days of long-term care must not begin on a day the participant is hospitalized. I f t h e p a r t i c i p a n t i s h o s p i ta l i z e d a f t e r t h e f i r s t d a y o f t h e t hirty (30) consecutive days, the hospital stay does not interrupt the thirty (30) consecutive days. ( ) 04. Start of Continuous Period . The start of a continuous period of long-term care is the fir st month of long-term care or HCBS. ( ) 05. Nursing Facility Services . Nursing facility services are services at the nursing facilit y level or the intermediate care for persons with intellectual disabilities le vel provided in a medical institution. ( ) 736. ASSESSMENT DATE AND COUNTING FSI RESOURCES. The assessment date is the start date of the first continuous p eriod of long-term care. The Department does a one-time assessment to determine the value of the couple's community and separate resources as of the date of the first continuous period of long-term care. The resource assessment is done at the request of either spouse, after one spouse is in long-term care or meets the level of care for HCBS, wheth er or not the couple has applied for Medicaid. State laws relating to community property or the division of marital property are not applied in determining the FSI total combined resources of the couple. ( ) 737. TREATMENT OF RESOURCES FOR ASSESSMENT. The resource rules used in determining eligibility for AABD cas h and Medicaid are also used in determining the couple's total combined resources for the FSI resource assessme nt with the following exceptions: ( ) 01. Resources For Sale . Excess resources offered for sale, are not excluded from the couple's total combined resources for the FSI resource assessment. ( ) 02. Jointly Owned Real Property . Jointly owned real property that is not the principal residen ce of the participant, is not excluded, if the community spouse is th e joint owner. ( ) 03. Long-term Care Partnership Policy . Resources excluded because of a participant's qualified long-term care policy are not excluded for the FSI resource ass essment. ( ) 04. Excluded Home . As defined in 42 U.S.C. 1396r-5(c)(5), an excluded home place d in trust retains its exclusion for purposes of the resource assessment. ( ) 738. ONE-HALF SPOUSAL SHARE. The spousal share is one-half (1/2) of the couple's total combi ned resources on the assessment date. The spousal share does not change, even if the participant leaves long-term care and then enters long-term care again. The Department must inform the couple of the resources counted in the assessme nt and the value assigned. The couple must sign the assessment form under penalty of perjury. The signature require ment may be waived for the long-term care spouse if IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.05 Department of Health and Welfare Eligibilit y for Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled Section 742 Page 1663 he or his representative says he is unable to sign the resource s assessment. A copy of the assessment form must be provided to each spouse when eligibility is determined or when either spouse requests a assessment prior to application. ( ) 739. -- 741. (RESERVED) 742. COMMUNITY SPOUSE RESOURCE ALLOWANCE. The CSRA protects resources for the community spouse. The CSRA is determined by subtracting the greater of the minimum resource allowance, or the spousal share from the coupl e's total combined resources as of the first day of the application month. The deduction must not be more than the maximum resource allowance at the time eligibility is determined. ( ) 743. RESOURCE ALLOWANCE LIMITS. The maximum resource allowance is computed by multiplying sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (a ll items; U.S. city average) between September 1988 and the September before the current calendar year. The minimum resource allowance is computed by multiplying twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (all items; U.S. city average) between September 1988 and the Septem ber before the current calendar year. If the result is not an even one hundred dollar ($100) amount, round up to the n ext one hundred dollars ($100). The couple's resources exceeding the CSRA are counted for the long-term care spouse. ( ) 744. INCOME COUNTED FIRST FOR CSRA REVISION. Income is determined prior to determining resources. If the cou ple's income is more than the minimum CSNS, the CSRA cannot be increased. If the community spouse has less inco me than the minimum CSNS, the CSRA may be increased as provided in Section 745 of these rules. Couple inc ome is the community spouse's gross income plus the long-term care spouse's income. The long-term care spouse's inc ome is his gross income less the AABD cash income exclusions and his patient liability income deductions, but not the CSA deduction. ( ) 745. UPWARD REVISION OF CSRA. If the community spouse's income, including income from his CSA and income-producing resources in his CSRA, is less than the minimum CSNS, the CSRA may be increased. The CSRA is increased by enough resources, transferred from the long-term care spouse, to raise the community spouse's income to the minimum CSNS Resources included in the transfer are presumed to produce income at the treasury rate, whether or not the resources produce income. If the community spouse shows he is making reasonable use of his i ncome and resources, to generate income, the Department may waive the treasury rate requirement. Actual inco me produced by the resources transferred to the community spouse is used to compute the CSA. A higher CSA can b e requested under Section 727 of these rules. If the transferred resources produce more than the treasury rate, the actual income produced i s used to determine the additional resources that can be transferred to the community s pouse in the CSRA. The long-term care spouse must transfer the resources to the community spouse, or the CSRA is not revised. ( ) 746. RESOURCE TRANSFER ALLOWANCE (RTA). The resource transfer allowance (RTA) is computed by subtractin g the community spouse's resources, at the time of application, from the CSRA. The community spouse must own less than the CSRA to get an RTA. The long term care spouse may transfer the R T A to the community spouse without an asset transfer penalty. If the institutional spouse transfers more than the RTA, the amount of the couple's resourc es over the CSRA counts as the institutional spouse's resources. After the month a long-term care spouse is determine d Medicaid eligible under FSI, resources of the community spouse are not considered available to the him while he remains in long-term care. ( ) 747. PROTECTED PERIOD FOR RTA TRANSFER. The long-term care spouse has sixty (60) days, from the date hi s application is approved, to transfer his ownership of the RTA resources to the community spouse. The long-term care s pouse must state, in writing, his intent to transfer the RTA resources to the community spouse, within the protected period, before he can be Medicaid eligible. Resources not transferred within the sixty (60) day protected p eriod are available to the long-term care spouse, effective the day he entered the facility. ( ) 748. EXTENSION FOR RTA TRANSFER. The protected period can be extended beyond sixty (60) days if necessary because of the participant's circumstances. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.05 Department of Health and Welfare Eligibilit y for Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled Section 749 Page 1664 749. RESOURCE ELIGIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY SPOUSE. When the community spouse is a Medicaid participant, the spouse 's resources are counted using Medicaid rules. The FSI rules apply only to the long-term care spouse. For the mont h the couple stopped living together, resources of the community spouse available for his Medicaid eligibility are the resources owned by the couple. ( ) 750. INCOME ELIGIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY SPOUSE. When the community spouse is a Medicaid participant, the spouse 's income is counted using Medicaid rules. The FSI rules apply only to the long-term care spouse. The community sp ouse may choose between the SSI and CP methods for determining income for M edicaid eligibility. ( ) 751. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES. The FSI method of calculating income and resources stops the fi rst full calendar month after a change in circumstances resulting in a coup le no longer having a communit y spouse and a long-term care spouse. ( ) 752. NOTICE AND HEARING. The Department must tell the participant the CSA, the family me mber allowance, the CSRA and how it was computed, and RTA. Any hearing requested about the CSRA or the RTA must be held within thirty (30) days of the date of the request for hearing. ( ) 753. -- 760. (RESERVED) 761. CHOICE OF SSI OR CP METHODS. A married participant, not using FSI, must be furnished a writt en explanation of SSI and CP income and resource counting methods. The couple chooses the most useful method, ba sed on their circumstances. The same method must be used for both spouses. ( ) 762. SSI METHOD OF COUNTING INCO ME AND RESOURCES OF A COUPLE. The SSI method is the same method used to count income and reso urces for AABD cash. Income and resources of the participant and spouse are counted as mutually available. This method must be used for months either spouse gets SSI or AABD cash, or an SSI and/or AABD application is filed and ap proved. This method must be used for Medicaid eligibility, and liability for the cost of long-term care, whet her one (1) or both spouses apply for Medicaid. For long- term care, the couple's income and resources are mutually avail able when one (1) or both spouses apply during the month they separated, because one (1) or both left their mutual home to enter a long-term care facility. ( ) 763. COMMUNITY PROPERTY (CP) METHOD OF COUNTING INCOME AND RESOU RCES OF A COUPLE. A married participant in long-term care, whose spouse is not in the community , can use the CP method. A married participant using the FSI method, but not income eligible using FSI, may choose the CP method for income eligibility. The CP method must not be used for the FSI partici pant's resource eligibility o r patient liability. ( ) 764. CP METHOD. The CP method gives each spouse has an equal one-half (1/2) sha re of the couple's community income and resources. Each spouse also has his or her own separate income and resourc es. Whether the spouses live together or, if not living together, the length of time they have lived apart, does not ch ange the way income and resources are counted. A spouse's property includes income, personal property and real p roperty. The income and resources of a married couple acquired during the marriage are presumed to be communit y property of the couple. The couple can give evidence to rebut the presumption that property acquired during the marriage is community property. ( ) 765. TRANSFER OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE INCOME NOT V ALID. An agreement between spouses, transferring or assigning rights to future income from one (1) spouse to the other, is not valid for eligibility for Medicaid. ( ) 766. CP METHOD NEED STANDARD. The participant is budgeted as a single person if his spouse is not a Medicaid applicant, is not living with him, or was not living with him on the first day of the month. The particip ant and spouse are budgeted as a couple if they both apply, and live together, or if they were living together on th e first day of the month. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.05 Department of Health and Welfare Eligibilit y for Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled Section 767 Page 1665 767. CP METHOD RESOURCE LIMIT. The participant's resource limit is two thousand dollars ($2,00 0) if his spouse is not a Medicaid applicant, is not living with him, or was not living with him on the first day of the month. The participant and spouse have a resource limit of three thousand dollars ($3,000) if they both apply, an d live together, or if they were living together on the first day of the month. ( ) 768. CP METHOD INCOME DISREGARDS. The participant gets the twenty dollar ($20) standard disregard if his spouse is not a Medicaid applicant, is not living with him, or was not living with him on the first day of the mo nth. If the participant has earned income, he gets the sixty-five dollar plus one-half ($65 + 1/2) of the remainder ea rned income disregard. The participant and spouse get the standard disregard on their combined unearned income if the y both apply, and live together, or if they were living together on the first day of the month. If either spouse has ea rned income, they get the earned income disregard from their combined earned income. ( ) 769. -- 775. (RESERVED) 776. 1972 RSDI RECIPIENT.

Asset transfers subject to penalty und er these rules may be voided an d set aside by court action as provided in Section 56- 218, Idaho Code. The asset transfer penalty applies to a Medica id participant in long-term care or HCBS.

( ) 02. Contract for Services Provided by a Relative .

The asset transfer penalty appli es to any transfer for less tha n fair market value made during a period preceding or following a request for long-term care services. The look-back period is determined as follows: ( ) 01. Transfers Prior to February 8, 2006 . For any asset transferred prior to February 8, 2006, the look-back period is thirty-six (36) months, unless the transfer is to or from a trust. If the transfer is to or from a trust, the look-back period is sixty (60) months. If the person is ent itled to Medicaid or HCBS services, the look-back period is counted from the month long-term care or HCBS service s began, or would have begun, were it not for a penalty. If the person is not entitled to Medicaid, the look-ba ck period is counted from the month prior to the month the application was submitted. ( ) 02. Transfers On or After February 8, 2006 . Any asset transferred on or after February 8, 2006, regardless of type, is subject to a look-back period of sixty ( 60) months. The look-back period is counted from the date of the application for long-term care or HCBS services or the date of the transfer, whichever is later in time. ( ) 834. PERIOD OF RESTRICTED COVERAGE FOR ASSET TRANSFERS. The period of restricted coverage is the number of months compu ted by dividing the net uncompensated value of the transferred asset by the statewide average cost of nursing faci lity services to private patients. The cost is computed for the time of the participant's mo st recent request for Medicaid. If the spouse becomes eligible for long-term care Medicaid, the rest of the period of restricted coverage is divi ded between the participant and spouse. ( ) 835. APPLYING THE PENALTY PER IOD OF RESTRICTED COVERAGE. Restricted coverage continues until the participant or spouse r ecovers all the assets, receives fair market value at the time of the transfer for all of the assets, or the period of re stricted coverage ends. The penalty continues whether or not the participant is in long-term care. The penalty period fo r asset transfers is applied as follows: ( ) 01. Penalty Period for Transfer Prior to February 8, 2006 . For assets transferred prior to February 8, 2006, there is no penalty if the amount transferred is less than the cost of one (1) month's care. The penalty period begins running the month the transfer took place. The month the transfer took place is counted as one (1) of the penalty months. A penalty period is computed for each transfer. A penalty period must expire before the next begins. Each partial month before the end of consecutive penalty period s is a penalty month. A partial month at the end of consecutive penalty periods is dropped. ( ) 02. Penalty Period for Transfers On or After February 8, 2006 . For assets transferred on or after February 8, 2006, the penalty period begins running the first d ay of the month after the mo nth the transfer took place or was discovered to have taken place, or the date the individu al would have been eligible for long-term care services or HCBS, if not for the transfer , whichever date is later in ti me. The value of all asset transfers made during the look- back period is accumulated for the purpose of calculating the p enalty. If an additional transfer is discovered after the penalty has been served, a new pen alty period begins the month following timely notice of closure of benefits. When a penalty period ends after the first day of the month, eligibi lity for long-term care services begins the day after the penalty period ends. ( ) 836. MULTIPLE PENALTY PERIO DS APPLIED CONSECUTIVELY. A penalty period is computed for each transfer. One (1) penalty period must expire before the next begins. ( ) 837. LIFE ESTATE AS ASSET TRANSFER. 01. Transfer of a Remainder Interest . When a life estate in real property is retained by an individ ual, and a remainder interest in the property is transferred during the look-back period for less than the fair market value of the remainder interest transferred, the value of the uncompe nsated remainder is subject to the asset transfer penalty as described in Sections 831 through 835 of these rules. To com pute the value of the life estate remainder, multiply the fair market value of the real property at the time of trans fer by the remainder factor for the participant's age at the time of transfer listed in the following table:IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.05 Department of Health and Welfare Eligibilit y for Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled Section 837 Page 1676 ( ) 02. Transfer of a Life Estate . When a life estate in real pro perty is transferred by an indi vidual during the look-back period for less than fair market value, the value of the life estate is subject to the asset transfer penalty as described in Sections 831 and 835 of these rules. To compute the value of the life estate, multiply the fair market value of the real property at the time of transfer by the life estate factor for the participant's age at the time of transfer listed in the following table:TABLE 837.01 - REMAINDER TABLE Age Remainder Age Remainder Age Remainder Age Remainder 0 .02812 28 .03938 56 .20994 84 .63002 83 .61358IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.05 Department of Health and Welfare Eligibilit y for Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled Section 838 Page 1677 ( ) 838.

Low-Income Revenue Rate . The Low Income Revenue Rate is the sum of the following fract ions, expressed as a percentage, calculated as follows: ( ) a. Total Medicaid inpatient revenues paid to the hospital, plus th e amount of the cash subsidies received directly from state and local governments in a cost re porting period, divided by the total amount of revenues and cash subsidies of the hospital for inpatient services in th e same cost reporting period; plus ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 Department of Health & Welfare Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits Section 400 Page 1745 b. The total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient hospit al services attributab le to charity care in the same cost reporting perio d, divided by the total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient services in the hospital in the same period. The total inpatient charges attrib uted to charity care must not include contractual allowances and discounts and reduction in charges given to Medi care, Medicaid, other third-party payors, or cash for patient services received directly from state and local governm ents' county assistance programs. ( ) 18. Medicaid Inpatient Day . For purposes of DSH payments, an inpatient day is defined as a Medicaid inpatient day in a hospit al for which there is also no Medicare inpatient day counted. ( ) 19. Medicaid Utilization Rate (MUR) . The MUR for each hospital will be computed using the Department's record of paid inpatient days for the fiscal year divided by the total inpatient days for the same fiscal year as reported in the DSH survey. In this paragraph, the term \"inpatient days\" includes administratively necessary days, newborn days, days in specialized wards, days provided at an inappropriate level of care, and Medicaid inpatient days from other states. In this paragraph, \"Medicaid inpatient days\" includes paid days not counted in prior DSH threshold computations. ( ) 20. Obstetricians . For purposes of an adjustment for hospitals serving a disprop ortionate share of low income patients, and in the case of a hospital located in a rur al area, as defined by the federal Executive Office of Management and Budget, the term \"obstetrician\" includes any phy sician with staff privileges at the hospital to perform nonemergency obstetric procedures. ( ) 21. On-Site . A service location over which the hospital exercises financia l and administrative control. \"Financial and administrative co ntrol\" means a location whose r elation to budgeting, cost reporting, staffing, policy- making, record keeping, business licensure, goodwill and decisi on-making are so interrelated to those of the hospital that the hospital has ultimate financial and administrative con trol over the service location. The service location must be in close proximity to the hospital where it is based, and bo th facilities serve the same patient population (e.g., from the same area, or catchment, within Medicare's defined Metropol itan Statistical Area (MSA) for urban hospitals or thirty-five (35) miles from a rural hospital). ( ) 22. Operating Costs . For the purposes of hospital reimbursement, operating costs a re the allowable costs included in the cost centers established in the finalized Medicare cost report to accumulate costs applicable to providing routine and ancillary services to patients for the pu rposes of cost assignment and allocation in the step- down process. ( ) 23. Other Allowable Costs . Other allowable costs are those reasonable costs recognized u nder the Medicaid reasonable cost princi ples for services not subject to Medicaid limitations of coverage or reimbursement limits. Costs that are not reimbursed as operating costs, but r ecognized by Medicare principles as allowable costs will be included in the total reasonab le costs. Other allowable cost s include, but are not necessa rily limited to, physician's component which was combined-b illed, capital costs, ambulance c osts, excess costs, carry-forwards and medical education costs. ( ) 24. Reasonable Costs . Reasonable costs include all necessary and ordinary costs inc urred in rendering the services related to patient care that a prudent and cost-co nscious hospital would pay for a given item or service. ( ) 25. Uninsured Patient Costs . For the purposes of determining the additional costs beyond uncompensated Medicaid costs that may be reimbursed as a DSH pa yment without exceeding the state Allotment Amount, only inpatient costs of uninsured patients will be cons idered. ( ) 26. Upper Payment Limit . The Upper Payment Limit for hospital services is defined in t he Code of Federal Regulations. ( ) 27. Prior Service Period Claims Subject to Future Cost Settlemen t. For providers subject to cost settlement, claims from prior service periods that were not cap tured in a prior cost settlements will be cost settled in the current year using cost-to-charge ratios and routine cost p er diems from the Medicare cost report currently being settled.

Prior authorization requirement for an initial length of stay will be established by the Department, or its designee, in the Idaho Me dicaid Provider Handbook for hospitals not reimbursed under DRG methodologies. ( ) 02. Extended Stay . The Department, or its designee, will establish authorization requirements in the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for hospitals not reimbursed u nder DRG methodologies. An authorization is necessary when the appropriate care of the participant indicate s the need for hospital days in excess of the initial length of stay, or previously approved extended stay. ( ) 03. Exceptions and Limitations . The following exceptions and limitations apply to in-patient hospital services for hospitals not reimbursed under DRG methodologies: ( ) a. Payment for accommodations is limited to the hospital's all-inc lusive rate. The all-inclusive rate is a flat fee charge incurred on a daily basis that covers both ro om and board. ( ) b.

( ) 04. Diagnosis Related Group Review and Audits . All services performed under DRG are subject to QIO reviews, retrospective reviews, and audits. The Department reserves the right to execute reviews as described in the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook as amended. ( ) 403. INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES: PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS. 01. Prior Authorization . Some services may require a prior authorization from the Depa rtment or its designee. Documentation for the request must include the most r ecent plan of care and adequate documentation to demonstrate continued medical necessity. The Department will se t additional documentation requirements in the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook to ensure quality of care and integrity of services. ( ) 02. Certification of Need . At the time of admission, the physician must certify that inp atient services are necessary. Recertification must occur at least every sixty (60) days inpatient hospital services are required, but may be required more frequently as determined by the Department . ( ) 03.

Documentation for the request should include the most recent plan of care. The Department wil l set additional documentation requirements in the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook to ensure quality of care and integrity of services. ( ) 404. INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES: PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS AND DU TIES. In addition to the provider enrollment agreement, each claim su bmitted by a hospital constitutes an agreement by which the hospital agrees to accep t and abide by the Department 's rules. Only a Medicare certified hospital, licensed by the state in which it operates, may enroll in the Idaho Medi caid program. Hospitals not participating as a Medicaid swing-bed provider, which are licensed for long-term care or as a specialty hospital that provides a nursing home level of care, will be reimbursed as a nursing facility. Hospit als not eligible for enrollment which render emergency care will be paid rates established in these rules. ( ) 405. HOSPITAL SERVICES - PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT. Under the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act, in re imbursing hospitals, the Department will pay the lesser of customary hospital charges or Medicaid reimbursement for services establishe d in accordance with the procedures detailed under this rule. The upper limits observed by the Department in reimbursing each individual hospital must not exceed the payment that would be determined a s a reasonable cost under the policies, definitions and procedures observed under Medicare (Title XVIII) principles of cost reimbursement. ( ) 01. Payment Procedures . The following procedures are to in-patient hospita ls: ( ) a. The participant's admission and length of stay may be subject t o prior authorization, concurrent review, continued stay review, and retrospective review by a Qu ality Improvement Organization (QIO) designated by the Department. QIO review will be governed by provisions of th e QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended. If a review identifies that an admission or continued stay is not medically necessary, then no Medicaid payment will be made. Failure to obtain a timely QIO review as required by Section 402 of these rules, and as outlined in the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended, will result in the QIO conducting a late review. After a QIO review has determine d that the hospital stay was me dically necessary, Medicaid will assess a late review penalty to the hospital as outlined in this rule. ( ) i. All admissions for hospitals not reimbursed under DRG methodo logies are subject to QIO review to determine if continued stay in inpatient status is medically necessary. A QIO continued stay review is required when the participant's length of stay exceeds the number of day s certified by the QIO. If no initial length of stay certification was issued by the QIO, a QIO continued stay revie w is required when the admission exceeds a number of days as specified by the Department. ( ) ii. Reimbursement for services originally identified as not medi cally necessary by the QIO will be made if such decision is reversed by the appeals process requir ed in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings.\" ( ) iii. Absent the Medicaid participant's informed decision to incu r services deemed unnecessary by the QIO, or not authorized by the QIO due to the negligence of the provider, no payment for denied services may be obtained from the participant. ( ) b. In reimbursing licensed hospitals, the Department will pay the lesser of customary hospital charges or Medicaid reimbursement for in-patient hospital care as set f orth in this rule, unless an exception applies as stated in Section 402 of these rules. The upper limits for payment must n ot exceed the payment tha t would be determined as reasonable cost using the Title XVIII standards and principles. ( ) 02. Hospital Penalty Schedule . The following applies for hospitals not reimbursed under DRG methodologies: ( ) a. A request for a preadmission or continued stay QIO review, or f or both, that is one (1) day late will result in a penalty of two hundred and sixty dollars ($260), fr om the total Medicaid paid amount of the inpatient hospital stay. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 Department of Health & Welfare Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits Section 405 Page 1748 b.

( ) vii. The number of swing-bed days that may be reimbursed to a pr ovider in a twelve (12) month period will be limited to the greater of one thousand ninety-five (1,0 95) days which may be prorated over a shorter fiscal period or, fifteen percent (15%) of the product of the average number of available licensed beds in the hospital in the period and the number of days in the fiscal period. The Departm ent may authorize additional critical access hospital swing-bed days for participants residing in a community without a nursing facility within thirty-five (35) miles contingent on a review of medical necessity, cost-effectiveness , residency, and quality of care. ( ) d. Computation of \"Swing-Bed\" Patient Contribution. The computatio n of the patient's contribution of swing-bed payment will be in accordance with IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits,\" Section 224. Adjustment for Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) .

Cost information as developed by the provider must be current , accurate, and in sufficient detail and in such form as needed t o support payments made for services rendered to participants. This includes all ledgers, books, reports, record s and original evidences of cost (purchase requisitions, purchase orders, vouchers, requisitions for materials, inventor ies, labor time cards, payrolls, bases for apportioning costs, etc.), which pertain to the determination of reasonable costs, leaving an audit trail capable of being audited. Financial and statistical records will be maintained in a consi stent manner from one (1) settlement period to another. ( ) 10. Availability of Records of Hospital Providers . A participating hospital provider of services must make available to the Department in the state in which the faci lity is licensed, the provider's fiscal and other necessary records for the purpose of determining its ongoing record keepi ng capability and to ascertain information pertinent to the determination of the proper amount of program payments due the provider.

Notice of Program Reimbursement . Following receipt of the finalized Medicare cost report and the timely receipt of any other information requested by the De partment to fairly cost settle with the provider, a certified letter with the return receipt requested will be sent to the provider that sets forth the amounts of underpayment or overpayment made to the provider. The notice of the results of the final retroactive adjustment will be sent even though the provider intends to request a hearing o n the determination, or has appealed the Medicare Intermediary's determination of cost settlement. Where the dete rmination shows that the provider is indebted to the Medicaid program because total i nterim and other payments excee d cost limits, the state will take the necessary action to recover overpayment, including the suspension of inte rim payments sixty (60) days after the provider's receipt of the notice. Such action of recovery or suspension wi ll continue even after a request for an informal conference or hearing is filed with the state. If the hearing r esults in a revised determination, appropriate adjustments will be made to the settlement amount. ( ) a. Timing of Notice. The Department will make every effort to issu e a notice of program reimbursement within twelve (12) months of receipt of the cost report. ( ) b. Reopening of Completed Settlements. A Medicaid completed cost s ettlement may be reopened by the provider or the state within a three (3) year period from t he date of the letter of noti ce of program reimbursement. The issues must have been raised, appealed and resolved through the reopening of the cost report by the Medicare Intermediary. Issues previously addressed and resolved by the D epartment's appeal pro cess are not cause for reopening of the finalized cost settlement. ( ) 13. Non Appealable Items . The formula for the determination of the hospital inflation i ndex, the principles of reimbursement that define allowable cost, non-Med icaid program issues, interim rates that are in compliance with state and feder al rules, and the preliminary ad justments prior to final cost settlement determinations as supported by properly completed cost reports and audits are not acceptable as appealable items.

( ) a. Annual Adjustments. Interim rates will be adjusted at least ann ually based on the best information available to the Department. ( ) b. Retrospective Adjustments. Interim rates will not be adjusted r etrospectively upon request for rate review by the provider. ( ) c. Basis for Adjustments. The Department may make an adjustment ba sed on the Medicare cost report as submitted and accepted by the Intermediary after the provide r's reporting year to bring interim payments made during the period into agreement with the tentative reimbursabl e amount due the provider at final settlement. If the settlement amount is equal to or greater than ten percent (10%) of the payments received or paid and equal to or greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the inter im rate will be adjusted to account for half (\u00bd) of the difference. ( ) d. Unadjusted Rate. The Medicaid interim reimbursement rate on fil e is synonymous with the term unadjusted rate used by other payors. ( ) 15. Audits .

The Department will provide the FQHCs a supplemental information worksheet to complete. This worksheet will be used by the Department to identify dental encounters and other incidental c osts related to either med ical/mental or dental FQHC encounters. ( ) c.

The Department's decision that they cannot reasonably be expect ed to be discharged from the medical institution to return home is based upon a review of th e medical records and plan of care, but that this does not preclude them from returnin g home with services necessary t o support nursing facility or ICF/ID level of care; and ( ) b. They or their authorized representative may request a fair hear ing prior to the Department's final determination that they are perm anently institutionalized. The notice must include information that a pre-hearing conference may be scheduled prior to a fair hearing. The notice must include the time limits and instructions for requesting a fair hearing.

An u ndue hardship does not exist if action taken by the participant prior to their death, or by their legal representat ive, divested or diverted assets from the estate. The Department grants undue hardship waivers on a case by case basi s upon review of all facts and circumstances, including any action taken to diminish assets available for est ate recovery or to circumvent estate recovery.

The participant requires nursing facility level of care when an adult meets one (1) of the Resource Utilization Group (RUG III) classifications or when a child meets one (1) or more of the criteria described in Subsections 223.02, 223.03, 223.04 or 223.05 of this rule. A child is an individual from age zero (0) through eighteen (18) years; an adult is an individual more than eighteen (18) years of age. ( ) 01. Required Assessment for Adults . A standard assessment will be approved by the Department for all adults requesting services with requirements for nursing fa cility level of care. The Department will specify the instrument to be used. ( ) 02. Supervision Required for Children . Where the inherent complexity o f a service prescribed by the physician is such that it can be safely and effectively perform ed only by or under the supervision of a licensed nurse or licensed physical or occu pational therapist. ( ) 03. Preventing Deterioration for Children . Skilled care is needed to prevent, to the extent possible, deterioration of the child's condition or to sustain current ca pacities, regardless of the restoration potential of a child, even where full recovery or medical improvement is not possible . ( ) 04. Specific Needs for Children . When the plan of care, risk factors, and aggregate of health care needs is such that the assessments, interventions, or supervisi on of the child necessitates the skills of a licensed nurse or a licensed physical therapist or licensed occupational thera pist. In such cases, the specific needs or activities must be documented by the physician's orders, progress notes, plan o f care, and nursing and therapy notes. ( ) 05. Nursing Facility Level of Care for Children . Using the criteria found in Subsections 223.02, 223.03, and 223.04 of these rules, plus consideration of the de velopmental milestones, based on the age of the child, the Department's BLTC will determine nursing facility level of care. ( ) 06. Conditions of Payment . ( ) a. As a condition of payment by the Department for long-term care on behalf of medical assistance participants, each fully license d long-term care facility is to be under the supervision of an administrator who is currently licensed under the laws of the state of Idaho and in accordance with the rules of the Bureau of Occupational Licenses. ( ) b. Payment by the Department for th e cost of long-term care exclud es the date of the participant's discharge, unless the day of discharge occurs on the same day a s admission; then, one (1) day of care is deemed to exist. When a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, the date of death is covered, regardless of the time of death. ( ) 224. NURSING FACILITY: POST-ELIGIBILITY TREATMENT OF INCOME. Where an individual is determined eligible for medical assistan ce participation in the cost of their long term care, the Department will reduce its payment to the long term care facili ty by the amount of their income considered available to meet the cost of their care. This determination is made in a ccordance with IDAPA 16.03.05, \"Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (AABD),\" Sections 721 through 726 . The amount that the medical assistance participant receives from SSA as reimbursement for their paymen t of the premium for Part B of Title XVIII (Medicare) is not considered income for patient liability under IDAPA 16.03.05, \"Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 225 Page 1893 Blind, and Disabled (AABD), \" Section 317. ( ) 225. NURSING FACILITY: COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS. An institution must provide, on a regular basis, health-related care and services to individuals; who because of their mental or physical condition requ ire care and services above th e level of room, board, and supervision. ( ) 01. Nursing Facility Care . The minimum content of care and services for nursing facility p a ti e n ts must include the following: ( ) a. Room bathroom linens; ( ) care, including speci ( ) d. Personal services; ( ) e. Supervision as required by the nature of the patient's illness and duration of their stay in the nursing facility; ( ) f. Special diets as prescribed by a patient's physician; ( ) g. All common medicine chest over-the-counter in cluding mouthwashes, analgesics, laxatives, emollients, burn ointments, first aid cream, protect ive creams and liquids, cough and cold preparations, and simple eye preparations; ( ) h. or administration of all drugs; ( ) k. All medical supplies including gauzes, bandages, tapes, compres ses, cottons, sponges, hot water bags, ice bags, disposable syringes, thermometers, cellucotton, incontinent supplies, or any other type of pads used to save labor or linen, and disposable gloves; ( ) l. Social and recreational activities; and ( ) m. Each item that is utilized by individual patients and is reusab le and expected to be available, such as bed rails, canes, crutches, walkers, wheel chairs, traction equipment, and other durable medical equipment. ( ) 02. Skilled Services . Skilled services include services that could qualify as eithe r skilled nursing or skilled rehabilitative services, that include: ( ) a. Overall management and evaluation of the care plan. The develop ment, management, and evaluation of a resident's care plan, based on the physician's orders, constitute skilled services when, in terms of the patient's physical or mental condition, such development, manag ement, and evaluation necessitate the involvement of technical or professional personnel to meet their needs, promot e their recovery, and assure their medical safety. This would include the management of a plan involving only a variety of personal care services where, in light of the patient's condition, the aggregate of such services necessitate s the involvement of technical or professional personnel. Where the patient's overall condition would support a finding t hat their recovery and safety could be assured only if the total care they require is pl anned, managed, and evaluated by technical or professional personnel, it would be appropriate to infer that skille d services are being provided. ( ) b. Observation and assessment of the resident's changing condition . When the resident's condition is IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 226 Page 1894 such that the skills of a licensed nurse or other technical or professional person are required to identify and evaluate the patient's need for possible modification of treatment and t he initiation of additional medical procedures until their condition is stabilized, such services constitute skilled servi ces. ( ) 03. Direct Skilled Nursing Services . Direct skilled shift; ( ) b. ( sterile irrigation of catheters; ( ) e. Application of dressings involving prescription medications aseptic techniques; ( ) f. Treatment of extensive decubitus ulcers or other widespread ski n disorders; ( ) g. Heat treatments that have been s pecifically ordered by a physic ian as part of treatment and that require observation by nurses to adequately evaluate the reside nt's progress; and ( ) h. Initial phases of a regimen involving administration of oxygen. ( ) 04. Direct Skilled Rehabilitative Services . Direct skilled rehabilitative services include the following: ( ) a. Ongoing assessment of rehabilitation needs and potential, servi ces concurrent with the management of a resident's care plan, including tests and measu rements of range of motion, strength, balance, coordination, endurance, functional ability, activities of dail y living, perceptual deficits, speech and language or hearing disorders; ( ) b. Therapeutic exercises or activities that, because of the type o f exercises employed or the condition of the resident, must be performed by or under the supervision of a qualified physical therapist or occupational therapist to ensure the safety of the resident and the effectiv eness of the treatment; ( ) c. Gait evaluation and training furnished by a physical or occupat ional therapist to restore function in a resident whose ability to walk has been impaired by neurologi cal, muscular, or skeletal abnormality; and ( ) d. Ultrasound, short-wave, and micr owave a l icensed physical therapist. ( ) 05. Other Treatment and Modalities. Other treatment and modalities that include hot pack, hydroculator, infrared treatments, paraffin baths, and whirlpoo l, in cases where the resident's condition is complicated by circulatory deficiency, areas of desensitization, open wound s, fractures, or other complications, and the skills, knowledge, and judgement of a licensed physical therapist are r equired. ( ) 226. NURSING FACILITY: PROCEDURAL RESPONSIBILITIES. 01. Nursing Facility Responsibility . Each nursing facility administrator, or their authorized representative must report the following information to the app ropriate BLTC within three (3) working days of the date the facility has knowledge of the following. ( ) a. Any readmission or discharge of a participant, and any temporar y absence of a participant due to hospitalization or therapeutic home visit. ( ) b. Any changes in the amount of a participant's income. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 227 Page 1895 c. When a participant's account has exceeded the following amount; ( ) i. For a single individual, one thousand eight hundred dollars ( $1,800);or ( ) ii. For a married couple, two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,80 0). ( ) 02. Other Financial Information for Participant . Other information about a participant's finances that may potentially affect eligibility for medical assistance must be reported if the nursing facility has any knowledge of the participant's financial information. ( ) 227. PREADMISSION SCREENING AND RESIDENT REVIEW PROGRAM (PASRR). All Medicaid certified nursing facilities must participate in, cooperate with, and meet all requirements imposed by, the Preadmission Screening and Re sident Review program, (PASRR) as set forth in 42 CFR , Part 483, Subpart C. ( ) 01. Background and Purpose . The purpose of these provisions is to comply with and impleme nt the PASRR requirements imposed on the state by federal law. The pur pose of those requirements is to prevent the placement of individuals with mental illness (MI) or intellectu al disabilities (ID) in a nursing facility unless their medical needs clearly indicate that they require the level of c are provided by a nursing facility. This is accomplished by both pre-admission screening (PAS) and resident review (RR). Individuals, for whom it appears that a diagnosis of MI or ID is likely, are identified for further screening by mea ns of a Level I screen. The actual PASRR is accomplished through a Level II screen where it is determined w hether, because of the individual's physical and mental condition, they require the level of services provided b y a nursing facility. If the individual with MI or ID is determined to require a nursing facility level of care, it must also be determined whether the individual requires specialized services. PASRR app lies to all individuals entering or residing in a nursing facility, regardless of payment source. ( ) 02. Policy . It is the policy of the Department that the difficulty in pro viding specialized services in the nursing facility setting makes it generally inappropriate to pl ace individuals needing specialized services in an nursing facility. This policy is supported by the background an d development of the federal PASRR requirements, including the narrow definition of mental illness adopted by fe deral law. While recognizing that there are exceptions, it is envisioned that most individuals appropriate for nursing facility placement will not require services in excess of those required to be provided by nursing facilities by 42 CFR 4 83.45. ( ) 03. Inter-Agency Agreement . The state Medicaid agency will enter into a written agreement with the state mental health and intellectual disabilities authorities a s required in 42 CFR 431.621(c). This agreement will, among other things, set forth respective duties and delegation of responsibilities, and any supplemental criteria to be used in making determinations. ( ) a. The \"State Mental Health Authority\" (SMHA) in the Division of B ehavioral Health of the Department, or its successor entity. ( ) b. The \"State Intellectual Disabilities or Developmental Disabilit ies Authority\" (SDDA) in the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. ( ) 04. Coordination for PASRR . The PASRR process is a coordinated effort between the state M edicaid agency, the SMHA and SDDA, independent evaluators and the nursi ng facility. PASRR activities will be coordinated through the Bureau of Long Term Care (BLTC). BLTC is responsibl e for record retention and tracking functions. However, the nursing facility is responsible for assuring that all screens are obtained and for coordination with the BLTC, independent MI evaluators, the SMHA and SDDA, and their d esignees. ( ) a. All required Level I screens and reviews must be completed and submitted to the BLTC prior to admission to the facility. ( ) b. When a nursing facility identifies an individual with MI or ID through a Level I screen, or otherwise, the nursing facility is responsible for contacting t he SMHA or SDDA (as appropriate), and assuring that a IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 228 Page 1896 Level II screen is completed prior to admission to the facility , or in the case of an existing resident, completed in order to continue residing in the facility. ( ) c. Resident Reviews (RR). An individual identified with MI or ID m ust be reviewed and a new determination made promptly after a significant change in their physical or mental condition. The facility must notify the BLTC of any such change within two (2) working days of its o c c u r r e n c e . F o r t h e p u r p o s e o f t h i s s e c t i o n , significant change for the participant's mental condition means a change that may require the provision of specialized services or an increase in such services. A significant change in physical condition is a change that renders the participant incapable of responding to MI or D.D. program inter ventions. ( ) 228. NURSING FACILITY: COORDINATION OF NURSING FACILITY ELIGIBIL ITY AND THE NEED FOR SPECIALIZED SERVICES. Determinations as to the need for nursing facility care and det erminations as to the need for specialized services should not be made independently. Such determinations will ofte n be made on an individual basis, taking into account the condition of the resident and the capability of the facilit y to which admission is proposed to furnish the care needed. When an individual identified with MI and ID is admitte d to a nursing facility, the nursing facility is responsible for meeting that ind ividual's needs, except for the provision of specialized services. ( ) 01. Level of Care . ( ) a. Individual determinations must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. ( ) b. Categorical determinations. Recognizing that individual determi nations of level of care are not always necessary, those categories set forth as examples at 42 CFR 483.130(d) are hereby adopted as appropriate for categorical determinations. When nursing facility level of care is determined appropriate categorically, the individual may be conditionally admitted prior to completion of the determ ination for specialized services. However, conditional admissions cannot exceed seven (7) days, except for respite admissions which cannot exceed thirty (30) consecutive days in one (1) calendar year. ( ) 02. Specialized Services . Specialized services for mental illness as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(1), and for intellectual disabilities as defined in 42 CFR 483.120( a)(2), are those services provided by the state that due to the intensity and scope can only be delivered by personnel and programs that are not included in the specialized rehabilitation services required of nursing facilities under 42 CFR 483.45. The need for specialized services must be documented and included in both the resident assessment instrum ent and the plan of care. ( ) a. Individual determinations must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. ( ) b. Categorical determinations that specialized services are not ne eded may be made in those situations permitted by 42 CFR 483.130. ( ) 03. Penalty for Non-Compliance . No payment will be made for any services rendered by a nursin g facility prior to completion of the Level I screen and, if requ ired, the Level II screen. Failure to comply with PASRR requirements for all individuals admitted or seeking admission may also subject a nursing facility to other penalties as part of certification action under 42 CFR 483.20. ( ) 04. Appeals . Discharges, transfers, and preadmission PASRR determinations may be appealed to the extent required by 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart E, and under Secti on 67-5229, Idaho Code. Appeals under this paragraph are made in accordance with the fair hearing provisio ns in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings.\" ( ) a. A Level I finding of MI or ID i s not an appealable determinatio n. It may be disputed as part of a Level II determination appeal. ( ) b. In the event that the PASRR program is eliminated or made non-m andatory by an act of Congress, the provisions of Section 227 of these rules will cease to be o perative on the effective date of any such act, without IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 229 Page 1897 further action. ( ) 229. NURSING FACILITY: PREPAYMENT SCREEN AND DETERMINATION OF EN TITLEMENT TO MEDICAID PAYMENT FOR NURSIN G FACILITY CARE AND SERVICES. The level of care for Title XIX and Title XXI payment purposes is determined by the Department. Necessity for payment is determined in accordance with 42 CFR 483 Subpart C a nd Section 1919(e) (7) of the Social Security Act. In the event a required Level II screen was not accomplished pr ior to admission, entitlement for Medicaid payment as established by the BLTC will not be earlier than the date the L evel II screen is completed, indicating that nursing facility placement is appropriate. ( ) 01. Information Required for Medical Evaluation Determination . A current Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be provided to the Department. Additional supporting information may be requested. ( ) 02. Information Required for Level I and II Screen Determination . An accurate Level I screen and when required, a Level II screen. ( ) 230. NURSING FACILITY: PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS AND DUTIES. 01. Provider Applicatio n and Certification . A facility must apply to participate as a nursing facility. ( ) 02. Licensure and Certification . ( ) a. Upon receipt of an application from a facility, the Licensing a nd Certification Agency determines the facility's compliance with certification standards for the type of care the facility proposes to provide to medical assistance participants. ( ) b. If a facility proposes to participate as a skilled nursing faci lity, Medicare (Title XVIII) certification and program participation is required before the facility can b e certified for Medicaid. The Licensing and Certification Agency will determine the facility's compliance w ith Medicare requirements and recommend certification to the Medicare Agency. ( ) c. If the Licensing and Certificatio n Agency determines that a fac ility meets Title XIX certification standards for nursing facility care. The Department will certif y to the appropriate branch of government that the facility meets the standards for nursing facility level of care . ( ) d. Upon receipt of the certification from the Licensing and Certif ication Agency, the Department may enter into a provider agreement with the long-term care facilit y. ( ) e. After the provider agreement has been executed by the Facility Administrator and by the Department, one (1) copy will be sent by certified mail to the facility and the original is to be retained by the Department. ( ) 231. -- 234. (RESERVED) 235. NURSING FACILITY: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT. 01. Payment Methodology . Nursing facilities will be re imbursed in accordance with the payment methodologies as described in Sections 236 through 295 of these rules. ( ) 02. Date of Discharge . Payment by the Department for the cost of long term care is t o exclude the date of the participant's discharge. If a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, their date of death is covered regardless of the time of occurrence. If an adm ission and a discharge occur o n the same date, then one (1) day of care will be deemed to exist. ( ) 236. NURSING FACILITY: REASONABLE COST PRINCIPLES.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 237 Page 1898 To be allowable, costs must be reasonable, ordinary, necessary and related to patient care. It will be expected that providers will incur costs in such a manner that economical and efficient delivery of quality health care to participants will result. ( ) 01. Application of Reasonable Cost Principles . ( ) a. Reasonable costs of any services are determined in accordance w ith this chapter of rules found in Sections 236 through 295 of these rules, and Provider Reimburse ment Manual (PRM), Sections 100 through 2600, as modified by the exceptions contain ed herein, is used to identif y cost items to be included on Idaho's Uniform Cost Report. ( ) i. Reasonable cost takes into account both direct and indirect c osts of providers of services, including normal standby costs. ( ) ii. The objectives of these methods are that: first, the costs w ith respect to individuals covered by the program will not be borne by others not so covered. Second, the costs with respect to individuals not covered will not be paid by the program. ( ) b. Costs may vary from one institu tion to another because of a var iety of factors. It is the intent of the program that providers will be reimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high quality care, unless such costs exceed the applicable maximum base rate developed pursuant to p rovisions of Title 56, Idaho Code, or are unallowable by application of promulgated regulation. ( ) c. Implicit in the intention that actual operating costs be paid t o the extent they are reasonable is the expectation that the provider seeks to minimize its costs and t hat its actual operating costs do not exceed what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer pays for a given item or servi ce. ( ) d. If costs are determined to exceed the level that such buyers in cur, in the absence of clear evidence that the higher costs were unavo idable, the excess costs are no t reimbursable. ( ) 02. Costs Related to Patient Care . These include all necessary and proper costs in developing an d maintaining the operation of patient care facilities. Necessary and proper costs related to patient care are usually costs that are common and accepted occurrences in the field of the pr ovider's activity. They include costs such as depreciation, interest expense, nursing costs, maintenance cost s, administrative costs, costs of employee pension plans, normal standby costs, and others. ( ) 03. Costs Not Related to Patient Care . Costs not related to patient care are costs that are not appropriate or necessary and proper in developing and maintaini ng the operation of patient care facilities and activities. Such costs are not allowable in computing reimbursa ble costs. ( ) 04. Form and Substance . Substance of transactions will prevail over the form. Financi al transactions will be disallowed to the extent that the substance of the tran saction fails to meet reasonable cost principles or comply with rules and policy. ( ) 237. NURSING FACILITY: NOTICE OF PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT. Following receipt of the finalized Medicare Cost Report and the timely receipt of any other information requested by the Department to fairly cost settle with the provider, a certi fied letter with the return receipt requested will be sent to the provider that sets forth the amounts of underpayment or ove rpayment made to the provider. ( ) 01. Notice . The notice of the results of the final retroactive adjustment will be sent even though the provider intends to request a hearing on the determination, or has appealed the Medicare Intermediary's determination of cost settlement. Where the determination shows that the prov ider is indebted to the Medicaid program because total interim and other payments exceed cost limits, the state will take the necessary action to recover overpayment, including the suspension of interim payments sixty (60) days af ter the provider's receipt of the notice. ( ) 02. Recovery or Suspension . Such action of recovery or suspension will continue even afte r a request for an informal conference or hearing is filed with the state. If the hearing results in a revised determination, IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 238 Page 1899 appropriate adjustments will be made to the settlement amount. ( ) 03. Timing of Notice . T h e D e p a r t m e n t w i l l m a k e e v e r y e f f o r t t o i s s u e a n o t i c e o f p r ogram reimbursement within twelve (12) months of receipt of the Cost Report from the Medicare Intermediary. ( ) 04. Reopening of Completed Settlements . A Medicaid completed cost settlement may be reopened by the provider or the state within a three-year (3) period fro m the date of the letter of notice of program reimbursement. The issues must have been raised, appealed and r esolved through the reopening of the Cost Report by the Medicare Intermediary. Issues previously addressed and reso lved by the Department's appeal process are not cause for reopening of the finalized cost settlement. ( ) 238. NURSING FACILITY: INTEREST C HARGES ON OVERPAYMENTS AND UNDE RPAYMENTS. The Title XIX and Title XXI programs will charge interest on ov erpayments, and pay interest on underpayments. ( ) 01. Interest After Sixty Days of Notice . If full repayment from the indebted party is not received within sixty (60) days after the provider has received notice o f program reimbursement, interest will accrue from the date of receipt of the notice of program reimbursement, and wil l be charged on the unpaid settlement balance for each thirty- day (30) period that payment is delayed. Periods of les s than thirty (30) days will be treated as a full thirty-day (30) period, and the thirty-day (30) interest charge will be ap plied to any unpaid balance. Each payment will be applied first to accrued interest, then to the principal. Inter est accrued on overpayments and interest on funds borrowed by a provider to repay overpayments are not an allowab le interest expense. ( ) 02. Waiver of Interest Charges . When the Department determines an overpayment exists, it may waive interest charges if it determines that the administrative costs of collecting them exceed the charges. ( ) 03. Rate of Interest . The interest rate on overpayments and underpayments will be t he statutory rate as set forth in Section 28-22-104(1), Idaho Code, compounded month ly. ( ) 04. Retroactive Adjustment . The balance and interest will be retroactively adjusted to eq ual the amounts that would have been due based on any changes that occu r as a result of the final determination in the administrative appeal and judicial appeal process. Interest pen alties will only be applied to unpaid amounts and will be subordinated to final interest determinations made in the ju dicial review process. ( ) 239. NURSING FACILITY: RECOVERY METHODS FOR OVERPAYMENTS. One (1) of the following methods will be used for recovery of o verpayments: ( ) 01. Lump Sum Voluntary Repayment . Upon receipt of the notice of program reimbursement, the provider voluntarily refunds, in a lump sum, the entire overpay ment to the Department. ( ) 02. Periodic Voluntary Repayment . The provider must request in writing that recovery of the overpayment be made over a period of twelve (12) months or less . The provider must adequately document the request by demonstrating that the financial integrity of the pr ovider would be irreparably compromised if repayments occurred over a shorter period of time than requested. ( ) 03. Department Initiated Recovery . The Department will recover the entire unpaid balance of the overpayment of any settlement amount in which the provider does not respond to the notice of program reimbursement within thirty (30) days of receiving the notice. ( ) 04. Recovery From Medicare Payments . The Department can request that Medicare payments be withheld in accordance with 42 CFR, Section 405.377. ( ) 240. - 241. (RESERVED)242. NURSING FACILITY: HOME OFFICE COST PRINCIPLES. The reasonable cost principles will extend to the home office c osts allocated to individual providers. In addition, the home office, through the provider, will provide documentation a s to the basis used to allocate its costs among the IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 243 Page 1900 various entities it administers or otherwise directs. ( ) 243. NURSING FACILITY: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS. 01. Principle . Costs applicable to services, facilities and supplies furnish ed to the provider by organizations or persons related to the provider by common owne rship, control, etc., are allowable at the cost to the related party. Such costs are allowable to the extent that they relate to patient care, are reasonable, ordinary, and necessary, and are not in excess of those costs incurred by a p rudent cost-conscious buyer. ( ) 02. Cost Allowability - Regulation . Allowability of costs is subject to the regulations prescribi ng the treatment of specific items as outlined in 42 CFR 413.17, et al , and the Providers Reimbursement Manual, PRM Chapter 10 and other applicable chapters of the PRM. ( ) 244. NURSING FACILITY: APPLICATION OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS . 01. Determination of Co mmon Ownership or Control in the Provider Organization and Supply Organization . In determining whether a provider organization is related to a supplying organization, the tests of common ownership and control are to be applied separately. If t he elements of common ownership or control are not present in both organizations, the organizations are deemed not to be related to each other. ( ) a. A determination as to whether an individual(s) possesses owners hip or equity in the provider organization and the supplying organization, so that the organi zations will be considered to be related by common ownership, will be made on the basis of the facts and circumsta nces in each case. ( ) b. The term \"control\" includes any kind of control whether or not it is legally enforceable and however it is exercisable or exercised. It is the reality of th e control that is decisive, not its form or the mode of its exercise. ( ) 02. Cost to Related Organizations . The charges to the provider from related organizations may no t exceed the billing to the related organization for these servic es. ( ) 03. Costs Not Related to Patient Care . All home office costs not related to patient care are not allowable under the program. ( ) 04. Interest Expense . Generally, interest expense on loans between related entities will not be reimbursable. See the PRM, Chapters 2, 10, and 12 for specifics . ( ) 245. NURSING FACILITY: COMPEN SATION OF RELATED PERSONS. Compensation paid to persons rel ated to owners or administrator s is allowable only to the extent that services are actually performed and are necessary and adequately documented and the compensation for the services is reasonable. ( ) 01. Compensation Claimed . Compensation claimed for reimbursement must be included in compensation reported for tax purposes and be actually paid. ( ) a. Where such persons perform services without pay, no cost may be imputed. ( ) b. Time records documenting actual hours worked are required in or der that the compensation be allowable for reimbursement. ( ) c. Compensation for undocumented hours worked will not be a reimbu rsable cost. ( ) 02. Related Persons . A related person is defined as having one (1) of the followin g relationships with the provider: ( ) a. Husband or wife; ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 246 Page 1901 b. Son or daughter or a descendant of either; ( ) c. Brother, sister, stepbrother, ( ) d. Father, mother, stepfather, stepmother, an ancestor thereof, or a brother or sister thereof; ( ) e. sister-in-law; ( ) f. A descendant of a brother or sister of the provider's father or mother; ( ) g. Any other person with whom the provider does not have an arms l ength relationship. ( ) 246. NURSING FACILITY: INTEREST EXPENSE. Generally interest on loans between related entities is not an allowable expense. The loan will usually be considered invested capital. See PRM, Chapter 2 for specifics. ( ) 247. -- 249. (RESERVED) 250. NURSING FACILITY: COST LIMITS. Sections 250 through 267 of these rules and the Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement Additional Terms - Nursing Facility, provide procedures and specifications necessary to im plement the provisions and accomplish the objectives of the nursing home reimbursement system as specified in Sectio ns 56-101 through 56-135, Idaho Code. All audits related to fiscal years ending on or before December 31, 1999, are subject to rules in effect before July 1, 1999. ( ) 251. - 254. (RESERVED) 255. NURSING FACILITY: RATE SETTING. The objectives of the rate setting mechanism for nursing facili ties are: ( ) 01. Payments . To make payments to nursing facilities through a prospective price-based system, which includes facility-specific case mix adjustments, separate margin payments for indirect care costs and direct care costs, and applied BAF. ( ) 02. Rate Adjustment . To set rates based on each facility's case mix index on a qua rterly basis and establishing rates that reflect the case mix of that facility's Medicaid residents as of a certain date during the preceding quarter. ( ) 256. NURSING FACILITY: PRINCIPLE FOR RATE SETTING. Reimbursement rates will be set based on projected cost data fr om cost reports and audit reports. Reimbursement is to be set for freestanding and hospital-based facilities. In gener al, the methodology will be a cost-based prospective reimbursement system with an acuity adjustment for direct care costs, allowances for margi n payments related to the indirect and direct care costs, and subject to the application of a BAF. ( ) 257. NURSING FACILITY: DEVELOPMENT OF THE RATE. Nursing facility rates are prospective, with new rates effectiv e July 1st of each year, and are recalculated annually with quarterly adjustments for case mix. In no case will the ra te be set higher than the charge for like services to private pay patients in effect for the period for which payment i s m a d e a s c o m p u t e d b y t h e l o w e r o f c o s t s o r customary charges. For the rate year of July 1, 2021, through J une 30, 2022, rates will be calculated using audited cost reports ended in the calendar year 2019, including an infl ation factor applied from the mid-point of the cost reporting period to the mid-point of the rate period. Inflation will be applied to all rate components, with the exception of property costs. For the rate years beginning July 1, 2022, and annually thereafter, rates will be calculated using audited cost reports for t he periods ending in the calend ar year two (2) years prior to each July 1 (July 1, 2022, rates will use cost reports ended in calendar year 2020 and so forth), including inflation adjustments from the mid- point of the cost report period to the mid-point of the rate pe riod, with the exception of property costs. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 259 Page 1902 258. (RESERVED) 259. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF NEW BEDS. Facilities that add beds after July 1, 1999, will have their re imbursement rate subjected to an additional limitation for the next three (3) years. This limitation will apply beginning with the first rate setting period that utilizes a cost report that includes the date when the beds were added. This provision will be the same for either behavioral care unit facilities or non-behavioral care units. ( ) 260. - 261. (RESERVED)262. NURSING FACILITY: OUT-OF-STATE NURSING HOMES. The Idaho Medicaid Program will r eimburse for out-of-state nurs ing home placements when services are not available in Idaho to meet the participant's medical need, or i n a temporary situation for a limited period of time required to safely transport the participant to an Idaho facili ty. Reimbursement for out-of-state nursing homes will be at the per diem rate set by the Medicaid Program in the state w here the nursing home is located. Special rates will be allowed according to Section 270 of these rules. ( ) 263. NURSING FACILITY: DISTRESSED FACILITY. 01. Determination . If the Department determines that a facility is located in an under-served area, or addresses an under-served need, the Department may negotiate a reimbursement rate different than the rate then in effect for that facility. ( ) 02. Discretionary Factors . The fact that a facility may b e located in an under-served ar ea or meets an under-served need does not guarantee increased reimbursement. I n exercising its discretion to apply a higher rate, the Department will consider the factors as described in Subsection s 263.02.a. through 263.02.e. of this rule. ( ) a. Prudent Spending Patterns. The facility has exercised prudent s pending and cost allocation practices, as evidenced by a thorough and comprehensive review of the facility's accounts by the Department. ( ) b. Reasonable Attempts to Remedy Problems. The facility must persu ade the Department that it has conscientiously and diligently attempted to cover its costs of care, hire qualified staff and otherwise operate effectively and efficiently, but for causes beyond the facility 's reasonable control, it has not been able to do so. ( ) c. Facility Already Receives Special Rates. When a facility alread y receives special rates for certain difficulty-of-care patients from the Department, the same costs of care that were used to determine special rates will not be applied toward a determination of distressed facility st atus, because the special rate meets that need. ( ) d. Direct and Indirect Costs of Care Apportioned to Patient Care. The Department reimburses the costs of patient care, and does not pay for indirect costs not associated with patient care. The determination of distressed status will focus on whether the facility's distress stems from patient care costs, or whether the distress arises from expenses unrelated to patient care costs. ( ) e. Existing Cost Limits.Under no circumstances may a facility's re imbursement exceed the lower of its actual costs or customary charge to private-pay patients, a s required by federal law, subject to the exceptions in federal law. The Department's cost caps can be exceeded through the distressed facility process, but to an amount no greater than the federal upper payment limit. ( ) 03. Annual Review . Distressed facility payments are assumed to be short-term in nature. Each distressed payment must be re-requested and re-justified for ea ch subsequent fiscal year that the facility desires the distressed facility rate. ( ) 04. Prospective Application . Distressed facility status will be applied only to facilities t h a t a r e currently distressed or entering a period of distress. Distress ed facility status will not be applied to retroactive rate years. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 264 Page 1903 05. Facility-by-Facility Basis . Each facility must independently establish distress on its ow n merits, whether or not other facilities with a common owner may also be experiencing distress. ( ) 264. NURSING FACILITY: INTERIM ADJUSTMENTS TO RATES AS A RESULT OF NEW MANDATES.Certain costs may be excluded from the cost limit calculations, may be subject to retrospective settlement at the discretion of the Department, and may result in changes to the prospective rates as provided in this Section to assure equitable reimbursement: ( ) 01. Changes of More Than Fifty Cents Per Patient Day in Costs . Changes of more than fifty cents ($.50) per patient day in costs otherwise subject to the cost l imitations incurred by a facility as a result of changes in state or federal laws or rules will be reported separately on t he cost report until such time as they can be properly reflected in the cost limits. ( ) a. The provider will report these costs on a separate schedule or by notations on the cost report so that these costs can be identified an d reconciled to the provider's general ledger. These costs will be reported separately and will not be reimbursed through the rate setting process unt il the costs are fully represent ed in the cost data used to establish the cost limitations and rates. ( ) b. If more than one (1) increase occurs as a result of one (1) or more law or rule changes, the costs from each event are to be reported separately. ( ) c. The computation of the cost increase amount or amounts is to be presented in detail on a supplementary schedule or schedules unless the Department state s otherwise. ( ) 02. Future Treatment of Costs . After the initial deadline has passed for all providers to fi le cost reports for reporting periods beginning on or after the date ce rtain cost increases were first required, the Department will, at it's option, include all of the previously excluded co sts related to those increases in the calculation of costs subject to the cost center limits. The intent of this provision is for costs to be exempt from the cost limits until these costs are able to be fully and equitably incorporated into the data base used to project the cost limits. When cost increases that have been excluded from the cap are incorporated in the inflation indices used to set the cost limits, the cost indices will be adjusted to exclude the influence of such changes if the amount included in the index is identified. When the cost limits are set to include previously excluded amo unts, any adjustments made to the indices related to the previously excluded costs will be removed. ( ) 265. NURSING FACILITY: MDS REVIEWS. The following Minimum Set ( MDS) reviews will be conducted: ( ) 01. Facility Review . Subsequent to the picture date, each facility will be sent a copy of its resident roster (a listing of residents, their RUG classification, case mix index, and identification as Medicaid or other). It will be the facility's responsibility at that time to review the ros ter for accuracy. If the roster is accurate, the facility will sign and return the roster for rate setting. If any errors are detected, those errors will be communicated to the Department in writing along with any supporting documentation. If the signed resident roster is not returned and no errors are communicated to the Department, the original residen t roster will be used for rate setting. Once the resident roster has been used for rate setting, it will be considered fi nal unless modified by subsequent Departmental review. ( ) 02. Departmental Review . If a departmental review of the MDS data reveals errors that result in an incorrect case mix index, the provider's rate will be retroacti vely adjusted, for all quarters containing the incorrect assessment, and an amount due to or from the Department will be calculated. This does not include residents who received the default classification due to incomplete or incons istent MDS data. (BCU) AND RATE STRUC TURE. Effective October 1, 2012, the additional direct care costs ass ociated with BCU residents will remain in direct care costs subject to the direct care cost limitation. Those qualify ing BCU nursing facility providers may have a direct care cost limitation higher than non-BCU nursing facility providers. BCU nursing facility providers will not receive an IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 267 Page 1904 increased indirect care cost limitation. ( ) 267. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF NEWLY LICENSED FACILITIES WI TH BEHA VIORAL CARE UNITS. Facilities licensed on or after September 1, 2017, must meet th e qualifications for a BCU described in Idaho Medicaid Provider Agreement Additional Te rms - Behavioral Care Units. BC U facilities existing prior to this date that receive a new license due to a change in ownership will not be subject to the provisions of this rule. ( ) 268. NURSING FACILITY: EXISTING PROVIDER ELECTS TO ADD BEHA VIORA L CARE UNIT (BCU). An existing nursing facility provider that elects to add a BCU on or after September 1, 201 7, may be d eemed eligible after meeting the following requirements: ( ) 01. Meet Criteria for BCU . The nursing facility provider must meet the criteria for a BC U described in Section 266 of these rules. ( ) 02. BCU Eligible Days . The provider must demonstrate that BCU days from a minimum of sixty (60) calendar days, regardless of payer source, divided by total cen sus days for that same sixty (60) day period, equals or exceeds a minimum of thirt y percent (30%). ( ) 269. NURSING FACILITY: NEW OWNER OF AN EXISTING NURSING FACILITY W I T H A BEHA VIORAL CARE UNIT (BCU). 01. New Owner Elects to Continue BCU . An existing nursing facility that is considered a BCU will continue to be a BCU, if the new owner elects to continue to pr ovide these services. The new owner will receive a rate calculated according to the current change of ownership ru les in Section 261 of these rules. The prior owner's cost report will be used until the new owner has a qualifying c ost report. They BCU will continue to qualify for the higher direct care cost limit the previous owner was allowed. ( ) 02. New Owner Does Not Elect to Continue BCU . If the new owner does not elect to operate the BCU, the prior owner's cost report will be used. The direct car e cost limit will be adjusted down to that of the non- BCU nursing facility. ( ) 270. NURSING FACILITY: SPECIAL RATES. A special rate consists of a facility's daily reimbursement rat e for a patient plus an add-on amount. Section 56-117, Idaho Code, provides authority f or the Department to pay facili ties an amount in addition to the daily rate when a patient has needs that are beyond the scope of facility service s and when the cost of providing for those additional needs is not adequately reflected in the rates calculated. This special rate add-on amount for such specialized care is in addition to any payments made in accordance with other provi sions of this chapter and is excluded from the computation of payments or rates under other provisions in thes e rules. ( ) 01. Determination . The Department determines to a pprove a special rate on a pati ent-by-patient basis. No rate will be allowed if reimbursement for these needs is ava ilable from a non-Medicaid source. A special rate request will be based on an identified condition that will cont inue for a period greater than thirty (30) days. ( ) 02. Effective Date . Upon approval, a special rate is effective on the date the ap plication was received. ( ) 03. Reporting . Costs equivalent to payments for special rate add-on amounts must be removed from the cost components subject to limits, and be reported separate ly by the provider. ( ) 04. Limitation . A special rate cannot exceed the provider's charges to other patients for similar services. ( ) 05. Prospective Rate Treatment . Prospective treatment of speci al rates became effective July 1, 2000. Subsections 270.06 and 270.07 of this rule provide clarificatio n of how special rates are paid under the prospective payment system. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 272 Page 1905 06. Determination of Payment for Qualifying Residents . Special rate add-on a mounts are calculated using one (1) of the methods described in Subsections 270.06.a. through 270.06.c. of this rule. ( ) a. One Hundred Percent (100%) Special Care Facility Existing July 1, 2000. If on July 1, 2000, an entire facility was a special care unit that included Medicaid residents, the facility's direct care cost per diem will not be subject to the direct care cost limit. However, the direct c are costs are case mix adjust ed based on the ratio of the facility's Medicaid CMI for the rate period to the facility-wid e CMI for the cost reporting period. ( ) b. Equipment and Non-Therapy Supplies. Equipment and non-therapy s upplies not addressed in Section 225 of these rules as determined by the Department, are reimbursed in accordance with IDAPA 16.03.09, \"Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits,\" Section 755, as an add-on amoun t. ( ) c. Ventilator Dependent Residents and Residents Receiving Tracheos tomy Care. Nursing facilities providing care to residents who are ventilator-dependent or who receive tracheostomy care are eligible to submit requests for the fixed add-on amount, in addition to the facili ty's rate for residents receiving this type of care. Approved requests are effective the date the type of care is ne eded by the participant, or no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the date the request is received by the Departmen t. The rate includes the cost for equipment and supplies and for additional registered nurse and certified nursing assis tant hours, as appropriate for each type of care. Costs for equipment and supplies will be adjusted annually for inflation, and registered nursing and certified nursing assistant costs will be adjusted according to the annual Weighted Average Hourly Rates (WAHR) survey results. ( ) i. Approved add-on rates for ventilator-dependent residents and residents receiving tracheostomy care are subject to annual reviews by the Department to ensure that the add-on rate remains necessary for the type of care needed by the resident. ( ) ii. The provider must inform the department if an approved add-o n rate is no longer needed or if the resident requires a change from one type of care to another. ( ) d. Ventilator Dependent Residents a nd Residents Receiving Tracheos tomy Care in Out-of-State Nursing Facilities. For residents who are ventilator-dependent or receive tracheostomy care in an out-of-state facility, the add-on amount to the facility's rate is effective the date this type of care is needed by the participant or no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the date the request is received by the Department. The add-on rate will include: ( ) i. Calculation of a staffing add-on for the cost, if any, for ad ditional direct care staff required in meeting the exceptional needs of these residents. The hourly ad d - o n r a t e i s e q u a l t o t h e c u r r e n t W AH R C N A o r current WAHR RN wage rate plus a benefits allowance based on an nual cost report data, then weighted to remove the CNA minimum daily staffing time adjusted for the appropriate sk ill level of care staff; and ( ) ii. Calculation of an add-on for equipment and non-therapy suppl ies following the provisions in Subsection 270.06.b. of this rule. ( ) 07. Treatment of the Special Rate Cost for Future Rate Setting P eriods . Special rates are established on a prospective basis similar to the overall facil ity rate. When the cost report used to set a prospective rate contains special rate costs, an adjustment is made to \"off set,\" or reduce costs by an amount equal to total incremental revenues, or add-on payments received by the provid er during the cost reporting period. The amount received is calculated by multiplying the special rate add-on a mount paid for each qualifying resident by the number of days that were paid. No related adjustment is made to the fa cility's CMIs. ( ) 08. Special Rate for Providers that Change Ownership or Close . When a facility changes ownership or closes, a closing cost report is not required. Spe cial rate payments made in the closing cost reporting period may be reviewed by the Department. ( ) 271. (RESERVED) 272. NURSING FACILITY: LEGAL CONSULTANT FEES AND LITIGATION COST S.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 273 Page 1906 Costs of legal consultant fees and litigation costs incurred by the provider will be handled in accordance with the following: ( ) 01. In General . Legal consultant fees unrelated to the preparation for or the taking of an appeal of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, or lit igation costs incurred by the provider in an action unrelated to litigation with the Department of Health and Welfa re, will be allowed as a part of the total per diem costs of which the Medicaid Program w ill reimburse a portion accordin g to the percentage of Medicaid patient days. ( ) 02. Administrative Appeals . In the case of the provider contesting in administrative appe al the findings of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, the costs of the provider's legal counsel will be reimbursed by the Medicaid Program only to the extent that t he provider prevails on the issues involved. The determination of the extent that the provider prevails will be based on the ratio of the total dollars at issue for the audit period at issue in the hearing to the total dollars ultimately awarded to the provider for that audit period by the hearing officer or subsequent adjudicator. ( ) 03. Other . All other litigation costs incurred by the provider in action s against the Department of Health and Welfare will not be reimbursable either directly or indirectly by the Medicaid Program except where specifically ordered by a court of law. ( ) 273. NURSING FACILITY: PATIENT FUNDS. The safekeeping of patient funds, under the program, is the res ponsibility of the provider. Accordingly, the administration of these funds requires scrupulous care in recor ding all transactions for the patient. ( ) 01. Use . Generally, funds are provided for personal needs of the patie nt to be used at the patient's discretion. The provider agrees to manage these funds and rende r an accounting but may not use them in any way. ( ) 02. Provider Liability . The provider is subject to legal and financial liabilities fo r committing any of the following acts. This is only a partial listing of the acts contrary to federal regulations: ( ) a. Management fees may not be charged for managing patient trust f unds. These charges constitute double payment as management is normally performed by an employ ee of the provider and their salary is included in reasonable cost reimbursement. ( ) b. Nothing is to be deducted from these funds, unless such deducti ons are authorized by the patient or their agent in writing. ( ) c. Interest accruing to patient funds on deposit is the property o f the patients and is part of the personal funds of each patient. The interest from these funds i s not available to the provider for any use, including patient benefits. ( ) 03. Fund Management . Proper management of such funds would include the following a s minimum: ( ) a. Savings accounts, maintained separately from facility funds. ( ) b. An accurate system of supporting receipts and disbursements to patients. ( ) c. Written authorization for all deductions. ( ) d. Signature verification. ( ) e. Deposit of all receipts of the same day as received. ( ) f. Minimal funds kept in the facility. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 274 Page 1907 g. As a minimum these funds must be kept locked at all times. ( ) h. Statement of policy regarding patient's funds and property. ( ) i. Periodic review of these policies with employees at training se ssions and with all new employees upon employment. ( ) j. System of periodic review and correction of policies and financ ial records of patient property and funds. ( ) 274. NURSING FACILITY: IDAHO OWNE R-ADMINISTRATIVE COMPENSATION. Allowable compensation to owners and persons related to owners who provide any administrative services will be limited based on the schedule in this section. ( ) 01. Allowable Owner Administrative Compensation . The following schedule will be used in determining the maximum amount o f owner administrative compensa tion allowable for the calendar year ending December 31, 2002. ( ) 02. The Administrative Compensation Schedule . The administrative compensation schedule in this Section will be adjusted annually based upon the change in aver age hourly earnings in nursing and personal care facilities as published by IHS Markit, its successor organizati on or, if unavailable, another nationally recognized forecasting firm. ( ) 03. The Maximum Allowable Compensation . The maximum allowable compensation for an owner providing administrative services is determined from the schedu le in Subsection 274.01 of these rules . Allowable compensation will be determined as follows: ( ) a. In determining the number of beds applicable on the schedule, a ll licensed beds for which the individual provides administrative services will be counted, re gardless of whether they are in the same facility. ( ) b. For an owner providing services to more than fifty (50) beds, t he amounts shown on the schedule for the applicable number of beds will determine the upper limi t for allowable compensation. ( ) c. For owners providing services to less than fifty-one (51) beds, such services related to administrative duties will be reimbursed at the hourly rate all owable if the owner was providing services to fifty-one (51) beds. Additionally, services other than administrative ser vices may be performed by the owner and will be allowable at the reasonable market rate for such services. To b e allowable, hours for each type of service will be documented. In no event will the total compensation for adminis trative and non-administrative duties paid to an owner or related party to an owner of a facility or facilities with fifty (50) licensed beds or less exceed the limit that would be applicable to an owner with the same number of points providing administrative services to facilities with fifty-one (51) beds as set forth in the schedule of Subsection 274.01 of these rules. ( ) 04. Compensation for Persons Related to an Owner . Compensation for persons related to an owner will be evaluated in the same manner as for an owner. ( )Licensed Bed Range Upper limit 51 - 100 86,951 101 - 150 95,641 151 - 250 129,878 251 - up 186,435IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 275 Page 1908 05. When an Owner Provides Services to More Than One Provider . When an owner provides services to more than one (1) provider compensation will be dis tributed on the same basis as costs are allocated for non-owners. ( ) 06. More Than One Owner or Related Party May Receive Compensatio n for Hours Actually Worked . Services must be actually performed, documented and necessary . Total compensation must be reasonable, and not greater than the amount for which the same services cou ld be obtained on the open market. The standard by which full time compensation is measured will be two thousand e ighty (2,080) hours. Compensation of an owner or a party related to an owner is subject to other provisions of thi s chapter, and will not exceed the compensation determined from the Administrativ e Compensation Schedule, and, on an hourly basis, will not exceed the compensation determined in the Administrative Compensation Sche dule divided by two thousand eighty (2,080). ( ) 275. NURSING FACILITY: PROPERTY RENTAL RATE REIMBURSEMENT. Free standing nursing facilities other than hospital based nurs ing facilities will be paid a property rental rate. Property taxes and property insurance will be reimbursed as costs exempt from limitations. The property rental rate includes compensation for major movable equipment but not for minor mova ble equipment. The propert y rental rate is paid in lieu of payment for amortization, depreciation, and interest fo r financing the cost of land and depreciable assets. Prior to final audit for free-standing nursing facilities, an interim rate for property reimbursement will be set to approximate the property rental rate as determined by Sections 56-108 and 56-109, Idaho Code. ( ) 01. Property Rental Rate . The property rental rate is bas ed upon current construction c osts, the age of the facility, the type of facility, and major expenditures made to improve the facility, or a rate based upon property costs as of January 1, 1985. The amount paid for each Medicaid day of care will be phased in according to Section 275.01 of these rules, and, beginning April 1, 1985, will be: ( ) R = \"Property Base\" x 40 - x building cos ts\" where: ( ) a. ) b. \"Property Base\" = thirteen dolla rs and nineteen cents ($13.19) beginning October 1, 1996 for all freestanding nursing facilities. ( ) c. \"Change in building costs\" = 1.0 from October 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996. Beginning January 1, 1997, \"change in building costs\" will be adjusted ea ch calendar year to reflect t he reported annual change in the building cost index for a class D building in the wester n region, as published by the Marshall Swift Valuation Service or the consumer price index for renter's costs whicheve r is greater. For freestanding nursing facilities, the index available in September of the prior year will be used. ( ) d. \"Age\" of facility - The effective age of the facility in years will be set by subtracting the year in which the facility, or portion thereof, was constructed from th e year in which the rate is to be applied. No facility or portion thereof will be assigned an age of more than thirty (30 ) years, however: ( ) i. If adequate information is not submitted by the facility to d ocument that the facility, or portion thereof, is newer than thirty (30) years, the age will be set a t thirty (30) years. Adequate documentation will include, but not be limited to, such documents as copies of building per mits, tax assessors' records, receipts, invoices, building contract, and original notes of indebtedness. An age w ill be determined for each building. A weighted average using the age and square footage of the buildings will become the effective age of the facility. The age of each building will be based upon the date when construction on that building was completed. This age will be adjusted to reflect major building expansion or remodeling prio r to April 1, 1985, if that expenditure was large enough to reduce the age of the facility by two (2) or more yea rs according to the following formula: ( ) Where:r = A x E / S x C r = Reduction in the age of the facility in years.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 275 Page 1909 If the result of this calculation, \"r\" is equal to or greater t han 2.0, the age of the building in years will be reduced by this number, rounded to the nearest whole number for rate setting purposes. In no case will the age be less than zero (0). ( ) ii. Historical nursing home construction cost per square foot fo r purposes of evaluating facility age. ( ) iii. For rates paid after June 30, 1989, the effective age of a facility will be further adjusted when the cost of major repairs, replacement, remodeling, or renovation o f a building initiated after April 1, 1985, results in the change in age by at least one (1) year when applied to the form ula in Subsection 275.01.d.i. of these rules. However, such change will not decrease the effective age of a facility b eyond the point where the increase in the property rental rate is greater than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference betw een the property rental rate \"r\" for a new facility at the time of the proposed rate revision and the property rental rate for which the facility was eligible immediately before the adjustment. The cost used for \"C\" will be adjusted accordin g to costs published by Marshall Swift Valuation Service to reflect current construction costs for average Class D convalescent hospitals. It is the provider's responsibility to notify the Department and document costs. The Department will adjust the age after documentation of costs. ( ) iv. In the event that new requirements are imposed by state or f ederal agencies, the Department will reimburse the expenditures directly related to these requiremen ts as an increase in the property rental rate if the expense is in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) per bed. If the cost related to the requirement is less than one hundred dollars ($100) per bed, the Department will, within twe lve (12) months of verification of expenditure, reimburse the Medicaid share of the entire cost of such new req uirements, as a one (1) time payment to the facility. ( ) v. At no time will the property rental rate paid to a facility b e less than the greater of the rate allowable to that facility on December 31, 1988, the rate allowable immed iately following the first opening of a new facility after December 31, 1988, or the rate allowable immediately foll owing the last, if any, age revision after December 31, 1988. However, subsequent to the application of this provision, before any property rental rate increase may be made for current or successor operators, the final settlement amount of any increase in the property rental rate will first be offset by an amount equal to the impact on final settlement of any rate decrease that would have occurred if the provisions of Subsections 275.01.d.iii. and 275.01.d.iv. of the se rules had not been applied. This is intended to allow the postponement of the financial burden to providers of proper ty rental rate decreases and to allow an equal offset of A = Age of the building at the time when construction was comple ted. E =Actual expenses for the construction provided that the total co sts must have been incurred within twenty-four (24) months of the completion of th e construction. S = The number of square feet in the building at the end of cons truction. C =The cost of construction for the buildings in the year when con struction was completed according to the schedule in Subsection 275.01.d.ii. Age Year Cost Age Year Cost Age Year Cost 1 2004 82.41 2 2003 80.80 3 2002 79.06 4 2001 78.43 5 2000 74.34 6 1999 71.55 7 1998 71.34 8 1997 68.20 9 1996 67.59 10 1995 66.19 11 1994 64.14 12 1993 60.56 13 1992 59.03 14 1991 56.13 15 1990 54.61 16 1989 53.17 17 1988 52.03 18 1987 51.66 19 1986 51.56 20 1985 50.55IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 275 Page 1910 the financial burden to the state of subsequent property rate i ncreases for a current or successor provider. ( ) vi. Effective July 1, 1991, for freestanding nursing facilities, \"age of facility\" will be a revised age that is the lesser of the age established under other provisions of this Section or the age that most closely yields the rate allowable to existing facilities as of June 30, 1991, under Sub section 275.01 of these rules. This revised age will not increase over time. ( ) 02. Grandfathered Rate . A \"grandfathered property rental rate\" for existing free-stan ding nursing facilities will be determined by dividing the audited allowable annualized property costs, exclusive of taxes and insurance, for assets on hand as of January 1, 1985, by the tot al patient days in the period July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1985. ( ) a. Prior to audit settlement, the interim rate for property costs allowable as of January 1, 1985, will be used to approximate the grandfathered rate. ( ) b. The grandfathered property rental rate will be adjusted to comp ensate the facility for the property costs of major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling or r enovation initiated prior to April 1, 1985, and completed during calendar year 1985. ( ) c. Beginning July 1, 1989, facilities receiving grandfathered rate s may have those rates adjusted for modifications related to major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling, or renovation initiated after January 1, 1986, if the cost of these modifications would be sufficient to reduce the age of the facility by one (1) year or more according to Subsection 275.01.d.i.of these rules. The grandfat hered rate will be revised after completion of modifications and will be the greater of: ( ) i. The grandfathered rate previously allowed; or ( )ii. The actual per diem property costs of amortization, deprecia tion and interest not applicable to the modifications for the audit period in which the modifications w ere completed plus the per diem rate of the first year amortization of the cost of these modifications when amortized over American Hospital Association guideline useful life or lives. However, no change in the grandfathered rate wil l be allowed to change that rate by more than three- fourths (3/4) of the difference between the previous grandfathe red rate and the property re ntal rate that would be paid for a new building at the time of the proposed rate revision. ( ) d. The facility will be reimbursed a rate that is the higher of th e grandfathered property rental rate as determined according to provisions of Subsection 275.02 of thes e rules or the property rental rate determined according to Subsections 275.01, 2 75.03, or Freestanding Nursing Facilities . Freestanding nursing facilities with leases will not be reimbursed in the same manner specified in Subsections 275.01 a nd 275.02 of these rules. Provisions in this section do not apply to reimbursement of home office costs. Home office costs will be paid based on reasonable cost principles. ( ) a. Facilities with leases entered into on or after March 30, 1981, are to be reimbursed in the same way as owned facilities with ownership costs being recognized inste ad of lease costs. ( ) b. Facilities with leases entered into prior to March 30, 1981, wi ll not be subject to reimbursement according to the provisions of Subsections 275.01 or 275.02 of these rules. Their property rental rate per day of care will be the sum of the annualized allowed lease costs and the o ther annualized property costs for assets on hand as of January 1, 1985, exclusive of taxes and insurance when paid sep arately, divided by total patient days in the period June 30, 1983, through July 1, 1984. ( ) i. Effective July 1, 1989, the property rental rates of leased n ursing facilities with leases entered into prior to March 30, 1981, may be adjusted to compensate for incr eased property costs resulting from facility modifications related to major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling, or renovation initiated after January 1, 1985, if the cost would be sufficient to reduce the age of the facility by one (1) year or more according to Subsection 275.01.d.i. of these rules. The rate will be revised after the completion of such modifications and will be the greater of IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 278 Page 1911 the property rental rate previously allowed under Subsection 27 5.03, or the actual per diem property costs for the amortization, depreciation, and interest not applicable to the modifications for the reporting period in which the modifications were completed, plus the per diem of the first ye ar amortization of the modification expenses using the American Hospital Association gu ideline useful life of lives. H owever, no such rate change will increase the allowable property rental rate by more than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the previous rate and the property rental rate that would be allowed for a new building a t the time of the proposed rate revision. ( ) ii. Where such leases contain provisions that bind the lessee to accept an increased rate, reimbursement will be at a rate per day of care that reflects t he increase in the lease rate. ( ) iii. Where such leases bind the le ssee to the lease and allow th e rate to be renegotiated, reimbursement will be at a rate per day of care that reflects an annual incre ase in the lease rate not to exceed the increase in the consumer price index for renters' costs. After April 1, 1985, i f such a lease is terminated or if the lease allows the lessee the option to terminate other than by an option to purch ase the facility, the property rental rate will become the amount \"R\" determined by the formula in Subsection 275.01 of th ese rules as of the date on which the lease is or could be terminated. ( ) 04. Sale of a Facility . In the event of the sale of a facility, or asset of a facilit y, the buyer will receive the property rental rate of Subsection 275.01 of these rules, e xcept in the event of a forced sale or except in the event of a first sale of a facility receiving a \"grandfathered rate\" after June 30, 1991, whereupon the property rental rate of the new owner will be computed a s if no sale had taken place. ( ) 05. Forced Sale of a Facility . In the event of a forced sale of a facility, or asset of a fa cility, where the seller has been receiving a grandfathered rate, the buyer will receive a rate based upon their incurred property costs, exclusive of taxes and insurance, for the twelve (12) months fo llowing the sale, divided by the facility's total patient days for that period, or the property rental rate, not modified by Section 275 of these rules , whichever is higher, but not exceeding the rate that would be due the seller. ( ) 276. -- 277. (RESERVED)278. NURSING FACILITY: OCCUPANCY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. In order to equitably allocate fixed costs to the Medicaid pati ents in cases where a facility is not maintaining reasonable occupancy levels, an adjustment will be made. No occ upancy adjustment will be made against the costs that are used to calculate the p roperty rental rate; however ad justment will be made against all other property costs. The adjustment will be made as follows: ( ) 01. Occupancy Levels . If a facility maintains an average occupancy of less than eig hty percent (80%) of a facility's capacity, the total property costs not includin g cost paid under the property rental rate, will be prorated based upon an eighty percent (80%) occupancy rate. Property cos ts and property rental rates are defined in Section 013 of these rules. The facility's average occupancy percentage will be subtracted from eighty percent (80%) and the resultant percentage will be taken times the total fixed costs to determine the nonallo wable fixed costs. ( ) 02. Occupancy Adjustment . For purposes of an occupancy adjustment, facility capacity wi ll be computed based upon the greater of the largest number of beds f or which the facility was licensed during the period being reported on or the largest number of beds for which the f acility was licensed during calendar year 1981, except where a portion of the facility has been converted to use for n onroutine nursing home activities or the facility is newly constructed and has entered the Medicaid Program subsequent to January 1, 1982. If the facility's designed capacity has been changed, the number of beds used to determine occupanc y will be lowered by the amount of capacity being converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. Facility capac ity for a new facility will be based on the number of beds approved by the certificate of need process less any capac ity converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. ( ) 03. Fixed Costs . For purposes of an occupancy adjustment fixed costs will be c onsidered all allowable and reimbursable costs reported under the property cost categor ies. ( ) 04. Change in Designed Capacity . In cases where a provider changes the designed capacity of a facility, the average occupancy for the period prior to the cha nge and subsequent to the change will be computed and IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 279 Page 1912 each period will be adjusted separately. If the designed capaci ty is increased, the increased number of beds will not be subject to this adjustment for the first six (6) months followi ng their licensure. ( ) 05. New Facility . In the case of a new facility being licensed and occupied, th e first six (6) months occupancy level will not be sub ject to this adjustment. ( ) 279. NURSING FACILITY: RECAPTURE OF DEPRECIATION. Where depreciable assets that were reimbursed based on cost and were used in the Medicaid Program by a facility subsequent to January 1, 1982, and for which depreciation has b een reimbursed by the Program, are sold for an amount in excess of their net b ook value, depreciation so reimb ursed will be recaptured from the buyer of the facility in an amount equal to reimbursed depreciation after January 1, 1982, or gain on the sale, whichever is less. ( ) 01. Amount Recaptured . Depreciation will be recaptured in full if a sale of a deprec iated facility takes place within the first five (5) years of a seller's ownership. Credit will be given for the period of ownership prior to January 1, 1982. For every year the asset is held beyond the fi rst five (5) years, the total depreciation recaptured will be reduced by ten percent (10%) per year of the total depreciat ion taken. ( ) 02. Time Frame . Depreciation will be recaptured by the Medicaid Program from the buyer of the facility over a period of time not to exceed five (5) years fro m the date of sale, with not less than one-fifth (1/5) of the total amount being recaptured for each year after such date. ( ) 280. - 282. (RESERVED) 283. NURSING FACILITY: FILING DATES. 01. Deadlines . Deadlines for annual cost reports will be the last day of the third month following the fiscal year end or the deadline i mposed by Medicare if the prov ider is required to file a Medicare cost report. ( ) 02. Waivers . A delay of thirty (30) days may be granted for annual cost re ports in unusual circumstances. Requests for such deferrals and reasons therefor e must be in writing and should be made prior to the deadline. A written decision will be rendered in writing within ten (10) days. ( ) 284. NURSING FACILITY: FAILURE TO FILE. Failure to submit timely reports may result in a reduction in t he interim rate. Failure to file the required cost reports, including required supplemental information, unless a waiver is granted, may result in a reduction of ten percent (10%) in the provider's rate(s) the first day of the month foll owing the deadline date. Continued failure to comply will result in complete payment suspension on the first day of the f ollowing month. When suspension or reduction has occurred and the provider has filed the required cost reports, amounts accruing to the provider during the period of suspension or reduction will be restored. Loss of license or ce rtification will result in immediate termination of reimbursement, full scope audit and settlement for the cost per iod. ( ) 285. NURSING FACILITY: ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

The name of the hospice from which the participant has receiv ed care; ( ) ii. The name of the hospice from which they plan to receive care ; and ( ) iii. The effective date of the change in hospices. ( ) c. A change in ownership of a hospice is not considered a change i n the patient's designation of a hospice, and requires no acti on on the patient's part. ( ) 06. Plan of Care . A plan of care must be established and reviewed at least mont hly. To be covered, services must be consistent with the plan of care. ( ) a. In establishing the initial plan of care, the member of the bas ic interdisciplinary group who assesses the patient's needs must meet or call at least one (1) other gr oup member (nurse, physician, medical social worker, or counselor) before writing the initial plan of care. ( ) b. At least one (1) of the persons involved in developing the init ial plan must be a nurse or a physician. This plan must be established on the same day as the assessment if the day of assessment is to be a covered day of hospice care. ( ) c. The other two (2) members of the basic interdisciplinary group must review the initial plan of care and provide their input to the process of establishing the plan of care within two (2) calendar days following the day IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 455 Page 1956 of assessment; input may be p rovided by telephone. ( ) 455. HOSPICE: PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS AND DUTIES. All services must be performed b y appropriately qualified perso nnel, but it is the nature of the service, rather than the qualification of the person who provides it, that determines th e category of the service. ( ) 456. HOSPICE: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT. With the exception of payment for physician services under Sect ion 458 of these rules, Medicaid reimbursement for hospice care will be made at one (1) of five (5) predetermined rates for each day in which a participant receives the respective type and intensity of the services furnished under t he care of the hospice. The five (5) rates are prospective rates; there will be no retroactive rate adjustments other than the application of the \"cap\" on overall payments, the service intensity add-on, and the limitation on payments for in patient care, if applicable. A description of the payment for each level of care is describ ed in Subsections 456.01 throu gh 456.04 of these ( ) 01. Routine Home Care . The hospice provider will be paid one (1) of two (2) routine home care rates for each day the patient is in residence, under the care of the hospice, and not receiving continuous home care. The rate is paid without regard to the volume or intensity of routi ne home care services provided on any given day. The two-rate payment methodology will result in a higher based paym ent for days one (1) through sixty (60) of hospice care and a reduced rate for days sixty-one (61) to end-of-care. If a participant leaves hos pice care and then later is placed back on hospice care, regardless of hospice provider, a minimum of a sixty (60) day gap in hospice services is required in order for the routine home care rate to be paid at the higher base payment rate. If there is not a minimum of a sixty (60) day gap in hospice services being provided, the hospice provider will be paid at the rate for which the participant is qualified. ( ) 02. Continuous Home Care . Continuous home care is to be provided only during a period o f crisis. A period of crisis is a period in which a patient requires contin uous care that is primarily nursing care to achieve palliation and management of acute medical symptoms. Care must be provided by either a licensed registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse and a nurse must provide care for at least half the total period of care. A minimum of eight (8) hours of care must be provided during a twenty-four ( 24) hour day that begins and ends at midnight. This care need not be continuous and uninterrupted. If less skilled care is needed on a continuous basis to enable the person to remain at home, this is covered as routine home care. For every hour or part of an hour of continuous care furnished, the hourly rate will be reimbursed to the hospice up to twenty-four (24) hours per day. ( ) 03. Inpatient Respite Care . The hospice will be paid at the inpatient respite care rate f or each day that the participant is in an approved inpatient facility and is rec eiving respite care. Payment for respite care may be made for a maximum of five (5) days at a time including the date of admission but not counting the date of discharge in any monthly election period. Payment for the sixth and any subseque nt day is to be made at the appropriate rate routine, continuous, or general inpatient rate. ( ) 04. General Inpatient Care . Payment at the inpatient rate will be made when general inpat ient care is provided. No other fixed payment rates will be applicable for a day on which the participant receives hospice general inpatient care except as describ ed in Section 458 of these rule s. ( ) a. Date of discharge. For the day of discharge from an inpatient u nit, the appropriate home care rate is to be paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. When the pa tient is discharged as deceased, the inpatient rate, either general or respite, is to be paid for the discharge date. ( ) b. Hospice payment rates. The Medicaid hospice payment rates are t he same as the Medicare hospice rates, adjusted to disregard cost offsets attributable to Medic are coinsurance amounts. Under the Medicaid hospice benefit, no cost sharing may be imposed with respect to hospice services rendered to Medicaid participants. ( ) c. Obligation of continuing care. After the participant's hospice benefit expires, the patient's Medicaid hospice benefits do not expire. The hospice must conti nue to provide that participant's care until the patient expires or until the participant revokes the election of hospic e care. ( ) 05. Service Intensity Add-On . For hospice services with dates of service on and after Janua ry 1, 2016, IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 457 Page 1957 a service intensity add-on payment will be made for a visit by a licensed registered nurse (RN) or social worker when provided in the last seven (7) days of life. Payment for the se rvice intensity add-on is in addition to the routine home care rate and is calculated by multiplying the continuous home care rate per fifteen (15) minutes by the number of units for the combined visits for the day. Payment must not exc eed sixteen (16) units per day, and is adjusted for geographic differences in wages. Phone time for a provider's so cial worker is not eligible for a service intensity add- on payment. ( ) 457. HOSPICE: LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS FOR INPATIENT CARE. Payments to a hospice for inpatient care must be limited accord ing to the number of days of inpatient care furnished to Medicaid patients. During the twelve (12) month period begin ning November 1st of each year and ending October 31st of the next year, the aggregate number of inpatient days ( both general inpatient days and inpatient respite care) may not exceed twenty percent (20% ) of the total number of days of hospice care provided to all Medicaid participants during the same period by the designated hospice o r its contracted agent(s). ( ) 01. For Purposes of Computation . If it is determined that the inpatient rate should not be pai d, any days for which the hospice receives payment at a home care rate will not be counted as inpatient days. The limitations on payment for inpatient days are as follows: ( ) a. The maximum number of allowable inpatient days will be calculat ed by multiplying the total number of a provider's Medicaid hospice days by twenty percent (20%). ( ) b. If the total number of days of inpatient care to Medicaid hospi ce patients is less than or equal to the maximum number of inpatient days computed in Subsection 457.01 of these rules then no adjustment is made. ( ) c. If the total number of days of inpatient care exceeds the maxim um number of allowable inpatient days computed in Subsection 457.01 of these rules then the paym ent limitation will be determined by: ( ) i. Calculating the ratio of the maximum allowable inpatient days to the number of actual days of inpatient care, and multiplying this ratio by the total reimbur sement for inpatient care that was made. ( ) ii. Multiplying excess inpatient care days by the routine home c are rate. ( ) iii. Adding the amounts calculated in Subsections 457.01.c.i. and 457.01.c.ii. of these rules. ( ) iv. Comparing the amount in Subsection 457.01.c.iii. of these ru les with interim payments made to the hospice for inpatient care during the \"cap period.\" ( ) 02. The amount by which interim payments for inpatient care exceeds the amount calculated as in Section 459 of these rules is due from the hospice. ( ) 458. HOSPICE: PAYMENT FOR PHYSICIAN SERVICES. The basic rates for hospice care represent full reimbursement t o the hospice for the costs of all covered services related to the treatment of the participant's terminal illness, including the administrative and general activities performed by physicians who are employees of or working under a rrangements made with the hospice. These activities would generally be performed by the physician servin g as the medical director and the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group. Group activities include p articipation in the establishment of plans of care, supervision of care and services, periodic review and updating of plans of care, and establishment of governing policies. The costs for these services are included in the reim bursement rates for routine home care, continuous home care, and inpatient respite care. ( ) 01. Hospice Employed Physician Direct Patient Service . Reimbursement for a hospice employed physician's direct patient services that are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual Idaho Medicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services . These services will be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and, the related payments wil l be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Section 459 of these rules has been exce eded. The only physician services to be billed by a hospice for such services are direct patient care services. Lab oratory and X-ray services are included in the hospice IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 459 Page 1958 daily rate. ( ) 02. Volunteer Physician Services . V olunteer physician services are excluded from Medicaid reimbursement with the following exceptions: ( ) a. A hospice may be reimbursed on behalf of a volunteer physician for specific direct patient care services that are not rendered on a volunteer basis. The hospic e must have a liability to reimburse the physician for those services rendered. In determining whether a service is pr ovided on a volunteer basis, a physician must not distinguish which services are provided voluntarily on the basi s of the patient's ability to pay. ( ) b. Reimbursement for an independent physician's direct patient ser vices that are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual Idaho Me dicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services. These services will not be billed by the hospice unde r the hospice provider number and they will not be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount p er Section 459 of these rules has been exceeded. The only services to be billed by an attending physician are th e physician's personal professional services. Costs for services such as laboratory or X-rays are not to be included on t h e a t t e n d i n g p h y s i c i a n ' s b i l l e d c h a r g e s t o t h e Medicaid program. The aforementioned charges are included in th e daily rates paid and are expressly the responsibility of the hospice. ( ) 459. HOSPICE: CAP ON OVERALL REIMBURSEMENT. Aggregate payments to each hospice will be limited during a hos pice cap period per Subsection 451.05 of these rules. The total payments made for services furnished to Medicaid part icipants during this period will be compared to the \"cap amount\" for this period. Any payments in excess of the cap must be refunded by the hospice. ( ) 01. Overall Cap . The overall cap will be compared t o reimbursement after the inp atient limitation is computed and subtracted from tota l reimbursement due the hospic e. ( ) 02. Total Payment for Services . Total payment made for services furnished to Medicaid partici pants during this period means all payments for services rendered dur ing the cap year, regardless of when payment is actually made. ( ) 03. Calculation of Cap Amount . The \"cap amount\" is calculated by multiplying the number of participants electing certified hospice care during the period by six thousand five hundred dollars ($6,500). This amount will be adjusted for each subsequent cap year beginning November 1, 1983, to reflect the percentage increase or decrease in the medical care expenditure category of the Con sumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It will also be ad justed as per Subsection 459.07 of these rules. ( ) 04. Computation and Application of Cap Amount . The computation and application of the \"cap amount\" is made by the Departmen t after the end of the cap peri od. ( ) 05. Report Number The hospice must report the number of Medicaid participants electing hospice car e during the period to the Dep artment. ( ) a. This must be done within thirty (30) days after the end of th e cap period: and ( ) b. If the participant is transferred to a non-certified hospice no payment to the non-certified hospice will be made and the certified hospice may count a complete par ticipant benefit period in their cap amount. ( ) 06. in Mid-Month . If a hospice certifies in mid-month, a weighted average cap a mount based on the number of days falling within each cap period woul d be used. ( ) 07. Adjustment of the Overall Cap . Cap amounts in each hospice's cap period will be adjusted to reflect changes in the cap periods and designated hospices duri ng a participant's election period. The proportion of each hospice's days of service to the total number of hospice d ays rendered to the participant during their election period will be multiplied by the cap amount to determine each h ospice's adjusted cap amount. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 460 Page 1959 a. After each cap period has ended, t he Department will calculate the overall cap within a reasonable time for each hospice participatin g in the Idaho Medicaid Progr am. ( ) b. Each hospice's cap amount will be computed as follows: ( ) i. The share of the \"cap amount\" that each hospice is allowed wi ll be based on the proportion of total covered days provided by each hospice in the \"cap period.\" ( ) ii. The proportion determined in Section 457 of these rules for each certified hospice will be multiplied by the \"cap amount\" s pecified for the \"cap period\" i n which the participant first elected hospice. ( ) c. The participant must file an initial election during the period beginning September 28 of the previous year through September 27 of the current cap year in o rder to be counted as an electing Medicaid participant during the current cap year. ( ) 08. Additional Amount for Nursing Facility Residents . An additional per diem amount will be paid for \"room and board\" of hospice residents in a certified nursin g facility receiving routine or continuous care services. In this context, the term \"room and board\" includes all assista nce in the activities of daily living, in socializing activities, administration of medication, maintaining the clean liness of a resident's room, and supervision and assisting in the use of durable medical equipment and prescribe d therapies. The additional payments and the related days are not subject to the caps specified in Sections 457 and 459 of these rules. The room and board rate will be ninety-five percent (95%) of the per diem interim reimbursement rate assigned to the facility for those dates of service on which the participant was a resident of that facilit y. ( ) 460. HOSPICE: POST-ELIGIBILITY TREATMENT OF INCOME. Where a participant is determined eligible for medical assistan ce participation in the cost of long term care, the Department will reduce its payments for all costs of the hospic e benefit, including the supplementary amounts for room and board, by an amount determined according to Section 22 7 of these rules. ( ) 461. -- 499. (RESERVED) SUB PART: ENHANCED DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES (Sections 500-719) 500. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY DETERMINATION STANDARDS.

Tests used to determine a developmental disability must reflect the current functional status of the individual being e valuated. Tests over one (1) year old must be verified to reflect the current status of the individual by an appropriate professional. Instruments designed only for screening purposes must not be used to determine eligibility. ( ) 01. Test Instruments For Adults . A Department-approved assessment tool for conducting cognitiv e and functional assessments must be used to determine eligibilit y. ( ) 02. Test Instruments for Children . The assessments utilized to determine eligibility must be bas ed on age appropriate criteria. Evaluations must be performed by qual ified personnel with experience and expertise with children; selected evaluation tools and practices should be age appropriate, based on consideration of the child's language and motor skills. A Department-approved assessment too l for conducting cognitive and functional assessments must be used with children.

Age 5 to Age 21: Use the pre-vocational area of a standardized functional assessment to document a limitation in this area. Birth to Age 5: A substantial limitation in this area is evidenced by the child's eligibility for SSI, early intervention, or early child hood special education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). AND (c) reflects the needs for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary or generic care, treatment or other services that are of life-long or extended duration and individually planned and coordinated.Age 5 through Adult: Life-long or extended duration means the developmental disability is one that has the reasonable likelih ood of continuing for a protracted period of time, including a reasona ble likelihood that it will continue throughout life. Birth to Age 5: The expected duration may be frequently unclear. Therefore, determination of eligibility by a multi-disciplinary team for early intervention services through SSI, an IFSP, child study team or early childhood special education services through an IEP will be an indicator of this criteria.TABLE 501 - DEVELOPMENTAL DIS ABILITY DETERMINATION STANDARDS Definition StandardsIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 507 Page 1963 504. -- 506.

The frequency and intensi ty of this type of aggressive behavior must require continuous monitoring to prevent injury to themselves or others. ( ) iv. Chronic or acute medical conditions that are so complex or u nstable that one-to-one staffing is required to provide frequent interventions and constant monitor ing. Without this intervention and monitoring the participant would require placement in a nursing facility, hosp ital, or ICF/ID with twenty-four (24) hour on-site nursing. Verification of the complex medical condition and the need for this level of service requires medical documentation. ( ) c. Hourly support is for those individuals that do not meet criter ia for either high or intense supports or those individuals who qualify for a daily rate but whose nee ds can be met with less than twenty-four (24) per day support. The combination of hourly supported living, developmen tal therapy, community supported employment, and adult day care will not be authorized to exceed the maximum set daily amount established by the Department except IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 515 Page 1971 when all of the following conditions are met: ( ) i.

( ) i. Reasonable cost takes into account both direct and indirect c osts of providers of services, including IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 590 Page 1988 normal standby costs. ( ) ii. The objectives of these methods are that: first, the costs w ith respect to individuals covered by the program will not be borne by others not so covered. Second, the costs with respect to individuals not covered will not be paid by the program. ( ) b. Costs may vary from one institu tion to another because of a var iety of factors. It is the intent of the program that providers will be reimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high quality care, unless such costs exceed the applicable maximum base rate developed pursuant to p rovisions of Title 56, Chapter 1, Idaho Code, or are unallowable by application of promulgated regulation. ( ) c. Implicit in the intention that actual operating costs be paid t o the extent they are reasonable is the expectation that the provider seeks to minimize its costs and t hat its actual operating costs do not exceed what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer pays for a given item or servi ce.

The following schedule will be used in determining the maximum amount o f owner administrative compensa tion allowable for the calendar year ending December 31, 2002. ( ) 02. The Administrative Compensation Schedule . The administrative compensation schedule in this Section will be adjusted annually based upon the change in aver age hourly earnings in nursing and personal care facilities as published by Data Resources Incorporated, its suc cessor organization or, if unavailable, another nationally recognized forecasting firm. ( ) 03. The Maximum Allowable Compensation . The maximum allowable compensation for an owner providing administrative services is determined from the schedu le in Subsection 597.01. of these rules. Allowable compensation will be determined as follows: ( ) a. In determining the number of beds applicable on the schedule, a ll licensed beds for which the individual provides administrative services will be counted, re gardless of whether they are in the same facility. ( ) b. For an owner providing services to more than fifty (50) beds, t he amounts shown on the schedule for the applicable number of beds will determine the upper limi t for allowable compensation. ( ) c. For owners providing services to less than fifty-one (51) beds, such services related to administrative duties will be reimbursed at the hourly rate all owable if the owner was providing services to fifty-one (51) beds. Additionally, services other than administrative ser vices may be performed by the owner and will be allowable at the reasonable market rate for such services. To b e allowable, hours for each type of service will be documented. In no event will the total compensation for adminis trative and non-administrative duties paid to an owner or related party to an owner of a facility or facilities with fifty (50) licensed beds or less exceed the limit that would be applicable to an owner with the same number of points providing administrative services to facilities with fifty-one (51) beds as set forth in the schedule of Subsection 597.01 of these rules. ( ) 04. Compensation for Persons Related to an Owner . Compensation for persons related to an owner will be evaluated in the same manner as for an owner. ( ) 05. When an Owner Provides Services to More Than One Provider . When an owner provides services to more than one (1) provider compensation will be dis tributed on the same basis as costs are allocated for Licensed Bed Range Upper limit 51 - 100 86,951 101 - 150 95,641151 - 250 129,878 251 - up 186,435IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 600 Page 1994 non-owners. ( ) 06. More Than One Owner or Related Party May Receive Compensatio n for Hours Actually Worked . Services must be actually performed, documented and necessary . Total compensation must be reasonable, and not greater than the amount for which the same services cou ld be obtained on the open market. The standard by which full time compensation is measured will be two thousand e ighty (2,080) hours. Compensation of an owner or a party related to an owner is subject to other provisions of thi s chapter, and will not exceed the compensation determined from the Administrativ e Compensation Schedule, and, on an hourly basis, will not exceed the compensation determined in the Administrative Compensation Sche dule divided by two thousand eighty (2,080). ( ) 598. -- 599. (RESERVED)600. ICF/ID: OCCUPANCY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. In order to equitably allocate fixed costs to the Medicaid pati ents in cases where a facility is not maintaining reasonable occupancy levels, an adjustment will be made. No occ upancy adjustment will be made against the costs that are used to calculate the p roperty rental rate; however ad justment will be made against all other property costs. The adjustment will be made as follows: ( ) 01. Occupancy Levels . If a facility maintains an average occupancy of less than eig hty percent (80%) of a facility's capacity, the total property costs not includin g cost paid under the property rental rate, will be prorated based upon an eighty percent (80%) occupancy rate. Property cos ts and property rental rates are defined in Section 013 of these rules. The facility's average occupancy percentage will be subtracted from eighty percent (80%) and the resultant percentage will be taken times the total fixed costs to determine the nonallo wable fixed costs. ( ) 02. Occupancy Adjustment . For purposes of an occupancy adjustment, facility capacity wi ll be computed based upon the greater of the largest number of beds f or which the facility was licensed during the period being reported on or the largest number of beds for which the f acility was licensed during calendar year 1981, except where a portion of the facility has been converted to use for n onroutine nursing home activities or the facility is newly constructed and has entered the Medicaid Program subsequent to January 1, 1982. If the facility's designed capacity has been changed, the number of beds used to determine occupanc y will be lowered by the amount of capacity being converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. Facility capac ity for a new facility will be based on the number of beds approved by the certificate of need process less any capac ity converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. ( ) 03. Fixed Costs . For purposes of an occupancy adjustment fixed costs will be c onsidered all allowable and reimbursable costs reported under the property cost categor ies. ( ) 04. Change in Designed Capacity . In cases where a provider changes the designed capacity of a facility, the average occupancy for the period prior to the cha nge and subsequent to the change will be computed and each period will be adjusted separately. If the designed capaci ty is increased, the increased number of beds will not be subject to this adjustment for the first six (6) months followi ng their licensure. ( ) 05. New Facility . In the case of a new facility being licensed and occupied, th e first six (6) months occupancy level will not be sub ject to this adjustment. ( ) 601. ICF/ID: RECAPTURE OF DEPRECIATION. Where depreciable assets that were reimbursed based on cost and were used in the Medicaid Program by a facility subsequent to January 1, 1982, and for which depreciation has b een reimbursed by the Program, are sold for an amount in excess of their net b ook value, depreciation so reimb ursed will be recaptured from the buyer of the facility in an amount equal to reimbursed depreciation after January 1, 1982, or gain on the sale, whichever is less. ( ) 01. Amount Recaptured . Depreciation will be recaptured in full if a sale of a deprec iated facility takes place within the first five (5) years of a seller's ownership. Credit will be given for the period of ownership prior to January 1, 1982. For every year the asset is held beyond the fi rst five (5) years, the total depreciation recaptured will be reduced by ten percent (10%) per year of the total depreciat ion taken. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 602 Page 1995 02. Time Frame . Depreciation will be recaptured by the Medicaid Program from the buyer of the facility over a period of time not to exceed five (5) years fro m the date of sale, with not less than one-fifth (1/5) of the total amount being recaptured for each year after such date.

Any property cos t related to home offices and day treatment services are not considered property costs and will not be reported in the p roperty cost portion of the cost report. These costs will be reported in the home office and day treatment section of the cost report. Property costs, including costs that are reimbursed based on a rental rate, will be reported in the prop erty cost portion of the cost report. The Department may require and utilize an appraisal to establish those components of property costs that are identified as an integral part of an appraisal. Property costs include the following components: ( ) 01. Depreciation . Allowable depreciation based on straight line depreciation. ( ) 02. Interest .

Beginning October 1, 1996, this cost area includes all allowabl e costs except those specifica lly identified as property costs in Section 623 of these rules and exempt costs or exclude d costs in Section 627 or 628 of these rules. This Section defines items and procedures to be followed in determin ing allowable and exempt costs and provides the procedures for extracting cost d ata from historical cost report s, applying a cost forecasti ng market basket to project cost forward, procedures to be followed to project costs forwar d, and procedures for computing the median of the range of costs and the ICF/ID cap. ( ) 01. Costs Subject to the Cap . Items subject to the cap include all allowable costs except p roperty costs identified in Section 623 o f these rules and exempt costs or excluded costs identified in Section 627 or 628 of these rules. Property costs related to a home office are admini strative costs, will not be reported as property costs, and are subject to the cap. ( ) 02. Per Diem Costs . Costs to be included in this category will be divided by the total participant days for the facility for the cost reporting period to arrive at all owable per diem costs. If costs for services provided some or all non-Medicaid residents are not included in the total cos ts submitted, the provider must determine the costs and combine them with the submitted costs in order that a total per diem cost for that facility can be determined both for both the purposes of determining the ICF/ID cap and of computin g final reimbursement. ( ) 03. Cost Data to Determine the Cap . Cost data to be used to determine the cap for ICF/ID faciliti es will be taken from each provider's most recent final cost repor t available sixty (60) days before the beginning of the period for which the cap is being set. Cost reports are final w hen the final audit report is issued, or earlier if the Department informs the facility t he report is final for rate se tting purposes. The selected final cost report will be used to establish the facility's prospective reimbursement rate. How ever, the final cost reports covering a period of less than twelve (12) months will be included in the data for determ ining the cap at the option of the Department. ( ) 04. Projection . Per diem allowable costs will be inflated forward using a cos t forecasting market basket and forecasting indices according to the same table as u sed for free standing facilities. ( ) a. The projection method used in Section 624 of these rules to set the cap will also be used to set non property portions of the prospective rate that are not subject to the cap. ( ) b. Forecasting indices as developed by Data Resources, Incorporate d, will be used unless they are unavailable. In such case, indices supplied by some other natio nally recognized forecaster will be used.

Physicians who provide these servi ces must bill the Medicaid program directly using their own provider numbers. ( ) b. Costs of services covered under the Early and Periodic Screenin g Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) portion of the Medicaid Program. Items such as eyeglass es and hearing aids are covered under IDAPA 16.03.09, \"Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits.\" The cost of these ser vices is not included as a part of ICF/ID costs. Reimbursement can be made to a professional providing these ser vices through their billing the Medicaid Program on their own provider number. ( ) c. Costs of services covered by other parts of the Medicaid Progra m. Examples of these items include legend drugs and ambulance transportation. These items must be billed to the Medicaid Program directly by the provider using their own provider number. ( ) 06. Cost Projection . Allowable per diem costs will be projected forward from the m idpoint of the Base Period to the midpoint of the Target Period. \"Base Period\" is d efined as the last available final cost report period. \"Target Period\" is defined as th e effective period of the prosp ective rate. Procedures for inflating these costs are as follows: ( ) a. The percentage change for each cost category in the market bask et will be computed from the beginning to the end of the Base Period. These percentages will then be divided by two (2) and the resultant percentages will be used to project forward allowable per diem costs for each cost category from the midpoint to the end of the Base Period. ( ) b. The percentage change for each cost category in the market bask et will be computed for the period from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. These percentages will then be used to project forward the allowable per diem costs for each cost category, as determined in Subsection 624.06.a. of these rules, from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. ( ) c. The percentage change for each cost category in the market bask et will be computed for the beginning to the end of the Target Period. These percentages wi ll then be divided by two (2) and the resultant percentages will be used to project forward the allowable per d iem costs as determined in Subsection 624.06.b. of these rules from the beginning to the midpoint of the Target Pe riod. ( ) 07. Cost Ranking . Prior to October 1st of each y ear the Director will determine the that percent above the median that will assure aggregate payments to ICF/ID provid ers will approximate but not exceed amounts that would be incurred using Medicare cost principles of reimburseme nt. That percentage will apply to caps and rates set after September 30th of each year. Projected per diem costs as determined in this section and subject to the cap will be ranked from the highest to the lowest. The cap will be set at a percent of the bed-weighted median for each rate period. The initial cap will be set as of October 1, 1996. ( ) a. The median of the range will be computed based on the available data points being considered as the total population of data points. ( ) b. The cap for each ICF/ID facility with a fiscal year beginning O ctober 1, 1996, will be computed prior to the beginning of that year. For those facilities with a fiscal year ending on a date other than September 30th, the first cap will be computed for the period beginning October 1, 1996, and ending on the fiscal year end date. ( ) c. Facilities with cost reports that transcend the period from Oct ober 1, 1996, through September 30, 1997, will be retrospectively settled using the previous reimbu r s e m e n t s y s t e m f o r t h e p e r i o d o f t h e r e p o r t u p t o September 30, 1996. There will not be a retrospective settlemen t on the portion of these cost reports attributed to October 1, 1996 through the end of the cost report period unles s provisions of Section 626 of these rules apply.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 626 Page 2005 ( ) d. Cost reports for periods beginning on or after October 1, 1996, will not be subject to retrospective settlement except as required by other provisions of this chapt er. ( ) e. A new cap and rate will be set on an annual basis for each faci lity the first of July every year. ( ) f. The cap and prospective rate will be determined and set on an a nnual basis for each facility July first of every year and will not be changed by any subsequent e vents or information with the exception that if the computations were found to contai n mathematical or clerical err ors, these errors will be corrected and the cap will be adjusted using the corrected figures. ( ) g. Payment of costs subject to the cap will be limited to the cap unless the Department determines the exclusions found in Section 6 28 of these rules apply. ( ) h. A facility that commences to offer participant care services as an ICF/ID on or after October 1, 1996, will be subject to retrospective settlement until the fir st prospective rate is set. Such facility will be subject to the ICF/ID cap as determined in this chapter. The first prospec tive rate for this provider will be set by the Department based on quarterly cost statements and final cost reports submi tted for periods following the first three (3) months of operation. This first prospectiv e rate may be set after the beg inning of the second fiscal year of the provider. For the second year the provider will be paid a rate to be settled retr ospectively unless both the Department and the provider agree to a prospective rate or rates covering that fiscal perio d. ( ) 625. (RESERVED) 626. ICF/ID: RETROSPECTIVE SETTLEMENT. When retrospective settlement is applicable, it is based on all owable reimbursement in accordance with this chapter and based on an audit report. Retrospective settlement will be subject to the same caps and limits determined for prospective payments. ( ) 01. A Provider's Failure to Meet Any of the Conditions . A p r o v i d e r ' s f a i l u r e t o m e e t a n y o f t h e conditions of participation set forth in 42 CFR 483, Subpart I, may subject that provider to retrospective reimbursement for the fiscal year, or any portion thereof, duri ng which the condition is not met. The provider's projected per diem rate may be ad justed to reflect actual reimb ursable costs subject to cost limits. ( ) 02. A First Time Provide r. A first time provider operating a new ICF/ID living unit wil l be subject to a retrospective settlement for the first fiscal year and until the first subsequent period wherein a prospective rate is set in accordance with Sections 603, 605, and 606 of these rules an d this chapter. A budget based on the best available information is required prior to opening for participant care s o an interim rate can be set. ( ) 03. New ICF/ID Living Unit . A new ICF/ID living unit for an existing operator is subject to first time facility requirements if the new living unit reflects a net inc rease in licensed beds, otherwise the Department may set a prospective rate with the non-property rate components based on similar components of rates most recently paid for the participants moving into the facility. The property rental rate will be set according to applicable provisions of this chapter. ( ) 04. Change of Ownership of Existing ICF/ID Living Unit . Where there is a change of ownership of an existing ICF/ID living unit, the provider operating the ICF/ ID living unit will not receive an adjustment of the provider's prospective rate except that the property rental por tion of the rate will be adjusted subject to property rental provisions of this chapter. However, new facility reporting req uirements and the cap will apply. ( ) 05. Fraudulent or False Claims . Providers who have made fraudulent or false claims are subjec t to retrospective settlement as det ermined by the Department. ( ) 06. Excluded Costs . Excluded costs may be retrospectively settled according to th e provisions of Section 247 of these rules. ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 627 Page 2006 627. ICF/ID: EXEMPT COSTS. Exempt costs are not subject to the ICF/ID cap. ( ) 01. Day Treatment Services . As specified in this Section, the cost of day treatment servi ces may be reimbursed in this category and may not be subject to the ICF/I D cap. ( ) a. This category includes the direct costs of labor, benefits, con tracted services, property, utilities and supplies for such services up to the limitations provided in th is Subsection. ( ) b. When a school or another agency or entity is responsible for or pays for services provided to a participant regularly during normal working hours on weekdays, no costs will be assigned to this category for such services. The Department will not reimburse for the cost of ser vices that are paid for or should be paid for by an other agency. ( ) c. When ICF/ID day treatment services are performed for participan ts in a licensed Developmental Disability Center, the allowable cost of such services will be included in this category, but not more than the amount that would be paid according to t he Department's fee schedule f or individual or group therapy for similar services. Amounts incurred or paid by the ICF/ID in excess of what would be paid according to the Department's fee schedule for like services are not allowable costs and will be reported as non-reimbursable. ( ) d. For day treatment services provided in a location other than a certified developmental disability center, the maximum amount reportable in this category will als o be limited. Total costs for such services reported by each provider in this category will be limited to the number of hours, up to thirty (30) hours per week per participant, of individual or group developmental therapy times the hourly r ate that would be paid acco rding to the most recent Department fee schedule for the same services if provided in a developmental disability center. Costs in excess of the limits determined in this Subsection will be classified and rep orted as subject to the ICF/ID cap. Initial rates established under the prospective system effective October 1, 1 996, and not later than October 1, 1997, will not include a limitation of day treatment costs based on the hourly rate, when the hours of individual or group therapy were not obtained or audited by the Department at the time the rate was published. However, if a provider believes that the day treatment cost used to establish the day treatment portion of its prospective rate was misstated for rates set for periods beginning October 1, 1996, through rates beginn ing October 1, 1997, revisions to the prospective rate may be made to the extent the provider demonstrates, to the sat isfaction of the Department, that the cost used was misstated. Such a revision will be considered only if the provi der requests a revision and provides adequate documentation within sixty (60) days of the date the rate was s et. At the option of the Department it may negotiate fixed rates for these day treatment services. Such rates will b e set so the aggregate related payments are lower than would be paid with a limitation based on schedules used for lic ensed Developmental Di sability Centers. ( ) e. Financial data including expenses and labor hours incurred by o r on behalf of the provider in providing day treatment services, must be identifiable and sepa rate from the costs of other facility operations. Reasonable property costs related to day treatment services and not included in the property rental rate, will be separately identified, will be reported as day treatment servic es costs, and will not include property costs otherwise reimbursed. Property costs related to day treatment services wi ll be separately identified as not related to living unit costs by a final audit determination issued prior to October 1, 1996, or will be separate and distinct from any property used for ICF/ID services that are or were day treatment service s. ( ) f. In the event a provider has a change in the number of participa nts requiring day treatment services, the prospective rate may be adjusted by the Department to refle ct a change in costs related to such a change. Providers receiving such changes may be required to provide add ed documentation to the Department to assure that further changes can be identified and the prospective rate adju sted accordingly. ( ) 02. Major Movable Equipment . Costs related to major movable equipment, as defined in this chapter will be exempt from the ICF/ID cap and will be reimbursed prosp ectively based on Medicare principles of cost reimbursement. ( ) 628. ICF/ID: COSTS EXCLUDED FROM THE CAP. Certain costs may be excluded from the ICF/ID cap, may be subje ct to retrospective settlement at the discretion of the IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 628 Page 2007 Department, and may result in changes to the prospective rate a s provided in this Section to assure equitable reimbursement: ( ) 01. Increases of More Than One Dollar Per Participant Day in Cos ts. Increases of more than one dollar ($1) per participant day in costs otherwise subject to t he cap incurred by a facility as a result of changes in State or Federal laws or rules will be reported separately on the cos t report for reports filed less than thirty (30) months, or a greater length of time if so directed by the Department, from the date such increases were first required. Such costs will be subdivided into the component parts of wages, benefits, contracted services and other costs in the amounts equal to costs removed from the respective cost categories subj ect to the cap. The Department may adjust the forecasted rate to include the projected per diem related to su ch costs. ( ) a. The provider will report these costs on a separate schedule or by notations on the cost report so that these costs can be identified a nd reconciled to the provider's general ledger. ( ) b. If more than one (1) increase occurs as a result of one (1) or more law or rule change, the costs from each event are to be reported separately. ( ) c. The computation of the cost increase amount or amounts is to be presented in detail on a supplementary schedule or schedules unless the Department state s otherwise. ( ) d. For interim rate purposes the provider's prospective rate may b e granted an increase to cover such cost increases. A cost statement covering a recent period may b e required with the justification for the increased costs. The actual amount related to such increases will be dete rmined at audit and may be retrospectively settled. ( ) e. After the initial deadline has passed for all providers to file cost reports for reporting periods beginning on or after the date certain cost increases were firs t required, the Department will, at it's option, include all of the previously excluded costs related to those increases wit h costs subject to the cap whe n setting rates or increase the cap and individual facility prospective rates following suc h cost increases. If a cap is set with these particular costs included in the cap category, providers subject to that c ap will not have these costs excluded from the cap for prospective rate purposes. The intent of this provision is for costs to be exempt from the cap until these costs are able to be fully and equitably incorporated in the data base used to project the cap and for these costs to be exempt only when they are not included in the data base. In those cases, wh en costs are not incurred i mmediately after a change in rule or law, delays in incorporating the new costs in the cap a re warranted. ( ) f. When cost increases that have been excluded from the cap are in corporated in the inflation indices used to set the cap, the cost indices will be adjusted to exclu de the influence of such changes if the amount is included in the index is identified. When the cap is set to include prev iously excluded amounts, any adjustments previously made to the indexes related to the previously excluded costs wi ll be removed. ( ) 02. Excess Inflation . Reimbursement of costs subject to the cap will be limited to the cap unless the Department determines the inflation indices used to set the pro spective rates for a reporting period understated actual inflation by more than seven (7%) percentage points. In such ca se, prospective rates and the cap will be increased by the amount that actual inflatio n indices exceeded projected inf lation indices and may be retrospectively adjusted by the department. ( ) 03. Cost Increases Greater Than Three Percent . When cost increases of greater than three percent (3%) of the projected interim rate that result from disasters s uch as fire, flood, or earthquake, epidemic or similar unusual and unpredictable circumstances over which a provider h as no control. Prospective rates will be increased and they will not be subject to the cap. However, they may be r etrospectively adjusted by the Department. For the purposes of this Subsection, disaster does not include personal or financial problems. ( ) 04. Decreases . In the event of state or federal law, rule, or policy changes that result in clearly identifiable reductions in required services, the Department ma y reduce the prospective rate to reflect the identified per diem amount related to such reductions. ( ) 05. Prospective Negotiated Rates . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 622 of these rules, the IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 629 Page 2008 Director will have the authority to negotiate prospective rates for providers who would otherwise be subject to accept retrospective settlement. Such rates will not exceed the projec ted allowable rate that would otherwise be reimbursed based on provisions of this chapter. ( ) 629. ICF/ID: LEGAL CONSULTANT FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS. Costs of legal consultant fees and litigation costs incurred by the provider will be handled in accordance with the following: ( ) 01. In General . Legal consultant fees unrelated to the preparation for or the taking of an appeal of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, or lit igation costs incurred by the provider in an action unrelated to litigation with the Department of Health and Welfa re, will be allowed as a part of the total per diem costs of which the Medicaid Program w ill reimburse a portion accordin g to the percentage of Medicaid patient days. ( ) 02. Administrative Appeals . In the case of the provider contesting in administrative appe al the findings of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, the costs of the provider's legal counsel will be reimbursed by the Medicaid Program only to the extent that t he provider prevails on the issues involved. The determination of the extent that the provider prevails will be based on the ratio of the total dollars at issue for the audit period at issue in the hearing to the total dollars ultimately awarded to the provider for that audit period by the hearing officer or subsequent adjudicator. ( ) 03. Other . All other litigation costs incurred by the provider in action s against the Department of Health and Welfare will not be reimbursable either directly or indirectly by the Medicaid Program except where specifically ordered by a court of law. ( ) 630. ICF/ID: PROPERTY RENTAL RATE REIMBURSEMENT. ICFs/ID will be paid a property rental rate. Property taxes, pr operty insurance, and depreciation expense or major moveable equipment will be reimbursed as costs exempt from limi tations. The property rental rate does not include compensation for minor movable equipment. The property rental r ate is paid in lieu of payment for amortization, depreciation, and interest for financing the cost of land and d epreciable assets. See Sections 56-108 and 56-109, Idaho Code, for further clarification. ( ) 01. Property Rental Rate . The property rental rate is bas ed upon current construction c osts, the age of the facility, the type of facility, and major expenditures made to improve the facility, or a rate based upon property costs as of January 1, 1985. The amount paid for each Medicaid day of care will be phased in according to the following: ( ) a. R = \"Property Base\" x 40 - \"Age\" / 40 x building cos ts\" where: ( ) b. ) c. \"Property Base\" = eleven dollars and twenty-two cents ($11.22) except for ICF/ID living units not able to accommodate residents re quiring wheelchairs beginning O ctober 1, 1996. Property base = seven dollars and twenty-two cents ($7.22) for ICF/ID living units not able to ac commodate residents requiring wheelchairs. ( ) d. \"Change in building costs\" = 1.0 from October 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996. For ICF/ID facilities, the most recent index available when it is first ne cessary to set a prospective rate for a period that includes all or part of the calendar year, will be used. ( ) e. \"Age\" of facility - The effective age of the facility in years will be set by subtracting the year in which the facility, or portion thereof, was constructed from th e year in which the rate is to be applied. No facility or portion thereof will be assigned an age of more than thirty (30 ) years, however: ( ) i. If adequate information is not submitted by the facility to d ocument that the facility, or portion thereof, is newer than thirty (30) years, the age will be set a t thirty (30) years. Adequate documentation will include, but not be limited to, such documents as copies of building per mits, tax assessors' records, receipts, invoices, building contract, and original notes of indebtedness. An age will be de termined for each building. A weighted average using IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 630 Page 2009 the age and square footage of the buildings will become the eff ective age of the facility. The age of each building will be based upon the date when construction on that building was c ompleted. This age will be adjusted to reflect major building expansion or remodeling prior to April 1, 1985, if tha t expenditure was large enough to reduce the age of the facility by two (2) or more years according to the following fo rmula: Where: If the result of this calculation, \"r\" is equal to or greater t han two point zero (2.0), the age of the building in years will be reduced by this num ber, rounded to the nearest wh ole number for rate setting purposes. In no case will the age be less than zero (0). ( ) ii. For rates paid after June 30, 1989, the effective age of a f acility will be further adjusted when the cost of major repairs, replacement, remodeling, or renovation o f a building initiated after April 1, 1985, results in the change in age by at least one (1) year when applied to the form ula in Subsection 630.01.d.i. However, such change will not decrease the effective age of a facility beyond the po int where the increase in t he property rental rate is greater than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the property rental rate \"r\" for a new facility at the time of the proposed rate revision and the property rental rate for whi ch the facility was eligible immediately before the adjustment. The cost used for \"C\" will be adjusted according to costs published by Marshall Swift Valuation Service to reflect current construction costs for average Class D conva lescent hospitals. It is the provider's responsibility to notify the Department and document costs. The Department will a djust the age after documentation of costs. ( ) iii. In the event that new requirements are imposed by state or federal agencies, the Department will reimburse the expenditures directly related to these requiremen ts as an increase in the property rental rate if the expense is in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) per bed. If the cost related to the requirement is less than one hundred dollars ($100) per bed, the Department will, within twe lve (12) months of verification of expenditure, reimburse the Medicaid share of the entire cost of such new req uirements, as a one (1) time payment to the facility. ( ) iv. At no time will the property rental rate paid to a facility be less than the greater of the rate allowable to that facility on December 31, 1988, the rate allowable immed iately following the first opening of a new facility after December 31, 1988, or the rate allowable immediately foll owing the last, if any, age revision after December 31, 1988. However, subsequent to the application of this provision, before any property rental rate increase may be made for current or successor operators, the final settlement amount of any increase in the property rental rate will first be offset by an amount equal to the impact on final settlement of any rate decrease that would have occurred if the provisions of Subsections 630.01.d.iii. and 630.01.d.iv. of the se rules had not been applied. This is intended to allow the postponement of the financial burden to providers of proper ty rental rate decreases and to allow an equal offset of the financial burden to the state of subsequent property rate i ncreases for a current or successor provider. ( ) v. Effective October 1, 1996, for ICF/ID facilities, \"age of fac ility\" will be a revised age that is the lesser of the age established under other provisions of this Se ction or the age that most closely yields the rate allowable to existing facilities as of September 30, 1996, unde r Subsection 630.01 of these rules. This revised age will not increase over time. ( ) 02. Sale of a Facility . In the event of the sale of a facility, or asset of a facilit y, the buyer will receive r = A x E / S x C r = Reduction in the age of the facility in years. A = Age of the building at the time when construction was comple ted. E =Actual expenses for the construction provided that the total co sts must have been incurred within twenty-four (24) months of the completion of th e construction. S = The number of square feet in the building at the end of cons truction. C =The cost of construction for the buildings in the year when con struction was completed according to the schedule in Subsection 630.01.d.ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 631 Page 2010 the property rental rate of Subsection 630.01 of these rules. ( ) 631. ICF/ID: PROPERTY REIMBURSEMENT LIMITATIONS. Beginning October 1, 1996, property costs of an ICF/ID will be reimbursed in accordance with Section 630 of these rules except as follows: ( ) 01. Restrictions . No grandfathered rates or leas e provisions other than lease p rovisions in Section 630 of these rules will apply to ICF/ID facilities. ( ) 02. Home Office and Day Treatment Property Cost s. Distinct parts of buildings containing ICF/ID living units may be used for home office or day treatment purpo ses. Reimbursement for the property costs of such distinct parts may be allowed if these areas are used exclusive ly for home office or day treatment services. The portion of property cost attribut ed to these areas may be reimb ursed as part of home office or day treatment costs without a reduction in the property rental rate. Reimbursement for home office and day treatment property costs will not include costs reimbursed by, or covered by the property ren tal rate. Such costs will only be reimbursed as property cost if the facility clearly included space in excess of space normally used in such facilities. At a minimum to qualify for such reimbursement, a structure would have square feet per licensed bed in excess of the average square feet per licensed bed for other ICF/ID living units within four (4) lice nsable beds. ( ) 03. Leases for Property . Beginning October 1, 1996, ICF/ID facilities with leases will be reimbursed as follows: ( ) a. The property costs related to ICF/ID living units other than co sts for major movable equipment will be paid by a property rental ra te in accordance with Section 63 0 of these rules. ( ) b. Leases for property other than ICF/ID living units will be allo wable based on lease cost to the facility not to exceed a reasonable market rate, subject to oth e r p r o v i s i o n s o f t h i s c h a p t e r , a n d P R M p r i n c i p l e s including principles associated with related party leases. ( ) 632. ICF/ID: SPECIAL RATES. Section 56-117, Idaho Code, provides that the Department may pa y facilities a special rate for care given to consumers who have medical or behavior long-term care needs bey ond the normal scope of facility services. These individuals must have one (1) or more of the following behavior needs; additional personnel for supervision, additional behavior management, or additional psychiatric or ph armacology services. A special rate may also be given to consumers having medical needs that may include indivi duals needing ventilator assistance, certain medical pediatric needs, or individuals requiring nasogastric or intrav enous feeding devices. These medical and behavior needs are not adequately reflect ed in the rates calculated purs uant to the principles set in Section 56-265, Idaho Code. The payment for such specialized care will be in addition to an y payments made in accordance with other provisions of this chapter and will be based on a per diem rate applicable to the incremental additional costs incurred by the facility. Payment for special rates will start with approval by the Department and be and reviewed at least yearly for continued need. The incremental cost to a facility that exceeds the rate for services provided pursuant to the provisions of Section 632 of these rules, will be excluded from the computation of payments or rates under other provisions of Section 56-265, Idaho Code, IDAPA Determinations . A determination to approve or not approve a special rate will b e m a d e o n a consumer-by-consumer basis. No rate will be allowed if reimburs ement for these needs is available from a non- Medicaid source. ( ) 02. Approval . Special rates will not be paid unless prior authorized by the Department. A special rate may be used in the following circumstances: ( ) a. New admissions to a community ICF/ID; ( )b. For individuals currently living in a community ICF/ID when the re has been a significant change in condition not reflected in the current rate; or ( )IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 633 Page 2011 c. The facility has altered services to achieve and maintain compl iance with state licensing or federal certification requirements that have resulted in additional cos t to the facility not reflected in their current rate. ( ) d. For the purpose of this rule, an emergency exists when the faci lity must incur additional behavioral or medical costs to prevent a more restrictive placement. ( ) 03. Reporting . Costs equivalent to payments at the special rate will be remo ved from the cost components subject to limits, and will be reported separately. ( ) 04. Limitations . The reimbursement rate paid will not exceed the provider's ch arges to other participants for similar services. ( ) 633. REIMBURSEMENT PROVISIONS FOR STATE OWNED OR OPERATED ICF/ID FACILITIES. Provisions of these rules do not apply to ICF/ID facilities own ed or operated by the state of Idaho. Reimbursement of such facilities will be governed by the principles set forth in the PRM, with the exception of depreciation. Assets of such facilities need not be depreciated if they have an acquisi tion or historical cost of less than five thousand dollars ($5,000). ( ) 634. (RESERVED) YOUTH EMPOWERMENT SERVICES (YES) HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVIC ES (HCBS) STATE PLAN OPTION (Sections 635-638) 635. YOUTH EMPOWERMENT SERVICES (YES) HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED S ERVICES (HCBS) STATE PLAN OPTION.
