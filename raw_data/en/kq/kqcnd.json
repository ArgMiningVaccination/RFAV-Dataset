If Chinese women are eating Chinese [during pregnancy](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/foods-definitely-avoid-pregnancy_0022296/) and they still give birth to healthy babies, then why can't we? One major culprit that brings all this bad name to Chinese foods is MSG or monosodium glutamate. It is a typical ingredient that is widely used for Indian Chinese preparations. Ajinomoto is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, a nonessential amino acid that is used to enhance flavors. Categorized as excitotoxini [X]Chemical substances that cause overstimulation of neural networks in the brain , MSG is potential enough to harm a growing brain and nervous system. Reports have indicated that MSG and aspartamei [X]An artificial food sweetener , another excitotoxin increasingly found in Chinese foods, readily crosses the placental barrier and over-stimulates the growing brain of [the fetus](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/your-unborn-babys-development_00389566/). The excitatory neurotransmitteri [X]Chemical messengers in the brain that send signals throughout the body to carry out different functions in MSG can even cause autism, schizophreniai [X]A psychological disorder causing delusions, hallucinations, and impaired thinking and emotional processing and cerebral palsyi [X]A neurological disorder affecting a person's muscle control, posture, and balance in the later years of life. The medical circles fear that an early exposure to MSG by these infants can cause a tendency to criminal behavior and episodic violence in the future ( [4](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DK-xWoefVrIC&pg=PA21&dq=msg+in+pregnancy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VWMCVZnvG5WQuQToiID4AQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=msg%20in%20pregnancy&f=false)). Additionally, anecdotal studies have also associated the intake of MSG with obesity and changes in fetal and gestational weight gain. Thus, this ingredient offers no real nourishment. An animal study evaluated the effects of MSG on serum sex hormones in female rats. According to the findings, oral administration of MSG to female rats during the oestrus phase (phase when a fertile) resulted in significantly higher progesterone levels than in the control group. Moreover, as depicted in the graph below, the rats treated with MSG exhibited comparatively lower estrogen levels, suggesting that MSG can affect female reproductive functioning.
