Enrollments, terminations, changes to coverage, address changes, etc. must be presented through your employer to either the SHBP and SEHBP . If you have any questions concerning eligibility provisions, you should contact the Division of Pensions and Benefits, Office of Client Services at (609) 292-7524 or pensions.nj@treas.state.nj.us . State Employees To be eligible for State employee coverage, you must work full-time for the State of New Jersey or be an appointed or an elected officer of the State of New Jersey (this includes employees of a State agency or authority and employees of a State college or university). For State employees, full-time requires 35 hours per week or more if required by contract or resolution.State Part-Time Employees A part-time employee of the State \u2014 or a part-time faculty member at an institution of higher education that participates in the SHBP \u2014 will be eligible for coverage under a SHBP medical plan and the Prescription Drug Plans if the employee is also enrolled in a State-administered retirement system. The employee must pay the full cost of the coverage. A part-time employee will not qualify for employer or State-paid post retirement health care benefits, but may enroll in the SHBP Retired Group at their own expense provided the employee was covered by the SHBP up to the date of retirement. See Fact Sheet #66, Health Benefits Coverage for Part-Time Employees, for details. Local Employees To be eligible for local employer coverage, you must be a full-time employee or an appointed or elected officer receiving a salary from a local employer (county, municipality, county or municipal authority, board of education, etc.) that participates in the SHBP and SEHBP . Each participating local employer defines the minimum hours required for full-time by a resolution filed with the Division of Pensions and Benefits, but it can be no less than 25 hours per week or more if required by contract or resolution. Employment must also be for 12 months per year, except for employees whose usual work schedule is 10 months per year (the standard school year). Enrollment You are not covered until you enroll in the SHBP and SEHBP . You must fill out a Health Benefits Program Application and provide all the information requested. If you do not enroll all eligible members of your family within 60 days of the time you or they first become eligible for coverage, you must wait until the next Open Enrollment period to do so. Open Enrollment periods occur once a year usually during the month of October. Information about the dates of the Open Enrollment period and effective dates for coverage is announced by the Division of Pensions and Benefits. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 8 Eligible Dependents Your eligible dependents are your spouse, civil union partner, or eligible same-sex domestic partner and/or your eligible children (see definitions below). An eligible individual may only enroll in the SHBP and SEHBP as an employee or retiree, or be covered as a dependent. Eligible children may only be covered by one participating subscriber. Spouse - is a person to whom you are legally married. A photocopy of the Marriage Certificate and additional supporting documentation are required for enrollment. Civil Union Partner - is a person of the same sex with whom you have entered into a civil union. A photocopy of the New Jersey Civil Union Certificate or a valid certification from another jurisdiction that recognizes same sex civil unions and additional supporting documentation are required for enrollment. The cost of a civil union partner's coverage may be subject to federal tax (see your employer or Fact Sheet #75, Civil Unions, for details). Domestic Partner - is a same-sex domestic partner, as defined under Chapter 246, P .L. 2003, the Domestic Partnership Act, of any State employee, State retiree, or an eligible employee or retiree of a SHBP participating local public entity if the local governing body adopts a resolution to provide Chapter 246 health benefits. A photocopy of the New Jersey Certificate of Domestic Partnership dated prior to February 19, 2007 or a valid certification from another jurisdiction that recognizes same-sex domestic partners and additional supporting documentation are required for enrollment. The cost of same-sex domestic partner coverage may be subject to federal tax (see your employer or Fact Sheet #71, Benefits Under the Domestic Partnership Act, for details). Children - In compliance with the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), coverage is extended for children until age 26. This includes natural children under age 26 regardless of the child's marital, student, or financial dependency status. A photocopy of the child's birth certificate that includes the covered parent's name is required for enrollment. For a stepchild provide a photocopy of the child's birth certificate showing the spouse/partner's name as a parent and a photocopy of marriage/partnership certificate showing the names of the employee/retiree and spouse/partner. Foster children and children in a guardian-ward relationship under age 26 are also eligible. A photocopy of the child's birth certificate and additional supporting legal documentation are required with enrollment forms for these cases. Documents must attest to the legal guardianship by the covered employee. Dependents of dependents are not covered under the SHBP and SEHBP plan. Coverage for an enrolled child ends on December 31 of the year in which he or she turns age 26 (see the \"COBRA\" section, \"Dependent Children with Disabilities\" and \"Over Age Children until Age 31\" below for continuation of coverage provisions). Dependent Children with Disabilities - If a child is not capable of self-support when he or she reaches age 26 due to mental illness, mental retardation, or a physical disability, he or she may be eligible for a continuance of coverage. To request continued coverage, contact the Office of Client Services at (609) 292-7524 or write to the Division of Pensions and Benefits, Health Benefits Bureau, 50 West State Street, P. O. Box 299, Trenton, New Jersey 08625 for a Continuance for Dependent with Disabilities form. The form and proof of the child's condition must be given to the Division no later than 31 days after the date coverage would normally end. Since coverage for children ends on December 31 of the year they turn 26, you have until January 31 to file the Continuance for Dependent with Disabilities form. Coverage State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 9 for children with disabilities may continue only while (1) you are covered through the SHBP and SEHBP , and (2) the child continues to be disabled, and (3) the child is unmarried, and (4) the child remains dependent on you for support and maintenance and lives with you. You will be contacted periodically to verify that the child remains eligible for continued coverage. See Fact Sheet #51, Continuing Health Benefits Coverage for Over Age Children with Disabilities, for more information. Additional information is repeated later in this guidebook. Over Age Ch ildren until Age 31 - Certain children over age 26 may be eligible for coverage until age 31 under the provisions of Chapter 375, P .L. 2005, as amended by Chapter 38, P .L. 2008. This includes a child by blood or law who is under the age of 31; is unmarried; has no dependent(s) of his or her own; is a resident of New Jersey or is a full-time student at an accredited public or private institution of higher education; and is not provided coverage as a subscriber, insured, enrollee, or covered person under a group or individual health benefits plan, church plan, or entitled to benefits under Medicare. Under Chapter 375, an over age child does not have any choice in the selection of benefits but is enrolled for coverage in exactly the same plan or plans (medical and/or prescription drug) that the covered parent has selected. The covered parent or child is responsible for the entire cost of coverage. There is no provision for dental or vision benefits. Coverage for an enrolled over age child will end when the child no longer meets any one of the eligibility requirements or if the required payment is not received. Coverage will also end when the covered parent's coverage ends. Coverage ends on the first of the month following the event that makes the dependent ineligible or up until the paid through date in the case of non-payment. See Fact Sheet #74, Health Benefits Coverage of Children until Age 31 under Chapter 375, for details. Supporting Documentation Required for the Enrollment of Dependents The SHBP and SEHBP are required to ensure that only eligible employees and retirees, and their dependents, are receiving health care coverage under the program. Employees or retirees who enroll dependents for coverage (spouses, civil union partners, domestic partners, children, disabled dependents, and over age children continuing coverage) must submit supporting documentation in addition to the enrollment application. Audit of Dependent Coverage The Division of Pensions and Benefits periodically performs audits using a random sample of members to determine if enrolled dependents are eligible under plan provisions. Proof of dependency such as a marriage, civil union, or birth certificates, or tax returns are required. Coverage for ineligible dependents will be terminated. Failure to respond to the audit will result in the termination of ALL coverage and may include financial restitution for claims paid. Members who are found to have intentionally enrolled an ineligible person for coverage will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Multiple Coverage under the SHBP/SEHBP is Prohibited State statute specifically prohibits two members who are each enrolled in SHBP/SEHBP plans from covering each other. Therefore, an eligible individual may only enroll in the SHBP/SEHBP as an employee or retiree, or be covered as a dependent. Eligible children may only be covered by one participating subscriber. For example, a husband and wife both have coverage based on their employment and have children State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 10 eligible for coverage. One may choose Family coverage, making the spouse and children the dependents and ineligible for any other SHBP/SEHBP coverage; or one may choose Single coverage and the spouse may choose Parent and Child(ren) coverage. Medicare Coverage While Employed In general, it is not necessary for a Medicare- eligible employee, spouse, civil union partner, eligible same-sex domestic partner, or dependent child(ren) to be covered by Medicare while the employee remains actively at work. However, if you or your dependents become eligible for Medicare due to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) you and/or your dependents must enroll in Medicare Parts A and B even though you are actively at work. Medicare Eligibility by Reasons of End Stage Renal Disease A member usually becomes eligible for Medicare at age 65 or upon receiving Social Security Disability benefits for two years. A member who is not eligible for Medicare because of age or disability may qualify because of treatment for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). When a person is eligible for Medicare due to ESRD, Medicare is the secondary payer when: Th e individual has group health coverage of their own or through a family member (including a spouse, civil union partner, or domestic partner). Th e group health coverage is from either a current employer or a former employer. The employer may be of any size (not limited to employers with more than 20 employees). The rules described above, known as the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) rules, are federal regulations that determine whether Medicare pays first or second to the group health plan. These rules have changed over time. As of January 1, 2000, where the member becomes eligible for Medicare solely on the basis of ESRD, the Medicare eligibility can be segmented into three parts: An in itial three-month waiting period; A \" coordination of benefits\" period; and A pe riod where Medicare is primary. Three-month Waiting Period Once a person has begun a regular course of renal dialysis for treatment of ESRD, there is a three- month waiting period before the individual becomes entitled to Medicare Parts A and B benefits. During the initial three-month period, the group health plan is primary. Coordination of Benefits Period During the \"coordination of benefits\" period, Medicare is secondary to the group health plan coverage. Claims are processed first under the health plan. Medicare considers the claims as a secondary carrier. For members who became eligible for Medicare due solely to ESRD after 1996, the coordination of benefits period is 30 months. When Medicare is Primary After the coordination of benefits period ends, Medicare is considered the primary payer and the group health plan is secondary. For any retiree who is enrolled in the Aetna Medicare Plan (HMO) (after becoming entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B), the Aetna Medicare Plan (HMO) will be the primary insurance plan. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 11 Retiree Eligibility Eligibility for coverage is determined by the State Health Benefits Program (SHBP) and School Employees' Health Benefits Program (SEHBP). Enrollments, terminations, changes to coverage, address changes, etc. must be presented to the SHBP/SEHBP directly. If you have any questions concerning eligibility provisions, you should contact the Division of Pensions and Benefits, Office of Client Services at (609) 292-7524 or pensions.nj@treas.state.nj.us . Fu ll-time State employees, employees of State colleges/universities, autonomous State agencies and commissions, or local employees who were covered by, or eligible for, the SHBP at the time of retirement and begin receiving a monthly retirement benefit or lifetime annuity immediately following termination of employment. Pa rt-time State employees and part-time faculty at institutions of higher education that participate in the SHBP if enrolled in the SHBP at the time of retirement. Pa rticipants in the Alternate Benefit Program (ABP) eligible for the SHBP who retire with at least 25 years of credited ABP service or those who are on a long term disability and begin receiving a monthly lifetime annuity immediately following termination of employment. Cer tain local policemen or firemen with 25 years or more of service credit in the retirement system or retiring on a disability retirement if the employer does not provide any payment or compensation toward the cost of the retiree's health benefits. A qualified retiree may enroll at the time of retirement or when he or she becomes eligible for Medicare. See Fact Sheet #47 , Retired Health Benefits Coverage under Chapter 330 , for more information. Su rviving spouses, civil union partners, eligible same-sex domestic partners, and children of Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS) members or State Police Retirement System (SPRS) members killed in the line of duty. The following individuals will be offered SEHBP Retired Group coverage for themselves and their eligible dependents: Fu ll-time members of the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) and school board or county college employees enrolled in the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) who retire with less than 25 years of service credit from an employer that participates in the SEHBP . Fu ll-time members of the TPAF and school board or county college employees enrolled in the PERS who retire with 25 years or more of service credit in one or more State or locally-administered retirement systems or who retire on a disability retirement, even if their employer did not cover its employees under the SEHBP . This includes those who elect to defer retirement with 25 or more years of service credit in one or more State or locally-administered retirement systems (see \"Aggregate of Pension Membership Service Credit\".) Fu ll-time members of the TPAF or PERS who retire from a board of education, vocational/ technical school, or special services commission; maintain participation in the health benefits plan of their former employer; and are eligible for and enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. A qualified retiree may enroll at retirement or when he or she becomes eligible for Medicare. Pa rticipants in the Alternate Benefit Program (ABP) eligible for the SEHBP who retire with at least 25 years of credited ABP State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 12 service or those who are on a long term disability and begin receiving a monthly lifetime annuity immediately following termination of employment. Pa rt-time faculty at institutions of higher education that participate in the SEHBP if enrolled in the SEHBP at the time of retirement. Eligibility for SHBP or SEHBP membership for the individuals listed in this section is contingent upon meeting two conditions: 1. Yo u must be immediately eligible for a retirement allowance from a State- or locally-administered retirement system (except certain employees retiring from a school board or community college); and 2. Yo u were a full-time employee and eligible for employer-paid medical coverage immediately preceding the effective date of your retirement (if you are an employee retiring from a school board or community college under a deferred retirement with 25 or more years of service, you must have been eligible at the time you terminated your employment), or a part-time State employee or part-time faculty member who is enrolled in the SHBP or SEHBP immediately preceding the effective date of your retirement. This means that if you allow your active coverage to lapse (i.e. because of a leave of absence, reduction in hours, or termination of employment) prior to your retirement or you defer your retirement for any length of time after leaving employment; you will lose your eligibility for Retired Group health coverage. (This does not include former full-time employees enrolled in TPAF and PERS board of education or county college who retire with 25 or more years of service). Note Note: If you continue group coverage through COBRA (see the \"COBRA\" section)\u2014 or as a dependent under other coverage through a public employer \u2014 until your retirement becomes effective, you will be eligible for retired coverage under the SHBP or SEHBP . Otherwise qualified employees whose coverage is terminated prior to retirement but who are later approved for a disability retirement will be eligible for Retired Group coverage beginning on the employee's retirement date. If the approval of the disability retirement is delayed, coverage shall not be retroactive for more than one year.Aggregate of Pension Membership Service Credit Upon retirement, a full-time State employee, board of education, or county college employee who has 25 years or more of service credit, is eligible for State-paid health benefits under the SHBP or SEHBP; subject to the applicable retiree contribution, if any. A full-time employee of a local government who has 25 years or more of service credit whose employer participates in the SHBP and has chosen to provide post-retirement medical coverage to its retirees is eligible for employer-paid health benefits under the SHBP . A retiree eligible for the SHBP or SEHBP may receive this benefit if the 25 years of service credit is from one or more State or locally-administered retirement systems and the time credited is nonconcurrent. For PERS or TPAF members, Out-of-State Service, U.S. Government Service, or service with a bi-state or multi-state agency, requested for purchase after November 1, 2008, cannot be used to qualify for any State-paid or employer-paid health benefits in retirement. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 13 Eligible Dependents of Retirees Dependent eligibility rules for Retired Group coverage are the same as for Active Group coverage except for Chapter 334 domestic partners (described below) and the Medicare requirements. Chapter 334, P.L. 2005, provides that retirees from local entities (municipalities, counties, boards of education, and county colleges) whose employers do not participate in the in SHBP or SEHBP , but who become eligible for SHBP or SEHBP coverage at retirement, may also enroll a registered same-sex domestic partner as a covered dependent provided that the former employer's plan includes domestic partner coverage for employees. Multiple Coverage under the SHBP/SEHBP is Prohibited State statute specifically prohibits two members who are each enrolled in SHBP/SEHBP plans from covering each other. Therefore, an eligible individual may only enroll in the SHBP/SEHBP as an employee or retiree, or be covered as a dependent. Eligible children may only be covered by one participating subscriber. For example, a husband and wife both have coverage based on their employment and have children eligible for coverage. One may choose Family coverage, making the spouse and children the dependents and ineligible for any other SHBP/SEHBP coverage; or one may choose Single coverage and the spouse may choose Parent and Child(ren) coverage. Enrolling in Retired Group Coverage The Health Benefits Bureau is notified when you file an application for retirement with the Division of Pensions and Benefits. If eligible, you will receive a letter inviting you to enroll in Retired Group coverage. Early filing for retirement is recommended to prevent any lapse of coverage or delay of eligibility. If you do not submit a Retired Coverage Enrollment Application at the time of retirement, you will not generally be permitted to enroll for coverage at a later date. See Fact Sheet #11, Enrolling for Health Benefits Coverage When You Retire, for more information. If you believe you are eligible for Retired Group coverage and do not receive an offering letter by the date of your retirement, please contact the Division of Pensions and Benefits, Office of Client Services at (609) 292-7524 or send an e-mail to: pensions.nj@treas.state.nj.us .Additional restrictions and/or requirements may apply when enrolling for Retired Group coverage. Be sure to carefully read the \"Retiree Enrollment\" section of the Summary Program Description . Medicare Parts A and B IMPORTANT: A Retired Group member and/ or dependent spouse, civil union partner, eligible same-sex domestic partner, or child who is eligible for Medicare coverage by reason of age or disability must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance) to enroll or remain in SHBP or SEHBP Retired Group coverage. You will be required to submit documented evidence of enrollment in Medicare Part A and Part B when you or your dependent becomes eligible for that coverage. Acceptable documentation includes a photocopy of the Medicare card showing both Part A and Part B enrollment, or a letter from Medicare indicating the effective dates of both Part A and Part B coverage. Send your evidence of enrollment to the Health Benefits Bureau, Division of Pensions and Benefits, PO Box 299, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0299 or fax it to (609) 341-3407. If you do not submit State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 14 evidence of Medicare coverage under both Part A and Part B, you and/or your dependents will be terminated from coverage. Upon submission of proof of full Medicare coverage, your Retired Group coverage will be reinstated by the Health Benefits Bureau on a prospective basis. Medicare Part D If you are enrolled in the Retired Group of the SHBP/SEHBP and eligible for Medicare, you will be automatically enrolled in Medicare Part D and the Medicare Prescription Plan. Important: If you decide not to be enrolled in the Medicare Prescription Plan, you will lose your prescription drug benefits provided by the SEHBP/SHBP. However, your medical benefits will continue. In order to waive the Medicare Prescription Plan, you must enroll in another Medicare Part D plan. To request that you not be enrolled, you must submit a Retired Change of Status Application waiving your prescription drug coverage.Medicare Eligibility A member may be eligible for Medicare for the following reasons: Medicare Eligibility by Reason of Turning Age 65 A member (the retiree or covered spouse/ partner) is considered to be eligible for Medicare by reason of age from the first day of the month during which he or she reaches age 65. However, if he or she is born on the first day of a month, he or she is considered to be eligible for Medicare from the first day of the month which is immediately prior to his/her 65th birthday. The retired group health plan is not considered a secondary plan under the Aetna Medicare Advantage plans. The Aetna Medicare Advantage plan does not coordinate with original Medicare. For more information on your Aetna Medicare Advantage HMO or PPO ESA plans, please refer to the plan documents that are sent to you as a member directly or the high level information located on www.aetnastatenj.com .Medicare Eligibility by Reason of Disability A member (the retiree or covered spouse/partner or dependent) who is under age 65 is considered to be eligible for Medicare by reason of disability if they have been receiving Social Security Disability benefits or 24 months. Medicare Eligibility by Reasons of End Stage Renal Disease A member usually becomes eligible for Medicare at age 65 or upon receiving Social Security Disability benefits for two years. A member (the retiree or covered spouse/partner or dependent) who is not eligible for Medicare because of age or disability may qualify because of treatment for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). When a person is eligible for Medicare due to ESRD, Medicare is the secondary payer when: Th e individual has group health coverage of their own or through a family member (including a spouse/partner). Th e group health coverage is from either a current employer or a former employer. The employer may be of any size (not limited to employers with more than 20 employees). State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 15 The rules listed above, known as the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) rules are federal regulations that determine whether Medicare pays first or second to the group health plan. These rules have changed over time. As of January 1, 2000, where the member becomes eligible for Medicare solely on the basis of ESRD, the Medicare eligibility can be segmented into three parts: (1) an initial three-month waiting period; (2) a \"coordination of benefits\" period; and (3) a period where Medicare is primary. Three-month waiting period Once a person has begun a regular course of renal dialysis for treatment of ESRD, there is a three-month waiting period before the individual becomes entitled to Medicare Parts A and B benefits. During the initial three-month period, the group health plan is primary. Coordination of benefits period During the \"coordination of benefits\" period, Medicare is secondary to the group health plan coverage only if you have ESRD prior to becoming Medicare eligible due to age. If you have ESRD and obtained Medicare prior to being declared as having ESRD, you will remain in the Aetna Medicare Advantage plan you are enrolled in. Should you have obtained Medicare due to ESRD, then during you coordination period you will be placed in a corresponding plan that coordinates with Original Medicare. When that coordination period ends, you will be placed back on your respective Medicare Advantage plan. Claims are processed first under the health plan. Medicare considers the claims as a secondary carrier. For members who became eligible for Medicare due solely to ESRD, the coordination of benefits period is 30 months. How to File a Claim If You Are Eligible for Medicare For all Aetna Medicare Plan (HMO) members, claims are submitted directly to Aetna, not to Medicare. Your provider will bill Aetna directly, using the claims address on the back of your Aetna Medicare Plan (HMO) ID card. Members of the Aetna Medicare Plan (HMO) will receive one Explanation of Benefits from Aetna. Members do not need to coordinate with Medicare or submit any additional information. However, if a claim is submitted to Medicare in error, Medicare will deny the claim. In this case, the member can submit this claim information to Aetna (using the claims address on the back of the Aetna Medicare Plan (HMO) ID card) for processing under the Aetna Medicare Plan (HMO). Any questions can be directed to Aetna Medicare Plan (HMO) Member Services at 1-866-234-3129 . For all other Aetna members, follow the procedure listed below that applies to you when filing your claim. New Jersey Physicians or Providers: Yo u should provide the physician or provider with your identification number. This number is indicated on the Medicare Request for Payment (claim form) under \"Other Health Insurance.\" Th e physician or provider will then submit the Medicare Request for Payment to the Medicare Part B carrier. Af ter Medicare has taken action, you will receive an Explanation of Benefits statement from Medicare. If t he remarks section of the Explanation of Benefits contains the following statement, you need not take any action: \"This information has been forwarded to Aetna for their consideration in processing supplementary coverage benefits.\" State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 16 If the statement shown above does not appear on the Explanation of Benefits , please attach a completed Aetna claim form, to a copy of the itemized bill from your physician or provider along with a copy of the Medicare Explanation of Benefits, and submit it to Aetna using the address on the back of your ID card. Out-Of-State Physicians or Providers: The Medicare Request for Payment form s hould be submitted to the Medicare Part B carrier in the area where services were performed. Call your local Social Security office for information. Wh en you receive your Explanation of Benefits from Medicare please attach a completed Aetna claim form, attach a copy of the itemized bill from your physician or provider and submit it to Aetna using the address on the back of your ID card. Medicare Estimation If you or your covered dependent do not enroll in Medicare Parts A and/or B coverage when you become eligible, you may pay more of your health care expenses. Aetna will process your claims as follows: Aetna will estimate the Medicare benefits t hat would have been available to you, if enrolled in Medicare Part A and/or Part B. When Aetna receives a claim that would be covered by Medicare Parts A and/or B, we will estimate what Medicare Parts A and/or B would pay for your medical services if you were enrolled in Medicare Parts A and/or B. Ae tna will calculate your benefits under this plan after taking into consideration the estimated Medicare payments to your providers. Yo u will be responsible for the amount that Aetna estimates Medicare would have paid, in addition to coinsurance, deductibles and/or copayments.

Under certain conditions, you may be able to enroll online. Ca ll or visit your local office. Locations listed in your telephone directory.COBRA Coverage Continuing Coverage When It Would Normally End The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) is a federally regulated law that gives employees and their eligible dependents the opportunity to remain in their employer's group coverage when they would otherwise lose coverage because of certain qualifying events. COBRA coverage is available for limited time periods (see \"Duration of COBRA Coverage\", and the member must pay the full cost of the coverage plus an administrative fee. Leave taken under the federal and/or State Family Leave Act is not subtracted from your COBRA eligibility period. Under COBRA, you may elect to enroll in any or all of the coverages you had as an active employee or dependent (health, prescription, dental, and vision), and you may change your health or dental plan when enrolling in COBRA. You may also elect to cover the same dependents that you covered while an active employee, or delete dependents from coverage \u2014 however, you cannot add dependents who were not covered while an employee except during the annual Open State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 17 Enrollment period (see below) or unless a \"qualifying event\" (marriage, birth or adoption of a child, etc.) occurs within 60 days of the COBRA event. Open Enrollment - COBRA enrollees have the same rights to coverage at Open Enrollment as are available to active employees. This means that you or a dependent who elected to enroll under COBRA are able to enroll, if eligible, in any medical, dental, or prescription drug coverage during the Annual Open Enrollment Period regardless of whether you elected to enroll for the coverage when you went into COBRA. This affords a COBRA enrollee the same opportunity to enroll for benefits during the Annual Open Enrollment Period as an active employee. However, any time of non- participation in the benefit is counted toward your maximum COBRA coverage period. If the State Health Benefits Commission make changes to any benefit plan available to active employees and/or retirees, those changes apply equally to COBRA participants.COBRA Events Continuation of group coverage under COBRA is available if you or any of your covered dependents would otherwise lose coverage as a result of any of the following events: Te rmination of employment (except for gross misconduct). De ath of the member. Re duction in work hours. Le ave of absence. Di vorce, legal separation, dissolution of civil union or same-sex domestic partnership (makes spouse or partner ineligible for further dependent coverage). Lo ss of a dependent child's eligibility through the attainment of age 26. Th e employee elects Medicare as primary coverage. (Federal law requires active employees to terminate their employer's health coverage if they want Medicare as their primary coverage.)Note Employees who at retirement are eligible to enroll for coverage in the Retired Group of the SHBP and SEHBP cannot enroll for health benefits coverage under COBRA. The occurrence of the COBRA event must be the reason for the loss of coverage for you or your dependent to be able to take advantage of the provisions of the law. If there is no coverage in effect at the time of the event, there can be no continuation of coverage under COBRA. DURATION OF COBRA COVERAGE COBRA coverage may be purchased for up to 18 months if you or your dependents become eligible because of termination of employment, a reduction in hours, or a leave of absence. Coverage may be extended up to 11 additional months, for a total of 29 months, if you have a Social Security Administration approved disability (under Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act) for a condition that existed when you enrolled in COBRA or began within State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 18 the first 60 days of COBRA coverage. Coverage will cease either at the end of your COBRA eligibility or when you obtain Medicare coverage, whichever comes first. COBRA coverage may be purchased by a dependent for up to 36 months if he or she becomes eligible because of your death, divorce, dissolution of a civil union or domestic partnership, or a child becomes ineligible upon attaining age 26, or because you elected Medicare as your primary coverage. If a second qualifying event occurs during the 18-month period following the date of any employee's termination or reduction in hours, the beneficiary of that second qualifying event will be entitled to a total of 36 months of continued coverage. The period will be measured from the date of the loss of coverage caused by the first qualifying event. Employer Responsibilities under COBRA The COBRA law requires employers to: No tify you and your dependents of the COBRA provisions within 90 days of when you and your dependents are first enrolled; No tify you, your spouse, civil union partner, or eligible same-sex domestic partner, and your children of the right to purchase continued coverage within 14 days of receiving notice that there has been a COBRA qualifying event that causes a loss of coverage; Se nd the COBRA Notification Letter and a COBRA Application within 14 days of receiving notice that a COBRA qualifying event has occurred; No tify the Health Benefits Bureau of the Division of Pensions and Benefits within 30 days of the loss of an employee's coverage; and Main tain records documenting their compliance with the COBRA law. Employee Responsibilities Under COBRA The law requires that you and your dependents: No tify your employer (if you are retired, you must notify the Health Benefits Bureau of the Division of Pensions and Benefits) that a divorce, legal separation, dissolution of a civil union or domestic partnership, or death has occurred, or that your child has reached age 26 \u2014 notification must be given within 60 days of the date the event occurred; Fi le a COBRA Application within 60 days of the loss of coverage or the date of the COBRA No tice provided by your employer, whichever is later; Pa y the required monthly premiums in a timely manner; and Pa y premiums, when billed, retroactive to the date of group coverage termination. Failure to Elect COBRA Coverage In considering whether to elect continuation of coverage under COBRA, an eligible employee, retiree, or dependent (also known as a \"qualified beneficiary\" under COBRA law) should take into account that a failure to continue group health coverage will affect future rights under federal law. First, you can lose the right to avoid having pre-existing condition exclusions applied to you by other group health plans if you have more than a 63-day gap in health coverage. The election of continuation of coverage under COBRA may help you to bridge such a gap. (If, after enrolling in COBRA you obtain new coverage which has a pre-existing condition clause, you may continue your COBRA enrollment to cover the condition excluded by the pre-existing condition clause.) Second, you will lose the guaranteed right to purchase individual health insurance policies that do not impose pre-existing condition State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 19 exclusions if you do not continue coverage under COBRA for the maximum time available to you. Finally, you should take into account that you have special enrollment rights under federal law. You have the right to request special enrollment in another group health plan for which you are otherwise eligible (such as a plan sponsored by your spouse's employer) within 30 days of the date your group coverage ends. You will also have the same special enrollment right at the end of the COBRA coverage period if you get the continuation of coverage under COBRA for the maximum time available to you. Termination of COBRA Coverage Your COBRA coverage will end when any of the following situations occur: Your eligibility period expires; Yo u fail to pay your premiums in a timely manner; Af ter the COBRA event, you become covered under another group insurance program (unless a pre-existing clause applies); You voluntarily cancel your coverage; Yo ur employer drops out of the SHBP and SEHBP;You become eligible for Medicare after you elect COBRA coverage. (This affects health insurance only, not dental, prescription, or vision coverage.) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires group health plans to implement several provisions contained within the law or notify its membership each plan year of any provisions from which they may file an exemption. Self-funded, non-federal government plans may elect certain exemptions from compliance with HIPAA provisions on a year- to-year basis. Certification of Coverage HIPAA rules state that if a person was previously covered under another group health plan, that coverage period will be credited toward any pre-existing condition limitation period for the new plan. Credit under this plan includes any prior group plan that was in effect 90 days prior to the individual's effective date under the new plan. A Certification of Coverage form, which verifies your group health plan enrollment and termination dates, is available through your payroll or human resources office, should you terminate your coverage. HIPAA Privacy The State Health Benefits Program and School Employees' Health Benefits Program make every effort to safeguard the health information of its members and comply with the privacy provisions of HIPAA, which requires that health plans maintain the privacy of any personal information relating to its members' physical or mental health. Termination for Cause Your coverage and the coverage of your dependents under this Plan may be terminated for cause. \"For cause\" is defined as: Un tenable relationship: After reasonable efforts, Aetna and/or the Plan's participating providers are unable to establish and maintain a satisfactory provider-patient relationship with the member, or the member repeatedly acts in a manner which is verbally or physically abusive. Fai lure to make copayments: The member fails to make required copayments or any other payment which he or she is required to pay. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 20 Misuse of identification card: T he member permits any person to use his or her Aetna identification card. Fu rnishing incorrect or incomplete information: The member willfully furnishes incorrect or incomplete information in a statement made for the purpose of enrolling in or obtaining benefits from the Plan. No n-compliance with your physician's plan of treatment: You have the right to refuse any drugs, treatment or other procedure offered to you by a participating provider, and to be informed by your physician of the medical consequences of your refusal of any drugs, treatment or procedure. Aetna and your Primary Care Physician will make every effort to arrange a professionally acceptable alternative treatment. However, if you still refuse the recommended plan of treatment, the Plan will not be responsible for the costs of further treatment for that condition, and you will be so notified. You may use the appeal process to have your case reviewed. Mi sconduct: The member abuses the system, including, but not limited to, theft, fraud, damage to the property of a participating provider or forgery of drug prescriptions. No benefits, other than for emergency care, will be provided to you and your family members as of 31 days after the date notice of termination is given to you by the State Health Benefits Commission. Any termination for cause is subject to review in accordance with the Plan's appeal process. If an appeal to Aetna is denied, you may appeal to the State Health Benefits Commission. If the Commission governing your coverage upholds the termination, you must change your coverage by completing a Health Benefits Program Application to enroll in another health plan. Benefits under this Plan end when your application is received and processed by the Division of Pensions and Benefits, Health Benefits Bureau. If the Commission overrules the decision to terminate, full coverage will be restored retroactively.Health Care Fraud Health care fraud is an intentional deception or misrepresentation that results in an unauthorized benefit to a member or to some other person. Any individual who willfully and knowingly engages in an activity intended to defraud the SHBP will face disciplinary action that could include termination of employment and may result in prosecution. Any member who receives monies fraudulently from a health plan will be required to fully reimburse the plan. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 21 How the Plan Works State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 22How the Plan Works Plan participants have access to a network of participating Primary Care Physicians (PCPs), specialists and hospitals that meet Aetna's requirements for quality and service. These providers are independent physicians and facilities that are monitored for quality of care, patient satisfaction, cost-effectiveness of treatment, office standards and ongoing training. The Aetna HMO's cover in-network benefits only except for in an emergency situation. Each participant in the Plan must select a Primary Care Physician (PCP) when they enroll. Your PCP serves as your guide to care in today's complex medical system and will help you access appropriate care. The Primary Care Physician As a participant in the Plan, you will become a partner with your participating PCP in preventive medicine. You will need to elect a Primary Care Physician upon entering the Aetna HMO plan. Consult your PCP whenever you have questions about your health. Your PCP will provide your primary care and, when medically necessary, your PCP will refer you to other doctors or facilities for treatment. The referral is important because it is how your PCP arranges for you to receive necessary, appropriate care and follow-up treatment. Except for PCP , direct access and emergency services, you must have a prior written or electronic referral from your PCP to receive coverage for all services and any necessary follow-up treatment. Participating specialists are required to send reports back to your PCP to keep your PCP informed of any treatment plans ordered by the specialist. Note If you determine there is a need to change your Primary Care Physician to another PCP , please contact the Aetna Member Services phone number on the back of your ID card and alert them to your required change. If you do not alert Aetna to the change in your primary care physician, you may be responsible for additional charges. Primary and Preventive Care Your PCP can provide preventive care and treat you for illnesses and injuries. The Plan covers routine physical exams, well-baby care, immunizations and allergy shots provided by your PCP . You may also obtain routine vision exams and gynecological exams from participating providers without a referral from your PCP . You are responsible for the copayment shown in the \"Schedule of Benefits.\" Specialty and Facility Care Your PCP may refer you to a specialist or facility for treatment or for covered preventive care services, when medically necessary. Except for those benefits described in this booklet as direct access benefits and emergency care, you must have a prior written or electronic referral from your PCP in order to receive coverage for any services the specialist or facility provides. When your PCP refers you to a participating specialist or facility for covered services, you will be responsible for the copayment shown in the \"Schedule of Benefits.\" For inpatient expenses and surgery performed in an outpatient facility, you must pay a portion of the covered expenses you incur. Your share of covered expenses is called your coinsurance. Once your copayments and coinsurance amounts reach the annual out-of-pocket maximum, the Plan pays 100% of your covered expenses for the remainder of that calendar year. To avoid costly and unnecessary bills, follow these steps: State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 23 Consult your PCP first when you need r outine medical care. If your PCP deems it medically necessary, you will get a written or electronic referral to a participating specialist or facility. Referrals are valid for 90 days, as long as you remain an eligible participant in the Plan. For direct access benefits, you may contact the participating provider directly, without a referral. Cer tain services require both a referral from your PCP and prior authorization from Aetna. Your PCP is responsible for obtaining authorization from Aetna for in-network covered services. Re view the referral with your PCP . Understand what specialist services are being recommended and why. Pre sent the referral to the participating provider. Except for direct access benefits, any additional treatments or tests that are covered benefits require another referral from your PCP . The referral is necessary to have these services approved for payment. Without the referral, you are responsible for payment for these services. If i t is not an emergency and you go to a doctor or facility without your PCP's prior written or electronic referral, you must pay the bill yourself. Yo ur PCP may refer you to a nonparticipating provider for covered services that are not available within the network. Services from nonparticipating providers require prior approval by Aetna in addition to a special nonparticipating referral from your PCP . When properly authorized, these services are covered after the applicable copayment. REMEMBER : You cannot request referrals after you visit a specialist or hospital. Therefore, to receive maximum coverage, you need to contact your PCP and get authorization from Aetna (when applicable) before seeking specialty or hospital care. Some PCPs are affiliated with integrated delivery systems (IDS) or other provider groups (such as Independent Practice Associations and Physician-Hospital Associations). If your PCP participates in such an arrangement, you will usually be referred to specialists and hospitals within that system or group. However, if your medical needs extend beyond the scope of the affiliated providers, you may ask to have services provided by non-affiliated physicians or facilities. Services provided by non-affiliated providers may require prior authorization from Aetna and/or the IDS or other provider group. Check with your PCP or call the Member Services number that appears on your ID card to find out if prior authorization is necessary.Provider Information You may obtain, without charge, a listing of network providers from your Plan Administrator, or by calling the toll-free Member Services number on your ID card. It is easy to obtain information about providers in Aetna's network using the Internet. With DocFind \u00ae you can conduct an online search for participating doctors, hospitals and other providers. To use DocFind, go to AetnaStateNJ.com and click on \"Find a Doctor\". Select the appropriate provider category and follow the instructions provided to select a provider based on specialty, geographic location and/or hospital affiliation. Your ID Card When you join the Plan, you and each enrolled member of your family receive a member ID card. Your ID card lists the telephone number of the Aetna PCP you have chosen. If you change your PCP , you will automatically receive a new card displaying the change. Always carry your ID card with you. It identifies you as a Plan participant when you receive services from participating providers or when you receive emergency services at nonparticipating facilities. If your card is lost or stolen, please notify Aetna immediately.

State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 108 In Case of Medical Emergency State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 109In Case of Medical Emergency Guidelines If you need emergency care, you are covered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, anywhere in the world. Aetna has adopted the following definition of an emergency medical condition from the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997: An emergency medical condition is a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson (including the parent of a minor child or the guardian of a disabled individual), who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in: Pla cing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy; Se rious impairment to bodily function; or Se rious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. Some examples of emergencies are: -He art attack or infants); -Unc ontrolled or severe bleeding; -Lo ss of consciousness. Whether you are in or out of Aetna's service area, we ask that you follow the guidelines below when you believe you may need emergency care. 1. Ca ll your PCP first, if possible. Your PCP is required to provide urgent care and emergency coverage 24 hours a day, including weekends and holidays. However, if a delay would be detrimental to your health, seek the nearest emergency facility, or dial 911 or your local emergency response service. 2. Af ter assessing and stabilizing your condition, the emergency facility should contact your PCP so they can assist the treating physician by supplying information about your medical history. 3. If y ou are admitted to an inpatient facility, notify your PCP as soon as reasonably possible. The emergency room copayment will be waived if you are admitted to the hospital. 4. Al l follow-up care must be coordinated by your PCP. 5. If y ou go to an emergency facility for treatment that Aetna determines is non-emergency in nature, you will be responsible for the bill. The Plan does not cover non-emergency use of the emergency room. Follow-Up Care After Emergencies All follow-up care should be coordinated by your PCP . You must have a referral from your PCP and approval from Aetna to receive follow-up care from a nonparticipating provider. Whether you were treated inside or outside your Aetna service area, you must obtain a referral before any follow-up care can be covered. Suture removal, cast removal, X-rays, and clinic and emergency room revisits are some examples of follow-up care. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 110 Urgent Care Treatment that you obtain outside of your service area for an urgent medical condition is covered if: Th e service is a covered benefit; Yo u could not reasonably have anticipated the need for the care prior to leaving the network service area; and A del ay in receiving care until you could return and obtain care from a participating network provider would have caused serious deterioration in your health. Urgent care from participating providers within your service area is covered if your PCP is not reasonably available to provide services to you. You should first seek care through your PCP . Referrals to participating urgent care providers are not required, but the care must be urgent, non-preventive or non-routine. Some examples of urgent by your PCP is covered, subject to the office visit copayment. Other follow-up care by participating specialists is fully covered with a prior written or electronic referral from your PCP , subject to the specialist copay shown in the \"Schedule of Benefits.\" What to Do Outside Your Aetna Service Area Plan participants who are traveling outside the service area, or students who are away at school, are covered for emergency care and treatment of urgent medical conditions. Urgent care may be obtained from a private practice physician, a walk-in clinic, or an urgent care center. An urgent medical condition that occurs outside your Aetna service area can be treated in any of the above settings. You should call your PCP before receiving treatment from a non-participating urgent care provider. If, after reviewing information submitted to Aetna by the provider(s) who supplied your care, the nature of the urgent or emergency problem does not clearly qualify for coverage, it may be necessary to provide additional information. Aetna will send you an Emergency Room Notification Report or a customer service professional (CSP) can take this information over the telephone. If Your Child Does Not Reside With You If your child does not live with you, but they live in another Aetna service area, they can choose a PCP in that service area. Members who reside outside of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, Delaware and Florida will be placed in the Aetna Select network. Your child's coverage under the Plan will then be the same as yours. A child covered by the Plan who does not reside in where the Aetna Network is available, can choose a PCP in your network and return to your network service area for care. In the event of an emergency that occurs outside of your service area, out-of-area dependents should obtain necessary care as described under \"In Case of Emergency,\" then contact their PCP to coordinate follow-up care.

This reminder is in the form of a newsletter provided by Merck & Co., Inc. Preventive Reminders Influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia and colorectal cancer are serious health threats. Each year, Aetna sends a preventive health care reminder to households with a member who is particularly vulnerable to one or more of these diseases - adults who are age 50 and older, children ages 6-23 months, and people over age 2 with a chronic condition such as asthma, congestive heart failure, or chronic renal failure.The reminder stresses the importance of receiving vaccines to prevent influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia, as well as completing appropriate colorectal cancer screening.

The Numbers To Know mailer is sent to Plan participants who are targeted by selected diagnoses within specific age groups. The mailer includes helpful tips on blood pressure and cholesterol management; desirable goals for blood pressure and cholesterol; and a tri-fold wallet card to track blood pressure, total cholesterol, medication and dosage information.

State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 115 Transplant Expenses Once it has been determined that you or one of your dependents may require an organ transplant, you, or your physician should call the Aetna precertification department to discuss coordination of your transplant care. Aetna will coordinate all transplant services. In addition, you must follow any precertification requirements found in the Certification for Admissions sections of this document. Organ means solid organ; hemotopoietic stem cell; bone marrow; tissue and CAR-T and T-Cell receptor therapy for FDA approved treatments. Benefits may vary if an Institute of Excellence (IOE) facility or non-IOE is used. In addition, some expenses listed below are payable only within the IOE network. The IOE facility must be specifically approved and designated by Aetna to perform the procedure you require. A transplant will be covered as preferred care only if performed in a facility that has been designated as an IOE facility for the type of transplant in question. Any treatment or service related to transplants that is provided by a facility that is not specified as an IOE network facility, even if the facility is considered as a preferred facility for other types of services, will not be covered. Please read each section carefully.If there is no IOE facility for your transplant type in your network, the National Medical Excellence Program\u00ae (NME) will arrange for and coordinate your care at an IOE facility in another one of our networks. If you don't get your transplant services at the IOE facility we designate, your cost share will be higher. The amount you will pay for covered transplant services is determined by where you get transplant services. You can get transplant services from: An Institutes of Excellence (IOE) facility we designate to perform the transplant you need A N on-IOE facility Your cost share will be lower when you get transplant services from the IOE facility we designate to perform the transplant you need. You may also get transplant services at a non-IOE facility, but your cost share will be higher. The National Medical Excellence (NME) Program \u00ae will coordinate all solid organ, bone marrow and CAR-T and T-cell therapy services, and other specialized care you need. Many pre and post-transplant medical services, even routine ones, are related to and may affect the success of your transplant. While your transplant care is being coordinated by the NME Program, all medical services must be managed through NME so that you receive the highest level of benefits at the appropriate facility. This is true even if the covered service is not directly related to your transplant. Covered Transplant Expenses Covered transplant expenses include the following: Cha rges for activating the donor search process with national registries. Com patibility testing of prospective organ donors who are immediate family members. For the purpose of this coverage, an \"immediate\" family member is defined as a first-degree biological relative.

Cha rges made by a hospital, outpatient facility or physician for the medical and surgical expenses of a live donor, but only to the extent not covered by another plan or program.

These services and supplies may include: physical, speech and occupational therapy; bio-medicals and immunosuppressants; home health care expenses and home infusion services. Covered transplant expenses are typically incurred during the four phases of transplant care described below. Expenses incurred for one transplant during these four phases of care will be considered one Transplant Occurrence. A Transplant Occurrence is considered to begin at the point of evaluation for a transplant and end either: (1) 180 days from the date of the transplant; or (2) upon the date you are discharged from the hospital or outpatient facility for the admission or visit(s) related to the transplant, whichever is later. The four phases of one Transplant Occurrence and a summary of covered transplant expenses during each phase are: 1. Pre -transplant Evaluation/Screening: Includes all transplant-related professional and technical components required for assessment, evaluation and acceptance into a transplant facility's transplant program. 2. Pre -transplant/Candidacy Screening: Includes HLA typing/compatibility testing of prospective organ donors who are immediate family members. 3.

Fo llow-up Care: Includes all covered transplant expenses; home health care services; home infusion services; and transplant-related outpatient services rendered within 180 days from the date of the transplant event.

Loss of eligibility does not include a loss due to failure of you or your dependent to pay premiums on a timely basis or due to termination of coverage for cause as referenced in the Termination of Coverage section of this Plan Description. You will need to enroll yourself or a dependent for coverage within: 60 d ays of the loss of coverage under the other group health plan or other health insurance coverage; 60 d ays of when coverage under Medicaid or an S-CHIP Plan ends; or 60 d ays of the date you or your dependents become eligible for Medicaid or S-CHIP premium assistance. The Effective Date of Coverage will be the first day of the first calendar month following the date the completed request for enrollment is received. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 122 You or your eligible dependent enrolling during a special enrollment period will not be subject to late enrollment provisions, if any described in this Summary Plan Description. Special Enrollment Period When a New Eligible Dependent is Acquired: When you acquire a new eligible dependent through marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption, the new eligible dependent ( as well as you and other eligible dependents, if not otherwise enrolled) may be enrolled during a special enrollment period.

State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 123 When Your Coverage Ends State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 124When Your Coverage Ends Coverage under your plan can end for a variety of reasons. In this section, you will find details on how and why coverage ends, and how you may still be able to continue coverage. When Coverage Ends for Employees Your coverage will end if: Yo u voluntarily terminate coverage; Yo ur employment terminates; Yo u are no longer eligible for coverage; Yo u do not make the required contributions; Yo u become covered under another health care plan offered by your employer; or Th e Plan is discontinued. Your Proof of Prior Medical Coverage Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, your employer is required to give you a certificate of creditable coverage when your employment ends. This certificate proves that you were covered under this plan when you were employed. Ask your employer about the certificate of creditable coverage.When Coverage Ends for Dependents Coverage for your dependents will end if: Yo ur coverage ends for any of the reasons listed above; You die; Yo ur dependent is no longer eligible for coverage; Yo ur payment for dependent coverage is not made when due; or De pendent coverage is no longer available under the Plan. Continuing Your Health Care Coverage Continuing Coverage for Dependent Students on Medical Leave of Absence If your dependent child who is eligible for coverage and enrolled in this plan by reason of his or her status as a full-time student at a postsecondary educational institution ceases to be eligible due to: a me dically necessary leave of absence from school; or a cha nge in his or her status as a full-time student, resulting from a serious illness or injury, such child's coverage under this plan may continue. Coverage under this continuation provision will end when the first of the following occurs: -The end of the 12 month period following the first day of your dependent child's leave of absence from school, or a change in his or her status as a full-time student; - Yo ur dependent child's coverage would otherwise end under the terms of this plan; - De pendent coverage is discontinued under this plan; or - Yo u fail to make any required contribution toward the cost of this coverage. To be eligible for this continuation, the dependent child must have been enrolled in this plan and attending school on a full-time basis immediately before the first day of the leave of absence. To continue your dependent child's coverage under this provision you should notify your employer as soon as possible after your child's leave of absence begins or the change in his or her status as a full-time student. Aetna may require a written certification from the treating physician which states that the child is suffering from a serious illness or injury and that the resulting leave of absence (or change in full-time student status) is medically necessary. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 125 Handicapped Dependent Children Health Expense Coverage for your fully handicapped dependent child may be continued past the maximum age for a dependent child. However, such coverage may not be continued if the child has been issued an individual medical conversion policy. Your child is fully handicapped if: he o r she is not able to earn his or her own living because of mental retardation or a physical handicap which started prior to the date he or she reaches the maximum age for dependent children under your plan; and he o r she depends chiefly on you for support and maintenance. At the end of the year your dependent reaches age 26, the New Jersey Division of Pensions and Benefits will automatically terminate their existing coverage as required by Health Care Reform. If the child is physically and/or mentally unable to provide for him- or herself, the member can request a Continuance for Dependent with Disabilities application from the Division of Pensions and Benefits. The form and proof of the child's condition must be received by the Division of Pensions and Benefits, Health Benefits Bureau, no later than 31 days after the date coverage would normally end. Since coverage for over age children ends on December 31 of the year they turn 26, you have until January 31 to file the Continuance for Dependent with Disabilities form. To obtain this form, call the Division of Pensions and Benefits at (609) 292-7524 , or write to: Division of Pensions and Benefits Health Benefits Benefits Bureau, PO Box 299, Trenton, NJ 08625-0299. The Continuance for Dependent with Disabilities form includes a section to be completed by a physician describing the dependent's disability. The Medical Review Board must assess each case, and the Board will often request that the member provide additional medical documentation that the Board finds necessary to make an informed determination. If the Medical Review Board determines that the dependent child is eligible for continued coverage, it may continue only while (1) you remain covered through the SHBP and SEHBP; and (2) the child continues to be disabled; and (3) the child is unmarried; and (4) the child lives with you and remains dependent on you for support and maintenance. You will be contacted periodically to verify that the child remains eligible for continued coverage and complete the Continuance for Dependents Disability form. Aetna and The Division of Pensions and Benefits will have the right to require proof of the continuation of the handicap. Aetna also has the right to examine your child as often as needed while the handicap continues at its own expense. Coverage for Health Benefits If your health benefits end while you are totally disabled, your health expenses will be extended as described below, but, with respect to medical benefits, only as to expenses incurred in connection with the injury or illness that caused the total disability. To find out why and when your coverage may end, please refer to When Coverage Ends. \"Totally disabled\" means that because of an injury or illness: Yo u are not able to work at your own occupation and you cannot work at any occupation for pay or profit. Yo ur dependent is not able to engage in most normal activities of a healthy person of the same age and gender. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 126 Extended Health Coverage Medical Benefits (other than Basic medical benefits): Coverage will be available while you are totally disabled, but only for the condition that caused the disability, for up to 12 months. When Extended Health Coverage Ends Extension of benefits will end on the first to occur of the date: Yo u are no longer totally disabled, or become covered under any other group plan with like benefits. Yo ur dependent is no longer totally disabled, or he or she becomes covered under any other group plan with like benefits. (This does not apply if coverage ceased because the benefit section ceased for your eligible class.)COBRA Continuation of Coverage You and your dependents have the right under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) to continue medical coverage under certain circumstances (called \"qualifying events\") when you would otherwise lose coverage. To do so, you must pay up to 102% of the full regular cost of coverage. Continuation of Coverage Following Termination of Employment or Loss of Eligibility You and your covered family members are eligible to continue coverage for up to 18 months if: Yo u leave your employer for any reason other than gross misconduct; or Yo u are no longer eligible because your working hours are reduced. You may elect to continue coverage for yourself and your dependents, or your dependents may each elect to continue their own coverage.If you or your dependent is disabled, as defined by the Social Security Administration, at the time of the qualifying event or becomes disabled within 60 days of the event, you may be entitled to an extra 11 months of coverage, for a total of 29 months. You must notify your Human Resources representative of the disability before the end of the original 18-month period to receive the extension, and you must pay up to 150% of the full cost of coverage for every month after the 18th month. Coverage may be continued for the disabled individual and for any family member for whom coverage is already being continued under COBRA, as well as for your newborn or newly adopted child who was added after the date COBRA continuation began. COBRA continuation of benefits will end on the first day of the month that begins more than 30 days after the final determination under Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act that the disabled individual is no longer disabled. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 127 Who Qualifies for COBRA You have 60 days from the qualifying event to elect COBRA. If you do not submit an application within 60 days, you will forfeit your COBRA continuation rights. Below you will find the qualifying events and a summa ry of the maximum coverage periods according to COBRA requirements. Qualifying Event Causing Loss of Health Coverage Covered Persons Eligible to Elect Maximum Continuation Periods Your active employment ends for reasons other than gross misconductYou and your dependents 18 months Your working hours are reduced You and your dependents 18 months You divorce or legally separate and are no longer responsible for dependent coverageYour dependents 36 months You become entitled to benefits under Medicare Your dependents 36 months Your covered dependent children no longer qualify as dependents under the planYour dependent children 36 months You die Your dependents 36 months You are a retiree eligible for health coverage and your former employer files for bankruptcyYou and your dependents 18 months State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 128 Continuation of Coverage Due to Other Qualifying Events Your eligible dependents can continue coverage for up to 36 months if coverage would otherwise cease because: You die; You are divorced; Yo u stop making contributions for a spouse from whom you are legally separated; Yo u become entitled to Medicare; or A co vered child is no longer eligible under the Plan. If one of the above events occurs while you or a covered dependent have already continued coverage due to the termination of your employment or your loss of eligibility, your dependent may extend coverage beyond the original 18-month continuation period, but for no more than a total of 36 months from the date coverage would originally have ended.Applying for COBRA Continuation Your Human Resources representative will give you information about how to continue COBRA coverage at the time you become eligible. You must inform your employer of any status changes that would make your dependents eligible for COBRA coverage within 60 days of the later to occur of: The occurrence of the event; and Th e date coverage would terminate due to the event. To ensure that there is no break in coverage, the election to continue coverage must be made within 60 days of: Th e date coverage would terminate due to the event; or Th e date your employer informs your dependents of their right to continue coverage; whichever happens later. If you do not make your election within 60 days, you will lose your COBRA continuation rights.When COBRA Continuation Coverage Ends Continuation coverage will end on the earliest date that: The COBRA continuation period expires. Yo u or your family members do not make the required contributions. Yo u or your family members become covered under another group health plan, unless that plan contains a provision that restricts the payment of benefits for a pre-existing condition. Once the pre-existing condition clause of the new plan ceases to apply, your COBRA coverage will cease. Yo u or your family members become enrolled in Medicare. (Coverage could continue for those individuals not eligible for Medicare for up to 36 months from the original qualifying event, provided those family members otherwise remain eligible.) Yo ur employer terminates this health plan. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 129 Claims State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 130Coordination of Benefits If you have coverage under other group plans, the benefits from the other plans will be taken into account if you have a claim. This may mean a reduction in benefits under the Plan. Benefits available through other group plans and/or no-fault automobile coverage will be coordinated with the Plan. \"Other group plans\" include any other plan of dental or medical coverage provided by: Gr oup insurance or any other arrangement of group coverage for individuals, whether or not the plan is insured; and \"N o-fault\" and traditional \"fault\" auto insurance, including medical payments coverage provided on other than a group basis, to the extent allowed by law. To find out if benefits under the Plan will be reduced, Aetna must first determine which plan pays benefits first. The determination of which plan pays first is made as follows: Th e plan without a coordination of benefits (COB) provision determines its benefits before the plan that has such a provision. Th e plan that covers a person other than as a dependent determines its benefits before the plan that covers the person as a dependent. If the person is eligible for Medicare and is not actively working, the Medicare Secondary Payer rules will apply. Under the Medicare Secondary Payer rules, the order of benefits will be determined as follows: - Th e plan that covers the person as a dependent of a working spouse will pay first; -Me dicare will pay second; and - Th e plan that covers the person as a retired employee will pay third. Ex cept for children of divorced or separated parents, the plan of the parent whose birthday occurs earlier in the calendar year pays first. When both parents' birthdays occur on the same day, the plan that has covered the parent the longest pays first. If the other plan doesn't have the parent birthday rule, the other plan's COB rule applies. Wh en the parents of a dependent child are divorced or separated: - If t here is a court decree which states that the parents will share joint custody of a dependent child, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the parent birthday rule, immediately above, applies. - If a c ourt decree gives financial responsibility for the child's medical, dental or other health care expenses to one of the parents, the plan covering the child as that parent's dependent determines its benefits before any other plan that covers the child as a dependent. - If t here is no such court decree, the order of benefits will be determined as follows: th e plan of the natural parent with whom the child resides, th e plan of the stepparent with whom the child resides, th e plan of the natural parent with whom the child does not reside, or th e plan of the stepparent with whom the child does not reside. If a n individual has coverage as an active employee or dependent of such employee, and also as a retired or laid-off employee, the plan that covers the individual as an active employee or dependent of such employee is primary. Th e benefits of a plan which covers a person under a right of continuation under federal or state laws will be determined after the benefits of any other plan which does not cover the person under a right of continuation. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 131 If the above rules do not establish an order o f payment, the plan that has covered the person for the longest time will pay benefits first. If it is determined that the other plan pays first, the benefits paid under this Plan will be reduced. Aetna will calculate this reduced amount as follows: The amount normally reimbursed for covered benefits under this Plan, less Be nefits payable from your other plan(s). If your other plan(s) provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, the cash value of the services will be used in the calculation. Subrogation and Right of Recovery Provision As used throughout this provision, the term \"Responsible Party\" means any party actually, possibly, or potentially responsible for making any payment to a Covered Person due to a Covered Person's injuries, illness or condition, including the liability insurer of such party, or any insurance carrier providing medical expense or liability coverage including, but not limited to, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, personal umbrella coverage, medical payments coverage, workers' compensation coverage, no-fault automobile insurance coverage, or any first party insurance coverage. For purposes of this provision, a \"Covered Person\" includes anyone on whose behalf the Plan pays or provides any benefit including, but not limited to, the minor child or dependent of any Plan member or person entitled to receive any benefits from the Plan. Immediately upon paying or providing any benefit under this Plan, the Plan shall be subrogated to all rights of recovery a Covered Person has against any Responsible Party with respect to any payment made by the Responsible Party to a Covered Person due to a Covered Person's injuries, illness, to the full extent of benefits provided or to be provided by the Plan. In addition, if a Covered Person receives any payment from any Responsible Party as a result of an injury or illness, the Plan has the right to recover from, and be reimbursed by, the Covered Person for all amounts this Plan has paid and will pay as a result of that injury or illness, up to and including the full amount the Covered Person receives from all Responsible Parties. By accepting benefits (whether the payment of such benefits is made to the Covered Person or made on behalf of the Covered Person to any provider) from the Plan, the Covered Person agrees that if he or she receives any payment from any Responsible Party as a result of an injury or illness, he or she will serve as a constructive trustee over the fund that constitutes such payment. Failure to hold such fund in trust will be deemed a breach of the Covered Person's fiduciary duty to the Plan. Further, the Plan will automatically have a lien, to the extent of benefits advanced, upon any recovery whether by settlement, judgment, or otherwise, that a Covered Person receives from Responsible Party as a result of the Covered Person's illness, injuries, or condition. By accepting benefits (whether the payment of such benefits is made to the Covered Person or made on behalf of the Covered Person to any provider) from the Plan, the Covered Person acknowledges that this Plan's recovery rights are a first priority claim against all Responsible Parties and are to be paid to the Plan before any other claim for the Covered Person's damages. This Plan shall be entitled to full reimbursement on a first-dollar basis from any Responsible Party's payments, even if such payment to the Plan will result in a recovery to the Covered Person which is insufficient to make the Covered Person whole or to compensate the Covered Person in part or in whole for the damages sustained. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 132 The Plan is not required to participate in or pay court costs or attorney fees to the attorney hired by the Covered Person to pursue the Covered Person's damage claim. The terms of this entire subrogation and right of recovery provision shall apply and the Plan is entitled to full recovery regardless of whether any liability for payment is admitted by any Responsible Party and regardless of whether the settlement or judgment received by the Covered Person identifies the medical benefits the Plan provided or purports to allocate any portion of such settlement or judgment to payment of expenses other than medical expenses. The Plan is entitled to recover from any and all settlements or judgments, even those designated as pain and suffering or non-economic damages only. The Covered Person shall fully cooperate with the Plan's efforts to recover its benefits paid. It is the duty of the Covered Person to notify the Plan within 30 days of the date when any notice is given to any party, including an attorney, of the Covered Person's intention to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to injuries or illness sustained by the Covered Person. The Covered Person shall provide all information requested by the Plan, the Claims Administrator or its representative including, but not limited to, completing and submitting any applications or other forms or statements as the Plan may reasonably request. Failure to provide this information may result in the termination of health benefits for the Covered Person or the institution of court proceedings against the Covered Person. The Covered Person shall do nothing to prejudice the Plan's subrogation or recovery interest or to prejudice the Plan's ability to enforce the terms of this Plan provision. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the Plan. In the event that any claim is made that any part of this recovery provision is ambiguous or questions arise concerning the meaning or intent of any of its terms, the Claims Administrator for the Plan shall have the sole authority and discretion to resolve all disputes regarding the interpretation of this provision. By accepting benefits (whether the payment of such benefits is made to the Covered Person or made on behalf of the Covered Person to any provider) from the Plan, the Covered Person agrees that any court proceeding with respect to this provision may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect. By accepting such benefits, the Covered Person hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving whatever rights may correspond to him or her by reason of his or her present or future domicile. Please note that coordination with your auto coverage may be impacted by certain special plan provisions for the SHBP/SEHBP . Claims, Appeals and External Review Filing Health Claims under the Plan Under the Plan, you may file claims for Plan benefits and appeal adverse claim determinations. Any reference to \"you\" in this Claims, Appeals and External Review section includes you and your Authorized Representative. An \"Authorized Representative\" is a person you authorize, in writing, to act on your behalf. The Plan will also recognize a court order giving a person authority to submit claims on your behalf. In the case of an urgent care claim, a health care professional with knowledge of your condition may always act as your Authorized Representative. If your claim is denied in whole or in part, you will receive a written notice of the denial from Aetna Life Insurance Company (Aetna). The notice will explain the reason for the denial and the appeal procedures available under the Plan. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 133 Urgent Care Claims An \"Urgent Care Claim\" is any claim for medical care or treatment for which the application of the time periods for making non-urgent care determinations could seriously jeopardize your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function, or, in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of your medical condition, would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the claim. If the Plan requires advance approval of a service, supply or procedure before a benefit will be payable, and if Aetna or your physician determines that it is an Urgent Care Claim, you will be notified of the decision, whether adverse or not, as soon as possible but not later than 72 hours after the claim is received. If there is not sufficient information to decide the claim, you will be notified of the information necessary to complete the claim as soon as possible, but not later than 24 hours after receipt of the claim. You will be given a reasonable additional amount of time, but not less than 48 hours, to provide the information, and you will be notified of the decision not later than 48 hours after the end of that additional time period (or after receipt of the information, if earlier). Other Claims (Pre-Service and Post-Service) If the Plan requires you to obtain advance approval of a non-urgent service, supply or procedure before a benefit will be payable, a request for advance approval is considered a pre-service claim. You will be notified of the decision not later than 15 days after receipt of the pre-service claim. For other claims (post-service claims), you will be notified of the decision not later than 30 days after receipt of the claim. For either a pre-service or a post-service claim, these time periods may be extended up to an additional 15 days due to circumstances outside Aetna's control. In that case, you will be notified of the extension before the end of the initial 15 or 30-day period. For example, they may be extended because you have not submitted sufficient information, in which case you will be notified of the specific information necessary and given an additional period of at least 45 days after receiving the notice to furnish that information. You will be notified of Aetna's claim decision no later than 15 days after the end of that additional period (or after receipt of the information, if earlier).For pre-service claims which name a specific claimant, medical condition, and service or supply for which approval is requested, and which are submitted to an Aetna representative responsible for handling benefit matters, but which otherwise fail to follow the Plan's procedures for filing pre-service claims, you will be notified of the failure within 5 days (within 24 hours in the case of an urgent care claim) and of the proper procedures to be followed. The notice may be oral unless you request written notification. Ongoing Course of Treatment If you have received pre-authorization for an ongoing course of treatment, you will be notified in advance if the previously authorized course of treatment is intended to be terminated or reduced so that you will have an opportunity to appeal any decision to Aetna and receive a decision on that appeal before the termination or reduction takes effect. If the course of treatment involves urgent care, and you request an extension of the course of treatment at least 24 hours before its expiration, you will be notified of the decision within 24 hours after receipt of the request. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 134 Health Claims - Standard Appeals As an individual enrolled in the Plan, you have the right to file an appeal from an Adverse Benefit Determination relating to service(s) you have received or could have received from your health care provider under the Plan. An \"Adverse Benefit Determination\" is defined as a denial, reduction, termination of, or failure to, provide or make payment (in whole or in part) for a service, supply or benefit. Such Adverse Benefit Determination may be based on: Yo ur eligibility for coverage, including a retrospective termination of coverage (whether or not there is an adverse effect on any particular benefit); Cov erage determinations, including plan limitations or exclusions; The results of any Utilization Review activities; A dec ision that the service or supply is experimental or investigational; or A dec ision that the service or supply is not medically necessary. A \"Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination\" is defined as an Adverse Benefit Determination that has been upheld by the appropriate named fiduciary (Aetna) at the completion of the internal appeals process, or an Adverse Benefit Determination for which the internal appeals process has been exhausted. Exhaustion of Internal Appeals Process Generally, you are required to complete all appeal processes of the Plan before being able to obtain External Review or bring an action in litigation. However, if Aetna, or the Plan or its designee, does not strictly adhere to all claim determination and appeal requirements under applicable federal law, you are considered to have exhausted the Plan's appeal requirements (\"Deemed Exhaustion\") and may proceed with External Review or may pursue any available remedies under \u00a7502(a) of ERISA or under state law, as applicable. There is an exception to the Deemed Exhaustion rule. Your claim or internal appeal may not go straight to External Review if: A ru le violation was minor and is not likely to influence a decision or harm you; and It w as for a good cause or was beyond Aetna's or the Plan's or its designee's control; and It w as part of an ongoing good faith exchange between you and Aetna or the Plan. This exception is not available if the rule violation is part of a pattern or practice of violations by Aetna or the Plan. You may request a written explanation of the violation from the Plan or Aetna, and the Plan or Aetna must provide such explanation within 10 days, including a specific description of its bases, if any, for asserting that the violation should not cause the internal claims and appeals process to be deemed exhausted. If an External Reviewer or a court rejects your request for immediate review on the basis that the plan met the standards for the exception, you have the right to resubmit and pursue the internal appeal of the claim. In such a case, within a reasonable time after the External Reviewer or court rejects the claim for immediate review (not to exceed 10 days), you will receive notice of the opportunity to resubmit and pursue the internal appeal of the claim. Time periods for re-filing the claim shall begin to run upon your receipt of such notice. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 135 Full and Fair Review of Claim Determinations and Appeals Aetna will provide you, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated by Aetna (or at the direction of Aetna), or any new or additional rationale as soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the date on which the notice of Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination is provided, to give you a reasonable opportunity to respond prior to that date.

You may also request that Aetna provide you, free of charge, copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim. If your claim involves urgent care, an expedited appeal may be initiated by a telephone call to the phone number included in your denial, or to Aetna's Member Services. Aetna's Member Services telephone number is on your Identification Card. You or your Authorized Representative may appeal urgent care claim denials either orally or in writing. All necessary information, including the appeal decision, will be communicated between you or your Authorized Representative and Aetna by telephone, facsimile, or other similar method. You will be notified of the decision not later than 36 hours after the appeal is received. If you are dissatisfied with the appeal decision on an urgent care claim, you may file a second level appeal with Aetna. You will be notified of the decision not later than 36 hours after the appeal is received.

If you choose not to file for voluntary review, the Plan will not assert that you have failed to exhaust your administrative remedies because of that choice. Request for External Review The External Review process under this Plan gives you the opportunity to receive review of an Adverse Benefit Determination (including a Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination) conducted pursuant to applicable law. Your request will be eligible for External Review if the claim decision involves medical judgment and the following are satisfied: Ae tna, or the Plan or its designee, does not strictly adhere to all claim determination and appeal requirements under federal law (except for minor violations); or th e standard levels of appeal have been exhausted; or th e appeal relates to a rescission, defined as a cancellation or discontinuance of coverage which has retroactive effect. An Adverse Benefit Determination based upon your eligibility is not eligible for External Review. If upon the final standard level of appeal, the coverage denial is upheld and it is determined that you are eligible for External Review, you will be informed in writing of the steps necessary to request an External Review. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 137 An independent review organization refers the case for review by a neutral, independent clinical reviewer with appropriate expertise in the area in question. The decision of the independent external expert reviewer is binding on you, Aetna and the Plan unless otherwise allowed by law. Preliminary Review Within five (5) business days following the date of receipt of the request, Aetna must provide a preliminary review determining: you were covered under the Plan at the time the service was requested or provided, the determination does not relate to eligibility, you have exhausted the internal appeals process (unless Deemed Exhaustion applies), and you have provided all paperwork necessary to complete the External Review and you are eligible for external review. Within one business day after completion of the preliminary review, Aetna must issue to you a notification in writing. If the request is complete but not eligible for External Review, such notification will include the reasons for its ineligibility and contact information for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (toll-free number 866-444-EBSA (3272)). If the request is not complete, such notification will describe the information or materials needed to make the request complete and Aetna must allow you to perfect the request for External Review within the 123 calendar days filing period or within the 48 hour period following the receipt of the notification, whichever is later. Referral to ERO Aetna will assign an ERO accredited as required under federal law, to conduct the External Review. The assigned ERO will timely notify you in writing of the request's eligibility and acceptance for External Review, and will provide an opportunity for you to submit in writing within 10 business days following the date of receipt, additional information that the ERO must consider when conducting the External Review. Within one (1) business day after making the decision, the ERO must notify you, Aetna and the Plan. The ERO will review all of the information and documents timely received. In reaching a decision, the assigned ERO will review the claim and not be bound by any decisions or conclusions reached during the Plan's internal claims and appeals process. In addition to the documents and information provided, the assigned ERO, to the extent the information or documents are available and the ERO considers them appropriate, will consider the following in reaching a decision: a. Your medical records;b. The attending health care professional's recommendation; c. Re ports from appropriate health care professionals and other documents submitted by the Plan or issuer, you, or your treating provider; d. Th e terms of your Plan to ensure that the ERO's decision is not contrary to the terms of the Plan, unless the terms are inconsistent with applicable law; e. Appr opriate practice guidelines, which must include applicable evidence-based standards and may include any other practice guidelines developed by the Federal government, national or professional medical societies, boards, and associations; f. An y applicable clinical review criteria developed and used by Aetna, unless the criteria are inconsistent with the terms of the Plan or with applicable law; and g. Th e opinion of the ERO's clinical reviewer or reviewers after considering the information described in this notice to the extent the information or documents are available and the clinical reviewer or reviewers consider appropriate. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 138 The assigned ERO must provide written notice of the Final External Review Decision within 45 days after the ERO receives the request for the External Review. The ERO must deliver the notice of Final External Review Decision to you, Aetna and the Plan. After a Final External Review Decision, the ERO must maintain records of all claims and notices associated with the External Review process for six years. An ERO must make such records available for examination by the claimant, Plan, or State or Federal oversight agency upon request, except where such disclosure would violate State or Federal privacy laws. Upon receipt of a notice of a Final External Review Decision reversing the Adverse Benefit Determination or Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination, the Plan immediately must provide coverage or payment (including immediately authorizing or immediately paying benefits) for the claim. Expedited External Review The Plan must allow you to request an expedited External Review at the time you receive: An A dverse Benefit Determination if the Adverse Benefit Determination involves a medical condition for which the timeframe for completion of an expedited internal appeal would seriously jeopardize your life or health or would jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function and you have filed a request for an expedited internal appeal; or A Fin al Internal Adverse Benefit Determination, if you have a medical condition where the timeframe for completion of a standard External Review would seriously jeopardize your life or health or would jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function, or if the Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care item or service for which you received emergency services, but have not been discharged from a facility. Immediately upon receipt of the request for expedited External Review, Aetna will determine whether the request meets the reviewability requirements set forth above for standard External Review. Aetna must immediately send you a notice of its eligibility determination.Referral of Expedited Review to ERO Upon a determination that a request is eligible for External Review following preliminary review, Aetna will assign an ERO. The ERO shall render a decision as expeditiously as your medical condition or circumstances require, but in no event more than 72 hours after the ERO receives the request for an expedited External Review. If the notice is not in writing, within 48 hours after the date of providing that notice, the assigned ERO must provide written confirmation of the decision to you, Aetna and the Plan. Sutter Health and Affiliates, the dominant health system in much of northern California, uses its bargaining power to insist on unique requirements to participate in the Aetna network. Aetna's contract with Sutter requires payment of claims that would otherwise be denied, such as those not medically necessary or experimental or investigational (but does not require payment for services the Plan expressly excludes from coverage, such as for cosmetic surgery). Aetna will charge the Plan for these claims in order to be able to continue providing Plan Participants with access to Sutter's services on an in-network basis.

Patient Self-Determination Act (Advance Directives) There may be occasions when you are not able to make decisions about your medical care. An Advance Directive can help you and your family members in such a situation. What Is an Advance Directive? An Advance Directive is generally a written statement that you complete in advance of serious illness that outlines how you want medical decisions made. If you can't make treatment decisions, your physician will ask your closest available relative or friend to help you decide what is best for you. But there are times when everyone doesn't agree about what to do. That's why it is helpful if you specify in advance what you want to happen if you can't speak for yourself. There are several kinds of Advance Directives that you can use to say what you want and whom you want to speak for you. The two most common forms of an Advance Directive are: A L iving Will; and A Du rable Power of Attorney for Health Care. What Is a Living Will? A Living Will states the kind of medical care you want, or do not want, if you become unable to make your own decisions. It is called a Living Will because it takes effect while you are still living. The Living Will is a document that is limited to the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures and/or treatment in the event of a terminal condition. If you write a living will, give a copy to your PCP . What Is a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care? A Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care is a document giving authority to make medical decisions regarding your health care to a person that you choose. The Durable Power of Attorney is planned to take effect when you can no longer make your own medical decisions. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 144 A Durable Power of Attorney can be specific to a particular treatment or medical condition, or it can be very broad. If you write a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, give a copy to your PCP. Who Decides About My Treatment? Your physicians will give you information and advice about treatment. You have the right to choose. You can say \"Yes\" to treatments you want. You can say \"No\" to any treatment you don't want \u2014 even if the treatment might keep you alive longer. How Do I Know What I Want? Your physician must tell you about your medical condition and about what different treatments can do for you. Many treatments have side effects, and your doctor must offer you information about serious problems that medical treatment is likely to cause you. Often, more than one treatment might help you \u2014 and people have different ideas about which is best. Your physician can tell you which treatments are available to you, but they can't choose for you. That choice depends on what is important to you.How Does the Person Named in My Advance Directive Know What I Would Want? Make sure that the person you name knows that you have an Advance Directive and knows where it is located. You might consider the following: If y ou have a Durable Power of Attorney, give a copy of the original to your \"agent\" or \"proxy.\" Your agent or proxy is the person you choose to make your medical decisions when you are no longer able. As k your PCP to make your Advance Directive part of your permanent medical record. Ke ep a second copy of your Advance Directive in a safe place where it can be found easily, if it is needed. Ke ep a small card in your purse or wallet that states that you have an Advance Directive and where it is located, and who your agent or proxy is, if you have named one. Who Can Fill Out the Living Will or Advance Directive Form? If you are 18 years or older and of sound mind, you can fill out this form. You do not need a lawyer to fill it out.Whom Can I Name to Make Medical Treatment Decisions When I'm Unable to Do So? You can choose an adult relative or friend you trust to be your agent or proxy, and to speak for you when you're too sick to make your own decisions. There are a variety of living will forms available, or you can write your wishes on a piece of paper. If necessary, your doctor and family can use what you write to help make decisions about your treatment. Do I Have to Execute an Advance Directive? No. It is entirely up to you. Will I Be Treated If I Don't Execute an Advance Directive? Absolutely. We just want you to know that if you become too ill to make decisions, someone else will have to make them for you. With an Advance Directive, you can instruct others about your wishes before becoming unable to do so. State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 145 Can I Change My Mind After Writing an Advance Directive? Yes. You may change your mind or cancel these documents at any time as long as you are competent and can communicate your wishes to your physician, your family and others who may need to know. What Is the Plan's Policy Regarding Advance Directives? We share your interest in preventive care and maintaining good health. Eventually, however, every family may face the possibility of serious illness in which important decisions must be made. We believe it is never too early to think about decisions that may be very important in the future and urge you to discuss these topics with your PCP , family, friends, and other trusted, interested people. You are not required to execute an Advance Directive. If you choose to complete an Advance Directive, it is your responsibility to provide a copy to your physician and to take a copy with you when you check into a hospital or other health facility so that it can be kept with your medical records.How Can I Get More Information About Advance Directives?

State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 146 Federal Notices State of New Jersey Aetna Member Guidebook | Aetna HMO Plan 2019 147Federal Notices This section describes laws and plan provisions that apply to reproductive and women's health issues. The Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act Federal law generally prohibits restricting benefits for hospital lengths of stay to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery and less than 96 hours following a caesarean section. However, the plan may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (physician, nurse midwife or physician assistant) discharges the mother or newborn earlier, after consulting with the mother. Also, federal law states that plan benefits may not, for the purpose of benefits or out-of-pocket costs, treat the later portion of a hospital stay in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. Finally, federal law states that a plan may not require a physician or other health care provider to obtain authorization of a length of stay up to 48 hours or 96 hours, as described above. However, to use certain providers or facilities, or to reduce your out-of-pocket costs, you may be required to obtain precertification. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act In accordance with the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, this Plan covers the follow procedures for a person receiving benefits for an appropriate mastectomy: Re construction of the breast on which a mastectomy has been performed; Su rgery and reconstruction of the other breast to create a symmetrical appearance; Pr ostheses; and Tr eatment of physical complications of all stages of mastectomy, including lymphedemas. This coverage will be provided in consultation with the attending physician and the patient, and will be subject to the same annual deductibles and coinsurance provisions that apply to the mastectomy. For answers to questions about the plan's coverage of mastectomies and reconstructive surgery, call Aetna's Member Services at the number shown on your ID card.Important Health Care Reform Information Some language changes in response to recent changes to preventive services coverage and women's preventive health coverage under the Federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) may not be included in the enclosed booklet. This may be because the language is still pending regulatory review and approval. However, please note that Aetna is administering medical and outpatient prescription drug coverage in compliance with the applicable components of the ACA. The following is a summary of the recent changes to preventive services coverage and women's preventive health coverage under the ACA that applies to non-grandfathered plans that are not otherwise exempt from the requirements.
