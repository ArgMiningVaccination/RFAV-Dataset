It began with loads of our wonderful practice members arriving, all dressed fabulously and looking amazingly radiant! The celebration room itself was decorated in a Mardi Gras theme, there were balloons, beaded necklaces, coins and awesome centerpieces made of Mardi Gras masks on the tables. We even had photographers set up to take pictures of the radiant looking couples and families. There was time to mingle about, meet new faces and socialize before dinner began. I definitely loved witnessing what a huge, friendly, awesome community that Crossroads is! Once dinner finished up, a slideshow was played, showing many of the exciting events that have occurred at Crossroads over the years. Testimonials from practice members of all ages were interspersed among the many pictures. Hearing all the wonderful stories of healing and health through chiropractic never ceases to amaze me! Next, Dr Stephanie shared with us all the beginnings of Crossroads, what her vision was then and how much it has grown since; she even now has a bigger vision of continuing to bring the Crossroads experience throughout the state! Dr Stephanie awarded some special certificates to a few lucky practice members for the following things: Longest Practice Members\u2014Skyp and Carol S. Crossroads Man of the Year\u2014Al B Most Attended Workshops\u2014Liz W Most Public and Vocal Practice Member\u2014Russ W Most Likely to Grow Up and Become a Chiropractor\u2014Carter H First Practice Member to be Adjusted at Crossroads Lakeside\u2014Mary K Biggest Extended Family Under Care\u2014Glorie J Most Generations Under Care\u2014Sylvia D Dr Stephanie would love to award each practice member, that is how special you all are to her! Her daughters surprised her with a beautiful bouquet of flowers and some balloons as a congratulatory gift for the amazing 10 years she has shared her passion and vision of health and wellness with us all. After that, it was time to kick off the shoes and dance! The dance floor quickly filled up, the tunes were pouring out, and everyone was having a good time. It was fabulous to see so many get on the dance floor and enjoy themselves. By the end of the night, even some of those that didn't want to dance were out there shaking it and having a good time! A big thank you goes out to everyone that celebrated with us! Those that were unable to make it, we missed you and want to you know how thankful we are that you are a part of our Crossroads Family. We also want to thank the awesome DJ, David J for providing all the wonderful music to dance to. A special thanks goes out the entire Crossroads Team, you are all amazing and I am so thankful to be a part of it! Last but definitely not least, a huge thanks to Dr Stephanie for the amazing vision she has had and continues to have for Crossroads Chiropractic! Here's to many, many more wonderful years!!
