The author was Christina Ross, of the Wake Forest Center for Integrative Medicine, in Winston-Salem, N.C. Which happens to be where the two top [editors of the journal](https://journals.sagepub.com/editorial-board/GAM) are based. Ross also is the author of [Etiology: How to Detect Disease in Your Energy Field Before It Manifests in Your Body](https://www.amazon.com/Etiology-Detect-Disease-Energy-Manifests/dp/147978169X), which is available on Amazon and elsewhere. According to the abstract of the article: Current practices in allopathic medicine measure different types of energy in the human body by using quantum field dynamics involved in nuclear medicine, radiology, and imaging diagnostics. Once diagnosed, current treatments revert to biochemistry instead of using biophysics therapies to treat the disturbances in subtle energies detected and used for diagnostics. Quantum physics teaches us there is no difference between energy and matter. All systems in the human being, from the atomic to the molecular level, are constantly in motion-creating resonance. This resonance is important to understanding how subtle energy directs and maintains health and wellness in the human being. Energy medicine (EM), whether human touch or device-based, is the use of known subtle energy fields to therapeutically assess and treat energetic imbalances, bringing the body's systems back to homeostasis (balance). The future of EM depends on the ability of allopathic medicine to merge physics with biochemistry. Biophoton emissions as well as signal transduction and cell signaling communication systems are widely accepted in today's medicine. This technology needs to be expanded to include the existence of the human biofield (or human energy field) to better understand that disturbances in the coherence of energy patterns are indications of disease and aging. Future perspectives include understanding cellular voltage potentials and how they relate to health and wellness, understanding the overlap between the endocrine and chakra systems, and understanding how EM therapeutically enhances psychoneuroimmunology (mind-body) medicine. The [notice reads](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868449/): An investigation is currently in process in relation to this article as a result of receiving several complaints regarding the validity of the science. This notice will be updated once the Journal has completed its review. Ross said: I absolutely stand by the validity of the science I wrote about in this paper and she confirmed that the paper underwent peer review and the editing process prior to publication. She also told us that the journal's move: was based on a complaint by a man in England who is an MD who chastised me for suggesting that human biology has a biofield. He also said strange things like \"quantum mechanics only works on the subatomic level\" and \"there is no direct relationship between energy and matter\". These sound like the ramblings of someone stuck in 1930's theories of physics and refused to believe Einstein and Neils Bohr's theories. I don't know who peer reviewed my paper, but the editors of GAHM have sent it out to more reviewers. One neuroscientist / Ayurvedic instructor who was added to the peer review list, told me and the editors he thought the paper was outstanding. He said it would be unfortunate to retract it. It's by far the most down-loaded paper I've published. Hundreds (over 1,000) downloads. I have received rave reviews from energy medicine practitioners and instructors. [Suzanne Danhauer](https://school.wakehealth.edu/Faculty/D/Suzanne-C-Danhauer), one of the top editors at the journal, told us: The investigation into the article is still underway, and we do not currently have any information to share beyond what is in the Expression of Concern. However, we will provide further information when the investigation is complete. Without taking a position on the merits of Ross' paper, the journal's move strikes us as curious. After all GAHM has published several other papers on the human biofield, [like this one](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.7453/gahmj.2015.038.suppl?icid=int.sj-full-text.similar-articles.1) and [this one](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2164956120982568?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.2). It's hard to argue that it didn't know what it was getting with the latest article. The case has echoes of [this post](http://retractionwatch.com/2021/01/13/confrontation-is-an-important-element-of-physics-progress-paper-on-black-holes-retracted/), from earlier in 2021, involving a journal that cut an author loose over a controversial paper it reviewed, accepted, edited and published.
