Sometimes all it takes is a short visit to the spa to help you feel refreshed, rejuvenated and recharged all over again. Did you know that massage therapy has been around for 5,000 years? Ayurveda, the ancient Indian science, and traditional Chinese medicine both stress on the benefits of indulging in a daily massage. It has been documented that massages can be beneficial for many chronic conditions like arthritis, low energy levels, hypertension, diabetes, gout, skin diseases, depression and more. There was a time when massage experiences were available only in luxury spas and upscale health clubs, but today you can find them being offered at business conferences, wedding parties, pool parties, malls and even airports. Massage therapy is the technique of pressing, rubbing and manipulating your skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments. Massage therapists typically use their hands and fingers to provide therapy, however, they can also use their forearms, elbows or feet, depending on the type of treatment offered. There are various different kinds of massages available around the world like Balinese, Reflexology, Swedish, Deep Tissue Massage, Lymphatic Massage, Hot Stone Massage, Abhyangam and Uzhichil. It is important to understand how massage works on the body. When the body undergoes massage therapy, it responds at two levels - relaxation and mechanical response. The relaxation response is nothing but an involuntary yet predictable response of the nervous system to the therapist's touch. When you experience relaxation, your heart rate and breathing slow down, your blood pressure decreases and most importantly, the stress hormones in your body are reduced. Due to this response, serotonin increases in the body, which helps you feel positive and relaxed. Mechanical responses are the physical changes that occur in your body when pressure is applied to its soft tissues. When you get a massage, there is an increase in blood circulation and lymphatic activity due to the physical manipulation of the tissues and the production of serotonin in the body. This enhances the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the muscle cells, which in turn helps detoxify these cells, thereby reducing swelling in the tissues. Massage therapies also help reduce painful contractions and spasms by relaxing the muscles. It has been found that a massage can also reduce nerve compression and is beneficial for your organs as they share neurological pain pathways with muscles, bones, and nerves. Massage therapy can make you feel more positive as it lowers your stress levels, thereby creating a healthy balance between your mind, body and soul. So go ahead and get a massage regularly without any excuses. *Inputs: Dr. Arjita Kumari, "}
