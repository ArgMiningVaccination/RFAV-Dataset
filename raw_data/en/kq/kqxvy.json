Here are some smart choices you can make now to set your child up for a healthy school year. Serve healthy foods One of the best ways to boost immunity and strengthen your white blood cells is to eat a balanced diet. For children ages 5 to 18, this means: - Lots of fruits and veggies: Experts recommend children eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Remember to \"eat the rainbow,\" by including a range of colorful fruits and veggies at meals and [snack times](https://www.reidhealth.org/blog/7-healthy-snacks-for-kids-playing-sports). Red, orange, yellow, and green produce contains lots of [phytonutrients](https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/food-composition/phytonutrients)that help protect the body against chronic diseases. - Whole grains: Ensure your child gets enough fiber by serving whole-grain breads, crackers, and cereals without added sugar [[1]](#_msocom_1). - Lean meat and other healthy protein sources: Good choices include fish, nuts, eggs, and beans. - Low-fat or nonfat dairy: Yogurt, milk, cheese, and other dairy products contain calcium needed to help your child stay healthy and build strong bones. - Healthy fats: Use vegetable oils such as olive, canola, and sunflower, and eat foods like avocados, nuts, and fish that contain healthy fats to promote good health. While treats are fine once in a while, limit the amount of processed foods, [sugary snacks and drinks](https://www.reidhealth.org/blog/is-there-too-much-sugar-in-your-childs-diet), and unhealthy fats your child consumes. Keep your child moving Equally important to long-term health is the amount of exercise your child gets. Staying active helps boost kids' immune systems, making them less likely to get sick during cold and flu season (or any other time). Exercise has many additional benefits, including: - Better sleep - Less anxiety and depression - Less risk of becoming overweight or developing Type 2 diabetes - Lower cholesterol and blood pressure - Stronger bones and muscle - Aim for an hour a day of activity, such as playing at the playground, going for a walk, or [playing a sport](https://www.reidhealth.org/blog/youth-sports-serve-up-a-lifetime-of-benefits). To help encourage your child to be active, try these tips: [Limit screen time](https://www.reidhealth.org/blog/better-health-through-reduced-screen-time). - Set a schedule for exercise. - Do activities together as a family. - Make exercise fun instead of a chore. Make sure your child gets plenty of sleep Sleep plays a big part in how the immune system functions, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/work-hour-training-for-nurses/longhours/mod2/05.html). When kids don't get enough sleep, they are more likely to develop colds, flu, and other illnesses. - How much sleep does your child need? This [depends on your child's age](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/sleep/Pages/healthy-sleep-habits-how-many-hours-does-your-child-need.aspx). - Toddlers (one to two years old): 11 to 14 hours of sleep per day, including naps - Preschoolers (three to five years old): 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day, including naps - Grade-school-age children (six to 12 years old): 9 to 12 hours of sleep each night - Teens (13 to 18): 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night To help your child get plenty of shut-eye, stick to a regular schedule, with the same bedtime and wake-up time each day. For older kids, make sure they turn off electronic devices at least an hour before bedtime. Manage your child's stress Adults aren't the only ones who experience stress. Children also have fears, worries, and anxiety, which can take a toll not only on their mental health but on their immune system. To help your child manage stress, create an open line of communication, letting them know they can talk to you about anything. It's also important to make sure your child has plenty of time to play and have fun. Some children can also benefit from relaxation techniques, such as listening to music while relaxing or doing a favorite activity, meditating, and practicing breathing exercises. Many meditation and relaxation apps are available to help. If you're concerned about [your child's mental or emotional health](https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/depression.html), get help by letting their pediatrician know. Fight off infections Encourage children, and everyone in your family, to take these simple steps to avoid catching germs that cause illnesses: - Always cover sneezes and coughs with a tissue, then throw it away, or cough and sneeze into your elbow, completely covering your nose and mouth. - Be sure to wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. - Don't touch your eyes, nose, and mouth without first washing your hands. - Stay away from anyone who is sick and avoid hugging, kissing, or shaking hands. If your child is sick, keep them home from school, and remember to regularly disinfect high-touch objects and surfaces, such as doorknobs, mobile devices, remote controls, and toys. Stay up to date on vaccinations Another important way to protect your child and help build a healthy immune system is through [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/visit/vaccination-during-COVID-19.html). A child's immune system is not fully developed during the first seven or eight years, which means babies and young children are at greater risk of getting sick. Vaccines boost the immune system by helping it to develop and learn to defend against different types of germs. By following recommended vaccination schedules, you can help prevent your child from getting many serious illnesses, such as measles, whooping cough, and many others. Make sure you take your child to the doctor for [regular well-child visits](https://www.reidhealth.org/blog/why-kids-of-all-ages-need-a-yearly-well-child-visit) and talk to the pediatrician about vaccinations to make sure your child stays on schedule.
