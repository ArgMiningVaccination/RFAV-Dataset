'Olelo No'eau # 2178 Financial Security Food Security Mental & Behavioral Health Housing Trust & Equitable Access I. Opening A. Executive Summary The research team has had the opportunity to engage with over 200 people across our island home who care deeply about our Hawaii. Social workers, teachers, farmers, doctors, policy advocates, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, survivors, students, and healthcare providers all asked to share their thoughts on and for the communities where they live, the clients they serve, and the people they love. With a charge of updating the 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and adding the lens of the pandemic effects on the social determinants of health, the 2021 CHNA research team sought out a wide range of perspectives to understand the unique and Significant Health Needs facing Hawaii's communities. Strategies to collect input included: 82 key informant interviews, 18 community meetings, three expert panel webinars, four small focus groups, a literature review of CHNA reports from various U.S. markets, and a review of publicly available secondary data. The importance of a shared kuleana - responsibility - of healthcare working together with community and government to address social determinants of health was an important theme throughout the process. A library of community-based organizations and programs working to address social determinants of health was updated from 2018 and is included as Appendix A. With the endorsement that the Statewide Priorities from 2018 were all still relevant and should remain as Significant Health Needs, several of the social determinants were consistently identified by key informants, experts at the University of Hawaii Thompson School of Social Work & Public Health, and community groups as being even more critical in 2021, due in large part to the pandemic experience. These Significant Health Needs were in existence before the pandemic, with the COVID-19 experience exposing the urgency of addressing these basic needs. While the social determinants of health, by their very nature, are interdependent and must be viewed holistically, the \"once in 100 years\" COVID-19 physical and societal impacts require focused efforts. The Significant Health Needs that have been identified as a 2021 priority are: 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 3 SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS STRONG FAMILIES I EMERGENCY PREPARED I ENVIRONMENT K0PUNACARE I HEALTHYSTARTS I COMMUNITYCOHESIVENESS FINANCIAL SECURITY I FOOD SECURITY I MENTAL HEAL TH HOUSING I TRUST & EQUITABLE ACCESS Each of these Significant Health Needs and 2021 Priorities is described in great detail in the pages of this report, with discussions of how they manifested during the pandemic, how communities strived to deal with them, and recommended Best Practices derived from that learning. These Best Practices are identified as opportunities for hospitals to be part of addressing the 2021 Priorities. In addition to the Best Practices, this report includes Possible Strategies for consideration by hospitals wishing to identify actionable steps in addressing the 2021 Priorities, as well as Policy Opportunities. The research team recognizes that many hospitals are already individually deploying some of these strategies, advocating for these policy changes, and/or participating in community initiatives for collective action. Indeed, all are integral parts of the communities in which they operate; and, by virtue of this involvement, work for the betterment of their communities. V oices heard throughout this assessment believe that greater collaboration will result in greater impact, and they are hopeful that some of these strategies and opportunities will lend themselves to that spirit of collaboration. (Please see Sections III-B and III-C, Addressing Health Priorities). 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 4 Several themes emerged across discussions of the 2021 Priorities and Significant Health Needs and warrant highlighting here. All have important implications for future planning: The rapid adoption of telehealth was one of the silver linings of COVID-19. The need for resilience and building resilient citizens is one of the lessons of COVID-19. An important investment needed now is in community health workers; trained people of the community, working in their same community. To better prepare for future public health crises, hospitals must get out into communities and build relationships. This is key to building trust in healthcare and assuring equitable access. For policy change, advocates and organizers around upstream determinants need for the strong voice of Hawaii's hospitals to be heard. B. Background and Scope In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (referred to as \"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\")1 amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) by adding a requirement that tax-exempt hospitals complete a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) at least once every three years for each of its facilities. 2021 marks the fourth CHNA that the Healthcare Association of Hawaii (\"HAH\") has conducted on behalf of its member hospitals with prior CHNA's conducted in 2013, 2015, and 2018. The requirement to conduct a CHNA is intended to ensure that hospitals receiving tax benefits are in turn providing benefits to the communities they serve. The CHNA seeks to ensure understanding of the Significant Health Needs facing a hospital' s community, which is paired with an implementation strategy following that CHNA that identifies how the hospital intends to address Significant Health Needs. 2 In 2018, the CHNA research and drafting was led by Islander Institute, \"a local, civic enterprise working to bring about positive social, economic, and political change in Hawaii by partnering with individuals, communities, organizations, and networks committed to island values,\" together with their subcontractor Hawaii Public Health Institute (HIPHI). 1 Internal Revenue Service. \"Community Health Needs Assessments for Charitable Hospital Organizations - Section 501(r)(3),\" available at https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/community-health-needs-assessment-for-charitable-hospital-org anizations-section-501r3 (referred to as \"IRS Section 501(r)(3) Overview\"). 2 IRS Section 501(r)(3) Overview. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 5 ____________________ ____________________ The 2018 process critically re-centered the work of the CHNA around community-driven definitions of \"health\" based upon the HAH stated commitment to \"engaging in deep and transformative relationships with local communities to address the social determinants of health and increase access to high quality of care.\" 3 Understanding criticism of CHNA processes across the country that lacked a connection to community voices and understanding social determinants of health, Islander Institute laid the foundation that the \"CHNA is meant to be a substantial step forward in addressing the root causes of health. It is a resource to be shared with all of Hawaii 4 for the creation of new strategies and partnerships.\" 5 It is with that foundation that HAH sought a research partner to update the 2018 CHNA for 2021. Ward Research built a team to engage meaningfully with community members, organizations, organizers, leaders, and those involved in both direct healthcare and in addressing upstream social determinants that significantly impact health outcomes. The Ward Team intends that this 2021 CHNA be read as building upon and updating, not replacing or reimagining, the important work done in 2018. \"How do we build systems that build upon trust, community relevance, cultural relevance - to do that successfully in people's vulnerable spaces and times, in a way that is trustworthy and delivering the right information, at the right time, in the right way.\" Social Work Educator 3 2018 CHNA, HAH, page 9. 4 Hawaiian words and place names are spelled and pronounced throughout Hawaii both with and without diacritical marks; specifically, the okina (indicating a glottal stop sound) and the kahak (indicating a stressed syllable).

Partners Healthcare Association of Hawaii (HAH) HAH has been the leading voice of healthcare in Hawaii since 1939. Its 170 member organizations encompass acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, Type II adult residential care homes, Medicare-certified home health agencies, and hospices. Additional members include home infusion/pharmacies, case management firms, air and ground ambulance providers, the Blood Bank of Hawaii, dialysis providers, and more. In a time of unprecedented change in healthcare, HAH is committed to working with providers across the continuum of care toward a healthcare system that offers the best possible quality of care to the people of Hawaii. University of Hawaii Thompson School of Social Work & Public Health From the start, it was clear that the CHNA process would benefit from the involvement of the University of Hawaii (UH). The UH Thompson School of Social Work & Public Health's vision is \"achieving social justice and health equity for the people of Hawaii and citizens in a changing world.\" They hosted panel discussions around the emerging priorities with faculty topic area experts and have followed the work on the CHNA with great interest and hopes of future collaboration. Ward Research Ward Research is a Hawaii-based market research firm specializing in both qualitative and quantitative research, with a wide range of public and private sector partners. Ward Research has worked with Hawaii's healthcare systems for decades in supporting public health policy, understanding client experiences, evaluating existing programs in meeting client needs and focusing on health and human service needs. Solutions Pacific Solutions Pacific is a community-based planning company working to support the collaboration of community, industry, and government. Its Team seeks to develop meaningful relationships between organizations serving communities needs and Hawaii's communities with a particular focus on Native Hawaiian and other traditionally vulnerable and under -served communities, including Pacific Islander, immigrant communities, and those experiencing houselessess. \"Partnering with outside resources builds community trust, communicates to hospitals what the community needs are, strengthens the supports that exist outside of the hospital, and develops relationships with outside resources so that patients can access them sooner and seamlessly.\" Hospital Social Worker 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 8 D. Methodology 26 CFR \u00a71.501(r)(3) requires that the CHNA process ensures that perspectives from \"medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations in the community served by the hospital facility, or individuals or organizations serving or representing the interests of such populations\" are meaningfully incorporated into the final assessment and implementation plans. The following were identified as critical sub-populations to engage, often representing underserved populations, to ensure voices from a wide range of community perspectives: Ethnic Communities Geographic Regions Vulnerable Populations Native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders (especially COFA) Filipino Rural Oahu Kauai, Maui Nui, and Hawaii Island Homestead communities Homeless households Developmentally disabled persons ALICE families Kpuna7 Persons with mental health needs Domestic violence survivors The Ward Team had prepared itself for potential participant fatigue given strong participation in 2018 and significant demands on time and resources due to COVID-19. However, community organizers and participants seemed eager to offer their perspectives, often honed through a lens impacted by COVID-19. Input was gathered through a range of methods, including community meetings, key informant interviews, and small groups. Community Meetings Organizations throughout the state, called \"community connectors,\" helped to reach individuals from key communities for group talk story sessions. These organizations were invaluable partners, each trusted and recognized within their target communities, and willing both to provide input from their own work as well as create space and encourage their clients, partners, staff, and stakeholders to participate. Each meeting focused on both a geographic region and either an ethnic community or a vulnerable population. COVID-19 presented unique challenges in engaging with Hawaii's difficult to reach communities while remaining safe. Most organizations continued to have virtual gatherings or one-to-one services in lieu of gatherings spaces, making it difficult to bring out voices typically not heard. However, community groups were eager to provide an opportunity to share their experiences and lift up the voices of their clients and the communities they serve. The Ward Team was able to join existing meetings of organizations both in person and virtually, gather in smaller groups, and host virtual events that provided resources to community organizations to help them with computer access and training. When appropriate and safe, 7 Kupuna is the Hawaiian word for a \"senior\", with kpuna as the plural form. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 9 community meetings were conducted in the spaces where members of that community are accustomed to gathering, and refreshments were provided to encourage a relaxed environment. Whether virtually or in person, meetings were generally approximately 90 minutes and included anywhere from 3 to 20 participants. Participants were primarily members of focus subpopulations or social workers and other community service providers doing frontline work with those communities. Facilitators from different islands would lead the group in an organic discussion beginning with the 2018 priorities and discussing top priorities that were similar to or different from today, understanding the impact of COVID-19, and teasing out opportunities for Hawaii hospitals to be a partner in addressing the community health needs identified both at the operational as well as the systemic level. The Ward Team sought out a diversity of perspectives, including: geographic through having at least one meeting on each island; a mixture of those that participated in 2018 and those that did not; multiple different ethnic communities; and various vulnerable populations with unique health needs. Community meetings were conducted in various locations, from agricultural plots in Kunia, Oahu to youth residential facilities in Kailua, Oahu, and nonprofit of fices in Lhue, Kauai. Every effort was made to ensure that Limited-English Proficient (LEP) and otherly-abled individuals were supported through interpretation, culturally appropriate facilitation, and graphic representations of the 2018 priorities. Participants were assured that their comments would be anonymous and their identity not included. In situations with especially vulnerable populations such as foreign-born folks or survivors of intimate partner violence, facilitators refrained from recording the meetings if the participants were uncomfortable. Participants generally took some time to become comfortable, opening up as others shared experiences with the healthcare system. 8 On many occasions, participants became emotional and expressed distress or anger over how they and their 'ohana were treated. This honesty seemed indicative of feeling safe and encouraged others to similarly share passionate perspectives. Discussions frequently included exploration of systemic racism, language bias, and discrimination based on substance abuse or sheltered status. Each in their own ways, community meetings began with an opening of space and recognition of the place hosting the discussion. Discussion of the 2018 priorities helped to orient the discussion. The three subsections of Foundation, Community, and Healthcare provided a framework for understanding the various upstream determinants and downstream impacts. \"Foundational\" elements are the furthest upstream determinants of health. Starting there allowed for a broader snapshot of the lived experiences of the participants. Housing and financial security were resounding themes among nearly every group. \"Community\" generally revealed 8 Generally, this report refers to the \"healthcare system\" as the collective organizations and people, whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health, typically through a more clinical setting such as hospitals and health centers. The \"healthcare continuum\" is used to reference the broader collective of organizations and people, who are involved in impacting the health of a person or community through a continuum of care, such as social work, skilled nursing, in-home care, non-clinical healthcare, and impacting upstream social determinants of health. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 10 uniquenesses of different regional experiences. Response to sense of place, for example, was significantly different on the island of Hawaii versus in urban Honolulu. \"Healthcare\" generally focused on the importance of trust in the healthcare system and accessibility of care. Most participants were comfortable enough to express both frustrations as well as positive experiences. To ensure all were heard, facilitators tried to conclude discussions by asking each participant: 1. What is the biggest obstacle to being healthy for you or your community?, and 2. If you could give one piece of advice to hospital administrators about serving your community, what would it be? The substantive suggestions from the community offered recommendations for how to develop trust, which was widely recognized as a key component in the ability for hospitals to meaningfully address the Significant Health Needs identified. Key Informant Interviews The Ward Team conducted 80 key informant interviews with individuals in key stakeholder positions able to provide input and insight on behalf of a target population. These tended to be organizational leaders serving stakeholder communities versus members of those actual populations that joined community meetings. Interviews were typically one on one between an interviewer and a key informant, lasting anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes. Interviews included representation from a wide variety of stakeholder groups, including; all of the sponsoring Hawaii hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Native Hawaiian health centers, community clinics, community-based organizations doing health-related work, community-based organizations working in the areas of upstream determinants, community-based organizations specializing in working with particular subpopulations, recognized community leaders in hard to reach communities, and many that were referred as critical experts or community leaders throughout the CHNA process. Discussions began with a review of the 2018 Statewide Priorities to assess current relevance, identifying where notable progress had been made, or ground had been lost, and asking if anything was found to be missing from the Priorities. The next set of questions addressed the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on those priorities, asked participants to think about any fracture points in the system which had been illuminated by the pandemic, and sought to identify the short- and long-term impacts anticipated. Lastly, the perceived role of hospitals in addressing these health needs was discussed, with a particular interest in exploring aspects of building trust in the healthcare system and identifying actionable steps hospitals might take. Key informant interviews were critical in capturing both the systemic as well as specific needs and opportunities for implementing best practices. Often interviewees were the key to unlocking critical dialogue with other parts of their communities of need. In many cases, the key informants participated in 2018 and offered valuable continuity perspectives. In all instances, informants offered generous input and unique viewpoints from direct and critical experiences. Appendix E includes the list of 2021 key informants, as well as the discussion outline used in the interviews. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 11 UH Partnership As the community health needs assessment process began, three key areas started to emer ge as themes for a greater level of need and priority: housing, food security , and mental health needs. The Ward Team put together a series of opportunities to engage at different levels around each topic, entitled \" Impacts of COVID-19 on the Social Determinants of Health\". (See Appendix F for a listing of the panel members and topics covered.) The Ward Team partnered with the University of Hawaii, Thompson School of Social Work & Public Health, to host three separate panel presentations featuring faculty topic area experts. Co-moderated by Interim Dean Tetine Sentell, Ph.D., and a member of Team Ward and attended by interested members of the Steering Committee and the Community Advisory Committee (CAC), the discussions elicited rich systemwide input around these three priorities. Held virtually on Zoom, attendees were encouraged to send questions in advance and/or put questions into the chat. The sessions began with a brief synopsis of CHNA learning to date on the topic area, introductions and brief presentations by each of the panelists, and subsequent discussion and Q&A. Dialogue around intersectionality explored how each priority integrates and works together for positive and negative health outcomes. Small Groups The Ward Team also held a series of private small group meetings with key leaders in three of these areas (food security, mental health, and housing). (Note that two of these necessitated additional one-on-one interviews, rather than small groups, given scheduling dif ficulties and the desire to speak with key individuals). These interviews followed the completion of most of the key informant interviews and community meetings and benefitted from that learning to date. The focus of discussion was around identifying COVID-19 adaptation strategies that worked and how that learning can be carried forward and built upon. Much of this discussion has augmented the Best Practice strategies highlighted in this report. Secondary Data Compilation Given the crucial secondary data collected in the 2018 CHNA, the Ward Team committed to updating that data to create trend information for this and future CHNA efforts. The secondary data included in the body of this report represents information relative to the four priority areas. Data related to the continuing Significant Health Needs are provided in a separate addendum to the report. It is important to note that while the data were updated, much of the \"new\" information is from 2019 or earlier, i.e., pre-pandemic, given the reporting lag. That data has been included, but caution is advised, as 2020 data forward may provide a dif ferent picture. Literature Review A literature review was conducted as part of the CHNA, reviewing four reports from other U.S. markets, as identified in the RFP and recommended by members of the Steering Committee. The review concentrated on best practices, particularly related to the prioritization process, and was shared with the Committee early in the assessment. This review resulted in the development of Hoolkahi, the iterative process used by Team Ward, the Steering Committee, and the Community Advisory Committee. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 12 ____________________ ____________________ Steering Committee In 2018, the Steering Committee included hospital representatives, government agencies, and community members. In 2021, the process included a Steering Committee (composed of representatives from the hospitals) and a Community Advisory Committee (of other key stakeholders). Most Steering Committee members participated in key informant interviews to provide their perspectives on the current priorities and COVID-19 and its impacts. Members were extremely supportive in identifying community-based partners and or ganizations to reach out to and engage with to encourage participation. Through monthly meetings, members provided insight and feedback on the assessment progress, especially attentive to ensuring a wide range of perspectives was being included and community member voices from traditionally underrepresented populations were heard. Members are included in Appendix C. Community Advisory Committee (CAC) In 2021, the Community Advisory Committee (CAC) was composed of community leaders serving various target communities. CAC members were especially generous with their time, input, and expertise throughout the process. In addition to being key informants, they also participated in meetings during the last phase of the assessment and report and helped to make critical connections where there were gaps, ensure that things were ground-truthed with what they saw in their communities, and provided input as to how the priorities could be helpful both within the clinical and community-based contexts. Finally, the CAC helped develop the final priorities and ensure that the Significant Health Needs , 2021 priorities, and COVID-19 all work together to paint the current picture of the community health needs. The rich input of this assessment, and the recommendation for future partnership opportunities, owe much to the invaluable input and support of the CAC members. Members are included in Appendix D. \"The opportunity that is ahead of us is to take what community has been doing, what the healthcare systems have been doing, and how we have both responded and have had to partner to respond to COVID. Community health workers are where we can use their expertise and our connectedness to community as the way that we move forward together.\" CAC Member 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 13 -HO'OLOKAHI Prioritization Process In response to inquiries from a few members of the Steering Committee, the Ward Team developed a prioritization process influenced by a traditional Delphi Method structured for Hawaii and HAH. The central premise is a structured and iterative communication technique to integrate the input of experts towards a consensus. The process that emerged was Hoolkahi, \"to bring into unison\". With the 2018 priorities as a basis, the Ward Team synthesized input from all sources and proposed prioritization options for feedback to the Steering Committee and CAC. The Ward Team guided this process by presenting progressive prioritizations for feedback, integrated input, refined the prioritization, and presented it again for feedback until agreed upon. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 14 We need to stop just pulling people out of the the river.

COVID-19 Impacts In early 2020, the world became aware of a highly contagious and rapidly spreading acute disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19), with various short- and long-term symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to death. 9 By March 2020, the State of Hawaii joined the rest of the United States in declaring an emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the next 22-months and ongoing as of the writing of this report, the pandemic has touched nearly every single part of life in Hawaii. Hawaii health care systems have faced significant and ongoing strain, requiring HAH to request the support of hundreds of U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) nurses throughout 2021 and causing one hospital to declare an emergency in August 2021. Non-emergent operations were canceled and postponed. Guests were strictly limited, even at the end of life. Emergency response capacity building measures were implemented including field clinics and on-site tent operations. For almost a year, before COVID-19 vaccinations were made available to the greater general public, progressively restrictive limitations were placed at both the state and local levels to manage viral spread through person-to-person interactions and mitigate the devastating impacts of the virus, which had disproportionately negatively impacts on Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islander, seniors, and vulnerable populations with underlying health conditions. Ongoing health care needs transitioned nearly completely virtual where possible, as did much of life. However , many routine screenings and health maintenance visits were missed; ramifications that may not be fully appreciated for years to come. Many businesses closed, travel in and out of the state was constricted for periods, unemployment rose to over 20%, schools were closed, and the federal government passed significant resources to help pay for the immediate health, community, and economic impacts on communities across the United States. Despite the significant impacts, the health-driven approach is largely believed to have saved hundreds if not thousands of lives, with just over 1,000 Hawaii residents having lost their lives due to COVID-19 as of the writing of this report. States that took less precautionary measures saw death per 100,000 people at nearly ten times the rate of Hawaii. 10 The impact that COVID-19 has had and continues to have will take years to be fully understood and measured. Most of the Significant Health Needs identified in 2018 were discussed as having been exacerbated and exposed by COVID-19. In some cases, such as financial insecurity and mental health, COVID-19 introduced new and consequential stressors. Pre-existing inequities 9 World Health Organization. 10 Becker's Hospital Review, describing the New York Times \"Latest Map and Case Count\" as of January 6, 2022. See: https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/us-coronavirus-deaths-by-state-july-1.html. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 16 ____________________ ____________________ were exposed and put marginalized communities further at risk.11 Many participants caution that these needs preexisted the COVID-19 pandemic. In many instances, participants described COVID-19 as shining a light on pre-existing fractures in our community foundations. Indeed, blaming COVID-19 for many of these chronic needs facing Hawaii's communities would be a misunderstanding of those impacts. Many community participants even identified silver linings. This devastating event has allowed Hawaii to take a closer look at these needs that were long ignored, overlooked, or not profoundly understood before COVID-19. The last 20 months have forced all sectors and segments of life to see plainly many of the fracture points. The calls to reject a \"return to normal\" have been deafening. Community-based organizations have put forward visions for what Hawai'i can transform to as a post-pandemic world becomes a reality . Although we have yet to see what will manifest, there have been significant \"opportunity seeds\" sown into the soil if only we water and nurture them. Needed resources coming in from the federal government have allowed the funding of long-overdue pilots and community-based concepts. While it is unsure in the long run how these programs will be supported after the federal funding is exhausted, it has provided a unique opportunity to try the programs and determine what does and does not work. Meaningful advancements have been made in digital and virtual engagement. Though this report will discuss some of that impact on those communities left behind, this event has forced systems to propel forward in ways that they have been trudging along for decades, with information technology professionals slowly pulling out their hair, hoping the rest of us will catch on. Perhaps the most exciting are the partnerships that have been born between community systems, across sectors, between government agencies, and interconnecting siloed ef forts that have the potential to carry the future forward. Throughout this report, COVID-19 impacts are uniquely discussed through each of the Significant Health Needs and 2021 priorities will be discussed in the relevant sections. \"What we know is that most of those risks are rooted in social determinants of health.

It must also prioritize those health needs, as well as identify resources potentially available to address them.\" 12 Hospital facilities may decide whether a health need is significant by evaluating any of the information gathered or known about its community. In 2018, the CHNA process identified 11 Priorities across 3 Goals. Each priority continued to maintain importance in 2021, and they are now called \"Significant Health Needs.\" From those Significant Health Needs, the 2021 CHNA identified 5 Priorities. Aside from some changes in wording, the Significant Health Needs remain the same. Given the prioritization framework, the structure by goal was not maintained. The graphic below cross-walks the changes from 2018 Priorities (left in orange) to 2021 Priorities and Significant Health Needs (right in blue). 12 IRS Community Health Needs Assessment for Charitable Hospital Organizations - Section 501(r)(3). 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 18 I SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS STRONG FAMILIES I EMERGENCY PREPARED I ENVIRONMENT K0PUNACARE I HEALTHYSTARTS I COMMUNITYCOHESIVENESS FINANCIAL SECURITY I FOOD SECURITY I MENTAL HEAL TH HOUSING I TRUST & EQUITABLE ACCESS Roots - Significant Health Needs .

These Significant Health Needs were in existence prior to the pandemic, with the COVID-19 experience highlighting the need to address these needs with greater urgency. While the social determinants of health, by their very nature, are interdependent and must be viewed holistically, the \"once in 100 years\" COVID-19 physical and societal impacts require focused efforts. The Significant Health Needs elevated to 2021 Priorities include: The increase in calls to Aloha United Way's 211 referral service corroborates several of the needs highlighted above, as the graph below illustrates. Calls to 211 related to housing increased almost 150% in 2020 over 2019, with dramatic increases in those related to healthcare, food, utilities, and financial assistance noted, as well. 2019 vs 2020 Comparison of Total Monthly Calls Processed by AUW 211 Hawaii Data Collaborative https://www.hawaiidata.org/news/2021/3/3/partnering-to-build-robust-211-data-resource 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 20 !!J_ ro 0 Top 211 Requests (Statewide) 2019 -2021 2019 2020 2021 16000 14457 14000 12000 10000 8000 6000 4000 2000 0 Housing & Highly Specific Healthcare & Food Utilities Govern men! & Employment & Shelter Needs/Other COVID-19 Legal Income Data provided by AJohai U nfted Way/211 No e: Year 2019 shows data from Jul Decemb .2019' only.

This report seeks to identify the priorities, understand and contextualize them, and identify potential strategies to address them. Truly understanding these priorities will require direct investigation through continued and expanded outreach to community partners and often underrepresented communities. Addressing them meaningfully will require working hand in hand with the leaders of each of these unique communities and ongoing investment into the necessary competencies. Community leaders throughout this assessment encouraged a greater level of self-ef ficacy than perhaps is typically acknowledged collectively. A self-efficacy that knows that we do have the tools, the knowledge, and the passion to take on these critical priorities with our community partners beyond healthcare. Acknowledging the intersectionality of many of the Significant Health Needs may provide a pathway towards stronger resiliency by understanding that social determinants of health can be impacted by the resources and talent of those already here in our community, both within healthcare and beyond. \"There are long term impacts for nancial insecurity. Folks who are struggling to keep housing over their heads, or still not returning to work, that income insecurity has stretched out longer than we imagined. Many parents have lost their jobs. So their children didn't go to college. When we look at our graduating class of 2020 and 2021, the decision-making for their parents and for themselves on whether they pursued a career, college, or post-secondary education, will impact the wealth of that family generationally.\" Community Foundation Leader 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 22 ____________________ ____________________ FINANCIAL SECURITY The Secondary Data Story Note: Much of the data available at the time of report preparation is pre-pandemic. Experts in the field all agree that, when data are available, the picture will be even more critical. Financial Hardship While many of Hawaii's households have been severely impacted by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the economic environment before the pandemic paints a picture of a slowly recovering state, but one still in financially dire straits. Hawaii's financially struggling families found it difficult to afford basic needs such as housing, food, childcare, healthcare, transportation, taxes, and, as seen from the pandemic, technology. The high cost of living in Hawaii outweighs their salary, which often leads to being forced to make difficult choices for their ohana. The struggle of local families to survive on low-income, job instability, and limited access to build any financial cushion has caused many to fall into the ALICE category. Although only one indicator, financial stability is interconnected with community health through access and other barriers. ALICE is defined as Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) but less than the basic cost of living for the county (the ALICE Threshold). ALICE workers are an essential part of our society, from teacher assistants to health aides to hairstylists to sales clerks. These are residents who are employed but do not earn enough to provide basic needs for their families. When you factor in ALICE with the poverty level, Hawaii was reported to have 148,771 ALICE households (33%) and nearly 9% (more than 41,619 people) living in poverty in 2018. Hawai'i County (48%) continued to lead other counties in the proportion of ALICE households and those living below the federal poverty level. Estimates for 2020 are that ALICE households comprised 59% of Hawaii's households post-shutdown, a shocking 17-point increase. \"I worry that we are hearing a lot about 'budgeting' for families.

Significant financial resources have poured into the state to deal with immediate impacts; however, community organizers expressed concerns over how their communities would fare as those state and county emergency relief programs draw to a close and families are left in a financial position that was already worsening before the pandemic and has been since compounded. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 25 PRACTICE: Volunteers with the Marshallese Association of Kaua'i, in partnership with HcYola Lahui, assisted community members in applying for unemployment, relief programs, and accessing telehealth as many of these programs lacked translation services or the understanding of how to work with Marshallese people. A number of other community organizations across nearly all islands were pointed to as having similar volunteer support efforts during and before the pandemic. Providing funding and resources for this kind of care coordination was widely recommended across many communities. ____________________ ____________________ One of the areas of relief was Unemployment Insurance (UI), which provided some relief to over 564,972 residents from March 18, 2020, to January 7, 202213. However, the system was not prepared to handle the tremendous volume, and residents reported waiting months for benefits, spending hours every day on the phone trying to get through to provide information to staff. A number of organizers talked about the stress this added to the stressors already on families. There were some residents unable to receive benefits at all. Immigrant and COFA14 migrant communities repeatedly discussed barriers to accessing UI, with many families never receiving financial assistance. Members of these communities were often filling essential worker jobs or had to take such positions because they were unable to access UI, and thus they and their families were further exposed to the spread of COVID-19. COFA communities across the state came together to support their families with food, quarantine housing, support in navigating programs, and all aspects of critical support systems. However, often, this work was done as volunteers with limited resources. The few paid positions were part-time or on-call and tended to focus on translation services alone rather than care coordination and helping to support community members to navigate processes. Those without access to family members or community leaders to assist them were often left behind. \"One of the reasons we formed the task force is that we would be left behind if we didn't. COVID exposed the health disparities. And we stood up to do something about it.\" COFA Community Leader 13 State of Hawaii, Unemployment Weekly Updates, available at: http://dbedt.hawaii.gov/economic/unemployment-2021-ui_state_2022/. 14 COFA refers to the Compact of Free Association between the United States and these countries.

All zip codes, census tracts, counties, and county equivalents in the United States are given an index value from O (low need) to J 00 (high need). To help you find the areas of highest need in your community, the selected locations are ranked from I (low need) to 5 (high need) based on their index value. Red dots depict the highest levels (5) areas, while the blue dots represent the areas ranked as a 4. The zip codes in Hawai'i with the highest levels of socioeconomic need are found in the Maunaloa and Ho'olchua areas in Maui County, in Hawai'i County, and the Wai'anae and Urban Honolulu areas in Honolulu County. Neither Kauai nor Maui Island had index values ranked as 5 or 4, based on ZIPCode data. This is most likely due to heterogeneous neighborhoods in ZJPCodes on Health Needs Assessment Page 27 ____________________ ____________________ FOOD SECURITY Recent natural disasters have shown just how vulnerable we are as a state, especially in rural areas and islands with varying periodic barge deliveries. It is estimated that 85-90% of Hawaii's food is imported15, proving the necessity to be more sustainable in order to face future threats. This priority seeks to understand and address both hunger and related food insecurity as well as food systems and pathways that can be strengthened for greater economic, ecological, and sustainable resiliency. The Secondary Data Story Note: Much of the data available at the time of report preparation is pre-pandemic. Experts in the field all agree that, when data are available, the picture will be even more critical. Access to Food Despite federal stimulus payments and programs to assist in rent and food, residents still faced difficulty in providing basic needs. According to Feeding America data from 2019, 162,220 residents face hunger, with 54,700 of them children. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, 11.5% of Hawaii households were food insecure, meaning there was difficulty in providing good, healthy food to their ohana because of a lack of money. 13.1% of Hawaii County households were food insecure, as compared to 9.8% in Kauai County. Data from the Accountable Health Communities Hawaii Project shows food sitting atop the list of needs reported by individuals screened across practice sites at five Oahu facilities: The Queen's Medical Center - Punchbowl and Queen's Medical Center - West Oahu, Kalihi-Plama Health Center, University Health Partners (Family Medicine Clinic), and Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center. Note that data spans pre-pandemic through October 2021. \"There are Medicare gaps among our Seniors, where they make a little too much income to qualify for Medicaid, so they make food versus medicine choices and don't get the treatment they need or use the hospital for care services.\" Government Leader, Maui Nui 15Office of Planning, DBEDT, State of Hawaii, \"Increased Food Security and Food Self-Sufficiency Strategy\" (October 2012). 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 28 Food Living situation Transportation Utilities Interpersonal safety 0% Health-Related more- heBIIIH'el81:ed !IOciel need.

All zip codes, census tracts, counties, and county equivalents in the United States are given an index value from 0 (low need) to I 00 (high need). To help you find the areas of highest need in your community, the selected locations are ranked from I (low need) to 5 (high need) based on their index value. Red dots depict the highest levels (5) areas, while the blue dots represent the areas ranked as a 4.

Neither Kauai nor Maui Island had index values ranked as 5 or 4, based on ZIPCode data. This is most likely due to heterogeneous neighborhoods in ZIPCodes on those FAO, METI/NASA, USGS, 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 31 PRACTICES The Kupuna Food Security Coalition emerged from the pandemic as a partnership among non-profit, government, community members. care facilities, hospitals, FQHCs, and private partners seeking to support the food needs of seniors, who were homebound during the beginning of the pandemic. Led by the Honolulu Executive Office on Aging, HIPHI, and AARP, the coalition took a strategy of partnership, relationship building across all partners seeking to meet the needs of seniors, and ultimately building a trust-based coalition that has since been leveraged to meet other senior needs including wellness checks and vaccinations. BEST PRACTICES In 2020, the City and County of Honolulu utilized CARES funds to build community food gardens at seven of its special needs housing projects housing homeless youth, domestic violence survivors, and kupuna. These families expressed a desire for more significant food securities especially given the limited means. One of the housing programs for previously homeless families partnered with Kekua Kali hi Valley to put together their gardens and utilize them as a curriculum for their youth. Access to Healthy Food In 2018, this was one of the 11 identified priorities, and there was robust discussion around access to healthy, locally grown, sustainable food. In 2021, with over a year of some families not being able to access food at all, the importance of both individual and household level food security and communitywide food security became heightened. Some community members expressed concerns around backsliding of keiki 16 nutrition and interruptions to farmers markets. With so much of Hawaii's food supply reliant upon overseas and inter-island transport by ocean barges and/or container ships, the State Emergency Operations Plan notes that the hub-and-spoke model of Hawai'i's shipping network, the vulnerability of island ports and harbors, and the minimal logistics system for distribution of commodities has rendered problematic the development of a large and sustainable warehousing system with sufficient capacity to meet surges in demand and/or withstand long impacts or interruptions. There is an estimated 5-7 days of food supply in-state, and a disruption to the supply chain would have an almost immediate impact on the population. 17 Community participants in a number of rural areas noted that there were grocery stores in their communities during the pandemic that completely shut down due to supply chain issues. These vulnerabilities are one reason that decades-long calls for investments in greater agriculture participation to support food security both as a normal course and especially in times of impact have grown. Countless articles over the past two years have discussed opportunities for investing the thousands of agriculturally zoned lands across the paeina into agriculture, supporting local farmers, and making food security accessible on a household level through food gardens and other neighborhood solutions. Organizations like ina Aloha Economic Futures have put forward visions for how to rebuild towards a circular economy with restorative and regenerative economies with investment in local food security as a pillar. 18 16 Keiki is the Hawaiian word for child or children 17 State of Hawaii, Emergency Management Agency, \"Emergency Operations Plan\" (November 2019), available at: https://dod.hawaii.gov/hiema/files/2020/02/Hawaii-State-EOP-Fall-2019-Published.pdf. 18 See: 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 32 ____________________ ____________________ Efforts like the Food Pantry, a no waste, healthy food resource using online ordering, helped to empower communities to come together. Community organizations played critical roles in helping to mitigate food insecurity in a wide range of ways. These grassroots partnerships coordinated and distributed local produce from local farms to families in need. While these community efforts proved effective, a University of Hawaii, College of Social Sciences study completed in March 2021, \"Addressing Hunger and Food Insecurity among Hawaii' s Families,\" observed several barriers that should be addressed: A lack of public awareness of available services Shame about needing to use food services Transportation (some food distributions are drive-up only) Difficulty receiving benefits without a stable address Lack of a coordinated plan statewide for addressing food insecurity Despite the challenges, food distributions provided an opportunity for many non-profit programs to connect with their communities. Outreach was paired with wellness checks, vaccination access, checking in for intimate partner violence, assessments for in-home health services, and enrollment in SNAP benefits for those that were eligible. The industry coordination created mesh networks to meet broad communities while minimizing overlap. Those networks built important trust connections that may allow an even deeper ability to reach people where they are and support their health needs. Greater opportunity exists to make families aware of resources available to them. Programs such as \"Da Bux\" helps to lower the cost of healthy food for SNAP eligible households and make healthy food more accessible. Building of gardens at affordable housing projects, where people are living and gathering, was an investment some organizations and counties made during the pandemic to help families to access healthy food right at their own homes - vegetables, fruit trees, herbs - with success at multi-family properties where enough families indicated in advance they were interested and would help care for a food garden if provided the opportunity . \"Many people have diabetes because of their unhealthy diet, where the only food that was fresh was sh or breadfruit. Everything else was canned - we did not grow up eating fruits and vegetables. You buy the food that is gonna feed your entire household. It's a matter of survival.\" COFA Community Leader, Maui 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 33 MENTAL & BEHAVIORAL HEALTH The Secondary Data Story Note: Much of the data available at the time of report preparation is pre-pandemic.

Among those interviewed, there was overwhelming agreement that the mental and behavioral health challenges that existed in Hawaii before the pandemic have only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 experience. Some hypothesized that it is in mental health where the greatest cracks in the system have long existed, with past cutbacks in state funding and a dearth of providers resulting in nowhere to send those screened and identified as needing assistance. Rebuilding the mental health system infrastructure was identified as critically necessary by a number of key informants. Looking to the future, there is great concern about the long-term mental and behavioral health impacts of the pandemic experience, impacts that perhaps cannot yet be appreciated. The isolation and lack of social interaction on the part of school children, who may slow in social and academic development, likely will result in behavioral problems that manifest down the road. Kpuna have suffered from limited social interaction, closure of senior daycares, and limited contact with their families. The stresses on families of parents working from home (if not laid off from their jobs), attending to their school-aged children struggling with distance learning, trying to manage financial needs, and dealing with healthcare challenges all will take a toll. Domestic violence and sexual abuse reports have increased. Reporting of child abuse cases declined dramatically when schools were closed, experts indicated, as schools were a primary source of identification. \"The COVID impact on mental and behavioral health will be long-lasting. We don't have a mental health hospital, no crisis center, etc. We don't have the safety net to address the issues on hand now, and more will come.\" Mental and Behavioral Health Service Provider, O ahu Overall, communities across the state saw a decrease in the accessibility to mental health resources. Providers and patients alike shared an overall decrease in appointment availability, resulting in lengthy delays for patients needing to access mental health providers in the community. As appointments transitioned to telehealth, patients without access to a phone or computer, or with anxiety around use and lack of privacy at home, were negatively impacted. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 36 ____________________ ____________________ Although a challenge for many, the growth of telehealth increased access for many as well. Community providers moved counseling sessions to video, breaking down geographic barriers. Whereas a family might have needed to bring their child across an island for counseling, for example - if transportation and time permitted - this barrier was now removed. Without geographic barriers, experts related that some services available on the U.S. continent could be remotely accessed, helping to address the shortage of providers available in Hawaii. Telemedicine also has the potential to help address the shortage of mental health professionals in Hawaii, because providers can be anywhere. It is believed by mental health experts that the move to telehealth can be combined with in-person services as we emer ge from the pandemic; that it will be one of the lasting positive impacts of the COVID-19 experience on mental health. \"I think there's been a change in the lens, the paradigms through which we see some of these mental health issues. It's a trauma-informed lens. It's a recognition that these are not broken people. WE are not broken people. We are people who have had particular sets of experiences that have been extraordinary, and our responses are actually normative in the sense that this is exactly what you would expect under such incredible circumstances. Culturally and historically across time, these are events that have created ways of relating and understanding our world. And sometimes our coping strategies become potential barriers. And it becomes important to recognize the impacts of these traumas and the impacts and the consequences of these traumas. And recognize them rather than as abnormal reactions; instead, incredibly normal reactions to extraordinary circumstances.\" Behavioral Health Educator 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 37 HOUSING Note: Much of the data available at the time of report preparation is pre-pandemic. Experts in the field all agree that, when data are available, the picture will be even more critical. The Secondary Data Story Income, Home Ownership, Housing Supply According to the 2020 U.S. Census, 41.1% of Hawaii residents (about 2 in 5) live in renter-occupied housing units; the City and County of Honolulu registered the highest among all counties, at 43.8%. The pandemic has brought more individuals to rethink their current living conditions, from living in the congested urban core to living in a less dense or even rural area. Low interest rates and the ability to work remotely have made Hawaii's housing market even more competitive among local and out-of-state buyers, often purchasing above market price. The U.S. Census American Community Survey's 5-year estimate for 2015-2019 reported the median housing unit value in Hawaii was $615,300, while nationally, it was $217,500. A recent study from Title Guaranty Hawaii reported that in May 2021, the median sales price for a single-family home on Oahu was $980,000, and it has since exceeded $1,000,000. In partnership with the counties, the State of Hawaii performs a housing gap study every three years. The need for housing at all income levels has steadily increased yearly since the study began. The most recent study in 2019 demonstrates that over 65,000 housing units are needed statewide to address housing needs by 2025. Housing is built at a rate of only a few thousand units per year. While just over half of those units are needed for families earning 80% or below the annual median income, considered low to moderate-income, it is clear that this is not a problem simply for low-income families. Housing stability has an important upstream impact on mental and physical health. Instability and poor housing conditions lead to greater stress, increased exposure to unhealthy environments, and less access to healthy food options. A recent study illustrated that \"poverty and poor housing together are implicated in high rates of chronic diseases. Studies show a correlation of housing conditions with asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure and stroke, heart disease, and anxiety and depression. This is borne out by data for Hawai'i showing the disproportionate prevalence of these conditions among low-income households.\" 19 19 Good Health Depends On Decent Housing, Hawai'i Budget and Policy Center (December 2021), available at: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ef66d594879125d04f91774/t/61cbb9d2e388e752f5626375/1640741331194/ Health+%26+Housing+Handout.pdf 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 38 US HAWAII Hawai i County Maui County C&C of Honolulu Kauai income.

There has to be a major shift on housing - it is connected to everything. Soon, we will have no choice but to move away.\" Native Hawaiian Organization and Policy Leader Nearly every key informant interview and community meeting included discussion on the need for housing, even where represented communities or organizations were not necessarily focused on housing. Some of the less obvious examples of the impact that were shared include: Domestic violence organizations talked about the lack of a place to go being a primary barrier in most survivors fleeing abusive households. Both Maui and Kauai service providers shared a regular return of housing choice vouchers (Section 8) and other housing subsidies due to the inability to find a unit to rent, despite being able to pay market rent with the voucher. Overcrowded housing conditions for many families contributed to rapid and widespread COVID-19 impacts. Many low-income households were financially unable to afford to stop working or work remotely. These same families often struggled with being able to safely distance or quarantine within their home from family members when exposed to COVID-19. These compounding factors were identified as contributing to the disproportionate rate of death among Pacific Islander communities due to COVID-19. Hospitals reported holding patients who are homeless longer than medically necessary, unable to discharge because of lack of housing and no place to safely recover; adding to capacity issues at hospitals during COVID-19 surges. Every homeless provider discussed lack of housing as the most significant barrier in addressing houselessness. On Oahu alone, hundreds of individuals are considered \"housing ready\" and cannot even find rooms in a shared home or dorm-like dwelling to rent, much less a private unit. While many seniors and their families wish to age in place, the lack of affordable senior housing is a stated barrier for tens of thousands of local seniors. Senior housing and senior daycare can provide needed companionship and social opportunities for seniors who often face higher rates of depression, feelings of isolation, and suicide than the population.20 20 \"Four-Year Area Plan on Aging\", Honolulu Elderly Affairs Division (2019 - 2023), available at: https://www.elderlyaffairs.com/Portals/_AgencySite/docs/Area_Plan_2019-2023_FINAL_DRAFT_10-01-19.pdf. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 40 ____________________ ____________________ \"COVID-19 made Kaua i itself a desirable location for people around the country to retreat to. This drove up housing prices and made purchasing a home almost unattainable for Kauai locals. There is a perception that: No matter how hard you work or how many jobs you have, we just can't get ahead.'\" Hospital Administrator Homelessness is an important and critically related element of the housing crisis. Homeless service providers across the state indicated that while other issues impact houseless communities, there is no greater barrier to their having healthier lives than the lack of available, affordable, and accessible housing. An estimated 25% of persons experiencing homelessness on O'ahu live with a mental health problem, 28% live with a physical or developmental disability, and 17% are survivors of domestic violence, 4% of whom are actively fleeing.21 These challenges further demonstrate the layered relationships between the 2021 Priorities and the importance of interconnected approaches. Housing First models have been successfully implemented in Hawaii and demonstrate positive health outcomes by high likelihood of staying housed, decreased use of drugs and emergent care, and increases in social engagement. Additionally, the direct healthcare benefit includes an estimated healthcare cost savings of $6,197 per client per month, representing a 76% decrease in healthcare costs after housing placement.22 Both national and local reports repeatedly demonstrate that the cost of addressing impacts of homelessness far exceed the cost of providing stable, permanent, supportive housing for those experiencing homelessness.23 Recently, Medicaid has added Community Integration Services (CIS) as eligible for coverage. This includes providing housing support services with the goals: \"(1) Support the member's transition to housing; (2) Increase long-term stability in housing in the community; and (3) Avoid future periods of homelessness and institutionalization for members.\" 24 Two homeless service agencies have become or are in the process of becoming enrolled providers. Going into the pandemic, in January 2020, the Point-in-Time Count performed by Partners in Care identified 6,458 individuals as homeless, with 3,650 of these unsheltered. Hawaii's homeless rate leads the nation in dramatic numbers, at 45.5 per 10,000 (HI) vs. 17.3 (nation). 21 2020 O'ahu Point in Time Count, Partners in Care (2020), available at: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5db76f1aadbeba4fb77280f1/t/5efa984a8ae4f774863509e8/1593481306526/PI C+2020+PIT+Count+Report+Final.pdf 22 Hawaii Pathways Project, State of Hawaii, see: https://homelessness.hawaii.gov/housing/. 23 Good Health Depends On Decent Housing, Hawai'i Budget and Policy Center (December 2021). 24 Medicaid Community Integration Services, Homelessness Initiative, see: http://homelessness.hawaii.gov/cis/. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 41 ____________________ ____________________ Many of the unsheltered individuals face major health issues caused by exposure to the elements and safety issues.

Underserved communities are often so because there are barriers to accessing, understanding, or being aware of those services and offerings. Focusing on equitable access becomes an opportunity for hospitals to meet people where they are, apply trauma-informed care principles, and help build meaningful relationships with those communities. In doing so, trust can be built, or in some cases rebuilt, to allow communities to try to gain meaningful access and better address the population's needs. Investments into building systems that will increase access to healthcare can also have a leveraging effect to increase access beyond healthcare and in support of addressing upstream determinants. For example, as will be discussed in more detail in Section III. B., hospitals' inclusion of community health workers can help people navigate the healthcare system and also be connected to existing services, programs, and organizations. Throughout the assessment, community organizers emphasized their interest in supporting connectivity between hospitals and community service providers. Hospitals can be seen as an important entry point to existing services and programs beyond healthcare. Developing and improving direct relationships to support warm handoffs during discharge can help to make meaningful progress in increasing access beyond healthcare. When discussing access to medical care or the broader healthcare system with neighbor island, rural, marginalized ethnic populations or kpuna, consistent themes emerged around the following areas of systemic barriers: Transportation Safety Language Access Digital Literacy & Access Cultural Competence Insurance Stigma & Bias Trust 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 43 ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Transportation While for some, the ability to work remotely and engage with telehealth has had a positive impact in increasing access, there are several ways in which transportation is a persistent barrier to healthcare for large portions of our community. The first is the proximity of clinics or hospitals to the populations that they serve and the viability of public transportation in relation to those places. Respondents on neighbor islands and rural areas of Oahu told stories of being discharged from the ER in the middle of the night and having no way to return home because they did not have a vehicle or a ride. Others talked about the difficulty of taking large chunks of time off from work to travel by bus to an appointment; making it less likely for them to keep up with recommended visits. \"If you are on Moloka i, then your options have gone backwards. You have to get on a very small plane. No available flights. If you use a wheelchair on Moloka i, they hoist you up on a forklift. Also, if you need nursing care, they have to ship you o island.\" Kpuna Care Provider, Maui Among Neighbor island residents, Lna'i and Molokai respondents were especially vocal concerning the lack of specialists or routine care that they could access on-island. One registered nurse on Lna'i told the story of her own fight with breast cancer during the pandemic and needing to arrange flights during the inter-island travel ban or take a ferry to Maui. For those serving kpuna on Molokai, the consensus was that one could not age safely on-island due to the lack of complete care needs. \"I got breast cancer - I had a problem, needed to have radiation daily. I had to change providers so that I could go to Maui instead of O ahu, so that I could go by boat and not fly during the COVID restrictions. The ferries were only running two days a week, so I had to stay on Maui for my treatment. I had a place to stay with friends and access to a car - but not everyone has those things.\" Lnai Caregiver On Kauai, the lack of residential treatment facilities means that those who get care are typically covered by insurance to travel to and stay on Oahu. Far more don't receive care, especially if it is difficult to find options with keiki care. Domestic violence survivors in an off-island program talked about how not having a place to go on Kauai was a significant factor in their not leaving their abusive situation earlier. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 44 ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ \"Language barrier is the top, number one. At the hospitals when you're visiting your doctor, a lot of interpreters don't know what the doctor said, and it might be because the interpreter does not understand the medical terminology. During COVID, when you had to get tested or you had to get the vaccine, everybody had to go online and pre-register. Well, not everybody has access and internet. And on top of that, they don't understand the questions because they are all in English. We helped. We just told people - give me your information and we will sign you up.\" Kpuna Care Provider, Maui Language Access Despite 18% of Hawaii residents being foreign-born, accounting for approximately 255,499 people,25 many of the Limited English Proficiency (LEP) communities that were interviewed for this survey felt that language access was the most significant barrier to receiving adequate care. Language access can be interpreted as shorthand for \"culturally-competent, linguistically-appropriate care\". The stories that immigrant participants often regaled were of extreme confusion concerning diagnosis, decision-making, and outpatient care. One Chuukese community leader and interpreter told a harrowing story of having to tell her aunt that her uncle was terminally ill because she was the only Chuukese interpreter available. Others commented on the challenges that arose due to lack of understanding of cultural protocols by medical staff. The importance of language and cultural representation among medical staff can be illustrated by one Thai farmer who participated in a community meeting; despite living in Kunia he would travel, by bus, into Kalihi to visit Kkua Kalihi Valley where he could be seen by a Thai doctor. \"They look up your name and they hear your accent, and they know you Micronesian, so they don't rush to take care of you.\" Chuukese participants, KKV, O ahu Cultural Competence Community members pointed to the State Department of Health, Office of Health Equity as an important resource that was shut down and is perhaps now being revived. They also pointed to the Pacific Islander community liaison position developed by the City & County of Honolulu as 25 New American Economy, \"Immigrants and Migrants in Hawaii: Essential Contributors to the State's Workforce and Economy\" (2021), available at: https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/NAE_Hawaii_V7_FINAL.pdf. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 45 PRACTICE: Built Environments Physical environments can help to break down barriers and create a greater feeling of warmth and belonging. One example shared was a food pantry at a campus being tucked away and hidden reinforcing a feeling of shame. Another campus featured the pantry in the middle of the dining hall with great lighting, signage, and a welcoming feeling that helped to break down possible stigmas. ____________________ ____________________ an example of progress for government institutions seeking to build relationships with community groups. Stigma & Bias In conversations with Native Hawaiian, COFA status, housing insecure, and former or current drug users, the issue of stigma was reiterated often. The feeling that care was being withheld or that they were being intentionally ignored by providers was common. For the Micronesian and houseless population, several participants asserted that they were receiving subpar care because the provider knew they didn't have medical insurance. Such biases and feelings of exclusion work in both directions, creating a barrier for individuals to want to access care, even when it is desperately needed. Behavioral health patients, as well as providers, sang a common refrain of clients receiving lower quality care due to judgments about addiction or mental health. The belief was that the stigma exists on the policy level as well, where resources, programs, and especially facilities are grossly lacking to provide the kind of care these populations need. \"One time I went to the hospital after my boyfriend bashed my head with a shing rod. He told them it was an accident. The nurses knew me and knew he abused me, but I overheard them saying - don't worry, she's just a chronic'.\" Domestic Violence Survivor Safety In relationships with intimate partner violence, safety is a significant barrier to receiving any medical care at all. Abusers isolate their partners, and keeping them from medical access is a form of maintaining control. When survivors do come into hospital settings, healthcare workers are not always trained in trauma-informed care and do not recognize the situation. Even when they do, and they find a way to privately offer assistance, without integrated services such as housing and safety plans, survivors feel they cannot risk leaving. Recommendations included requiring training on how to ask important questions, provide posters in every exam room, bathroom, or other potential location. Collaboration with domestic violence providers is an opportunity to create more warm handoffs for care, where there seems to be very little currently. Housing support services, an eligible Medicaid expense, can also be of value here to have within the hospital setting for these and other populations where housing support is a critical element of the individual's health needs. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 46 ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ \"You can't strengthen families if you don't know whether their family is a safe family. Kids living with families that are not safe do not have a healthy start at all. How do you treat the whole person if you are leaving out a whole portion of their reality?\" Domestic Violence Service Provider While the physical and sexual violence data still reflects data from 2013, it is important to point out that Hawaii's percentages are much higher than those for the nation overall. Domestic violence providers as well as hospital workers reported significant increases in intimate partner violence. \"Safer at Home\" slogans didn't apply to many people who were not safer at home but were afraid to go to shelters, which were facing the same constraints as other shelters with the need to spread out, and where their kids might get exposed to COVID-19, there were less opportunities to ask for help and develop safety plans, and courts were closed. Providers added services such as texting, online chat, and participated in at-home food delivery in order to meet people where they were and offer resources. One hospital worker indicated having patients that called 911 feigning illness to the Emergency Department and privately ask for help. \"The pandemic did not turn people into abusers.

Across the state, broadband access is spotty, with rural populations suffering the most and entire communities unable to regularly connect to internet service. The rise of telehealth has broadened the barrier to care among folks without internet, a device, or the training to use one. Many participants serving kpuna commented on how difficult it was to support their patients in using a device to make appointments, check their medical history, or keep up with public health information. For rural populations they simply lacked consistent access to broadband or did not have strong enough wifi to have multiple members of their household using it at the same time. Still, among Micronesian and Marshallese populations, few had regular access to a device, and the sites they needed to use were not translated. As stated above, underserved populations are typically underserved because there are systemic barriers they consistently encounter. Although these challenges are entrenched, difficult to solve, and require many years of focused work, there were several programs and initiatives shared as making meaningful progress. Meeting people where they are, and tapping into the technology they are using, is an important approach. For example, Honolulu County has created kiosks in grocery stores to assist people with basic licensing and vehicle registration. Similar tools, or partnering with existing ones, may be one way to utilize technology to bring healthcare into communities where they are. Many communities were delighted to see mobile and pop-up clinics coming to their neighborhood. Project Vision, Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies, Kaiser, Hawaii Pacific Health which were referenced often as excellent models, to be replicated and expanded. Progress was also made in addressing cultural and language barriers when Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian, and Filipino COVID-19 coalitions were brought together and started pushing for more contact tracer, in-language health information, and vaccination sites in their own communities. Insurance For 25 years COFA communities were unable to access Medicaid after being removed in 1996. Although the state continued to cover the federal portion for a period, it was dramatically reduced in 2009. One Marshallese physician at the time recalled, \"we heard stories of people actually going home to die because they couldn't get access to the health care they needed.\" 26 In December 2020, Congress restored COFA migrants as eligible for Medicaid, impacting an estimated 25,000 Hawaii residents, and efforts by community leaders to get their members enrolled are actively underway. But getting funding for those positions has been a challenge as organizations are largely left to grant processes. In the meantime, damage has already been done to the COFA community and many community members' relationship with healthcare. For 25 years, many community members did not go to the doctor at all, even for life-threatening issues, and saved what little money they could to try to 26 \"How Decades of Advocacy Helped to Restore Medicaid Access to Micronesian Migrants.\" Honolulu Civil Beat (December 2020), available at: https://www.civilbeat.org/2020/12/how-decades-of-advocacy-helped-restore-medicaid-access-to-micronesian-migra nts/. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 48 ---afford to pay out of pocket for care for their children. Being impacted by and having to pay for healthcare needs has also worked to keep COFA communities in poverty. Trying to rebuild those relationships and habits will take time and concerted effort. Trust Many of these fractures in access and in social relationships and conditions as a whole work together to create a lack of trust between communities and institutions, including hospitals. The lack of trust in the healthcare system, combined with distrust of government, has made current conditions ripe for misinformation and prevents many from engaging with providers, health educators, and others. While the root causes of this distrust may go back generations and is important to understand, it is instructive to focus on: a) how it currently manifests and b) what actions are needed to rebuild trust. Some examples of how this mistrust manifests that were shared in the course of the data collection include screening rates far below target thresholds, delaying early intervention until acute care is needed, and vaccine resistance. Opinions on what is needed to build trust in the healthcare system, and specifically what hospitals could do in this regard, were virtually unanimous. The key, they said, is outreach to the community, building relationships now in preparation for the next crisis. Had the investment in these relationships already been made, our pandemic experience might have been different, they thought. By outreach, key informants and community members were talking about getting out into the community, rather than waiting for the community to walk into the facility. The suggestions centered around these themes are explored more below: Utilize and invest in community health workers Build cultural competencies Develop greater collaboration and trust within the healthcare system Address common/consistent messaging Community Health Workers The pandemic experience has underscored the need for increased investment in community health workers (CHW); persons of the community working in the community. The most successful efforts in educating underserved communities have been those that identified and trained trusted people in the target communities, sometimes going door-to-door to distribute flyers and encourage vaccination and promote healthy behaviors. The CHW can aid community members in navigating the complex healthcare system, provide health education, dispel myths, and meet people where they are. Many examples of this were given and complimented, but in almost every instance, the position had run out of funding and been terminated, had put the CHW on part-time or on-call, and the work reverted back to volunteers. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 49 ____________________ ____________________ \"If they're from that community, they will not only be trusted, but will be really vested in the mission of improving those health outcomes.\" UH Faculty Professor \u2014 Nursing At times, there was a disconnect in the definitions of community health workers. Community-based key informants see them as \"of the community, in the community\"; well trained but not necessarily requiring advanced education. Often, most effective because they are known to the community in other capacities. Some seek CHW applicants with a solid educational background. Adding to the confusion, some of the hospitals refer to medical social workers - often bilingual - in their Emergency Department as CHW. Clarity in the definition will be helpful to finding common ground. Further complicating the discussion is whether and how a licensing process and regulation might work and to what degree it may be needed as a possible pathway to insurance reimbursement which would likely lead to better pay and job stability and security. Concerns are that this process and licensing costs may leave many of those integrated with the community behind another barrier, creating further divisions. CHWs are currently housed both in clinical and non-clinical settings. In some cases, status as part-time, temporary, or contractors create barriers in having consistent services available. Community volunteers often help to fill similar roles. Perhaps more than any other single recommendation, the Ward Team heard the value of investing in greater capacity in this area. Many hospitals already support CHWs in some way, and there seems to be great opportunity to work together with community organizations to build additional capacity both within the hospital setting and within the community setting while avoiding the risk of pulling critical community-based resources out. One of the challenges identified by some of the hospitals is the lack of reimbursement for CHW services. They identified the need for grants and health systems support, and endorsed the grant recently secured by the Department of Health to augment training programs statewide. 27 In 2018, Housing Services became eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. Hospitals may consider how to invest in these services to support the financial costs of CHW services. Additionally, having the resources available within the hospital makes them available for housing support and coordination with service providers as needed for domestic violence survivors and those experiencing houselessness. Although some homeless service providers have pursued certification, navigating the billable process is challenging for many non-profits and could be a partnership opportunity. 27 See: https://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/doh-news-release-2-2-million-grant-to-augment-community-health-workforc e-training-programs-statewide/ 2021 Community ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ \"We put out a plea to folks to help us. We used CARES money to do medical services in-house. We established contracts with every health plan on island to provide medical care. We became a credentialed Medicaid provider.\" Homeless Services Provider Building Cultural Competencies When speaking about building trust, participants talked about developing cultural competencies that go beyond staff training. Staff training certainly is a part of it, but to truly build that trust, they said, it needs to be operationalized. It needs to become part of the fabric of the organization, requiring a paradigm shift. An example during COVID-19 was the establishment of isolation/quarantine (ISO/Q) facilities for households unable to isolate or quarantine at home. Translation alone was not enough to make people comfortable to go to live in a place they did not know. A major shift happened with the COFA community when providers within their community were able to manage a ISO/Q hotel, helping to navigate people through the health system, making the property welcoming and warm, and managing it in a way that was culturally appropriate for community members to feel comfortable. \"When you take unique community needs to a large healthcare system, one that understands operational protocols, we fall short. We continue to not understand each other because there's no one translating the 'how'. It takes a special assertive role, like cultural programmer, and we often don't invest in those types of positions that help us to develop processes and protocols to operationalize trust in the context of care setting.\" Hawaii Hospital Representative For some routinely underserved communities, such as the COFA population, leaders commented that individuals were quick to abort care if they felt misunderstood or care came in a culturally inappropriate manner; these individuals would then be less likely to return to that provider for any further services. While telephonic interpretation is often better than patients not being able to communicate at all with their provider, most participants felt that it was grossly inadequate to: communicate clearly with the patient their care pathway; assist the patient in making the appropriate decision for themselves; reduce the stress or concern present; and understand or address unspoken cultural barriers or misunderstandings. There was resounding support for increasing the number of bilingual medical social workers, medical interpreters, and culturally-competent providers as the most meaningful way to address barriers to care for LEP communities. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 51 PRACTICE: A hospital and Area Agency on Aging is partnering on a pilot to bridge kupuna being discharged from hospital/facility based settings to appropriate and available home and community based services. The initial phase will have hospital discharge social workers screen kupuna that would benefit and meet eligibility criteria for home delivered meal services, which will be ready prior to or shortly after returning to the home setting and hopefully reducing re\u00ad admittance back to the hospital setting. Phase II hopes to explore integration of other home and community based services such as bathing, decluttering, and chores. Greater Collaboration Within Healthcare and Beyond An observation frequently mentioned in the key informant interviews was that greater collaboration within the healthcare industry would help build trust and better serve communities. They felt that competition within the healthcare industry may sometimes prevent community advancement, delay services, and ultimately further underserve marginalized populations. This perceived competition was not limited to the largest health systems, but was felt to permeate all parts of the healthcare industry - hospitals, urgent care clinics, FQHCs, primary care clinics, and eventually pharmacy-based primary care delivery - all competing for the same healthcare dollar. Greater collaboration would result in greater impact on the patients they serve and, potentially, lower healthcare costs, they thought. Looking to the broader healthcare continuum, nearly every social service provider indicated that a warm hand-off strategy would tremendously improve the working relationship, trust, and patient care. While hospitals may not be positioned to provide all aspects of care an individual needs, establishing close referrals and hand-off relationships can help ensure that care is received. Consistent Messaging Perhaps reflecting the challenges of communicating during a rapidly-changing pandemic, some thought that inconsistent messaging contributes to a distrust of the healthcare system. This can be seen by some as a failure to collaborate or as an example of the variety of \"facts\" available. An important communication strategy in building community trust is sharing successes. As recommendations from this assessment are implemented, reporting back and sharing those milestones as a direct result of engagement through the process helps to further reinforce the pilina - or relationships - that are built through processes such as these. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 52 C. Significant Health Needs The 2018 CHNA identified eleven (11) Priorities across three (3) goals. Throughout the process of research and input gathering for the 2021 CHNA, five (5) priorities emer ged as have been explored in depth above. However, the remaining 2018 Priorities were identified by community members and leaders as remaining critical to address. These continued needs are referred to as the \"Significant Health Needs\" by the IRS in Section 501(r)(3). Below is a brief update of key themes for each of the 11 Priorities from 2018. The table below provides brief themes and summaries taken from the statewide interviews and community conversations regarding each of the 11 Significant Health Needs. SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED 2021 SUMMARY Address financial insecurity. Respondents felt that financial insecurity had Create coordinated and systemic increased dramatically. Housing prices are higher, opportunities for communities and inflation has impacted the cost of household items, families to make good food and and unemployment has touched many families. housing realistically accessible, The most financially vulnerable said that develop workforce skills, create new unemployment and the Child Tax Credit had economic opportunities, build helped them significantly but those with more financial assets, and reestablish means had little recourse, and many faced food active lifestyles. scarcity or eviction. Work together for equity and justice. Work alongside affected populations to address inequitable treatment and opportunity. Most respondents commented that not much had been done to shift systemic racism, gender equity, income disparities, or bias, but they felt that most people were now aware of the issues that had been present all along. This narrative shift and understanding was seen as the first step towards addressing the issue. Discussions highlighted that access, resources, and challenges were not experienced equally by all genders. Strengthen safe families. Create the conditions and opportunities for families to be healing forces for its own members, including addressing financial stress that will enable more healthy time together. Respondents largely commented that while communities had, at times, grown stronger due to COVID-19, families were less safe and under greater strain than in 2018. Many highlighted the increase in intimate partner violence and child abuse due to sheltering at home, doubling up households, and the lack of resources or contact with educators who could report abuse. Prepare for emergencies. Mitigate future health impacts by engaging people, increasing understanding of the This priority was seen as having made the most progress of the foundational goals. Folks largely credited the collaboration of agencies and 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 53 most vulnerable populations, building organizations that are traditionally siloed as the food systems, and strengthening genesis of this progress. COVID-19 caused such relationships and community cohesion. an overwhelming emergency that traditional stakeholders had to get out of their comfort zone just to address basic needs of the community. Build good food systems. Establish access to nutritious food so that it is available to all. The public is now aware of how many keiki and kpuna are food insecure and Hawaii's reliance on imported foods. Many pointed to how folks began growing their own food, the creation of food hubs, and farmers' markets as positive steps forward. Increased usage of SNAP and \"Da Bux\" program, which partners with grocers to provide half off local produce, helped mitigate impacts. Restore environment and sense of place. Better protect Hawaii's natural resources, prepare adequately for climate change, develop good design and integration of the built environment, and reduce the negative environmental impacts of the visitor industry. Respondents commented that the biggest impact they had seen on this issue was when Hawaii shut down tourism, and our natural spaces were given room to heal. Many pointed to Hanauma Bay and other parks that were in better shape now. Most did not feel the current reliance on tourism is tenable or that enough is being done to mitigate the harm that tourism and climate change is having on our state. Over 80% of respondents to a 2021 health and well-being survey indicated the health of the land and ocean was important to their own well-being, with 63% of Native Hawaiians stating it was extremely important.28 Nurture community identity and Two situations were regularly commented on with cohesiveness. Support community-led regard to this priority. The first was COVID-19 and efforts through shared activities and how organizations and neighbors banded together events, active organizing around shared to meet basic needs and support the most purposes, and instilling community pride vulnerable. The second was the efforts to protect to foster greater trust and connectivity. Mauna Kea, and the growth of a shared identity and purpose among some of the Native Hawaiian population working together. Invest in teenagers and healthy starts. Invest in health and education at the earliest stages of life. Support school-based structures, community-based activities, and youth empowerment for pre-teens and teens. Respondents were frequently distressed by this priority, with some commenting that it had regressed seriously in the last three years. Concerns were raised about increase in child neglect and the need for more training to identify signs. Teens no longer had access to their peers or after-school programs. Teen vaping and suicide rates rose. Access to early childhood care and 28 Imi Pono Hawaii Well-Being Survey 2021, see: https://marzanoresearch.shinyapps.io/HawaiiDashboard2/. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 54 support was similarly scarce and unreliable. Outcomes for homeless youth and youth identifying as LGBTQIA are especially disparate.29 Those that have 4+ childhood traumas are 17 times more likely to experience substance abuse. Shift kpuna care away from \"sick Respondents commented that while much care.\" Build a new paradigm of aging attention was given to the needs of kpuna and so that healthy aging is available to things like \"kpuna shopping hours\" were helpful; more. Combat the grave threats of the lack of congregate, in-person activities, closure boredom, loneliness, purposelessness, of adult daycares and senior centers had done inactivity, and other social and serious damage to the population. Many died in emotional hardships of aging. isolation without their family around them. Strengthen trust in healthcare. Rebuild and strengthen trust through listening, empathy, compassion, and treating the whole person, while also paying attention to the use of language and cultural nuances. Respondents commented that at the beginning of the pandemic, some subpopulations had a lot of trust in the healthcare system while other communities routinely felt bypassed or judged by the healthcare system and providers. This was exacerbated after the COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Most respondents were wholly distressed by the breakdown of trust and concerned about effective strategies. Many examples were highlighted to build stronger relationships between hospitals and community organizations. Provide accessible, proactive support for those with high needs. Identify, develop, and strengthen outreach, early intervention, free healthcare services, mental health, and oral health for those who are struggling with houselessness, mental illness, and addiction. Responses to this question varied greatly from island to island and among different ethnic, linguistic, and marginalized communities. A few common issues were: lack of mental health resources, especially for youth or LEP individuals; telehealth and mobile clinics were two innovations that were universally seen as progress, but access to broadband and/or familiarity with technology were barriers; and the complexity of the healthcare system was routinely noted as especially difficult to overcome. 29 The inaugural Hawaii Sexual and Gender Minority Health Report, produced by the State Department of Health, is an invaluable resource for a more in-depth exploration of health needs impacting this community.

Unique Populations 1. Geographic Hawaii County Secondary data show Hawaii County with many challenges in addition to the geographic challenges brought by the distinct demographic differences of the West and East sides. Population growth in Hawaii County was among the highest for the state from 2010 to 2020, at 8.2%. At the same time, data show Hawaii County with the lowest median household income, highest percentage of adults reporting frequent mental stress, and the second highest suicide rate (just slightly behind Kauai). The teen birth rate is the highest in the state, and early/adequate prenatal care for all women with a recent birth was the lowest. The proportion of single parent households is the highest in the state. The challenges of rural health on Hawaii's largest island are currently being examined by the State Rural Health Association; State Department of Health, Office of Primary Care and Rural Health; in conjunction with community partners. On the positive side of the ledger, with the lowest median housing prices in the state, the homeless rate is lower than other counties, as is the percentage reporting severe housing issues (overcrowding, high housing costs, lack of a kitchen, lack of plumbing). A higher percentage of Hawaii County teens spend less than 2 hrs a day online in activities other than school-related, with the hope that they spend more time outside. Kaua'i County Population growth in the past 10 years was the highest in the state, at 9.2%. This translates to an additional 6,200 people on this relatively small island, and contributes to traf fic and congestion problems, escalating real estate prices, and housing challenges. The homeless rate on Kauai is the highest in the state, and service providers often cannot get families into housing even if they have Section 8, Housing First, or other vouchers that will pay market rents (with the latter true on Maui, as well). At the same time as these indicators are showing challenges, many of Kauai's health indicators are showing improvement, such as the percentage of adults who have had a routine medical checkup in the prior 12 months (prior to the pandemic) and those saying they have a usual source of healthcare. While cancer prevalence is low, some cancer death rates also are among the lowest in the state. Significantly, the incidence of breast cancer is the lowest in the state; and the death rate from breast cancer is lowest. The same is true for lung cancer. This suggests that it isn't lack of screening that results in low prevalence, given the relatively lower death rates, as well. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 56 --Given the relatively small population of Kauai, the lack of facilities and health care/service providers is a significant barrier, especially in the area of mental and behavioral health. Women domestic violence survivors in residential treatment on Oahu who were from Kauai indicated they would have gotten help earlier if there were resources and facilities on-island. Maui County The distinct characteristics of each of Maui County's tri-island population mask some of the challenges faced by residents. The map of areas of highest socioeconomic need in the state, for example, does not highlight any ZIPCodes on Maui, but rather multiple areas of Molokai. It is likely the heterogeneity of Maui's residential areas - defined by ZIPCodes - that masks this. The median home prices are second only to Oahu, with a high vacancy rate (i.e. vacation rentals) rivaling that of Kauai. Both Maui and Kauai residents find themselves struggling with rising real estate costs due to increased demand from population growth and second home prices paid by outside buyers. The residual unemployment rate from the pandemic remains highest in Maui County and financial stresses (among other factors) likely contribute to the highest percentages of adults in the state reporting heavy drinking (two or more drinks per day) and intimate partner violence, both physical and sexual. At the same time, Maui County reflects the lowest percentage of adults who did not participate in any physical activity or exercise outside of work in the 30 days prior to the survey . The mortality rate in the county is the lowest in the state. While cancer prevalence has fallen over the past several years, as it has around the state, Maui County's prevalence remains the highest, with certain cancer death rates among the highest, as well. Coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure rates are among the lowest. \"As goes Native Hawaiian health on Molokai, so goes health on Molokai\", given that approximately 6 out of 10 residents of Molokai have Native Hawaiian ancestry . The chronic conditions known to be overrepresented in the Native Hawaiian population all present challenges to health on Molokai. So, too, does household income below 200% of the federal poverty level, which accounted for about 45% of the population before the pandemic. Subsistence farming, hunting, and fishing contribute to the family dinner table and serve to maintain the cultural connection to the ancestral way of life. The remoteness of Molokai, combined with the population of approximately 7500, leads to a dearth of services and facilities for healthcare (and other goods). The people of Molokai are extremely dependent on limited transportation services, especially for specialty care, much of which is extremely inconvenient and can be costly for accompanying caregivers. City & County of Honolulu (Oahu) As would be expected of an urban center, the stresses of long commute times, driving alone on a long commute, and other urban lifestyle indicators are clear in the secondary data. Another example is air quality, which is much worse on Oahu than on the Neighbor Islands. Insufficient sleep, defined as 7 hours or less per 24-hour period, was much higher on Oahu (45% of adults, contrasted to 38-40% on Neighbor Islands). Certain health outcomes data, however, are generally better for residents of Oahu than for those on the Neighbor Islands, likely due to greater access to screening and preventive care. With 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 57 breast cancer, for example, the incidence is the highest in the state yet the death rate from breast cancer ranks among the lowest, which likely reflects greater access to care. The birth rate, which has fallen on Oahu and almost everywhere in the past several years, remains the highest in the state, while the teen birth rate is among the lowest. Data for teens show levels of fruit/vegetable consumption and sufficient sleep to be lower on Oahu than on the Neighbor Islands. However, the percentage of teens reporting being bullied or cyberbullied is lowest on Oahu, as is the percentage who reported at least one suicide attempt in the 12 months prior to being surveyed (as part of the Hawaii DOH Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System). Levels of teen vaping and alcohol use are reportedly lowest on Oahu, as well. This data may be a reflection of the highest median household income in the state and the proliferation of private schools on the island. 2. Healthy Women and Healthy Keiki The old saying, it takes a village to raise a child can still be applied to modern society. However, in today's society, it takes a community to raise a healthy child. Building special relationships based on trust will open doors from a young age. From vaccinations to nutrition and fitness, by providing the tools to help children develop a healthy foundation at a young age will support their social emotional health to guide them to make responsible decisions. Furthermore, good nutrition and physical activity/exercise leads to self confidence. In 2019, Hawai'i's population included 304,638 children under age 18 and 560,761 women over age 18. The population of women over age 18 in Hawai'i decreased when compared to the nation overall. The share of the state's population under 18 (21.4%) was smaller than the U.S. overall (22.6%) as of 2019. Hawai'i's female population is slightly older than the rest of the country, with a median age of 39.1 in 2019, compared to 38.1 for the nation. Healthy Starts The birth rate in the state and nationally has decreased since 2015. Hawai'i's birth rate decreased to 11.9, while nationally the rate dropped to 11.6 per 1,000 total population in 2018. Unfortunately, Hawai'i had a higher rate of newborns at low birth weight than the national figure of 8.3%. Hawai'i County accounted for the highest at 8.6%, with Honolulu and Kaua'i at 8.5%. While the proportion of birth mothers with adequate prenatal care during pregnancy has decreased overall in the state (66.4% from 70.8%) and Honolulu County (63.4% from 72.7%) from 2013 to 2019, other counties saw a positive increase. Maui County saw the highest improvement from 67.3% to 83.1%, while Kaua'i County remained the highest level of prenatal care delivered, at 91.7%. Teen pregnancy rates in the U.S and Hawai'i have reflected a dramatic decrease from 2015. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 58 BIRTH RATE (per 1,000 total population) US HAWAI`I Hawai`i County Maui County C&C of Honolulu Kaua`i County 2015 12.4 12.9 12.1 11.5 13.3 12.4 2018 11.6 11.9 11.1 10.9 12.4 10.4 The birth rate is an important measure of population health.

Going into the pandemic, fewer Hawai'i students were eligible for the Free Lunch Program and the percentage of children living below poverty level had improved. However, when the pandemic closed public schools, meals were not provided to school aged children who depended on the daily nutritious meals. Many families have also lost financial stability during the pandemic. Most children come from households where all parents are in the workforce. Overall, Hawai'i (74.2%) and its counties had more households with all parents holding down a job than was true nationally (71.5%), and, of course, multiple jobs are often necessary to keep up with the cost of living. Kaua'i County (82.9%) had the highest among the counties; while, Honolulu was 72.9%.

Only Maui County had experienced a downturn in enrollment, from 51.7% to 44.6%. The disruption in education caused by the pandemic prevented three- and four- year olds from being in a safe and nurturing environment to support their learning and developmental years. Thus, many childcare workers were faced with unemployment or termination as enrollment decreased or childcare centers closed. Before the pandemic, national (48.3%) and state (48.0%) figures for early childhood education enrollment remained stable and showed positive change. Furthermore, daycare centers were shut down due to lack of workers or low student enrollment due to low immunization rates among preschoolers. During the pandemic, many residents avoided medical centers and doctor offices or lost health insurance coverage for their family because they were unable to work. This meant immunization among 3- and 4-year olds were postponed or ignored, for children who were about to start preschool or daycare. Thus, children were unable to enroll in daycare or preschool without the required immunization. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 62 US HAWAI`I Hawai`i County Maui County C&C of Honolulu three- and four- year olds enrolled in school (public or private).

The disruption in in-classroom teaching is proving to be problematic in a child's early foundation for critical thinking and social wellbeing. It will be particularly challenging to assess the needs of certain at-risk groups (homeless, Micronesians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Hawaiians), where many opted to keep their children home rather than return back to the classroom for in-person learning. Many students described to be at-risk were not equipped with a technological device nor internet access to participate in online learning. Thus, chronic absenteeism was observed among Micronesians (77%), English learners (72%), and among Pacific Islanders (55%). The Department of Education conducted a study amongst 90,000 students in grades 1 through 8. The study showed similar results to earlier studies, with a higher percentage of students who were performing below their grade level. Children Living with Disabilities When schools shut down and distance learning took into effect, it proved challenging for parents of school-aged children with disabilities and special needs. Daily routines utilizing specialized occupational exercises and tools could not be followed at home. US HAWAI`I Hawai`i County Maui County C&C of 5 years old with any disability (Data: 2013-17).

The social bonding in formative years has been severed due to school closures, separation of friends, and canceled activities. Anxiety, stress and mental health challenges are heightened concerns that need immediate attention. Obesity and Eating Disorders During the pandemic, as parents found themselves with more things to do but with less time to do it, fast food meals became the quick solution. A CDC study released in September 2021 showed significant weight gain nationally among children and teens between the ages of 2 and 19. Before the pandemic, child obesity levels were at 19%, increasing to 22% during the pandemic. Higher obesity levels translate to higher respiratory problems, diabetes and high blood pressure at an earlier age. And according to a recent report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the obesity rate for preteens and teens in Hawai'i ages 10 to 17 showed a significant increase from 11.1% in 2018-2019 to 15.5% in the years 2019-2020. The prevalence of eating disorders continues to rise at a steady pace for Hawai'i's teens. While Maui County showed a slight improvement at 23.4% from 22.4% in 2017, data from other counties indicated an increase.

Addressing Health Priorities A. A Shared Kuleana for Community Health The 2018 baseline CHNA proposed an empowering framework of shared kuleana. The following is an excerpt that is important to reassert, reestablish, and recommit towards. \"At some point in history, a model of healthcare was established that went this way: It is up to the doctor to heal the patient, and it is up to the patient to comply with the doctor's orders. But even as our understanding of health grew to include public health, prevention, and social determinants, our concept of responsibility for health doesn't seem to have kept pace. We are still primarily looking to healthcare\u2014now in the form of the healthcare industry\u2014to drive the improvement of health, now including community health. In turn, the industry puts increasing onus on individuals to adopt \"healthy lifestyles\"\u2014something that many in the community would say is essentially impossible for lack of a basic foundation for health. Expectations are unrealistic on both sides of the equation. Rather than pushing responsibility back and forth between individuals and the healthcare system, it is more realistic and more consistent with Hawaii values to engage one another and share kuleana throughout the entire healthcare ecosystem.\" The HAH CHNA process has adopted the understanding of upstream social determinants as directly connected to health and healthy outcomes. Hawaii's hospitals, the healthcare ecosystem, and the broader community are capable of addressing these Significant Health Needs and the 2021 Priorities, and building a healthy Hawaii. A Hawaii that keeps its people safe, that provides enriched environments for its keiki to thrive, that provides a home to every family that wants one, where there is no stigma and discrimination, where healthcare meets people where they are, jobs can provide a good quality of life, that lives up to its promise of celebrating diversity, that seeks to heal generational trauma, where sustainable food and quality education are accessible for all, and where the ina and spaces in which we live are honored and respected. A Hawaii that is healthy. \"If we believe that community is the solution to these issues, then we need to invest in a meaningful way that shows that we mean that. A priority is equality and justice - but people are so disconnected from believing that we can achieve equality and justice. We forgot that we are the solution to the problems that we face.\" Social Work Educator 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 70 B. Developing Strategies to Address Priorities One of the requests from the Steering Committee was to include potential strategies that would allow hospitals to engage with and make an impact on relatively high-level priorities. The assessment process raised many recommendations and best practice examples, many of which are discussed throughout this report in their respective sections. This section includes two elements: 1. Recommendations that HAH members might consider approaching collectively, in order to make a noticeable and meaningful impact with communities while also leveraging resources, lessons learned, and symbiotic energy. 2. A table of the compiled strategies shared throughout the report. Collective Strategies These strategies might be considered collectively as an industry, where the sum is greater than its parts, and the ability to leverage synergies can improve the opportunity for impact. Community Health Workers As was explored in Section II. C., CHWs have had successes in helping many underserved communities to achieve healthy outcomes, and hospitals choosing to embrace these roles within the system could be an opportunity to address a number of the 2021 Priorities. Minimally, working together across the system and where CHWs currently operate to provide a shared definition and goals would be helpful in identifying where support can be most meaningful. One of the challenges identified by some of the hospitals is the lack of reimbursement for CHW services. Hospitals may consider how to integrate housing services into these roles as they are eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. For residents over 60, hospitals might seek out the Area Agency on Aging for their respective County to determine how Older Americans Act funding might be available to support patient care coordination needs. Workforce Development HAH has led a workforce development initiative since 2018, identifying workforce needs across the healthcare continuum. One key element identified is the need for growth and career advancement while continuing to work, which HAH calls the \"glidepath.\" Community members working in and around financial insecurity for communities suggested that hospitals might consider introducing a living wage for their entry-level professionals and support \"earn and learn\" opportunities to advance to family-sustaining wages. This could help to address financial security for an important sector of the larger workforce and help with recruitment. Workforce shortages were highlighted in other parts of the healthcare continuum as well, including social workers, homeless service providers, and in-home care providers. Elderly affairs agencies expressed that even when there is funding available to support in-home care workers and positions, providers have challenges finding people to fill positions. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 71 Hawaii Survival Budget (2020 ALICE Report) Assistant, Nurse Aide Phlebotomist ..

Below is an example of a Nurse Assistant to Nurse glidepath from HAH, where some of the greatest needs lie. 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 72 ____________________ ____________________ Healthcare Facilities The lack of critical facilities creates major fracture points that impact people throughout the healthcare system, a number of them identified both by hospitals and community leaders, who are engaging with the system on a daily basis and dealing with the repercussions of those limitations. Hospitals may consider how to partner within the industry and with external public, private, and non-profit partners to address some of these facility needs. A long-term residential (non-forensic) mental health facility has the potential to provide care to severely mentally ill persons there (rather than in hospital beds) and decrease homelessness. Short-term stabilization facilities within communities could assist with an alternate location for MH1s and provide for more comprehensive care. Treatment beds in residential facilities would allow for discharge from hospitals to appropriate care settings. Residential recovery programs can support behavioral health needs. Continuing Education Trauma-informed care and cultural competencies are important to be understood by all frontline workers. Even if CHWs are fully integrated into all hospitals, they are not going to, nor are they intended to, provide the full panoply of care to an individual and rather assist them in navigating it. Thus it is important that all frontline workers are regularly trained in care principles and they do not only live on planning documents. HAH members could consider a blue ribbon standard of requirements for all facilities to implement ongoing training that could be centrally coordinated and provided. \"It's really important for individuals to remember traumatic history when dealing with patients and be sure not to re-traumatize these individuals. I've heard many examples of Native Hawaiians who come in to their doctors and talk about their traditional medicines that they've been using to try to heal themselves, and really received very dismissive treatment from medical professionals. That registry traumatizes individuals and communities. It's really important that we create safe spaces for individuals, and also connect back to the 'ina as much as possible.\" Social Work Educator Post-Federal Funding Planning Well over $4 billion has entered the State of Hawaii and its Counties by way of federal funds throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. These resources have come directly through state and local governments, as plus-ups to existing entitlement programs, relief aid to address emer gencies, and funding to support community-level programs. The priorities have included both short term relief needs to address the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on communities and families, as well as the long-term opportunities to invest in infrastructure and make structural changes to 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 73 ____________________ ____________________ strengthen the resiliency of government, systems, and communities to improve overall quality of life and prevent future events from having such devastating impacts. As these funds have come in, they are complex, have a wide range of eligibility expenditures and priorities, vary in their jurisdictional implementation, and have dif fering expenditure deadlines. For example, the first significant tranche of funding came in 2020 through the \"CARES Act,\" with an expenditure deadline of just over six months or funding would be lost. In addition to the complexities of the funding opportunities, the systems, and organizations responsible have to layer these duties on top of existing responsibilities, which in many cases were already over-taxed and under-resourced before the pandemic. While having significant resources may sound like a great opportunity and, in many cases, has been lifesaving, it has been challenging to strategically coordinate and make planful long-term decisions around those resources. There is growing concern regarding what happens when those resources hit a cliff. For example, there are significant concerns about what happens to those trained staff and community resources, who were desperately needed and supported by federal funds through the pandemic, when the funding comes to a close. In other cases, redundant systems have been set up to address the volume of needs during the pandemic, which can negatively impact existing systems in the long-term. A number of agencies and community organizations have turned down funds fearing that capacity was lacking to responsibly implement new programs without detriment to existing programs and those that rely upon them. While strategic planning is happening in pockets, several key stakeholders throughout the assessment process identified the great opportunity that the healthcare industry may have to participate in and support coordinated discussions among the healthcare continuum regarding those long-term planning needs, including making strategic decisions based upon the funding that is available now and how it can help to develop critical infrastructure that outlasts the current funding opportunities. \"Light was shone brightly on community health workers because of the pandemic. Their ability to connect to the community and translate what was happening, especially when you're dealing with communities that are so distrusting of government, was critical. That is why the federal government is investing in building up this workforce .\" Healthy Policy Leader 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 74 Summary of Suggested Strategies by 2021 Priority Below is a table list of suggested strategies made throughout the assessment process for consideration by hospitals wishing to identify actionable steps in addressing the 2021 Priorities. The research team recognizes that many hospitals are already individually deploying some of these strategies, advocating for these policy changes, and/or participating in community initiatives for collective action. Indeed, all are integral parts of the communities in which they operate; and, by virtue of this involvement, work for the betterment of their communities. These are offered simply as a list of suggestions, requiring their own due diligence by respective and interested hospitals. PRIORITY SUGGESTED STRATEGIES Financial Explore funding opportunities for care coordinators to assist households Security with accessing relief funding opportunities Develop relationships with non-profit service providers addressing financial security within respective communities and establish systems for warm handoff of patients Assist with accessing tax credits e.g. food tax credit Implement high school and community training programs for entry-level healthcare jobs that are targeted to low-socioeconomic status communities and under-represented populations with a commitment to hire and provide support for career development Evaluate a living wage minimum for all healthcare workers Consider low-cost on-site child care for employees and/or other employer-funded child care options. Consider collaborating with other employers for joint employee child care initiatives Utilize the hospital's purchasing power to build local wealth in the communities you serve by locally sourcing goods, services, and food, supporting diverse and locally owned vendors, and helping to incubate new community enterprises to fill supply chain gaps Designate a percentage of the hospital facility's investment portfolio to provide affordable capital for projects in the hospital's service area that address the upstream drivers of health in collaboration with community partners, such as affordable housing, healthy food access, environmental disparities, and economic empowerment for underserved communities Food Participate in communications around food as medicine Security Greater collaboration between groups/coalitions being built Purchasing food for hospital facilities from local farmers to support production and be resilient to external interruptions Partner with healthy food providers to identify households in need coming in for care and providing meals upon discharge Pursue collaborative funding to support meals at Title I schools Support community farmers' markets and local grocery stores 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 75 Screen patients for food insecurity and implement \"food as medicine\" initiatives including: physician referrals to on-site food pantries, partnerships with healthy food providers to provide meals upon discharge, vouchers for local produce purchases at farmers markets Partner with schools to develop healthy eating curricula, school gardens, Farm to School networks, and healthy local meals Support Farmers Markets and development of healthy food options located at hospital facilities and in communities with low access to healthy food options Assist eligible patients to enroll in SNAP and contribute funding to SNAP \"double bucks\" voucher programs Utilize hospital cafeterias as sites for summer meal programs for school-age children, and kupuna meals/gathering places Provide space on hospital grounds for community garden; Utilize a hospital garden for culturally-based foods and medicinal plants Benchmark and leverage hospital purchasing power to buy local and support development of local healthy food systems Housing Expand use of upstream determinants of health in screening questions; Note food or housing insecurity in patient history Explore the potential for developing workforce housing where facilities may have appropriate land available Partner to support workforce housing for healthcare workers Integrate housing services into hospital programs now that they are an eligible Medicaid reimbursable expense Partner with housing organizations for billing support Develop care coordinator relationships that create a \"hand-off\" from the hospital to the social service providers Engage in advocacy efforts to support affordable housing initiatives Mental & Support de-stigmatization and training for proper care and customer Behavioral service, including considering mandatory training Health Message publicly the cost of treating negative outcomes being higher than re-investing in preventative treatment Encourage and further develop delivery of service to meet people where they are, via non-traditional channels, such as telehealth, street medicine, grocery kiosks, etc. Build or enhance psychiatric capacity in Emergency Rooms Address mental health needs of healthcare workers Training on trauma-informed care, seeing the person beyond the crisis Raise public awareness to help destigmatize mental and behavioral health as well as access to resources Engage in \"normalizing strategies\" such as supporting mental health professionals in school, screening for teens, coping skills training Partner with mental health service providers to address mental health needs while hospitalized, including discharge support and residential treatment, when needed 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 76 Engage in efforts to support development of mental and behavioral health workforce within our state Support up-stream investment in existing community-based programs Increase QUEST Field Service Coordination and allow for in-home visits to identify and address needs before they become a crisis Increase and develop mobile mental health resources and providers (Case Managers, LCSWs, Psychiatric APRNs, Psychiatrists, Pharmacists) to frequently go into the community to clients Seek partnerships to develop additional 24/7 mental health Crisis Shelters in the community , where individuals could go if experiencing a mental health crisis or high risk of substance abuse relapse and reduce Emergency Department visits Greater collaboration with FQHCs and nonprofit organizations working within marginalized communities Trust & Equitable Invest in community health workers and medical social workers asAccess important connectors to community Build cultural competencies through training and hiring more bilingual staf f and those with deep community relationships Build competencies through training on trauma-informed care, understanding how to meet people where they are Conduct consistent outreach in underserved populations in collaboration with community partners Increase signage in all areas around safety and violence Support the cost of attendant travel for insurance purposes Expand mobile and pop-up clinics Expand and continue to promote telehealth initiatives Support the expansion of broadband and programs that provide service and equipment support to patients needing it Invest in built environments that seek to break down shame and bias Support healthcare in the schools such as the return of school health nurses and health screenings Partner to help address barriers to access such as transportation, child care, language, digital literacy , etc. Raise public awareness of need to destigmatize key populations or access to resources Increase digital access to patients, including technical assistance to support, such as through providing computers or kiosks on property Work with established kiosks such as AlohaQ to add healthcare and beyond services access and information Promote and implement programs to support diversity, equity, and inclusion internally within hospitals to guide internal hiring Support the development of culture that creates roles for non-clinical staf f within emergency departments 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 77 ____________________ ____________________ \"COVID laid it bare and showed us how weak our safety net is. Some of these messes, we didn't get into overnight.\" Youth Policy Advocate C. Policy Opportunities Many community organizations working in upstream social determinants are involved in policy-making and advocacy around those issues. One of the critical ways that the CAC had identified that HAH and Hawaii's hospitals could be involved in supporting those upstream determinants is by lending their voice to those policy discussions, whether at the executive branch, administrative, or legislative level. Hawaii's hospitals are well respected and have an impactful voice in these spaces and could help to establish and reinforce these social determinants as intrinsically related to health. Supporting select advocacy efforts could also help to develop stronger working relationships with community-based organizations and broaden the coalition of those advocating for a better quality of life for Hawaii residents. Potential example policy initiatives are included below. A number of hospitals already support various important social determinants. This report encourages hospitals to further connect with the community and policy organizations working within the upstream social determinants to discuss where there is alignment and greatest opportunity for healthcare voices to be ef fective. Advocating for a healthy Hawaii through policy change, such as increased regulation of tobacco products, sugary beverage fees, bringing more local produce into schools, and other initiatives Raising Hawaii's minimum wage, currently $10.10/hr ($21,008/year full time) Prohibiting housing discrimination against renters based upon source of income, so those with vouchers cannot be excluded so long as they can pay the rent Supporting Operating and Capital budget allocations to support any of the priorities Allowing homeless youth in shelters without parental consent Strengthening protections for domestic violence survivors Support language access compliance in all state agencies and funding for in-state medical interpreter training initiatives Support taxing items to disincentivize such as sugar-sweetened beverages, tobacco, etc. Supporting progressive tax structure efforts that provide for sustained investment in these community-based health programs versus one-off grants 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 78 OLA LOKO I KE ALOHA Love is integral to mental and physical wellbeing 'OLELO NO'EAU 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 79 IV . Conclusion A. Mahalo from the Research Team The past nine months of this assessment has provided such an incredible experience. The research team has had the opportunity to engage with over 200 people across our island home, who care so deeply about our Hawaii. Social workers, teachers, farmers, doctors, policy advocates, mothers, daughters, survivors, students, policy makers, nurses . . . all asking the question, \"What makes Ours a Healthy Community?\" For the communities in which they live, the clients they serve, the people they love. With a charge of updating the 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and with considerable recognition of the pandemic effects on the social determinants of health, the 2021 CHNA research team sought out a wide range of voices, perspectives, and communities to understand the unique and Significant Health Needs facing Hawaii' s communities. The foundations laid in 2018 focusing on upstream social determinants provided a critical backdrop for building upon and delving into the barriers to healthy communities and people today . While there initially were concerns about possible survey and interview fatigue and the thought that these might dampen participation, it was clear that the pandemic experience had sharpened community focus on the social determinants of health and, indeed, had resulted in a generous willingness to participate. There was tremendous recognition of the sacrifices and contributions of hospitals and the entire continuum of healthcare throughout the last two years, and what could even be described as excitement for an opportunity to identify ways to strengthen healthcare systems and build trust with communities. Recommendations and best practices were bountiful. This report seeks to lift those up and provide specific pathways for hospitals to consider being part of addressing Significant Health Needs. Trauma experienced throughout the community is profound, both individually and collectively. This report seeks to honor and learn from those experiences. We were inspired by community members that shared stories of the strength of honoring place and acknowledge the healing that Hawaii's 'ina can provide. We were influenced by the lelo noeau: \"Mhala i ka wai ka maka o ka pua,\" - people, like flowers, thrive where there is water and resources for a good quality of life. We are honored to have been a small part of the important work of keeping our communities alive and thriving, and we believe the hospitals of Hawaii have the power and passion to be life bringing wai to Hawaii' s communities.

Acknowledgments Many people throughout the healthcare community, healthcare continuum, and our community broadly helped input into this 2021 update of the Community Health Needs Assessment. The research team saw its role primarily as a conduit for a deep well of knowledge to provide a framework for understanding the complex and interconnected needs facing our communities today and a pathway with actionable and achievable next steps. Our client and partner in this process was HAH. Mahalo to the executive leadership and the Steering Committee, who entrusted us with this critical responsibility . We also want to offer special thanks to Jodi Hashimoto, who served as our project manager, and Lori Henning, without whom this CHNA would not have come together as it did. The critical project management, expertise, and leadership they provided were invaluable and helped keep every stakeholder engaged and every critical deliverable on track. We highly recommend that future CHNA's include strong project management support. We also want to extend gratitude to the 2018 research team, who moved mountains in shifting the lens of this vital work from clinically focused to more broadly understanding and embracing the social determinants of health as the framework for this work moving forward. Building upon that foundation was an honor, and we sincerely appreciate the 2018 team and those involved in that report. In addition to the formal partners, stakeholders, key informants, community connectors, and stakeholders identified throughout this report and its appendices, many individuals served as kumu - sources of knowledge and mentorship - to our team. Out of respect for the preferred anonymity of many, we simply say, our most sincere mahalo. \"In public health, we often think about our objectivity and being actually removed from communities, when in fact we should be embedded, immersed, and part of. How do we make communities more resilient? What we know is that trauma isolates, and we know that that isolation keeps people separate from others who could be resources, both formal and informal. And we know that the healing process for trauma means bringing people together .\" Social Work Educator 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 81 V . Appendices A. Appendix A - Shared Kuleana Strategies The resources below are a sample of projects and special programs currently operating within community around the 2021 Priorities. It is not an exhaustive list of all programs and is not intended as a list of providers, although they are referenced and mentioned where appropriate or where a specific program wasn't named but housed within an organization. 1. Coalitions There are a number of coalitions working in and around the various 2021 Priorities and other Significant Health Needs. Some hospitals already participate. These could be good opportunities to join existing work and support the collective work being done with communities around social determinants of health. Suggested examples include: Affordable Housing Coalition: https://www.ahafellows.com/home Hawaii Coalition https://www.hiphi.org/hawaii-oral-health-coalition/ https://www.hiphi.org/kupuna-food-security-coalition/ Obesity Prevention Task Force (OPTF) - originally convened through statute by the Department of Health, the OPTF continues to meet and is convened by HIPHI: https://www.hiphi.org/heal/healthy-eating-active-living-coalitions/ Partners in Care (PIC): https://www.partnersincareoahu.org/ Working Families Coalition: https://www.workingfamilieshawaii.org/ 2.

ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) individuals and families are those who have at least one job yet cannot afford housing, child care, food, transportation and health care. Nearly one in two households in Hawaii are ALICE and below. Since releasing its report, AUW has focused on supporting the ALICE community on strengthening their financial health. AUW embraces the reality that sustainable social change must involve cross-sector coordination, long-term commitment, and investment in deeper relationships with strategic partners. Additionally AUW hotline at 211 provides referrals to relevant programs. (https://www.auw.org/alice ) 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 82 Hawaii Budget & Policy Center (HBPC) .

Blue Zones Project. Dan Buettner's book, The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who've Lived the Longest , evolved into a worldwide network of \"community-wide well-being improvement initiatives\" intended to help people live longer, healthier, and happier lives. The Hawaii Medical Service Association (HMSA) brought the Blue Zones Project to Hawaii, with program staff implementing various activities in communities throughout the state. For example, in September 2018, Blue Zones held a Big Island Food Policy Summit in Hilo that convened close to 100 2021 Community Health Needs Assessment Page 83 stakeholders from agriculture, the food industry, health, education, local government, and various parts of the community to build a common agenda for Hawaii Island' s food self-reliance and work toward creating a healthy food system for Hawaii Island.
