Patient Testimonials: \"I've been seeing Eva for my chronic back pain and sciatica. My first 3 acupuncture treatments have significantly healed constant back and hip pain that I have had for years. Although chiropractics and osteopathic treatments helped me previously, nothing has reduced the pain more than acupuncture. I believe that the herbal medicine Eva prescribed was also very effective in removing the pain rapidly. I have recommended her to several friends with neck and shoulder pain. One of them who went to Eva has been very pleased with the reduction of his neck pain. \"(Paul, Male, 48 yo) \"I have chronic allergy and lots of runny nose. I used 2 boxes of tissues every day to blow my nose, feeling still not enough .I also used nasal sprays but it worsened my symptoms after a prolonged use. It was 1 month ago that I contacted Eva as a last resort. Eva gave me 30 packs of herbal decoction she had made herself so I could take them over 2 weeks. I am now relieved of most of the symptoms following herbal treatments, which is continuing. The best thing is that I do not need to wake up any more at night only to blow the nose. I feel less tired in the morning and use only half box of tissues in daytime.\" (Lee, Male 32 yo) \"I have lived with prolonged period over 5 years. Although I was only 13, my GP prescribed me oral contraceptives and I became unbelievably obese after taking them for years. Unfortunately, it did not fix my condition, either. My symptoms included intense fatigue, anxiety and dull pain in my lower abdomen that went all the way through to my back. My blood loss was very excessive with dark red clots. I saw Eva last year and I was given a box of granule medicine made from Chinese herbs. I followed her instructions and it made a big improvement! The first period was about 80% better than any I'd had in my entire life. The duration came back to normal and I felt energetic. The pain in my abdomen was much milder and the discharge reduced a lot. By the time my next period came around, I hardly even noticed the symptoms. No lack of energy, no abnormal discharge or foul smell, no excessive bleeding, no cramping. I've been taking her herbs since then, and it has changed my life. Now I get acupuncture and herbal medicine for other conditions as they come up.\"(Asha, Female, 19 yo) Health Fund Rebates: Eva is registered with all major private health funds including Medibank, MBF, NIB, HCF and MANY MORE.

Back Pain Lower Back Pain and Sciatica Treated with Acupuncture You can relieve low back pain after one or more treatments from Belfield Holistic Medical Centre. Lower back pain is one of the most common conditions treated with acupuncture. There are two types of acute and chronic cases: The symptoms of the lower back pains are: soreness, stiffness, and dull ache in the lower back on one or both sides or at the center of the lumbar spine. Some patients with sciatica may experience pain, tingling, numbness, radiating in the thighs and legs or even to the feet. Prolonged sitting, standing, walking or even lying in the bed, can aggravate the lower back pain. X-ray or MRI may show a narrowing of disc space or even disc protrusion that may or may not press on the nerve at L4-L5 or L5-S1. The same disc protrusion may cause narrowing of the spinal canal resulting lumbar stenosis. Some patients may already have one or more surgeries. But the lower back pain persisted even after multiple sessions with physical therapy and chiropractic treatments. In such situation, acupuncture provides an excellent and effective alternative to those patients who has failed the procedures listed above and those who wish not to have surgery or under constant heavy pain medications. Eva's approach with acupuncture to treat low back pain is based on her Chinese Medicine. Her unique acupuncture point selection is designed to improve blood circulation and relax paraspinal muscles allowing more fluid and nutrients to nourish the disc thereby increase the elasticity of the discs. Such increase in the elasticity of the discs thru acupuncture can help in reduce the disc protrusion and thus reduce and eliminating the lower back pain. A companion exercise program is also given to the patients undergoing acupuncture for lower back pain and sciatica. The number of visits ranges from 2 to 10. Most of the patients experience substantial relief after 4 acupuncture treatments. Payment Options Payments accepted by Cards, Cash, Cheque or Internet Banking. Hicaps machine is available.
