[Inner Traditions/Bear & Company](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/361356815/Inner-Traditions-Bear-Company) Reviews for Colloidal Silver 4 ratings1 review - Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Excellent book with clear details and no waste of time from too much resources . 1 person found this helpful Book preview Colloidal Silver - Werner K\u00fchni Introduction During the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth, medical practitioners held silver\u2014especially colloidal silver\u2014in high regard. This changed during the twentieth century with the introduction of antibiotics and corticosteroids. Today, our increasing awareness of the side effects of these kinds of pharmaceutical drugs indicates that it is time for silver to regain its place in medical theory and practice. The uses for silver\u2014in particular colloidal silver\u2014have expanded enormously in recent years, and these are now so well known that it is only a matter of time before colloidal silver once again becomes a standard component in the medical pharmacopoeia. There are literally hundreds of thousands of pages about colloidal silver on the Internet. Unfortunately, much of this information is unreliable and unorganized, and a great deal of it is simply wrong. For this reason we believe that the time has come for a book that accurately and clearly examines both the theoretical basis for and the range of practical uses of colloidal silver. In keeping with this goal, we consider it equally important that we also point out the limitations of our own current understanding of and experience with colloidal silver, not only for the sake of our readers, but also to hopefully provide an impetus for further research. While silver is frequently characterized as a natural antibiotic, this description encompasses only a small part of its broad range of uses. For example, its antibiotic effect does not explain why silver is so effective in treating viruses, which are, strictly speaking, not alive.*1 Nor does it address its capacity for healing wounds and alleviating pain. It makes no note of the antidepressive effects that have often been observed after using silver solutions and ignores the fact that colloidal silver can be used to continue treatment after a person has been weaned off of psychopharmacological agents. Characterizing silver as an antibiotic also says nothing about its ability to help epileptics have fewer as well as less severe seizures. Recent years have shown that colloidal silver can form the basis of a practical and systematic form of therapy for a host of conditions and diseases as well as an effective means of maintaining one's health and well-being\u2014a subject that will be explored in detail in this book. We will also look at the use of silver in mineral stone therapy; in this regard, silver differs from all other metals in its luster and indestructibility, while its purifying influence can cause many pathogens and ailments to disappear. Of all the colloidal metals, silver has the greatest range of medical applications. Although the effects of colloidal silver are similar to those of colloidal gold and colloidal platinum, in practice it is actually far superior to these other noble metals. And even though colloidal gold can be used for a variety of psychological ailments, colloidal silver exerts similar effects when taken over a longer period of time. Despite its long and complex cultural history, silver has been seen in an ambivalent light. Since ancient times, scientists and poets around the world have been fascinated by the great beauty and the marvelous properties of this precious metal. In the mythological, spiritual, and psychological domains, and even in fairy tales, silver has come to symbolize modesty, purity, devotion, neutrality, and reason. In meditation, it can open a path to deeper spirituality. At the same time, silver's negative potential can be seen in the ways that it has seduced the powerful and the wealthy, such that it has come to stand for corruption and colonialism. And so the task that lies before us is to compile all that has been learned about silver in both theory and practice from the many different sources\u2014the humoral pathology of ancient times, alchemy, folk medicine, homeopathy, anthroposophy, and modern biomedicine\u2014and to present this to you, the reader. 1 A Brief History of Silver Metallic silver has been known since antiquity. The oldest known silver artifacts date from the fourth century BCE. The Egyptians were probably the first to use silver for medicinal purposes. We know silver also found its way into ancient Greek, Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese medicine. Hippocrates believed that silver healed wounds and controlled disease. He listed as a singular treatment for ulcers the flowers of silver alone, in the finest powder (Rentz 2015). Herodotus describes how the king of Persia carried with him boiled water in silver flagons to prevent sickness. In the Americas, the Inca, Maya, and Aztec peoples used silver both for creating cult objects and for ornamentation, and there is evidence that ancient Incan and Muiscan surgeons performed cranioplasty using precious metals and gourds. Indeed, the quest for gold as well as for silver was part of the reason Spain colonized these indigenous cultures of the Americas. SILVER DURING THE MIDDLE AGES The different ways that silver was used during the Middle Ages were largely shaped by influences stemming from antiquity and Arabic alchemy. It was not until the sixteenth century, with the introduction of Paracelsus' (1493-1541) concept of spagyrics, that coined the term spagyric to refer to an herbal medicine produced by alchemical procedures that involve fermentation, distillation, and the extraction of mineral components from the ash of a plant. Paracelsus associated the seven metals (gold, silver, mercury, copper, iron, tin, lead) with the seven planets (sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn), and in turn with seven different parts of the body, and even with certain foods. If you have the Astrum of Mercury, in the same manner, you will tinge the whole body of common Mercury. If you have the Astrum of Venus you will, in like manner, tinge the whole body of Venus, and change it into the best metal. These facts have all been proved. The same must also be understood as to the Astra of the other planets, as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Luna, and the rest. For tinctures are also prepared from these: concerning which we now make no mention in this place, because we have already dwelt at sufficient length upon them in the book on the Nature of Things and in the Archidoxies. So, too, the first entity of metals and terrestrial minerals have been made, sufficiently clear for Alchemists to enable them to get the Alchemists' Tincture. (Paracelsus) Because he associated silver with the moon, and mercury (i.e., quicksilver) with Mercury (the planet), Paracelsus pioneered the idea of using silver amalgam for medicinal purposes, such as in detoxifying baths. Several hundred years earlier, writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, visionary, and polymath Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) viewed silver through the lens of the ancient doctrine of humoral pathology. She considered it a potent remedy for treating congestion and the coughing that results from it. She characterized silver as sharp and cold. In the ninth book of her Physica, titled Metals, she notes: Silver (argentum) is cold, [because it contains cold wind, which makes even the earth cold]. A person who has in him a superfluity of humors, which he often expels [by coughing them up], should heat very pure silver in the fire and, thus heated, put it in good wine. He should do this three or four times, so that the wine gets hot from it. He should drink it often, heated this way, before breakfast and at night. It will diminish his superfluous humors. [The strong natural cold of silver diminishes hot, cold, and moist humors by its sharpness, joined with the heat of the fire and the heat of the wine, altered as described.] (Bingen 1998, 238) In the fourteenth century, Conrad von Megenberg, a polymath and canon of Regensburg, wrote in part 7 of his Book of Nature, Silver also has the ability to fuse other metals together and make one piece from two. When ground and mixed with precious ointments, it can be used against that viscous moisture in the body known as phlegm. . . . Silver is pure, but less so than gold. . . . Although it is white, it has the property of blackening other things that scratch it. Its slag, called scoria in Latin, can be used to treat scabies and hemorrhoidal bleeding. (Megenberg 1897, 478) It should be added that Megenberg's reports on the effectiveness of silver in treating metabolic weaknesses, itching, and hemorrhoidal complaints are in complete agreement with Hildegard von Bingen's earlier accounts. Until the time of Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), the founder of homeopathy, preparations of silver had found only limited medical use. Hahnemann himself was slow to acknowledge silver's many benefits. In his 1798 Apothekerlexikon (Pharmacist's Lexicon), one of the standard reference works of homeopathy, Hahnemann still reflected an earlier era's views about silver's limited application in medicine: \"A pharmacist will occasionally wrap silver leaf (Argentum foliatum) around their pills as a kind of luxury, a procedure that makes this form of medicine, which is already difficult for our stomachs to digest, only that much more indissoluble and ineffective (2:216 ff.). In his subsequent works Hahnemann began to demonstrate a growing interest in silver's efficacy, describing two forms of silver nitrate, as metallic silver had not been used in medical practice before his time. By 1820, however, Hahnemann expanded the role of silver in homeopathy by introducing triturated colloidal silver, which he called ARGENTUM METALLICUM metallicum, describing this as a sensible medicament\" for treating patients. Silver in Folk Medicine In European folk medicine, ancient ideas about silver commingled with various demonological notions that arose during the medieval period. A mixture of these beliefs continued to shape the ways in which silver was used all the way up until the early twentieth century, especially in the Alps, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean regions, as illustrated by this passage from Ulrike M\u00fcller-Kaspar's 1999 book, Handbuch des Aberglaubens (Handbook of Superstitions): Silver has the power to ward off demons and illnesses, whereby silver that has been inherited over many generations is particularly powerful. Wearing rings of silver is an especially useful apotropaic means of fighting off various illnesses. Finely ground silver, mixed with various plants, is said to be useful in treating rabies, nosebleeds, dropsy, etc. (M\u00fcller-Kaspar 1998). Thus in some ways silver is still used today just as Dioscorides and Megenberg recommended. The manner in which Paracelsus and the other early modern alchemists used silver apparently had little impact on European folk medicine because the theoretical justifications they supplied for its use were too abstract. MODERN SCIENCE CONSIDERS SILVER In 1861, Scottish chemist Thomas Graham (1805-1869) described the differences between colloids that were capable of passing through membranes and precipitates that were unable to do so. Graham's discovery was that substances could enter a solution in such a manner that they exhibit characteristics that are quite different from those of a true solution. He applied the term colloidal (from kola, glue) to this intermediate state, as glue, gelatin, and related substances were the most obvious to him as being in this unique state. Graham's study of colloids was foundational in the field known as colloid chemistry, and he is credited as its founder. In 1869, French scientist J. Ravelin noted that even low doses of silver produced antimicrobial effects. In 1881, Carl Siegmund Franz Cred\u00e9 (1819-1892), a gynecologist from Leipzig, recommended administering eye drops containing 1 percent silver nitrate to newborns to prevent them from developing ophthalmia, a form of conjunctivitis common in neonates, which can cause blindness. Both because of its success and because better alternatives were lacking, the use of what became known as Cred\u00e9's prophylaxis was made mandatory in several countries and became a standard practice in obstetrics. By 1897, silver nitrate began to be used in the United States to prevent blindness in newborns, a practice that was eventually replaced by the use of modern antibiotics. In 1893, Swiss botanist Karl Wilhelm von N\u00e4geli (1817-1891) characterized the properties of silver as oligodynamic, which simply means active in very small quantities. N\u00e4geli determined that concentrations of as little as 0.0000001 percent silver ions were sufficient to kill a freshwater pathogen (Spirogyra) and other living organisms such as algae, molds, spores, fungi, prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, and even viruses.*2 In 1910, Dr. Henry Crookes reported that certain colloidal metals have a highly germicidal action but are quite harmless to human beings. . . . The greater the extent to which the metal is set free in a very dilute solution of its salts, the greater is the germicidal power of the solution! By converting the metal into a colloidal state it may be applied in a much more concentrated form and with correspondingly better results. (Searle 1920, 68) In 1919, the prolific author, editor, and translator Alfred B. Searle wrote in The Use of Colloids in Health and Disease, The germicidal action of certain metals in the colloidal state having been demonstrated, it only remained to apply them to the human subject, and this has been done in a large number of cases with astonishingly successful results (Searle 1920, 75). In all, more than ninety-six different silver medicinals, many used intravenously, were in use prior to 1939, as documented by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association (Rentz 2015). In the 1970s, Dr. Robert O. Becker (1923-2008), an orthopedic surgeon and medical research doctor, studied the effects of colloidal silver on electrochemical processes in the body. He wrote about his research on the medical applications of silver in several best-selling books, including The "}
