The first seizure is typically a febrile status epilepticus. Shortly thereafter other seizures occur leading to diagnosis in an otherwise normal infant. Later, myoclonus, atypical absences, and partial seizures are observed. Developmental delay becomes apparent within the second year of life. Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN1A are the cause of DS in 70%-80% of the patients. Fever is the most common trigger of seizures during the course of the disease. 1,2Vaccination is the trigger of the first seizure in about 50% of cases.3,4 However, precipitation of seizure onset by immunizationdoes not affect the course of the disease. 5 A growing body of evidence implicates a link between inflammation and epileptic disorders.6,7Most studies ana- lyzed the baseline levels of proinflammatory tissue, sera, or cerebrospinal fluid of studies evaluated cytokine levels followingex vivo stimulation of immune cells with nonspecific acti- vators.9Ex vivo responses to vaccine antigens reflecting in vivo priming with vaccines avoid seizure-induced cofounding factors. Despite evidence for vaccine-related seizure onset in DS, nothing is known about cytokine response to vaccines in these patients. In DS, experimental studies have shown that the SCN1A mutation results in a modified neuronal excitability, which is sensitive to the increase in body temperature.10Whether inflammation con- tributes to seizure occurrence has not yet been investigated. Here, we explored if vaccinated patients with DS might be prone to an altered cytokine response to the vaccine. 2|POPULATIONS AND METHODS We compared ex vivo cytokine S1) to sex- and age-matched heathy children (HC). Inclusion criteria were completion of vacci- nations and availability of residual cryopreserved periph-eral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from blood samples collected for standard care in stable clinical conditions (DS) at least 15 days from any fever/infection episode or for biological investigations in healthy bone marrow donors before the gift (HC). The study was approved by our hos- pital 's institutional review board (Robert-Debr /C19e Hospital, Paris, France). Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all children. Table S2 reports the main character- istics of DS. Cryopreserved PBMCs from DS and HC were simulta- neously thawed and seeded (10 6/mL) into Roswell Park Memorial Institute culture medium supplemented with pooled human sera (10%), glutamine (1%), and antibiotics. Cell suspensions were cultured at 37 \u00b0C, in 5% CO 2atmo- sphere, overnight with the vaccine at a predetermined opti- mal dilution (10%) or left unstimulated. Cytokines were in supernatants by a kine assay using the 17-Plex human (Bio-Rad, Labora- tories Inc., Marne-La-coquette, France) as described previously.11Supernatants from the 2 culture conditions were analyzed for each child. Sufficient amounts of PBMCs were available to isolate monocytes in 5 DS patients and their respective controls. PBMCs (2 9106) from each individual were distributed into culture medium (1 mL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and monocytes were allowed to adhere to plastic by incubation of the cell suspension in flat-bottom culture walls for 2 hours at 37 \u00b0C. After careful removal of nonadherent cells, culture medium was added (1 mL) to monocytes andcultures were processed as described earlier for PBMCs. Data were analyzed using the Prism 5 software (Graph- Pad, San Diego, CA, USA). Cytokine/chemokine releases are expressed as median and range in Table 1. Vaccine- specific cytokine/chemokine releases are expressed as mean/C6standard error of the mean (SEM) in Figure 1. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test. Pvalues are considered statistically significant when P<.05. 3|RESULTS We exclude 5 cytokines/chemokines showing either con- centrations outside an in all culture conditions (IL-7, IL-12). As shown in Table 1, the median levels of cytokine release in the supernatants from unstimulated PBMCs(background) were similar in DS and HC. In vitrostimulation with the vaccine induced in both groups a marked increase, over background, in the secretion of Type 1 T helper (Th1) (IL-2, IFN- in the proinflam- matory IL-6, tumor IL-10 cytokine. After subtracting the background values (Figure 1), a remarkably higher release of TNF- a, a cytokine implicated in the pro-inflammatory pathway of monocyte activation and lower release of IL-10, a major anti-inflam-matory cytokine, were observed in DS as compared to controls. Vaccine-specific release of IL-13, a cytokine implicated in the alternative pathway of monocyte activa- tion and of IL-2, a cytokine implicated in the activation and homeostasis of conventional and regulatory T cells, were also lower in DS. Overall, the cytokine balance in response of PBMCs to the vaccine was shifted in favor of an inflammatory profile associated with defective IL-10 and IL-13 secretion in DS. Adjuvants and/or components of whole pathogens con- tained in vaccines are required for vaccine immunogenic-ity. They act through activation of innate immune cells including monocytes. We have therefore analyzed vac- cine-induced cytokine releases by monocytes. Results showed higher spontaneous release of IL-1 band IL-6 by monocytes in DS than in HC (Table 1). In vitro stimula- tion of monocytes with the vaccine induced a significant increase over spontaneous release of IL-1 b, IL-6, and TNF- ain DS but of IL-10 in HC (Table 1). It is worth noting that in accordance with T-cell depletion, Th1, Th2,and Th17 cytokine responses were not induced by the vaccine in monocyte preparations. After subtracting spon- taneous release, monocyte response to the vaccine in DS was clearly directed toward a pro-inflammatory (IL-1 b, IL-6, and TNF- a) profile associated with defective coun- terregulatory IL-10 response (Figure 1). Monocytes are known to exist as polarized populations including M1 and M2 subsets. Although M1 monocytes/macrophages are powerful inflammatory cells that produce high levels of IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF- acytokines, M2 monocytes/macro- phages produce low these proinflammatoryresponses. 12Overall, our results support that monocytes/ macrophages are shifted in favor of a M1 proinflamma- tory phenotype in DS. 4|DISCUSSION Previous data supported a role for inflammation in epi-lepsy. 6,8Despite the clinical scenario of fever-induced and vaccine-induced seizure in DS, there are no datae46|AUVIN ET AL .TABLE 1 Cytokine/chemokine releases (median (range)) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and separated monocytes from healthy children and pat ients with Dravet syndrome (954- 14 564).54AUVIN ET AL . |e47currently available on a possible alteration of the inflammatory response to vaccination in these patients. Our study provides the first evidence that vaccine responsiveness is biased toward a proinflammatory profile in DS. There are accumulating data on the role of IL-1 b, IL-6, and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis.7In humans, immunohistochemistry studies of surgical samples of structural epilepsies are con-sistent with a role of these inflammatory mediators. 6,7 Cytokine dosages in the blood of patients with epilepsyhave been also done, but much methodological bias exists, as reported in a recent meta-analysis 9(timing of the blood sample, numerous epilepsy syndromes, and seizure types and frequency). Only IL-6 appears to be increased in the blood of patients with epilepsy, whereas IL-1 band TNF- a do not differ from controls.9To avoid the bias described earlier, few studies have investigated cytokine secretion after in vitro stimulation of PBMCs. An increased amount of IL-1 b(significant in 4/6), a(significant in 1/1) has been found.9PBMCs of patients with epilepsy and controls were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in 4 studies, ds-RNA of a common viral vector in one study, and mitogen in one study.9 In DS, we found a clear proinflammatory profile with an increase of IL-1 b, IL-6, TNF- a, and a decrease of IL- 10 after in vitro vaccine stimulation of PBMCs. This pro- file is unique compared to previous studies that reported also an increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.9 The cytokine profile found in the monocytes of DS wascomparable to the profile in PBMCs. Together, these results support a bias toward an M1 proinflammatory FIGURE 1 Comparison of vaccine-specific cytokine releases by immune cells from patients and from healthy children. The mean ( /C6SEM) concentrations (pg/mL) of vaccine-specific cytokine release (values observed in vaccine-stimulated cultures minus values observed in unstimulated cultures) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, part A) and by monocytes (part B) are shown. The only cytokines with concentrations significantly more elevated in vaccine-stimulated than in vaccine-unstimulated cultures are illustrated. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare results from patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and healthy children (HC)l Pvalues are indicated when statistically significant (P<.05)e48|AUVIN ET AL .phenotype in DS at the expense of an M2 reparative and neuroprotective phenotype. Further studies are required to determine whether the discrepancies found in IL-10 level(decrease in our study and increase in past studies 9) rely on the use of polyclonal activators in previous studies (recalled antigens in ours) or represent a selective down- regulation of IL-10 in DS. It is notable that we also found lower vaccine-specific release by PBMCs of IL-13, a T cell -derived that drives monocyte differentia- tion toward an M2 phenotype. Altogether these results support for the first time that an altered interplay between the innate and the adaptive immune compartments occurin an epileptic syndrome. Whether the systemic changes we observed may reflect similar changes in brain mono- cytes/microglia remains to be addressed. Of interest sodium channel modulation contributes to effector roles of activated microglia. Pharmacological release of microglia. 13The SCN1A mutation in DS might then be then a factor modulating the inflamma- tory properties of the monocytes. Despite the small sample size, our results are suffi- ciently reliable to support a shift toward an M1 pro-inflam-matory phenotype of monocytes in DS. Monocytes can adopt either M1 or M2 phenotypes. 14The activated M1 phenotype is predominately induced by an acute pathologi- cal condition such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, or experimentally induced systemic inflammation.14M1 monocytes are involved in the production of proinflamma- tory cytokines, usually associated with negative conse- quences and that have been also described to promote ictogenesis and epileptogenesis.6These results provide new insight into immune mechanisms associated with an epi- lepsy syndrome. Previous studies have already shown that peripheral inflammation can contribute to seizure precipita- tion or lower brain excitability.6Our study may also guide research for the development of new immunotherapeutic agents in an epilepsy syndrome for which fever, viral ill- nesses, and immunization are frequent triggers of seizures during the whole course of the disease.
