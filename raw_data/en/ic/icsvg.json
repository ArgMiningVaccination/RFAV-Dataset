A simple, ammonia-free glass cleaner may be used. Apply the cleaner onto the cloth, do not spray directly on crystal. Avoid getting any chemicals on surrounding metals. Avoid placing crystal in direct sunlight, as a yellowing of the crystal may occur, as well as a potential fire hazard. To clean gold leaf, wipe with a dry soft cloth, very soft natural brush, or feather duster. Dust and debris can be removed from the shade by dusting with a clean soft bristled brush or the upholstery brush on the vacuum. "}
