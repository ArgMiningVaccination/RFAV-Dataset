The scientific world is continually gaining new knowledge about the benefits of herbs. Walgreens makes benefiting from both ancient wisdom and modern science a simple task with a wide selection of high quality herbal supplements. The Roots of Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine can be traced back to at least 3000 BCE with some scientists believing the tradition of healing the body with herbs may have begun even earlier. Ancient healers in what are now China and Egypt kept records of their innovative treatments for various types of medical conditions. Through the centuries, many cultures developed very complex and advanced principles of herbal medicine. Much of what herbs are used for today is owed to these forms of folk medicine. Some of the biggest contributors to the modern use of herbs were traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda (an alternative healing tradition from India) and the healing arts of the Native Americans and African tribes. Validation through Science Herbal medicine underwent a period of advancement during the 19th century. During this time, scientists were gaining new tools and methods of analyses to help them study plants more intensely. They began to study some of the folk remedies that people in their parts of the world and elsewhere around the globe used on a regular basis. In some cases, their studies seem to prove the benefits of ancient remedies. In others it led to the development of entirely new alternative medical principles, such as homeopathy. Today, scientists continue to study herbal medicine. They are examining how the extracts from flowers, bark, berries, seeds, roots and leaves can be beneficial to the human body. While there have been promising results from studies on several herbs, including [ginkgo biloba](/store/c/ginkgo-biloba/ID=361677-tier3), [St. John's wort](/store/c/st-john's-wort/ID=361651-tier3)and [valerian](/store/c/valerian-root/ID=361645-tier3), the scientific field of herbal medicine is still largely under development with more testing required to confirm the benefits of many herbs.
