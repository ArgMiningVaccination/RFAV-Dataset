[+] [+] [Chapter 3](/content.aspx?legacysectionid=ch3) on Evaluation of the Patient with a Wound presented the two questions that need to be answered in order to successfully treat a patient with a wound: (1) Why does the patient have a wound? and (2) Why is the wound not healing? Once a wound diagnosis has been determined and standard care has been initiated, the wound should progress through the stages of wound healing discussed in [Chapter 2](/content.aspx?legacysectionid=ch2) on Healing Response. When progress is not observed, the second question\u2014Why is the wound not healing?\u2014becomes even more imperative to answer. Sometimes the wound will respond initially and make measureable progress, then stall again for no apparent reason. This chapter focuses on those factors that are known to impede wound healing, some more obvious than others, and provides suggestions on how to identify and minimize the effect on the healing process. The factors are categorized into infection, medications, nutritional deficits, comorbidities, and extrinsic/psychosocial behaviors. [+] [+] [TABLE 11-1](#hamm_ch11tb1) provides laboratory values, always a good starting place for solving the conundrum, with normal values, trends that are typical when a patient does not have the normal healing response, and clinical presentations that accompany abnormal lab values.
