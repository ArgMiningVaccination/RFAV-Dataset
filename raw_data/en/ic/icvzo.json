[Unicorn System] EURACTIV is part of the Trust Project >>> Print Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram Enelane is an IT solution based primarily on the need for secure data exchange in the energy sector, but it can easily be used outside this area as well. It provides secure data exchange within the corporate infrastructure, including external data communication with third parties, with easy management and control. It can be used as a data communication gateway between the organisation and the external environment, or for integrating disparate IT systems within the organisation. One of the key factors that differentiate Enelane from other solutions is its easy scalability and high throughput. It can process a large number of data messages in a very short period of time, making it an ideal choice for transmission or distribution system operators (TSOs and DSOs), as well as other energy market participants. Enelane can easily handle increases in the number of users and data volume without slowing down performance. This also makes it an ideal solution for electricity traders who need to quickly and reliably transfer data on energy volumes and prices, and obtain the information necessary for planning the transmission of electricity. The speed of message processing depends on the size of the message. Small messages are processed by Enelane in about 10 ms, messages of common size around 100-200 kB in 500 ms and large messages in the order of seconds. Of course, the processing time also depends on the complexity of the data stream that processes the message (validation, metadata extraction, transformation). Enelane was designed to handle large volumes of data and to be able to adapt to the needs of different types of customers. As part of our commitment to service excellence, we put Enelane through rigorous stress tests to validate its scalability and throughput. During the stress tests, we simulated a high number of concurrent data transfers and real-time communications. Enelane was able to handle these demands without significant slowdown, demonstrating that our technology can handle high volumes of data traffic without compromise, and do so quickly and reliably. In this benchmark test, Enelane sent and received 2 KB messages in twenty and fifty parallel threads, respectively, in each direction. The obtained results were measured on a regular server (CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009, Intel Xeon Silver 4114 CPU @ 2.20 GHz) while deploying Enelane in Docker. For higher throughput and performance requirements, Enelane can be scaled up by adding additional resources (CPU, memory) as well as by adding additional servers to create a powerful Enelane cluster. With these superior performances, we believe Enelane is the ideal solution for the energy market and for all customers who need a fast, reliable and scalable data exchange solution.
