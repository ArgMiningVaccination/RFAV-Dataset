Ayurvedic & Organic Makeup Products | Natural Makeup & Beauty Products Online From Just Herbs Ayurveda is an age-old Hindu system of medicine. It focuses on attaining the balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Ayurvedic herbs have been used since ages to naturally heal or enhance skin and hair and now are incorporated in many natural makeup products for the skin. They have also become an integral part of the lives of modern families. Be it skin or [hair care](https://www.justherbs.in/collections/view-all-hair-products), herbal cosmetic products have made their way into every home. Things to know before buying natural makeup products online There are many things you must consider before buying natural makeup products online. You cannot pick up anything off the rack that has '100% natural' written on it. The first step is to look at the ingredients used in the organic makeup products you are interested in. Here are some ingredients you have to say a big No to: Parabens Parabens have been used in skin care products as artificial preservatives since the 1920s. Although these chemicals reduce any growth of mould and bacteria on your skin, they disrupt bodily hormones. Parabens are said to harm reproductive organs and fertility, increase the risk of cancer, and may affect births. Additionally, they can irritate your skin. ( [1](https://www.ewg.org/what-are-parabens#:~:text=The%20concern%20with%20these%20chemicals,can%20also%20cause%20skin%20irritation)) Petrochemicals On the other hand, petrochemicals harm your health, including irritation in the eyes and skin. You might experience shortness of breath, a congested nose, sore throat, dizziness, and weakness due to significant exposure to petrochemicals. ( [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24851575/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20The%20results%20showed%20that,exposure%20to%20industrial%20air%20pollutants)) GMOs Although the long-term impacts of GMOs are unknown, there are some short-term side effects you may experience ( [3](https://andalou.com.au/blogs/our-blog/gmos-in-skincare#close)): - Allergies - Skin irritation - Digestive problems - Clogged pores - Acne breakouts - Fatigue or foggy effect BHA (Butylated hydroxyanisole) BHA are related to synthetic antioxidants that are used in cosmetics as preservatives. Multiple health benefits come with using BHA in makeup products. They can induce allergies and are recognised as potential human carcinogens. ( [4](https://davidsuzuki.org/living-green/dirty-dozen-bha-bht/#:~:text=Health%20and%20Environmental%20Hazards,possible%20human%20carcinogen%20%5B2%5D)) Fragrance Chemicals Fragrance chemicals are volatile organic compounds that vaporise to release a pleasant smell. Beauty products with fragrance chemicals can cause headaches, irritation of the throat, nose, and eye, nausea, and other respiratory problems. These fragrance chemicals can harm individuals with asthma because they sometimes aggravate asthma attacks or sinus conditions. ( [5](https://noharm-uscanada.org/issues/us-canada/fragrance-chemicals)) Sulphates Sulfates are mineral salts that may be man-made or natural. These are results of either decay of animal and plant matter or textiles, tannery, steel mills, and mining industries. Sulfate compounds are found in face cleaners; however, they are predominantly used in laundry and dish detergent, shampoos, and bath bombs. Sulphates can cause dry skin due to too much oil extraction. This will wear off your skin's protective layer and expose you to dryness and red, itchy skin. Individuals with sensitive skin might get skin inflammation or oedema. ( [6](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/what-to-know-sulfate)) Things you need to do before buying Ayurvedic Makeup Products Online shopping is the 'to-go' form of shopping (ironically). While you shop for herbal makeup products online, you won't have access to the product's colour, texture, and feel. You're going in blind. Therefore, here are some tips and hacks to buy natural makeup products you can find online. - Identify the Texture and Colour of your skin Not all types of natural makeup products will enhance your skin tone. Reviews will give you the most reliable idea about a product. See if the product gets easily oxidised or changes colour when it settles. Use a product only if it sits well with your skin type to prevent irritation and too much dryness or stickiness. For products you apply on your face and any nail polish, look for the most flattering colours according to your skin colour. Don't invest in something you aren't sure of. However, if you're in that phase which we all go through, where you just want a new look and want to experience something, go right ahead! If you want to try out a bold eyeshadow, find that colour in a texture that suits you. You'll feel more confident trying it out. - Search Search Search It doesn't matter whether you're buying from a well-known natural makeup brand; you must research. Use the beautiful 'filters' option and filter out some to narrow your options. The only way to buy suitable makeup products online is to check your shade in a store. This will make things so much easier! Don't run to it if it's on sale! If you have used a product, loved it, and it's on sale, buy it as soon as your fingers can move across a screen! However, if you see something new, look at the reviews and look at a few blogs on it. Will this shade of lipstick give you a look you want? Look at reviews from beauty editors, makeup artists, and independent blogs. Check out Just Herbs hair care & skin care products online Individuals who apply makeup every day must know that there are some rules you must follow when it comes to makeup. Applying conventional products repeatedly can expose you to unknown chemicals that might do more harm than good. These chemicals might pose health risks and affect bodily functions. However, at Just Herbs, all ingredients are harvested from their original habitat. Additionally, Just Herbs uses certified and cold-pressed plant oils as the base in most products. You also won't find ingredients such as synthetic preservatives, artificial colours and fragrances, and heavy metals in our products. Natural products use plants in their rawest forms and avoid bleaching, refining, deodorising, and striking them with gamma radiation. All makeup products at Just Herb are made without animal cruelty.
