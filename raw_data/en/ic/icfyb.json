Pain Management In the middle of the current opioid crisis, it's no wonder acupuncture has become more popular than ever as an opioid alternative in the US. As a matter of fact, this ancient form of Chinese medicine has historically been used for pain management for centuries. Fun fact - acupuncture is even supported by Medicaid and the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Even though there's still more research to be done, acupuncture has been reported to be useful for managing pain condition such as: - Chronic back pain - Chronic neck pain - Chronic osteoarthritis pain - Chronic headaches But that's not all. Acupuncture is also a practical alternative for those who think that modern medicine is falling short. Schedule your next appointment online!New patient appointments require a $35 deposit.

Services We Offer Acupuncture Chinese Herbal Medicine Reiki Fertility Pain Management Cupping, Gua Sha and Moxibustion We all have ONE main energy (Power) channel that runs through the center of our body. Everything in the body gets fed energy from this ONE main channel. The focus of this treatment is two fold: 1: To actively remove any blockages that may be in the main channel. 2: To release any blockages in the auxiliary channels which branch out from the main channel and feed the rest of the body. Blockages in the auxiliary channels cause very specific problems and issues in the body depending on the location of the blockage - i.e. physical problems (migraines, headaches, back pain, digestive disorders, etc.), emotional disorders (anxiety, depression, etc.), neurological disorders, and combination disorders (disorders affecting multiple systems). What is Chinese Herbal Medicine? Chinese Herbal Medicine is based on a Chinese Medical Diagnosis. We, as practitioners of Chinese Medicine, are looking for what is causing the problem according to Chinese Medical Theory. If you fix the cause, then there will be no re-occurrence of the problem. In other words, it is not simply a symptomatic treatment. For example, if a person has a headache, there is no specific \"headache\" herb in Chinese Medicine, although it can treat headaches quite effectively. In order to do this, we have to make a Chinese Medical Diagnosis (find the cause). We would need to know the location of the headache (temples, back, front, or top of head, etc.), the type of pain (dull, achy, sharp, etc.), whether or not the headache is constant or it comes and goes, what brings it on, is it better or worse at a certain time of the day, what makes it better or worse, etc. We would also look at the tongue and feel the pulse for clues as to what is causing the headache. We take these signs and symptoms and this leads us to a Chinese Medical Diagnosis. Once we have the Chinese Medical Diagnosis, then we do the appropriate treatment to correct the imbalance.
