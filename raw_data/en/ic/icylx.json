You are what you eat, and this helps to prepare your mind, body, and spirit for your work with the medicine. In addition to entering ceremony in a clean state, it also shows the spirit of Ayahuasca your intention, discipline, and commitment to the process. The dietary guidelines as outlined in the [Preparation section of Our Process](https://www.arkanainternational.com/preparation) offer suggestions on what to avoid and what to incorporate in your diet leading up to your retreat. Arkana's Commitment to Nutrition At every meal, we offer unique smoothies and juices using superfoods and fresh fruits from the jungle, including camu-camu, maracuya (passion fruit), mangoes, and acai. We also include a healthy portion of deliciously cooked vegetables, and there is always a wide variety of common and exotic jungle fruits available. For guests who eat meat, our meals use only fish, chicken, beans, and eggs for protein. No red meat, and all our food is fresh and prepared daily. We cook with a little bit of oil and himalayan salt, which has natural minerals, in order for our guests to maintain their electrolytes in the heat and replace what they sweat out. Why A Proper Diet Is So Important As part of our alchemy for your transformation, what we put into our bodies is as important as what we put into our minds and our hearts. Food is medicine too. We provide our guests with fresh, delicious, wholesome meals to promote all aspects of the healing process. We are proud to provide healthy, balanced meals throughout the entirety of your stay. We work with our shamans to ensure that all food is Ayahuasca-friendly, while maintaining a delicious variety of local and regional food that is always fresh and prepared with love. For those guests who adhere to a stricter diet; we offer delicious options for people who don't eat meat, animal products, or gluten. Just let us know "}
