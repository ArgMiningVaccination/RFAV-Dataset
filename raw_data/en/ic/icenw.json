It may simply be meditation done under the guidance of a trained practitioner or teacher, or it may be through the use of imagery, music, and other techniques. The session can be either in person, via media comprising music or verbal instruction, or a combination of both. The most common form is a combination of meditation music and receptive music therapy, guided imagery, relaxation, mindfulness, and journaling. Because of the different combinations used under the one term it can be difficult to attribute positive or negative outcomes to any of the various techniques. Furthermore, the term is frequently used interchangeably with \"guided imagery\" and sometimes with \"creative visualization\" in popular psychology and self-help literature. It is less commonly used in scholarly and scientific publications. Consequently, guided meditation cannot be understood as a single technique but rather multiple techniques that are integral to its practice. Relaxing music series help you calm down. These music are great for relaxing, meditation, yoga, massage, studying, reading, sleeping, working and more. Copyright \u00a9 2021 Soothing Relaxation & Meditation Music. All rights reserved.
