Schools are required to provide parents with HPV information and vaccine availability, but the HPV vaccine is not mandated. Pharmacists are not authorized to administer vaccines to children under age 11 without a physician's order. Allowed during PHE through PREP Act and IN Executive order. Medicaid children must receive their childhood vaccines through the Vaccine for Children (VFC) program. Current Outcomes Indiana ranks 36thin the nation for HPV vaccination rates. To date, relatively few private practices are providing COVID vaccines, posing risk for negative repercussions for childhood catch -up vaccines. The Children and Hoosier Immunization Registry Program (CHIRP) has been noted as an Indiana strength. Very few pharmacies in Indiana are enrolled as VFC providers.Vaccine Considerations 25Identify opportunities to increase vaccine knowledge and motivationVaccine \"catch -up\" programs in schools provide opportunities to increase vaccine rates but must be balanced with efforts to encourage primary care visits Facilitate and support private practitioner capacity to administer all recommended childhood vaccinesSome stakeholders spoke of concern families will not attend well child visits if vaccinations are readily available via alternative sitesObesity, Nutrition, Food Insecurity & Physical Activity 26 SOURCES: IC 20 -30-5-7; IC 20 -30-5-7.5; IC 20 -26-9-18.5; Jump IN; 2021 Indiana KIDS COUNT Data Book .

HEA 1405 passed in 2021 authorizes FSSA to expand school -based services eligible for Medicaid reimbursement beyond those in an IEP . Current HB 1192 clarifies the scope of these additional services as those delivered by school -based nurses or licensed providers employed or contracted by a school corporation. Participating local education agencies (LEAs*) retain the federal share of Medicaid reimbursements and restore the state -funded portion to state tuition support. LEAs may use their unrestricted federal Medicaid funds as they choose.Medicaid Administrative Claiming Allows public school corporations to recover federal matching funds for state/locally -funded administrative activities that school staff perform to assist students who have unmet health care needs such as: Providing information on health coverage options Translation for health services Referrals and appointment scheduling Coordinating or attending meetings or trainings on health services Developing plans and strategies to improve student health service deliverySBHC National Landscape Some states allocate funds to SBHCs.
