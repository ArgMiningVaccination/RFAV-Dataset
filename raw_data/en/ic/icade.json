The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rule making notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative documents af fecting rules that are statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-related documents an agency may want to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to provide public notice of all rulemaking actions and must invite public input. This is done through negotiated rulemaking procedures or after proposed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedures through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a legal notice (Public Notice of Intent) that publishes in authorized newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to par ticipate when a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency, if none have been scheduled. Such submissions or requests must be pr esented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" for each proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, the ag ency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed rule at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowt h\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislative review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the rulemaking that will be fo rwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when the agency adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by the calendar y ear and issue number. For example, Bulletin 13-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2013; Bulletin 14-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2014. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, co rrespond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 13-1 refers to January 2013; V olume No. 13-2 refers to February 2013; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January 2014 is cited as V olume 14-1. The December 2015 Bulletin is cited as V olume 15-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online comp ilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full force and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codified into the Administrative Code up on becoming effective. All pending rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legisla tive session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administrative Code. These rules are codified into the Admi nistrative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending rules are not en forceable, they are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into the Administrative Code until approved as final. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index. Link to it on the Administrative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct rulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies must, when feasible, engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested persons and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule through dialogue. Agencies are required to conduct negotiated rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 August 3, 2016 -- Volume 16-8The agency files a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate - Ne gotiated Rulemaking\" for publication in the Administrative Bulletin inviting interested persons to contact the agency if interested in discussing the agency's intentions regarding the rule changes. This process is intended to result in the formulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of regular rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that regular (proposed) rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is taken by the agency. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to th e adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) fo r the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority for or is occasioning the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the subs tance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided, however, that notwithstanding Section 67-5231, Ida ho Code, the absence or accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the rule. d) if any document is incorporated by reference in the proposed rule, a brief written synopsis of why the incorporation is needed must be in cluded in the notice of proposed ru lemaking, along with a link to the electronic version of the incorporated material or information on how it can be obtained. e) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; f) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; g) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to wh om comments on the proposal may be sent; h) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and i) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. Any proposed rulemaking that is submitted for publication in the Bulletin that would impose a fee or charge must be accompanied by a cost/benefit analysis that is prepared by the ag ency. This cost/benefit analysis must estimate, as reasonably as possible, the costs to th e agency to implemen t the rule and the estimated costs that would be borne by citizens or the private sector. This analys is is filed with the Director of Legi slative Services Office who then forwards it to the appropriate germane joint subcommittee assigned to review the promulgating agency's proposed rules. When incorporating by reference, the notice of proposed rulemaking must include a brief synopsis detailing the need to incorporate by reference any additional materials into the rule. The agency mu st also provide information regarding access to the incorporated materials. At a mini mum, and when available, the agency must provide an electronic link to the documents that can accessed on a web s ite or post this information on its own web site, or both. This link can be placed into the ru le and activated once it is posted on the Coordinator's web site. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may adopt the pend ing rule. Because a proposed rule is not enforceable, it has no effective date, even when published in conjunction with a temporary rule that is of full force and effect. An agency may vacate (terminate) a rulemaking after the publication of a proposed rule if it decides, for whatever reason, not to proceed further to finalize the rulemaking. The publication of a \"Notice of Vacation of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin officially stops the formal rulemaking process.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 7 August 3, 2016 -- Volume 16-8TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; orc) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of the above legal crite ria and the governor determines that it is necessary that a rule become effective prior to receiving legislative auth orization and without allowing for any public input, the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. The law a llows an agency to make a temporary rule immediately effective upon adoption. However, a temporary rule that impo ses a fee or charge may be adopted only if the governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a final rule, or expires under its own terms. The statute that regulates rulemaking in Idaho requires that the text of all proposed rulemakings publish in the Bulletin in order for the rulemaking to be valid. This is true for all temporary rules as well. In most cases, the agency wants the temporary rule to also become a final rule and in most of these cases, the temporary rule and the proposed rule text is identical. In this event, both rulemakings may be promulgated concurrently, however, they remain separate rulemaking actions. The rulemaking is published in the Bulletin as a temporary/proposed rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text in the Bulletin. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. The agency must publish a notice of rescission to effectively rescind the temporary rule. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rule that is being vacated, the agency, in most instances, will rescind the temporary rule. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule;b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective and a statement that the pending rule may be rejected, amended or modified by concurrent resolution of the legislature; d) an identification of any portion of the rule impo sing or increasing a fee or charge and a statement that this portion of the rule shall not become fi nal and effective unless affirmatively approved by concurrent resolution of the legislature; (e) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to the specific section of the Idaho Code that has occasioned the rulemaking, or the federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; and (f) a specific description, if applicable, of any ne gative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 8 August 3, 2016 -- Volume 16-8than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided however, that notwithstanding section 67-5231, Idaho Code, the absence or accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or the enforceability of the rule. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pendi ng rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that me mbers of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of th e pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the sections or their subparts that have changed from the proposed text are republished. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Adoption of Pending Rule\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agen cy under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect. No pending rule adopted by an agency becomes final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review and approval. Where the legi slature finds that an agency has viol ated the legislative intent of the authorizing statute, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking in whole or in part. A \"Notice of Rulemaking - Final Rule\" and the final codified text must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is partially rejected by concurrent resolution of the legislature. Unless rejected by concurrent resolution, a pending rule that is reviewed by the legislature becomes final and effective at th e end of the session in which it is reviewed without any further legislative action. All pending rules that are appr oved by concurrent resolution become final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution unless otherwise stated. In no event can a pending rule become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

Each state agency ha s a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphab etical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administration's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket number is a series of numbers separated by a hyphen (38-0501-1401). (the two-digit agency code) in the Bulletin. The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket number: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-1401\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule bein g promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2014. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2014 would be designated as \" 1402\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 1402. Within each Docket, only th e affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10

OF RULEMAKING - ADOPTION OF TEMPORARY RULE EFFECTIV E DA TE: The effective date of the temporary rule is July 1, 2016. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given this agency has adopted a temporary rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 22-101(3), 22-2403, 22-2411, 22-2412, and 22-2413, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule: USDA no longer requires a CAN brand on animals imported from Canada as long as they have two other forms of identification. The additional requirement to CAN brand im ported bison adds to the stress and risk of injury to an animal before shipment. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: USDA changed its animal import standards. Only cattle imported from Canada are required to have a CAN brand, not bison. Compliance with these national standa rds requires two other forms of identification for bison imported from Canada. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger and the fee is described herein: ISDA does not anticipate any fiscal im pact from the changes to be made to the Rule during this rulemaking.

PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearings concerning this rulemaking will be held as follows: The hearing sites will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Professional Standards Commission (PSC) follows a St rategic Plan of annually reviewing twenty percent (20%) of the Idaho Standards for Initial Certification of Professional School Personnel. These standards are incorporated by reference in rule in IDAPA 08.02.02. 004.01. The following certificates and endorsements were reviewed by committees of content experts: Art, Biology, Chemistry, Communication, Drama, Early Childhood/Early Childhood Special Education Blended Certificate, Earth an d Space Science, Economics, Elementary, Generalist, Health, Journalism, Mathematics, Music, Natural Scien ce, Physical Education, and School Social Worker. All standards and endorsements were revised to better align with national standards and best practices. The proposed endorsement revisions include renaming the \"Ear ly Childhood/Early Childhood Special Education Blended Certificate\" to \"Blended Early Childhood Education/Earl y Childhood Special Educatio n Certificate\" to increase clarity regarding the intent of the certificate. Additionally, the specific Birth through Grade 3 range of the endorsement is now officially being named as an endorsement in rule. A new endorsement will provide Idaho universities the opportunity to prepare their \"Blended Early Childhood Education/Early Childhood Special Education Certificate\" candidates to teach elemen tary through Grade 6, to increase the number of teachers who can teach elementary special education by meeting additional requirements. Two additional Generalist Endorsements will encourage teacher preparation candidate s to consider adding a special education endorsement allowing th em to specialize in either elementary or secondary grades to help address the need for more special education teachers. In addition , \"All Subjects K through 8\" endorsement has been added to rule. The name has been added to Elementary Certificates for a number of years to designate what the certificate holder can teach, but it was never officia lly listed in rule as an endorsement.Thursday, October 13, 2016 - 6:00 PM Monday, October 17, 2016 - 6:00 PM Lewis & Clark State College Williams Conference Center Clearwater Room 500 8th Avenue Lewiston, ID 83501College of Western Idaho Nampa Campus Aspen Building, Room 108 6002 Birch Lane Nampa, ID 83687 Monday, October 24, 2016 - 6:00 PM Marshall Public Library Minnie Howard Community Room 113 S.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 33-105 and 33-1702, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearings concerning this rulemaking will be held as follows: The hearing sites will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Currently, Section 3.5 of the Operating Procedures for th e Idaho Public Driver Education Programs states public driver education and training instructors shall have a medical examination that meets the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Regulations (49 CFR 391.41-391.49). In March of 2014, the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Regulations began requiring only specifically trained medical providers to perform these physicals, thereby raising the cost to the individual significantly. Department of Transportation physicals are not covered as part of the medical benefit provided by insurance. This rule is intended to update the Operating Procedures for Id aho Public Driver Education Programs to remove the specific requirement to have a Fe deral Motor Carrier Department of Transportation physical.

While the manual is referenced in the rule, it has not been formally incorporated by re ference. The manual meets the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requirement of 20 US Code Section 1412, and is consistent with other state and federal regulations regarding the education of individuals with disabilities. Amendments to the manual since the December 2014 a pproval include: changing the manual to reflect federal guidance about confidentiality agreements; removing reference to No Child Left Behind due to the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); removing outdated reference to psychosocial rehabilitation; changing references to highly qualified teacher to align with ES SA; clarifying language regarding Idaho's 10-day rule for parents objections to a district's proposal for an Individual Educational Program; adding additional resources to the Procedural Safeguards Notice and making introduction more parent friendly; removing references to the Appendices that are no longer attached to the manual; and fixing typos throughout document. Additionally, several revisions within IDAPA 08.02.03.109 regarding Special Education are needed to comply with federal regulations, as well as to clarify language a nd update the rule to reflect current practice. Changes would clarify the scope of the 10-day rule for objection to a change in an individualized education program or placement, and would align mediation proce dures with federal regulations.

The action is au thorized pursuant to Sections 30-14-605 and 30-14-608, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 17, 2016. The hearing site (s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking:I. Amendments Associated with Federal Regulato ry Naming Conventions and Related References The Department's rules reference various rules of federal regulatory bodies with whom the Department shares regulatory authority. II. Amendments Resulting from Federal Preemption of State Authority During 2015 and as a result of the federal Dode Frank legislation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) passed new rules governing federal Regulation A secu rities offerings. In part, these new rules preempted state authority to oversee and comment on the disclosures presente d in certain securities offerings but partially retained state authority to require filings and coll ect fees. Rule XX clarifies the effect of this federal preemption and allows the Department to know who will be offering Regulation A securities to Idaho residents and to reduce its fee schedule accordingly. Recently the former National Association of Securities Dealers (NSASD) was renamed as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Various rules changes are associated with eliminating and replacing NASD references to FINRA references. Where applicable, some references to CFR 1 citations have been amended to reference the appropriate CFR rules citation. III. Amendments Associated with Multi-State Uniform Guidelines The Department collaborates with 50 other state secu rities regulators, as well as Canadian and Mexican securities regulators through the North American Securities Regulators Association (NASAA) http:// www.nasaa.org/about-us/our-role/ . Many of these efforts are directed at providing a uniform regulatory framework for securities issuers across jurisdictions. The Department seeks to amend its ex isting incorporation of NASAA Statem ents of Policy to reflect changes in these uniform guidelines during the last ten years. IV . Rules Intended To Streamline Multi-State Securities Issuer Filings To provide some regulatory relief for certain securities issuers that wish to sell securities in multiple jurisdictions, the Department piloted and allows the use of a national electronic depository (EFD) for the filing of certain documents. Acknowledgment of this optional issuer filing format will be provided for in these rules.V . Rule Amendment to Clarify State/Federal Investment Adviser Books and Records Requirements There are two tiers of regulated investment advisers in the United States. Investment advisers with assets under management in excess of $100 million are required to register only with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, while those managing funds under $100 million are required to register only with their state of domicile. Since Advisers may, over time, experience varian ces in their \"book of business\", they may migrate back and forth between federal and state oversight. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE Docket No. 12-0108-1601 Rules Pursuant to the Uniform Securities Act (2004) Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 70 August 3, 2016 - Vol. 16-8The Department seeks to minimize the changes required of state registered advisers as they move between the two regulatory systems. VI. Clarification Regarding In vestment Adviser and Investment Adviser Representative Registration Platforms Investment Advisers and their representatives are requir ed to use national registration platforms to license in the jurisdictions where they will conduct business. Presently, advisers use the \"IAR\"2 while their representatives use a corollary system known as the \"CRD.\"3 The rules pertaining to these adviser and adviser repres entative registrations are being amended to clarify which registration platform should be used based upon the registrant's status as either an adviser or an adviser representative. VII. Update to Better Identify Suitability Standards Where Investment Advisers are Involved Rule 104.04 proposes to add language that clarifies that investment advisers have a duty to provide suitable recommendations in connection with their advisory activities when advising clients to purchase or sell securities.VIII. Clarification Regarding Investment Adviser Financial Statement As a condition of registration and ongoing compliance, investment advisers must demonstrate solvency by providing a balance sheet to the Department. To avoid confusion on the format and content of Adviser balance sheets, it is proposed that Rule 89.01(e) be amended to identify that balance sheets provided to the Department are prepared substantially in accordance with Generally Accepted A ccounting Principles (GAAP) 1 Investment Adviser Registration Depository2 Investment Adviser Registration Depository3 Central Registration Depository FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: There are no proposed additional fees associated with the proposed rules changes. There is one fee reduction associated with the implemen tation federal preemption of state authority in association with certain securities registrations. The prospective fee reduction and resulting loss of revenue does not materially affect projected agency revenues.FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/ANEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the May 4, 2016 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 16-5, pages 46-47 . INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: The regulation of securities issuers, as well as financial professionals, firms and agents is a shared burden between states and federal authorities. Rather than develop separate state standards, the Department seeks to provide a level playing field for all affected financial professionals by incorporating various rules of pertinent Self Regulator Organizations (SROs) such as the Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The Department has previously adopted various policy statement of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) in order to promote uniformity among state regulators. This approach provides industry participants with a uniform approach to regulation (more certainty) while reducing compliance costs with the application of broadly accepted standards of conduct.ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the proposed rule, contact Jim Burns at (208) 332-8080, jburns@finance.idaho.gov , or securitiesrules@finance.idaho.gov .

Section 013.02 (Donations) - eliminate the permission to donate or contribute to, or otherwise sponsor a trade association event. Section 014.01 (Self-Promotional Items) - increas e amount spent on self-promotion items from $10 to $15/item and from $50 to $75/year in cumulative value. Section 014.02 (Educational Programs) - increase the expenditure from $10 to $20 per person.

PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearings concerning this rulemaking will be held as follows: The hearing sites will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Recent policy changes from the Land Board have resulte d in the department no longer presenting individual sales to the board for approval unless they fall outside established land board policies. This has resulted in some of the rules becoming obsolete. Additionally, the department has initiated the negotiated rule making process to address rules related to the sale of cedar poles. The current policy and rules that govern the sale of cedar poles may be legally questionable and do not help the department meet its constitutional mandate to maximize long term returns to the Endowments. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: There are no proposed fee increases. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year as a result of this rulemaking: These rules apply to the sale of forest products on State-Owned Endowment Lands, there will be no direct costs to the General Fund or dedicated funds that may be linked to addressing the rules. The purpose for addressing some of the rules is to improve the efficiency, cost effectiven ess and lessen environmental impacts of the current timber sale program resulting in greater returns to the Endowments.NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted.

To calculate this hypothetical levy, sum the amount of the school district's tort fund levied for the prior year, the agricultural equi pment replacement revenue, and the personal property replacement revenue, then divide this sum by the school district's taxable value used to determine the tort fund's levy for the prior year. For the current year, the allowed tort fund increase for new construction is this Hypothetical New Construction Levy times the current year's new construction roll value for the school district. (3-25-16) 11. Special Provisions for In terim Abatement Districts . When an interim abatement district transitions into a formally defined abatement district under Section 39-2812, Idaho Code, the formally defined abatement district shall not be considered a new taxing district as defined in Paragraph 803.01.g. of this rule for the purposes of Section 63-802, Idaho Code. For the formally de fined abatement district, the annual budget subject to the limitations of Section 63-802, Idaho Code, shall be the amount of property tax revenue approved for the interim abatement district. (4-2-08) 12. Special Provisions for Levies for Payment of Judgments by Order of Court . The levy permitted pursuant to Section 63-1305A, Idaho Code, requires that the taxing district first budgets the maximum amoun t of property tax permitted pursuant to Section 63-802, Idaho Code, including any foregone amount. This requirement shall be deemed to have been met if, despite additional budget allowed pursuant to Section 63-802, Idaho Code, every fund used by the taxing district levies at the maximum levy rate provided by law, or, if no maximum levy rate is provided, the fund levies the maximum permitted budget amount. To the extent necessary to enable all previously accrued foregone amounts to be levied, the taxing district may need to use additional funds within which it is permitted to levy property taxes before levying as permitted pursuant to Section 63-1305A, Idaho Code. (4-4-13) 13. Cross Reference for School Districts with Tuition Funds . School district tuition fund levies are exempt from the limitations of Section 63-802, Idaho Code.

Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For ar rangements, contact the undersigned at (208) 373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This rulemaking has been initiated to delete Section 582, Interim Conformity Provisions for Northern Ada County Former Nonattainment Area for PM-10. In reviewing the Rules for Control of Air Pollution in Idaho, DEQ discovered that Section 582 is outdated and no longer applicable. Section 582 was originally promulgated in 2001 to address Clean Air Act transportation conformity requirements for the PM10 Ada County nonattainment area. Transportation conformity requir es an area experiencing air quality problems to have a transportation plan consistent with air quality goals. Section 582 was promulgated as a temporary measure that was necessary until a required maintenance plan was developed. The maintenance plan has since been developed and was approved by EPA on October 17, 2003. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2016 for adoption of a pending rule. This pending rule docket is expected to be final and effective upon adjournment of the 2017 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. DEQ will submit the final rule docket to EPA for removal of Section 582 from Idaho's State Implementation Plan. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorporation by reference is necessary: Not applicable. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Negotiated rulemaking was not conducted. DEQ determined that negotiated rulemaking is not feasible due to the simple nature of th is rulemaking and because the provisions are outdated and are no longer applicable.IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: This proposed rule does not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government, nor is it broader in scope or more stringent than federal regulations.FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: T he following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: Not applicable. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning this rulemaking, contact Carl Brown at carl.brown@deq.idaho.gov or (208) 373-0206. Anyone may submit written comments by mail, fax or e-mail at the address below regarding this proposed rule.

It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2016 for adoption of a pe nding rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2017 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature.INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorpora tion by reference is necessary: Adoption of federal regulations is necessary to mainta in program primacy. Incorporation by reference allows DEQ to keep its rules up to date with federal regul ation changes and simplifies compliance for the regulated community. Information for obtaining a copy of the federal regulations is included in the rule. In compliance with Section 67-5223(4), Idaho Code, DEQ prepared a brief synopsis detailing the substantive difference between the previously incorporated material and the latest revised edition or version of the incorporated material being proposed for incorporation by reference. The Overview of Incorporations by Reference can be obtained at www.deq.idaho.gov/58-0105-1601 or by contacting the undersigned. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Negotiated rulemaking was not conducted. DEQ determined that negotiated rulemaking is not feasible due to the simple nature of this rulemaking and because DEQ has no discretion with respect to adopting EPA's federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA). Whenever possible, DEQ incorporates federal regulations by reference to ensure that the stat e rules are consistent with federal regulations.

This action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 88, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 17, 2016. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This rulemaking has been initiated to adopt into state rules the newly revised federal Technical Standards and Corrective Action Requirements for Owners and Operators of Underground Storage Tanks (USTs), 40 CFR Part 280, and to establish a fee struct ure. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) updated 40 CFR Part 280 on October 13, 2015 amending the 1988 federal regulations by increasing emphasis on properly operating and maintaining underground storage tank equipmen t. In order to retain state program approval/primary enforcement authority that was approved by EPA on February 28, 2012, Idaho is required to adopt the newly revised 40 CFR Part 280 and re-submit a state program approval application package by October 13, 2018. Additionally, these new regulations and successive federal grant reductions have made it impossible to maintain the minimum program effort necessary to retain state program approval. DEQ must negotiate a fee structure to ensure there is sufficient funding to maintain an underground storage tank program and retain state program approval. Fees would not exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per tank per year. Collection of UST fees is authorized by Section 39-119, Idaho Code. Senate Bill 1244 (2016) revised Section 39-8802(2)(d), Idaho Code, to allow for collection of UST fees under Section 39-119, Idaho Code. The revised 40 CFR Part 280 includes the secondary cont ainment and operator training provisions found in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. EPA is giving the states the option to adopt the new provisions or retain their existing secondary containment and operator training rules. DEQ pr oposes to retain its existing, less stringent, secondary containment and operator training rules (IDAPA 58.01.07.100 and 300) and incorporate the remainder of 40 CFR Part 280 by reference. In addition, DEQ proposes revisions that would simplify inspections, include a fee structure, remove duplicate definitions now found in 40 CFR Part 280, include a training requirement overlooked during the 2007 rulemaking, and provide for alternative periodic testing of containment sumps used for interstitial monitoring of piping. Owners and operators of underground storage tanks, cities, counties, bankers, lenders, realtors, petroleum marketers, consultants, representatives of the Idaho Petr oleum Storage Tank Fund Board of Trustees, and citizens of the state of Idaho may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language th e agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2016 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to become final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2017 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. FEE SUMMARY: DEQ must negotiate a fee structure to ensure there is sufficient funding to maintain an underground storage tank program and retain state program approval. Fees would not exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per tank per year. Collection of UST fees is authorized by Section 39-119, Idaho Code. In 2016, the Idaho Legislature revised Section 39-8802(2)(d), Idaho Code, to allow for collection of UST fees under Section 39-119, Idaho Code, (Senate Bill 1244).INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorpora tion by reference is necessary:DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0107-1601 Rules Regulating Underground Storage Tank Systems Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 145 August 3, 2016 - Vol. 16-8Adoption of federal regulations is necessary to mainta in program primacy.

( ) 02. Alternative Test Method Allowed . ( ) a. As an alternative to the allowable test method in 40 CFR 280.35(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(C), containment sumps used for interstitial monitoring of piping may be tested as follows: ( ) i. Temporarily remove any interstitial monitoring containment sump sensors before conducting the test; ( ) ii. Add water to the containment sump up to a point directly beneath the first containment sump penetration fitting from the bottom of the containment sump. The water must be allowed to settle for at least fifteen (15) minutes; ( ) iii. Place a measuring stick that has one sixteenth (1/16th) inch increments into the lowest point in the containment sump and extending abov e the water level in the sump; and ( ) iv. Document the initial water level measurement as measured from the botto m of the containment sump. After one (1) hour, document the ending water level measurement. If the water level changes less than one eighth (1/8th) inch, the containment sump passes the integrity test. If the water level changes one eighth (1/8th) inch or greater, the containment sump fails the integrity test. ( ) b. Upon completion of the test, remove all water and properly dispose of it. Reinstall any interstitial monitoring sensors. Reinstall all containment sump lids, gaskets, and covers. ( ) 1012. -- 199. (RESERVED) 200. RELEASE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. 01.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 19-850(a)(i), Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 17, 2016. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The State Public Defense Commission has been granted the authority and obligation to provide training to defending attorneys throughout the State. The legislature has appropriated training funds so the Commission may accomplish this task. It is necessary for the Commission to operate under temporary rules at this time to begin immediately providing the requisite training to ensure that defending attorneys are providing constitutional representation.TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: Promulgation of this rule will have no negative ongoing fiscal impact, but will allow the Commission to disburse appropriated funds immediat ely, conferring a benefit. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: This rule will not require any additional expense beyond the already appropriated training funds. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There will be no negative fiscal impact on the state general fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the PDC needs the ability to use the funds appropriated by the legislature immediately. The PDC believes it is prudent to move forward without negotiated rulemaking to provide the requisite training rather than to continue to operate in the absence of any rules at all. The tr aining is required under the statute and to ensure that the defending attorneys across the state are providing constitutional representation.ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary and proposed rule, contact Kimberly Simmons at (208) 332-1735. Anyone may submit written comments regarding the proposed rulemaking.
