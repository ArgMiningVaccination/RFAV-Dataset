Some people want to have a happy romantic relationship, others want success in business, still others wish to make a contribution to others, be better parents, or simply live a healthy and energetic life. My job is to help you achieve your goals and objectives. Consider where you would like to be 5 years from now. In order for that to happen what needs to happen the fourth year? What puts this goal into motion? What needs to happen in year 3 and 2 and this year? What needs to happen in the next 6 months? These would be objectives, personal benchmarks, that would lead to the yearly objective, which would lead to the next yearly objective, etc., etc. So objectives are stages of achievement leading to the ultimate goal you've set for 5 years. A rather simplified version, yes, because there are obstacles and challenges along the way that require preparation as well as surprises that occur that can disrupt your focus. Negative thinking must be overcome and replaced by realistic and supportable qualities you probably didn't know you had. These are things that coaching brings out. It's not me telling you how great, talented and gifted you are, that's not my job. What I do is help you to realize all these things about who your are not to inflate your ego but rather for you to discover more about who you are and gain confidence, determination, and a commitment to yourself. It's really a fun process and sometimes intense, but understand, I don't tell you how to fix your issues. I am not a therapist, I don't diagnose or anything remotely related to that. I listen to you, from where you've been to where you choose to go and help you to get on the path and find it within yourself. Hoist your anchor and unfurl your sails. "}
