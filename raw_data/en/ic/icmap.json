This golden spice related to the ginger family has been used for centuries to support various aspects of well-being and as a natural skin and beauty aid.* The traditional uses of [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/turmeric) and its active component, curcumin, have been the subject of over 3,000 publications,REF#282 making it one of the most studied Ayurvedic herbs on the planet. Several of these studies focus on explaining how [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/turmeric) may benefit skin health.* In this article, you'll learn seven ways [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/turmeric) and curcumin can benefit your skin. Including how it works and how to use it for the best results. What Is Turmeric and How Does it Benefit Skin Health? [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/turmeric), also known as \"the golden spice\" or \"Indian saffron,\" is a bright orange rhizome (the stem below the ground) belonging to the ginger family. It's grown and cultivated throughout Eastern Asia, primarily India, where it's been used in Ayurveda and other traditional wellness practices for thousands of years. [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/turmeric) is considered sacred in parts of India and is used in religious ceremonies. It's also a staple in Indian and Asian cooking as a primary ingredient of yellow curry powder. Turmeric's traditional uses range from supporting inflammation and immunity to a digestive aid and skin healing ointment. As previously mentioned, [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/turmeric) has been extensively studied for its health benefits. Scientists have concluded the active component, curcumin, is mainly responsible for [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/turmeric) benefits for the skin and overall well-being.* How Curcumin Benefits Skin Health Curcumin is one of over 100 active plant compounds found in Turmeric. It is a powerful antioxidant* and is considered the primary active component of the plant. Scientists have shown that curcumin provides a wealth of benefits to the skin via its supportive effects on REF#283 REF#284 REF#285 REF#286 - Inflammatory response - Bacterial balance - The body's antioxidant capacity - The body's ability to neutralize oxidation - Gut microbiome health - Dermal microbiome health Research has also shown Turmeric and curcumin may benefit a variety of skin concerns when used topically and taken internally.REF#287 Let's explore how Turmeric and curcumin may benefit the skin and specific skin concerns.* 7 Remarkable Turmeric Benefits For The Skin Turmeric and curcumin can remarkably support skin health and beauty in various ways.* The following summarizes how Turmeric may benefit the skin based on scientific evidence and traditional use.* #1: Turmeric May Help Oily or Acne-Prone Skin Turmeric powder has long been used to improve the texture and condition of various skin types.* It's also been traditionally used to help balance oil production in acne-prone skin, making it a popular ingredient in many natural blemish products.* Some studies have validated this traditional use, which may be great news for those seeking a natural approach to acne.* One study published in the Tropical Journal of Pharmaceutical Research entitled: \"Effect of Turmeric (Curcuma longa Sebum Secretion\" found Turmeric extract helped balance skin sebum (oil) production when applied topically.REF#288 Excess sebum production is commonly associated with skin problems such as acne and clogged pores. Additional research has shown that Turmeric's supportive effects on the bacterial balance of the dermal microbiome and inflammatory response may also explain its positive effects on acne.REF#289 #2: Turmeric's Antioxidant Properties May Aid Skin Conditions Various types of persistent [skin conditions](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/eczema-treatments%20) have become common among adults and children. Fortunately, there is evidence suggesting Turmeric may provide some much-needed support by promoting normal [inflammatory levels](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/anti-inflammatory-supplements), skin barrier function, microbiome balance, of life.REF#290 REF#291 REF#292 REF#293 REF#294 More research is needed to draw a definitive conclusion. However, turmeric's demonstrated benefits for inflammation, microbiome, and skin barrier function suggest a positive effect for those with persistent skin issues.* #3: Turmeric May Support Wound Healing Turmeric pastes, and poultices have been used in Ayurveda to help speed wound healing for thousands of years.* Traditional Ayurvedic practitioners knew it worked but didn't have the modern resources to determine how it worked. Fast-forward to the 21st century: new research has shown how Turmeric supports wound healing.* Recent studies on the wound-healing properties of curcumin show it can support various aspects of wound healing, including REF#295 - Inflammation - Oxidation - Granulation tissue formation - Collagen deposition - Tissue remodeling - Wound contraction - Formation of scar tissue In other words, curcumin supports the body's inflammatory response, helps slow oxidation of the wound, and supports the skin in rebuilding and repairing damaged tissue.* [Curcumin or Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/curcumin-vs-turmeric) is traditionally used as a wound dressing and applied topically. To use Turmeric to speed wound healing on a superficial (not deep) cut or scrape: - Mix Turmeric with water to form a thick paste - Apply directly to the cut and put a bandaid on the paste to hold it in place - Change every few hours as needed For larger cuts, lesions, wounds that won't heal, and other injuries always seek medical advice first. #4: Turmeric May Support Healing of Burns Turmeric pastes and poultices have been used traditionally on various types of burns, including sunburns. Which was a real issue for those living in the topics before the invention of sunblock. New research supports the use of Turmeric for burns and sun-damaged/sunburned skin. In a study published in the International Journal of Dermatology titled: \"Signaling pathways targeted by curcumin in acute and chronic injury: burns and photo-damaged skin,\" scientists explain how it works.REF#296 The body releases a unique enzyme called Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) within five minutes following injury when the skin is burned. PhK activates inflammatory pathways in injury-activated scarring and plays an essential role in promoting the survival of precancerous cells after sunburn. Curcumin acts as a PhK inhibitor, which helps with short-term skin repair and prevents long-term consequences of sunburn.* Researchers noted the skin repair benefits from topical application of curcumin gel might take several months. #5: Turmeric Promotes A Healthy Glow Turmeric's natural antioxidants, bacterial-balancing properties, and deep orange color can help restore skin's healthy and youthful glow. There are various ways to use Turmeric on your skin, but face masks are one of the most popular. Here are some basic Turmeric mask formulas for DIY fun: Note: Turmeric will stain your clothes and almost anything in its path (countertops, towels, bowls, etc.), so be prepared with an old shirt, stainless steel bowls, old towels, and washcloths you're OK with ruining. - Try combining Turmeric with aloe vera and honey for a powerful deep-cleansing mask. - Mix a little Turmeric with plain yogurt to moisturize and protect. - Combine Turmeric with lemon and jojoba oil to lighten dark spots naturally. - Mash up an avocado with a few papaya cubes, and add 1-2 teaspoons of Turmeric for a naturally exfoliating and moisturizing experience. If you have sensitive skin, open wounds, are taking medication, or have a chronic skin condition, check with your doctor before using Turmeric on your skin. #6: Turmeric May Help Reduce Signs of Aging Turmeric is one of India's best-kept secrets for maintaining a youthful appearance from the inside out. This is thanks to its unique antioxidant properties, which have been shown to fight free radical damage while optimizing the body's natural antioxidant stores. Excess free radicals have been associated with premature aging because they cause inflammation and cell damage,REF#297 which can lead to premature aging. As previously discussed, curcumin can also help mitigate the effects of sun damage, which play a significant role in aging.* Research has also shown curcumin can reduce the formation of wrinkles and skin aging.REF#298 Should Turmeric be used topically and/or internally for aging? Both. The studies cited refer to Turmeric's benefits when used topically for skin aging and free radical damage. However, since consistent stress is a significant driver of the aging process and free radical formation,REF#299 Turmeric may be valuable when used topically and internally. Extensive researchREF#300 has validated Turmeric and curcumin's antioxidant benefits when taken internally. Plus, Turmeric belongs to a [group of herbs known as adaptogens](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/press/everything-you-need-to-know-about-adaptogens-explained), which help calm and support the body's stress response.* [Gaia Herbs Golden Milk](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/golden-milk) is a tasty and relaxing way to enjoy a daily dose of Turmeric and other adaptogenic herbs. #7: Turmeric May Help With Dark Spots and Even Skin Tone Skin lighteners are popular for reducing the appearance of brown spots and hyperpigmentation. Unfortunately, chemical-based skin lighteners, such as hydroquinone and topical steroids, can be dangerous and create [unwanted side effects](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/turmeric-side-effects), such as permanent skin damage.REF#301 This has led people to seek natural alternatives, which is where Turmeric comes in. Turmeric has been used in traditional Ayurveda for hyperpigmentation, age spots, brown spots, uneven skin tone, and scarring.* Research has also shown Turmeric may reduce hyperpigmentationREF#302 and scarring.REF#303 How to Use Turmeric on Dark Spots, Brown Spots, and Scarring* Turmeric is traditionally mixed with yogurt, oil, or water and applied directly to the affected areas. Some experts also recommend combining Turmeric with lemon juice, which has also been shown effective for lightening dark spots.REF#304 You'll need to repeat this process regularly over several weeks to see results.* Always check with your dermatologist or healthcare practitioner if you have very sensitive skin or a chronic condition. How To Begin Enjoying Turmeric's Benefits For Your Skin The best way to begin using Turmeric for your skin depends on your goals. If you're interested in using it topically, you can purchase a high-quality supplement or buy Turmeric in bulk to create your DIY personal care products. There are also many high-quality beauty products that contain Turmeric available on the market today. Look for chemical-free, non-toxic brands with a decent concentration of organic Turmeric. If you're interested in taking a Turmeric or curcumin supplement, we recommend following this criterion in your selection: - Look for organic Turmeric from a brand that does third-party testing for identity, purity, and contaminants - Choose a formula that contains Black Pepper or \"piperine,\" which helps aid absorption* - In general, you may consider a whole Turmeric supplement vs. pure curcumin. Turmeric contains various beneficial compounds, beyond curcumin, that are only available in its whole state.
