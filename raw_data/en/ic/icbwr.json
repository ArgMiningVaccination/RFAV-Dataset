Pfizer and Moderna both use mRNA and have been shown to be the most effective vaccines. Johnson & Johnson uses a protein found on the COVID-19 virus. What is mRNA and is it safe? mRNA or messenger RNA is the blueprint genetic code of the virus. Without the full virus, the mRNA cannot become infectious. Our body's immune system locates the mRNA and builds antibodies against this molecule to stop new infection. mRNA degrades naturally and within a few hours. mRNA cannot alter a person's DNA. Since the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the blueprint of the virus, they are likely to be effective against most strains of the virus. All established scientific communities have agreed that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and should be used. What are the side effects? Flu-like symptoms including fatigue, muscle pain, fever, headache. These are normal and will last for hours to a few days. there been collected on these vaccines to say they're safe? Yes! Over 6 billion doses have been administered worldwide. There is more data available supporting these vaccines than most other medical treatments or vaccines ever created. I don't have any risk factors for serious COVID infection. Do I still need to get the vaccine? Yes. Though rare, many patients have experienced \"long COVID\" symptoms that continue for months after a mild infection. We do not know the long-term health complications that may arise due to COVID-19, even in cases that resolve quickly. To prevent this and reduce spreading the virus to other people, it is highly recommended that people who are young or generally healthy still get the vaccine. Who shouldn't get the vaccine? Very few people fit into this category. If you have had a severe allergic reaction against your first dose of either vaccine, including being unable to breathe, it is recommended you do not receive the second dose. People with moderate allergic reactions including rashes are still recommended to get the full vaccine. Should I get the vaccine if I am pregnant or planning to become pregnant? Yes! The COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for all patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding, attempting to become pregnant, or plan to become pregnant in the future. This will also protect your newborn from the virus since they are not yet eligible. What if I have an autoimmune disease? Patients with autoimmune disease shared similar rates of vaccine side effects and vaccine efficacy, and therefore should still be vaccinated. Can I still get COVID after getting the vaccine? Yes, but the odds are extremely low. The vaccine also prevents a serious infection, drastically decreasing the risk of death.
