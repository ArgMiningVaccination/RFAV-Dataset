This document outlines a strategic vision for integrating chiropractors into the \"MedicalHome\" model of healthcare delivery as expressedby the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Actand endorsed by the Centers for Medicare andMedicaid Services (CMS). Briefly, the concept is that primary care doctors can play a key role in healthcare servicecoordination, and that by encouragingpartnerships between healthcare providers andindividual patients, affordable healthcare withimproved overall outcomes will result. Guy D'Andrea, a managing partner at Discern LLC, the consulting organization retained by theF4CP to develop the paper, says \"By using back pain as a case study of chronic problems, we see that by avoiding costly surgeries we can save a lot of money.

Claude Cote, founder and chief executive officer of Platinum System, was one of the realinnovators of providing a software system to thechiropractic community. In 1989, Cote beganhelping a chiropractic friend by developing achiropractic management software system.Word of mouth spread among chiropractors andCote quit his job and began assistingchiropractors full time. At that time, the software was only for billing and scheduling chiropractic patients. By September 2001, after five years of writing code to cover all the various functions of fully automated patient management systems through the office, keeping patient records,documentation for insurance and regulatoryagencies, and digitally handling more of the business side of the chiropractor, Cote offered Platinum System to the chiropractic world.

Manuel Duarte, DC, was one of the authors and researchers of the study. Duarte felt it was necessary to do a pilot study because orthotics are commonly used in the treatment of patients suffering from low-back pain. However, evidence and documentation supporting this form of treatment could not be found. T o learn more about this study, visit www.ChiroEco.com/footlevelersstudy.

These are areas of the body, often in the bellies of muscles, that are excessively tender when touched or pressed. Sometimes, the patient does not even know they are sore. They are usually a few inches away from the area of symptomatic complaint. Classical myofascial trigger points often radiate pain into the area of complaint when pressed, duplicating the patient's symptoms. Any tender area, radiating or otherwise, may respond to the agonist reflex. Pain on movement. This is when the muscle, joint, ligament, tendon, neck, low back, etc., hurts when the patient moves it. Often it hurts most in one direction or another, such as when the patient turns his or her head to the right, the neck hurts. When the patient bends forward, his or her low back hurts. Many times, pain on movement is caused by trigger points and will resolve when the trigger points are eliminated. Spontaneous pain. This is the pain that the patient is aware of, the pain that brings him or her into your office \u2014 the headache, low-back pain, joint pain, etc. This is the symptom.
