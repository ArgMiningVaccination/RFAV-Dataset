Thevery best of this work comes from epidemiologic studies ofAfrican Americans. This paper summarizes results of theseinvestigations, including findings identifying effects of reli-gious participation on both physical and mental health out-comes. Evidence mostly supports a protective religiouseffect on morbidity and mortality and on depressive symp-toms and overall psychological distress among AfricanAmericans. This paper also carefully discusses what theresults of these studies mean and do not mean, an impor-tant consideration due to frequent misinterpretations of find-ings on this topic. Because important distinctions betweenepidemiologic and clinical studies tend to get glossed over,reports of religion-health associations oftentimes draw erro-neous conclusions that foster unrealistic expectations aboutthe role of faith and spirituality in health and healing. Finally,implications are discussed for clinical practice, medicaleducation and public health. Key words: religion Iepidemiology Ihealth Imedicine I African AmericansFor the past two decades, researchers have sys- tematically investigated connections betweenaspects of religious faith and spiritual expressionand indicators of physical health status and mentaland emotional well-being. 1This work, some of it funded by research grants from the National Insti-tutes of Health (NIH), has been conducted for themost part by social and behavioral scientists; epi-demiologists; and physicians; mostly geriatricians,psychiatrists and family practitioners. Publishedempirical studies now exceed 1,200 in number,about 75-90% revealing a generally salutary associ-ation at the population level, 2depending upon the health outcome under consideration. These findings are especially pertinent to JNMA readers. Unlike so many other areas of healthresearch, there is no paucity of published data onreligious determinants of morbidity, mortality, andphysical and mental health status among AfricanAmericans. Indeed, the very best studies in terms ofmethodological sophistication, the widest range ofhealth outcomes, and focused programmatic efforthave been conducted in this population. 3-5 Several factors contribute to the increasing promi- nence of this research, including mainstream mediaattention and publicity, controversy aroused by medicalresearchers engaging concepts related to God and faith,and the occasional zeal of both opponents and propo-nents of this work. Invariably, overstatement and mis-statement of study results and implications occur inwhich much more is read into empirical results than thefindings merit. 6Specifically, the caveats of population- based health research often get lost in the translation, asqualifications and reservations related to researchdesign and interpretation familiar to epidemiologistsare glossed over in efforts to generalize findings pastwhere they can be reliably taken. 7 Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to pro- vide a comprehensive summary of empirical researchon religion and health among African Americans.First, an overview is provided of existing study find-ings for both physical and mental health.

RELIGION AND PHYSICAL HEALTH Over the past century, hundreds of published studies have identified religious differences in awide range of physical health outcomes and haveexamined effects of religiousness on health statusindicators and measures of disease states. 2,8-9Nearly every major disease entity and cancer site has beenstudied in relation to religion; especially large bod-ies of published data exist for morbidity due to coro-nary heart disease, hypertension and stroke, cancer,and for overall and cause-specific mortality. This lit-erature on the \"epidemiology of religion \" 10is part of a larger set of findings also linking expressions ofreligiousness to mental health, psychological well-being, healthy lifestyle behaviors, healthcare utiliza-tion and other health-related outcomes. 11-12 Results from these studies identify a consistently salutary relationship between religious participationand health status. This is expressed in two ways.First, observable differences in rates of morbidityand overall and cause-specific mortality exist acrossmajor categories of religious affiliation, with lowerrates typically found among members of religions ordenominations that make strict behavioral demands.Examples include Seventh-Day Adventists and Lat-ter-Day Saints. Second, higher levels of active reli-gious participation or observance are associated, onaverage, with less illness and with better health,according to a variety of scales or indices. The con-sistency of findings across a diversity of samples,designs, methodologies, religious measures, healthoutcomes and population characteristics serves tostrengthen the inference of a positive associationbetween religion and health. This finding has been observed in studies of old, middle-aged and young subjects, both men andwomen, from the United States, Europe, Africa andAsia. Studies have been published in every decadesince the late 19th Century, using retrospective case-control, prospective cohort, cross-sectional preva-lence and longitudinal panel designs. Subjects haveincluded Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims,Buddhists and Parsis, with religiousness assessed inany of over a dozen ways (e.g., church attendance,affiliation, private prayer, Bible reading, churchmembership, pro-cedures. included subjectsdrawn from Anglo-white, Hispanic, Asian-Ameri-can, and African-American populations. 13 Within the past two decades, comprehensive spe- cialized reviews have focused on this literature.Results of gerontological and geriatric studies havebeen especially well-summarized, review,15NIH- commissioned quantitative review,16annotated bibli- ography,17meta-analysis18and in a comprehensive textbook detailing results of over 1,200 studies.2 Research in African Americans Early reviews found that religion and health research among African Americans was scant andsuperficial. 8Even today, research on health, as in other topical domains, is yet to fully address andaccount for the uniqueness and diversity of African-American religious experience in the diaspora. 19 Still, studies by at least a couple of establishedresearch teams have been instrumental in providingempirical evidence that the unique patterns of reli-gious expression among African Americans havemeasurable impacts on a variety of physical andmental health indicators. 3 The best research on religion and health among African Americans has emphasized older adults orchanges in the religion-health dynamic across thelife course. Some of this work has focused explicitlyon African Americans; other research based on gen-eral populations has taken a racial-comparativeapproach, such as through stratification by race orthrough use of a binary black-white variable. Whilethis latter approach has been sharply criticized assimplistic in that it masks considerable cultural andethnic diversity among African Americans and maysuppress some significant health disparities, 20result- ing findings nonetheless provide evidence of inter-esting connections among religion, health and race.The concept of race is far too complex to be reducedto a sociodemographic variable, of course, but inthis limited context has proven useful to epidemio-logic researchers seeking to explore existing data inthe hope of identifying health status differences. Racial Differences in Religion and Morbidity National survey data beginning in the 1970s found interesting age differences in the extent to which fre-quent attendance at religious services is associatedwith both higher self-ratings of health and greater sat-isfaction with health. Among older African Ameri-cans, in contrast to older whites, church attendancehad no effect. 21In a sample of younger and middle- aged African Americans, again in contrast to whites,frequent attendance was strongly associated as wasstrength of religious affiliation. 22Among younger African-American men, a positive association wasJOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL. 97, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2005 239RELIGION, HEALTH AND MEDICINE found that reflected the mediating effects of social support or socioeconomic status.23 Longitudinal studies from the 1980s further revealed racial differences in patterns of religion-healthassociations. In national data, an index of religiouspractice predicted the health of African Americans butnot of whites. 24Among older African Americans only, religiousness served to counterbalance or offset thedeleterious effects of poor personal and family healthby heightening feelings of self-esteem. 25 Studies undertaken since the 1990s have identi- fied the complexities of racial differences in reli-gion-health associations. In one study, while fre-quent religious attendance was found to predict thehealth of both African Americans and whites,African Americans with the highest levels of func-tional health impairments engaged in more privatedevotional activities than less impaired AfricanAmericans, to the greater benefit of their self-assessed health. 26In a study of Protestant Christians, race was not a source of variation in physical activi-ty, body mass index or self-rated health. 27This is pertinent here, as African-American Protestantsexceeded their white counterparts in religious atten-dance and self-rated religiousness, variables associ-ated with health in other studies. Finally, an index ofreligious devotion (i.e., prayer and Bible study) wasassociated with greater depression in both AfricanAmericans and whites, but only among whites didhistory of chronic illness moderate this effect. 28 The best study to date, from a national sample of 1,126 noninstitutionalized older adults, revealed thatfrequent church attendance and greater congrega-tional cohesiveness were predictors of a self-ratingof overall health and that these effects were strongeramong African Americans, especially a mediatingeffect of optimism. 29The author concluded that \"old- er black people may derive greater health-relatedbenefits from religion because they are moreinvolved in it \" (p. S341). In summary, the weight of published evidence from this category of studies supports the presenceof a racial difference in the association between reli-giousness and morbidity. Evidence here is mixed butmoderately suggestive of a more salient religiousimpact on health among African Americans, espe-cially older adults. Religion and Morbidity in African Americans Since the late 1980s, the NIH has supported two research programs that focus on religion-health con-nections in data collected from African-American pop-ulations. Research by Brown and associates has result-ed in several important studies of the impact ofAfrican-American religion on health and well-being.One study found a gender difference in the stress- buffering effects of religious activity on physicalhealth. 30Among men, no relationship was present; among moderately religious women, greater life stresswas associated with poorer health; among less reli-gious women, stress and health were unrelated. Theauthors explained that African-American women mayincrease their religious participation to cope withstressful circumstances and concomitant personal andfamily health challenges. In an urban community studypublished in JNMA , no associations were observed between any religious indicator and either hypertensionprevalence or a self-rating of health. 31The authors spec- ulated that religious effects on health in this populationmay be more likely to show up in the long run in reduc-tions in morbidity and mortality rather than in currentassessments of health in younger subjects. Research at the University of Michigan 's Pro- gram for Research on Black Americans (PRBA) hassystematically investigated religious effects on avariety of health status indicators. In nationally rep-resentative data from the National Survey of BlackAmericans (NSBA), a composite index assessingorganized religious participation exhibited a strongeffect on overall well-being even after adjusting foreffects of health and several known sociodemo-graphic correlates of religiousness, health and well-being. 32These effects were observed in all age cohorts. A follow-up study replicated these findingsamong older adults in three national studies. 33 African Americans were more religious according toall available measures, yet adjusting for the effectsof a binary race variable did not diminish the statisti-cal significance of these religion-health associa-tions, suggesting that findings observed in theNSBA study were not unique to African Americans. In summary, the weight of evidence from this cate- gory of studies supports a positive associationbetween religiousness and health among AfricanAmericans. Findings from both the Brown and asso-ciates and University of Michigan research teams aresuggestive of a moderate health advantage amongreligious African Americans across the life course. Religion and Mortality in African Americans Since the early 1990s, a steady stream of findings suggests that religious participation protects againstpremature mortality and, thus, increases longevity. 18A handful of studies has included African Americans orexplored racial differences, with mixed results. Forexample, survival data reported a likelihood of mor-tality of 46% less among frequent church attendersover a period of 6.3 years; adjusting for effects ofrace, along with age, gender and education reducedthe protective effect only slightly, to 41%. 34Follow-up240 JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL. 97, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2005RELIGION, HEALTH AND MEDICINE data over 28 years found a 36% lower risk of mortali- ty among frequent religious attenders when adjustingfor effects of race, alongside age, sex, education andreligious affiliation. 35Studies like these reveal a sur- vival advantage for religious individuals but do notclearly identify a substantive black-white differencein this association. By contrast, a sophisticated analysis of national data uncovered an African-American survival advan-tage due to religious participation. 36Data on more than 20,000 adults compiled from the National Centerfor Health Statistics (NCHS) Multiple Cause of DeathPublic Use Data File matched subjects from the 1987National Health Interview Survey 's Cancer Risk Fac- tor Supplement to the National Death Index list ofdeaths through the end of 1995. The life expectancyestimate at age 20 for nonchurchgoers in the totalsample was 55.3 years; for greater-than-weekly atten-ders, it was 62.9 years, an advantage of about sevenyears. Among non-African Americans, the respectivelife expectancy estimates were 56.1 and 63.4 years \u2014 a similar seven-year advantage. Among AfricanAmericans, results were striking: nonchurchgoers hadan estimated life expectancy at age 20 of 46.4 years;for more than weekly attenders, the estimate was 60.1years. This translates to a nearly 14-year survivaladvantage for frequent church attenders. This level ofreligious attendance closes the racial gap in lifeexpectancy from nearly nine years in nonattenders toless than three years. Similarly sophisticated studies using African- American samples confirm a protective effect of reli-gious participation for longevity. In data from theNational Health Interview Survey, frequent churchattendance was strongly associated with survivalamong older African Americans. 37Nonattenders had 1.77 times the odds of dying within a four-year fol-low-up period than did church attenders. For women,the adjusted odds ratio was 1.63 and for men was2.72. In a more recent national study, the hazards ratiofor nonchurchgoers in the overall sample was 2.23;adjusting for effects of every other variable in thestudy, the ratio was 2.22. 38That is, nonchurchgoers experienced over twice the risk of dying in the eightyears of study follow-up compared to frequent atten-ders. Even for those who attended church as much asweekly, compared to more frequent attenders, thehazards ratio was 1.47, indicating nearly 1.5 times therisk of death and suggesting a sort of dose-responseeffect. The relative mortality risk among nonchurch-goers was observed separately in both younger (3.76)and older African Americans (1.96), in both women(2.54) and men (2.42), and in both Southerners (2.11)and non-Southerners (2.08). Adjusting for effects ofhealth, socioeconomic status, health behaviors andsocial ties had no substantive impact on the consisten-cy of these findings. The effect of religious participa- tion on longevity in this population must be due toother functions or characteristics of religiousness. In summary, the weight of evidence for this cate- gory of studies is supportive of an inverse relation-ship between religiousness and mortality amongAfrican Americans. Findings from several especiallylarge and sophisticated epidemiologic studies sup-port the presence of a protective religious effect onsurvival and longevity in this population. A final caveat: as with all epidemiologic findings, this inverse association between religious participa-tion and mortality among African Americans isexpressed on average and across large populations.Such an approach necessarily masks individual casesthat do not fit the general pattern (e.g., the cigarettesmoker who lives to 100, the fit athlete who dies sud-denly at 40 years of age). The present findings, aswith all epidemiologic results, thus should not beoverinterpreted as expressing universal effects butrather probabilities. It would be helpful for subse-quent research in this area to stratify by cause ofdeath, especially in order to determine precisely howand where a protective religious effect on survivalmanifests in the African-American population. RELIGION AND MENTAL HEALTH A growing literature has investigated religious effects on the mental health of African Americans,particularly on measures of depression. Studies alsohave explored the influence of religion on measuresof positive well-being, notably life satisfaction andhappiness. Comprehensive reviews have noted thepresence of many excellent studies whose findingspoint to a salutary effect of religion among AfricanAmericans or to interesting racial differences. Research on religious predictors of mental illness dates back decades. 39,40Early studies compared the prevalence of mental illness among active andunchurched Catholics, Protestants and Jews, 41and identified a dose-response relationship between psy-chological impairment and religious commitment. 42 Throughout the 1960s, clinical and epidemiologicstudies explored whether religious participationexhibited preventive effects on subsequent rates ofmental illness with mixed results. 43-45The 1970s wit- nessed expansion in the study of religion and mentalhealth, 46enough to fill a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) bibliography of over 1,500 scholarlyarticles, chapters, books and reports. 47Throughout the 1980s, studies became more sophisticated, with aconsistently positive relationship between religionand mental health identified in several comprehensivereviews. 48-50Since 1990, research has flourished, and a salutary mental-health impact of religious commit-ment, on average, is becoming accepted by investiga-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL. 97, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2005 241RELIGION, HEALTH AND MEDICINE tors.2,51The importance of religion was formally rec- ognized by inclusion in the DSM-IV of a new catego-ry acknowledging religious and spiritual problems aspotential sources of psychological distress. 52 Gerontological research on religion and well- being also flourishes, a development decades in themaking. Research began in the early 1950s, 53-56wax- ing and waning throughout the next 20 years until abrief resurgence in the middle 1970s. 57-58In the 1980s, work by Markides and Levin,59-64Koenig65-66and oth- ers67-68sparked an enduring renewal of interest. Since the late 1980s, studies have systematically investigat-ed patterns, determinants and outcomes of religious-ness 4in relation to psychological distress, addictive behaviors, coping, self-esteem, mastery, chronic anxi-ety, life satisfaction, happiness and depressive symp-toms. Reviews of this research, 5,14-15,69-74including an NIH-sponsored quantitative summary of studies pub-lished through the middle 1990s, 16all conclude that religion exerts, on average, a moderate and mostlypositive influence on dimensions of well-being. Research in African Americans The NIH review16identified 73 studies published in aging or social science journals between 1980 and1994 in which religious variables were included. Ofthese, 47 reported on the race or ethnicity of their studysample. Among this group, 11 studies were of African-American subjects only; 26 studies comprised multi-ethnic samples; of these, 13 noted the inclusion ofAfrican Americans. In total, 24 studies reported thepresence of African-American subjects. Y et only someof these studies focused on racial differences or report-ed religious effects among African Americans. Studies of religion, race and mental health and well-being have generally tackled the issue of race inone of three different ways: a) a binary race variablewas introduced in statistical models ostensibly inorder to adjust for effects of race on a religion-men-tal-health or religion-well-being association; b)explicit racial comparisons were made in associa-tions between respective religion and mental healthindicators; and c) African-American study sampleswere used, the approach characterizing most of thework produced by the PRBA and Brown and associ-ates teams. Many of these studies focus on olderadults or on age differences across the life course. Adjustment for Racial Effects Several studies published from the 1970s through 2002 included a binary race variable whose effectswere adjusted for in subsequent analyses. While notan ideal approach for examining the impact of race,these studies sought to investigate determinants ofpsychiatric or psychosocial outcomes. The investi-gators, sensitive to the potential importance of raceas a correlate of religious participation and of the outcome under study, commendably ensured that itseffects were adjusted for in multivariable analyses. Three studies, based on large national or regional samples, revealed protective or buffering effects ofreligion on depressive symptoms, although the impactof race is less clear. In one study, strength of religiousbeliefs exhibited a protective effect on a depressionmeasure based on the Langner scale. 75Race was adjusted for, which had no net effect on depression. Anational study found effects of several religious indi-cators on a depression index comprising items similarto the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression(CES-D) scale. 76Fundamentalist beliefs were a mod- erate predictor of depression, and protective effects ofchurch attendance and prayer were mediated respec-tively by church-based support and religious coping.Effects of race were adjusted for, as greater prayer,religious coping, fundamentalism and religious atten-dance were found among African Americans. 76A study of older veterans found religious coping uti-lized more by African Americans and black Protes-tants; religious coping inversely related to depression,as assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scales(GDS), and less depression among both AfricanAmericans in general and black Protestants. 77 Several studies investigated religious effects on indicators of psychological well-being, typically lifesatisfaction or happiness. All were based on largenational or regional studies, including four that useddata from the General Social Survey (GSS). In the1973 GSS, religious attendance predicted life satis-faction after adjusting for effects of race. 78Similarly, in the 1983 survey, religious attendance and devo-tional intensity exhibited strong effects on life satis-faction after adjusting for race. 79Using pooled data from the 1983 and 1984 surveys,80religious atten- dance predicted overall and marital happiness anddivine relations (a composite of closeness to God,prayer and history of an out-of-body experience)predicted scores on four well-being indicators, afteradjusting for racial effects. 80In the 1988 survey, sev- eral religious indicators were associated with greaterlife satisfaction or personal happiness. 81As in the other GSS studies, race did not appear to be a mean-ingful factor in this relationship. Studies using other data sources confirm these results. The most sophisticated of these, from thePRBA team, utilized data from four national surveysof older adults conducted from the early 1970sthrough the late 1980s. 33Findings revealed religious effects on well-being in two of the samples, evenafter adjusting for effects of a binary race variable. In summary, the weight of evidence for this cate- gory of studies is inconclusive with respect to raceand African-American subjects. Considerable evi-242 JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL. 97, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2005RELIGION, HEALTH AND MEDICINE dence exists supportive of religion 's salutary role in both preventing depressive symptoms and promot-ing overall psychological well-being, but there is lit-tle convincing evidence to suggest that this effect ismore or less salient among African Americans. Racial Differences Another group of studies examined religion-well- being associations separately by race, enabling com-parison of the direction and magnitude of effects inAfrican Americans and whites. A study of olderadults found that frequent religious attendance andbelief in life after death were associated with greaterlife satisfaction but only among whites. 21A study of younger and middle-aged adults found that churchattendance and strength of religious affiliation pre-dicted global happiness in both races but moresoamong African Americans. 22 Recent longitudinal psychiatric-epidemiologic studies have provided mixed evidence of racial dif-ferences, and the precise nature of these differencesis unclear. In the Duke Epidemiologic CatchmentArea (ECA) study, frequent religious attendance wasassociated with fewer depressive symptoms but onlyamong whites. 28Among African Americans, absence of a religious affiliation was strongly associatedwith more depressive symptoms. The Duke Estab-lished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of theElderly (EPESE) investigation found striking racialdifferences in the protective effect of frequentchurch attendance on depression in older adultsdiagnosed with cancer, 82such that stronger net effects were found among African Americans. Bycontrast, in the Y ale EPESE study, when baselinedepression was adjusted for, neither public nor pri-vate religiousness had any effect on depression ineither African-American or white Protestants. 83 However, a protective effect against cognitive dys-function due to at least weekly religious attendancewas observed after three years among whites. In summary, the weight of evidence for this cat- egory of studies was evenly mixed. Racial differ-ences in the association between religiousness andmental health are not uncommon, but no consisten-cy is observed in how these differences expressthemselves. Much depends, it seems, on the partic-ular outcomes under investigation and the age ofstudy subjects. African-American Study Samples Few large probability samples of African Ameri- cans exist which simultaneously include both reli-gious and mental-health measures. Data from smallcommunity or clinical samples of convenience mustbe relied upon, or the proportionately small subsetof African-American subjects in most national orregional health surveys. Accordingly, the most sophisticated research has been done by Brown andcolleagues and by investigators affiliated withPRBA or using data from studies based at the Uni-versity of Michigan. Several NIMH-funded studies of religion and depressive symptoms conducted by Brown and Garyand colleagues make a strong case for a protectiveeffect of religion among African Americans. In anurban study of noninstitutionalized men, a very cleartrend was apparent such that depression scores, asmeasured by the CES-D, declined with increasing reli-giousness. 84A community survey found an inverse effect of religiousness on depressive symptoms, espe-cially in men, and a stress-buffering effect of religionon depression among men with injuries. 85Absence of a stress-buffering effect in women was borne out inanother study. 30An urban study found protective effects for both religious attendance and presence of a denom-inational affiliation were observed in relation to CES-D scores. 31Most recently, the team found that the one- year prevalence of major depression, assessed by theDiagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), among subjectswithout a religious affiliation was 6.4%, the highest forany category of any exposure variable in the studyexcept for poor health status. 86For subjects with a reli- gious affiliation, the prevalence rate was only 2.8%. Other studies have demonstrated a salutary impact of religion on indicators of psychologicalwell-being, such as life satisfaction or happiness.Early research, based on convenience samples ofolder adults, points to a generally positive effect. Forexample, religiousness was found to be associatedwith life satisfaction and happiness, 87and overall well-being as assessed by the Philadelphia GeriatricCenter (PGC) scale was predicted by receipt ofchurch-based support. 88This latter study showed that religion may influence well-being in ways other thanas a result of the positive effects or satisfactionresulting from a perception that one is personallyreligious. Another study found impacts of self-ratedreligiousness and religious attendance on life satis-faction as assessed by the Diener scale. 89Religious- ness was in fact the strongest determinant of life sat-isfaction, and, among men, was the only predictor,explaining a substantial 27% of the variance in lifesatisfaction. Among women, it was a stronger deter-minant of well-being than even health. Studies from PRBA, or based on national surveys housed at the University of Michigan, provide addi-tional evidence that religion serves as a resource notjust for primary prevention of psychiatric illness inclinical and community populations but for promo-tion of well-being among the general population.Research by Krause, 25,90,91for example, has identified positive effects of religion on psychosocial resourcesJOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL. 97, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2005 243RELIGION, HEALTH AND MEDICINE used to cope with life stress. One study identified a strong effect of self-rated religiousness on self-esteem, which, in turn, strongly protected againstdepression. 25In another study, organized religious participation strongly predicted self-esteem, andmore informal and private religiousness was associat-ed with a sense of mastery or personal control, 90a key correlate of well-being. More recently, frequentchurch attendance was associated with greater lifesatisfaction specifically because of the informal sup-port received at church and by the strength providedby one 's faith to confront race-related problems. 91 Other studies of religion and well-being have been conducted using waves of data from the NSBA. Onestudy found that religious effects on life satisfactionwere not completely explained by the tendency ofboth well-being and some expressions of religious-ness to be higher in successively older age cohorts. 92 A subsequent study found that organized religiousparticipation was associated with life satisfactioneven after adjusting for effects of health and everyother religious and sociodemographic construct in thestudy. 32Especially remarkable was that this net effect of religious participation on well-being was about aslarge as, or larger than, the unadjusted effect of healthon life satisfaction, regardless of age cohort. Theseresults challenged the conventional belief that healthstatus and socioeconomic status are the primarydeterminants of general well-being in adults, 93regard- less of age or race. More recently, analyses revealedboth contemporaneous and longitudinal effects ofreligion on well-being, 94suggesting that the salutary impact of religion on well-being may extend forwardin time, similarly to its effects on physical longevity. In summary, the weight of evidence for this cate- gory of studies strongly supports a positive associa-tion between religiousness and mental health amongAfrican Americans. Findings from numerous large-scale national and regional studies consistently under-score religion 's salient role in preventing depression and promoting well-being in this population. WHAT THESE FINDINGS MEAN AND DO NOT MEAN To summarize, research over the past 20 years points to a significant impact of religious participa-tion on indicators of physical and mental health.Moreover, this association appears to vary but yet isnot explained away by race. This is expressedthrough: a) studies of physical morbidity in whichreligiousness exhibited protective effects even afteradjusting for effects of race; b) studies in whichracial differences were found in the presence andmagnitude of religious effects on health; c) studiesof African Americans, especially older adults, inwhich religiousness was a salient protective factoragainst morbidity, mortality and depressive symp- toms or a correlate or determinant of positive well-being. Whether or not religion is more salient a pre-ventive resource for mental health among AfricanAmericans than among whites is still an open ques-tion. But its importance as a generally protectivefactor for physical and psychological morbidityamong African Americans is strongly supported. These findings among African Americans are con- sistent with religion and health research among thegeneral population. Religious participation, broadlydefined, appears to exhibit moderate but statisticallysignificant protective effects on subsequent morbidityand mortality. Religion, then, is similar to other psy-chosocial and behavioral factors observed to mitigateor exacerbate the risk or odds of adverse health out-comes at the population level. 95Examples of psy- chosocial variables whose effects have been validatedepidemiologically among African Americans and/orthe general population include such familiar con-structs as stressful life events, the type-A behavioralpattern, coping, hardiness, locus of control, bereave-ment, John Henryism and social support. Despite the consistency of studies of religion and health with longstanding research in psychosocialepidemiology, the meaning and significance of find-ings, such as those summarized in this paper, haveoften been overstated and misinterpreted. This hasfueled a spate of \"skeptic \" rebuttals that even more dramatically misinterpret what this research means. 96 The typical critique of this research combines adhominem attacks on the motives of investigators,claims that it is impossible to study religion empiri-cally, assertions that every study conducted on thetopic is methodologically flawed, and denunciationsof this area of investigation as an encouragement ofthe use of prayer in lieu of medical treatment for ill-ness. Uninformed by the many decades of scholarlyresearch and writing on religion among social andbehavioral scientists and by the principles of epidemi-ologic research methods, these skeptical critiques areessentially straw men. But, in fairness, as noted, theymay be responses in part to the misinterpretation andoverstatement of findings by ill-informed supportersor religious partisans and by the popular media. Part of the confusion may lie in an apparent diffi- culty in distinguishing between epidemiologicresearch findings, such as those reviewed in thispaper, and results of medical research studies, suchas those obtained from clinical trials. Epidemiologicresearch seeks to identify characteristics of peopleor environments that are observed to offer protectionor elevate risk in terms of some subsequent adversehealth-related outcome. These relationships areexpressed as rates or ratios, or statistical associa-tions, and, as noted earlier, manifest on average and244 JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL. 97, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2005RELIGION, HEALTH AND MEDICINE across general populations of healthy people. Med- ical research, by contrast, typically seeks experi-mental methods to identify treatments that cure sickpeople or are otherwise therapeutic. Both types ofresearch are of course health-related and are indis-pensable for advancing our understanding of thedeterminants of health status across the natural his-tory of disease. But, strictly speaking, most religionand health research has not been explicitly con-cerned \"with medicine, with physicians, with patients, with illness, with the clinical setting, withmedical therapies or with healing \". 97These studies, instead, are \"population-based sociological and epi- demiologic studies of general communities investi-gated cross-sectionally or prospectively in order toidentify religious correlates of health and well-being. \" 97These investigations are not much differ- ent\u2014theoretically, conceptually or methodological- ly\u2014from the decades of population-based studies of religious determinants of such diverse outcomes aspolitical preference, sexual activity, criminal behav-ior, contraceptive usage, social support, fertility,marital satisfaction, environmental attitudes or otherissues explored by social scientists. 12 Another barrier to acceptance of research findings supportive of a salutary role for religious participationmay be a perception that such results cannot be ration-ally explained. This is analogous to the issue arising inclinical studies when there is empirical evidence ofefficacy yet no consensus on the mechanism of action.But, again, this objection is not valid. For one, it pre-supposes a reductionistic definition of religion assomething solely supernatural or outside the realm ofobservation. On the contrary, studies of religion andhealth have assessed observable behaviors, such as fre-quency of church attendance, or have measured beliefsor attitudes about the importance of religion or havesimply asked people to report their church affiliation.Religious assessment has a long history within thefields of psychology and sociology, and over a hundredvalidated measures exist for assessment of religiousbehaviors, beliefs, attitudes, identities, emotions, val-ues, experiences and so on. 98Moreover, while some religions may endorse supernatural beliefs, religion ingeneral represents a domain of life that operatesthrough social institutions that provide resources andservices to fellow human beings. This is clearly evidentamong African Americans, for whom the historic blackchurch has been not just a principal actor in the strug-gle for survival, dignity and justice, but a leading playerin primary care delivery, community mental health,health promotion and disease prevention, and healthpolicy, as elaborated by one of the present authors 20years ago in JNMA . 99 The misinterpretation of epidemiologic and socio- logical findings on religion is so pervasive that atleast a couple of sophisticated reviews have been written expressly to address this problem.6,100Com- mon misinterpretations of the findings summarized inthe present review include: \"Religious involvement promotes healing, \" \"Religious people don 't get sick, \" and \"Religion is the most important factor in health \". 100As has been pointed out, these findings suggest nothing of the sort, but rather that some formsof religious participation may serve to protect somepeople against some types of morbidity and that, onaverage, religious participation seems to be associat-ed with lower risk or odds of subsequent morbidityand premature mortality. Religion simply deserves aplace at the table, so to speak, among the numerousenvironmental and host characteristics that exhibitmeasurable impacts on population-wide rates ofrespective diseases in particular groups of people. 100 An especially perplexing and yet common misin- terpretation of this research is, \"Prayer heals. \" Obvi- ously, epidemiologic investigations of the healthimpact of religious participation and hypotheticalexperiments on faith healing do not even involvestudy of the same stage of or direction along the natu-ral history of disease. To investigate a purported heal-ing power of prayer as some researchers actually havedone 101would require a sample of sick people, an experimental therapeutic protocol involving prayingand an effort to monitor whether study subjects movein a salutogenic direction \u2014that is, from a clinical sta- tus of ill to a status of well. By contrast, the epidemio-logic studies reviewed in this paper involve samplesof healthy people who are observed in order to deter-mine whether certain characteristics (e.g., religious-ness) serve to prevent subsequent movement in apathogenic direction, across the clinical threshold,from wellness to illness. No therapy is being studiednor is there anyone or anything to heal, and thus noth-ing concerning a prayer-healing connection couldpossibly be inferred from these studies 'findings. Y et, such an inference is often made from religion andhealth research by nonscientists and even some clini-cians, both skeptics and religious believers, causing aconsiderable muddying of the waters. 102 The most concise and accurate summary of exist- ing research findings reviewed in the present paper issimply this: religious participation appears to be apotentially powerful, salutary resource in the lives ofmany people, notably African Americans. No more,no less. This finding is hardly controversial. It makessense precisely because religious participation mayserve to provide what Antonovsky called a \"sense of coherence \" 103and, thus, help individuals to cope with the stresses inherent in daily life and, ultimately, tostrengthen the host resistance of populations. 7,100 How can religion serve to strengthen host resist- ance and prevent morbidity among African Ameri-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL. 97, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2005 245RELIGION, HEALTH AND MEDICINE cans? Several potential mediating factors have been proposed, most of which have been investigated inthe context of religion-and-health research. Takentogether, they demonstrate that findings linkingmeasures of religion and indicators of health amongAfrican Americans fit squarely within mainstreamtheories of biobehavioral and psychosocial factors inpreventive medicine and epidemiology. First, strong commitment to a system of religious beliefs may lead to avoidance of destructive habits andadoption of healthy behaviors known to reduce the riskof morbidity among African Americans. 104Second, fre- quent church involvement may strengthen bonds to themost significant network of social support in theAfrican-American community, a key resource for healthpromotion and disease prevention. 105Third, the worship experience in African-American churches may producepositive affects that could potentially influence suscepti-bility to or course of illness or even be therapeutic, 106 such as through psychoneuroimmunologic or neuroen-docrine pathways. Fourth, certain healthy beliefs whichmotivate preventive healthcare practices may be conso-nant with or supported by the beliefs or worldviews pro-moted by African-American churches. 107Finally, the positive expectations of persons of faith, such as thosepromoted by readings of scripture, by sermons or bypastoral counseling encounters, may be an especiallypotent resource for preventing psychological distress inAfrican Americans. 108Evidence supportive of these potential mediating factors is discussed in greater depthin the recent book, God, Faith, and Health . 1 Certainly, these hypothesized linkages connect- ing religion and health among African Americans,and among all people, would be worth exploring fur-ther. Such research is especially consistent withincreasing calls to investigate the relationshipbetween psyche and soma. This exciting intellectualfrontier for physicians and scientists was heraldeddecades ago by medical pioneers, from Sir WilliamOsler 109writing in the British Medical Journal to Dr. Paul Dudley White110here in the pages of JNMA , yet only recently has it received the attention it deserves.Investigating the possible interconnections amongbody, mind and spirit \u2014and community \u2014may pro- duce promising leads in the challenge to improve thehealth of African Americans. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE, MEDICAL EDUCATIONAND PUBLIC HEALTH The presence of this large body of empirical find- ings on religious determinants of health has alreadysignificantly impacted medicine and the health pro-fessions. While most existing findings are not basedon clinical studies, as noted earlier, the implicationsthat one 's health status may be influenced to someextent by aspects of one 's religious life have not been lost on many physicians, especially in the aca-demic world. Innovations have been wide-ranging,occurring in clinical assessment, medical and healthprofessions education, and public health policy.These changes reflect a growing awareness of thesalience of religion as a motivating force in people 's lives\u2014one that, according to epidemiologic studies, seems to exert a mostly salutary effect on indicatorsof physical and mental health. The authoritative Handbook of Religion and Health 2outlines opportunities for physicians and other health professionals to stay attuned to orrespond to religious needs of their patients: taking areligious history, supporting or encouraging reli-gious beliefs, ensuring access to religious resources,respecting visits by clergy, viewing hospital chap-lains as part of the healthcare team, being ready tostep in when clergy are unavailable and usingadvanced spiritual interventions (e.g., prayer) cau-tiously. The first of these activities may be the mostdirectly applicable to most physicians. Accordingly,greater attention is beginning to be paid to what isknown as spiritual assessment, 111particularly for African-American patients, as noted recently inJNMA . 112The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, for example, under itsbehavioral healthcare standards, now specifiesguidelines related to spiritual assessment. 113 This is a potentially challenging issue for clini- cians. Physicians are limited in the time available tothem in the typical clinical encounter, and indica-tions that yet another overlooked factor ought to beprobed for and measured may not necessarily bewelcomed, no matter how much variance such a fac-tor might explain in statistical models. Medical his-tory-taking is a painstaking process, and, naturally,the lengthy scales and indices used in large commu-nity studies cannot be used given the constraints ofthe typical primary care office visit and the urgencyto make a sound diagnosis. Fortunately, efforts havebeen made to develop and validate brief, useful andculturally sensitive inventories for such settings, anda variety of simplified instruments are available forboth primary care physicians and psychiatrists. 114,115 Since the first NIH Conference on Spiritual Assess-ment in Health Care Settings, held in 1995, medicaleducators have begun to integrate this material intotheir curricula. Notwithstanding previous warnings about the overinterpretation of findings related to religion-health associations, it is important to recognize thepotential importance of religious and spiritual beliefswith regard to patients 'well-being and coping efforts. Religious and spiritual beliefs and practices (e.g.,prayer, rituals, religious support) are important246 JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL. 97, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2005RELIGION, HEALTH AND MEDICINE resources and sources of comfort to many individuals and may be an essential component of their overallcoping strategy for dealing with the physical and psy-chological effects of illness and the treatment experi-ence. In fact, some patients report a desire to engagein prayer with their physicians but indicate that theyare often reluctant or embarrassed to do so. 2While undoubtedly important in specific circumstances andwith particular patients and physicians, the use ofprayer and other religious coping strategies in clinicalencounters should be guided by several caveats. First, because the physician-patient relationship is characterized by significant differences in power,knowledge and authority, there is always the possi-bility that physician attempts to incorporate religioninto the therapeutic relationship will be miscon-strued as coercive. 116In the interest of preserving patient autonomy and self-determination, the patientshould be the one who requests prayer and other reli-gious activities. The use of religious or spiritual his-tories of the type mentioned previously can beemployed as a preliminary procedure that informsphysicians as to the relevance of these concerns forindividual patients, as well as signals to the patientof the physician 's willingness to engage in discus- sions of these topics. Exploration of religious topicsshould proceed using a patient-centered approachand, to the extent possible, nondirective techniques. Second, the physician should also feel comfort- able in engaging in these activities \u2014both with respect to the type of activities and level of involve-ment required. Physicians who do not share thepatient 's religious tradition and beliefs may need to simply demonstrate acknowledgment of and respectfor clients 'religious orientations. When patients and physicians have similar religious orientations andbeliefs, they may be able to engage questions of reli-gion and health in ways that affirm their own under-standings and preferences, while at the same timeupholding the highest standards of ethical care.However, even patients and physicians who ostensi-bly share the same faith tradition (e.g., Christianity)may have very different preferences for religiousinterventions and views about the functional aspectsof religion. 117For example, they may differ with respect to the types of religious coping preferred orattitudes about the appropriate uses of prayer underthese circumstances. Further, differences concern-ing the use of religion in healthcare are likely inten-sified in situations in which the patient and physi-cian are of different religious or faith backgrounds. Third, for precisely these reasons, physicians must demonstrate tolerance and respect for patient beliefsas well as competence in discussing religion andusing religious methods of varying levels of sophisti-cation and depth. Several physicians have advocateduse of advanced religious interventions, such as prayer and reading of religious scriptures in health-care settings. 116,118For reasons stated earlier, this should only be done with care and in a manner thatrespects patients 'wishes and autonomy. Physicians who choose to engage in these discussions and inter-actions with patients and their families should recog-nize the outstanding resource that they have availablein hospital chaplains or other clergy who make hospi-tal rounds. Hospital chaplains are specifically trainedto handle the issues and concerns that arise in thesesituations and provide a perspective that emphasizesthe health and well-being of the whole person. Fur-ther, by virtue of their training and experience, hospi-tal chaplains have a wider exposure to and apprecia-tion of a range of faith traditions and religions. This isparticularly important, as the U.S. population is reli-giously pluralistic and diverse. Physicians whochoose to incorporate religious content into theirpractice should be responsive to the significant reli-gious and cultural subgroups that may reside in theircommunities (e.g., Muslim, Hindu, Hmong). Unfor-tunately, the predominant focus of the research litera-ture on white mainline Protestant denominations haslimited our understanding of the relation between reli-gion and health for different and diverse religious andfaith groups, such as exist among African Americans. Fourth, frequently, patients may feel that their ill- ness has been caused by a lack of faith on their partor is due to other religious reasons (e.g., moral fail-ing, sin). Physicians must be especially careful toavoid contributing to these beliefs. Appropriatereferral to a hospital chaplain or the patient 's own clergy may be needed to address these special con-cerns. However, it should be noted that in someinstances, patients 'beliefs regarding individual blame may be consistent with their religious orienta-tion. For the patient, accepting responsibility in suchsituations may be seen as appropriate and necessaryfor spiritual reconciliation. Accordingly, physiciansmust be very careful not to \"prescribe \" prayer or other religious practices specifically as a means toeffect a cure for disease without an explicit indica-tion from the patient that he or she is comfortablediscussing these issues with their physician. Profes-sional codes of ethical conduct and practice, whileendorsing the clinical value of religious orientations,explicitly prohibit actions on the part of the profes-sional that seek to impose particular views (eitherreligious and antireligious) on clients or that dis-courage and disparage clients 'religious beliefs and values behavior. 119As indicated above, the best advice is when in doubt, consult a healthcare chap-lain or appropriate member of the clergy. Several clinicians 2,120have written expertly about the issues involved in incorporating religion in treat-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL. 97, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2005 247RELIGION, HEALTH AND MEDICINE ment. While beyond the scope of the present article, more extensive discussions are needed concerningthe appropriate roles of religion in the clinicalencounter and which include the perspectives ofpatients, clergy, health professionals and bioethi-cists. 11,120This past decade has also witnessed a growing receptivity to broaching larger issues relat-ed to spirituality and personal faith in undergraduateand graduate medical curricula. In 1992, only threeU.S. medical schools had coursework or instructionof any type related to summarizing or exploring therole of religion in health and illness and in the clini-cal setting. 121,122Two thirds of medical schools now have such coursework, including especially innova-tive programs at Howard University College ofMedicine and Morehouse School of Medicine, andthese developments are formally recognized andsupported by the Association of American MedicalColleges. 123Additionally, training curricula have been developed for residents in psychiatry and pri-mary care, which are being used as guidelines inmany residency programs throughout the country. 124 Several years ago, the present authors outlined a model of the contributions of religion to publichealth. 12It was noted that one of the principal ways that church involvement can impact on the healthand well-being of communities is through increasingaccess to religious institutions that participate in oroffer health programs or interventions, such asscreening, referrals and free clinics. In the publichealth sector, efforts to make use of churches andreligious institutions for community health interven-tions actually predate most of the wider publicitygiven research findings related to religion andhealth. Westberg 's 125well known church-based Wholistic Health Centers and the pioneering Healthand Human Services Project of the General BaptistState Convention of North Carolina 126date back at least 25 years. The latter program was especiallyimportant as it demonstrated that medical profes-sionals, academic public health scientists and histor-ically African-American churches could successful-ly collaborate to improve the health status ofunderserved African Americans and reduce the riskand complications of serious diseases, such ashypertension and diabetes. Over the past fewdecades, numerous public health and communitymedicine programs have been implemented in col-laboration with African-American churches anddenominations, 99and African-American pastors have proven especially valuable allies for interven-tions at all three of the levels of prevention. 127 Dr. Caswell A. Evans, Jr., a former president of the American Public Health Association, has called for anincrease in partnerships and coalitions between thehealth and faith communities as a vital means to \"pro-mote the physical, emotional, mental, social, educa- tional, economic, environmental and spiritual well-being of all communities \". 128For African Americans, this would be a welcome development. Church com-munities and congregations are primary sources offormal and informal support, both emotional and tan-gible, for African Americans, 3especially older black adults.129These, in turn, may be powerful resources for promoting health and preventing disease, and thusreducing the unfortunate racial disparities in access tomedical care, in physician utilization, in morbidityand mortality and in overall health status that still per-sist in the United States. 130 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Work on this paper was supported by the Nation- al Institute on Aging under NIH Research Grant No.R01 AG18782 (Linda M.
