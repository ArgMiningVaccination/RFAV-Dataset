Peter is a long-time researcher on the development of vaccines for HIV. This researcher coming from Copenhagen is also often conduct research cooperation with PSSP-LPPM IPB, including research cooperation on vaccine papiloma virus. In a half-day seminar held by PSSP IPB, researchers from IPB Dr.drh. Diah Iskandriati also presented her study entitled Nonhuman Primate Model for Infectious Disease Study- Harnessing Knowledge from Nature for Goodness of Mankind. According to Dr. Diah, the progress and development of the human medicine world was obtained through research using animals. Although alternative methods of replacing animals have been found, there are several studies and tests that still require the presence of animals. \"Based on the 2016 data, on the number of animals used in the countries, the animal users in the study are still dominated by USA (20 million), China (16 million), Europe and Japan respectively 11 million. Some of the medical breakthroughs gained by using animals such as the discovery of insulin, anti-depressant, anesthesia to stem cells,\" he said. Primate animals are one of the laboratory animals that have close kinship with humans so that they have similarities in anatomy, physiology, immune system even a similar learning system. For example, only female human and female primates who ovulate, menstruate and menopause, so primate animals become good model animals for female reproduction. Research milestones using primate animals began in 1990 with the discovery of a blood component followed by other findings such as anti-HIV drugs, model animals for Parkinson's and the latest is cloning on monkeys. Some findings that use primate animals also received the Nobel Prize such as the invention of yellow fever vaccine (1951) and polio vaccine (1954). Today, there are seven primate species widely used in biomedical research originating from Asia (long-tailed macaque, pig-tailed macaque and rhesus macaque), Africa green monkey) and South/Central America (common marmoset and squirrel monkey). \"The aspects of animal welfare should also be considered in the use of primates as animal models and testing,\" he explained. To maintain the preservation of this animal, since 1994 the Decree of the Minister of Forestry (No. 26/kpts/1994) declared that long-tailed monkeys for research and export must be obtained from captive breeding research. Besides preventing the exploitation of primate animals from their natural habitat, the utilization of captive breeding also maintains the quality of animal health to avoid disruption of research results. Dr.drh. Huda Darusman, Head of PSSP IPB said, since 1992, PSSP has pioneered primate specific pathogen free (SPF) breeding of some pathogen agents that could be a confounding factor in biomedical research and protecting personnel against zoonotic agents. \"Primate animals are one of the many laboratory animals that make outstanding contributions to the development of the health world,\" he explained.
