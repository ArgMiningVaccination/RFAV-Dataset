As the owner of Wine Tours of Sedona, and a resident to Sedona for over a decade, I have known Amalia for many years. In that time, I have had the privilege to experience her work on a multitude of mediums. Whether she has been providing me an iridology reading or naturopathic guidance, she has always been keenly aware of my needs, and thus her efforts and knowledge always provide me with the best diagnosis and guidance of what I should do to remedy a given situation. In addition, she has helped provide me with spiritual guidance and counseling when myself and a former romantic partner were going through some rough patches. In times when my body and muscles have been sore, I have received incredible massage therapy that got rid of the knots, and made me feel fresh and alive. In social settings, she had led Shakti Dances which assisted me in stepping outside my proverbial box, and grow as a human being. Regardless of the reason I come to see Amalia, I always know with 100% certainty that I am going to be better than I was when got there. I am grateful to be able to seek her various therapeutic remedies as needed, and feel honored to be able to refer her to you my valued clients. ~Jim Reich SESSIONS OFFERED: BODYWORK/MASSAGE: Intuitive Body work and energy healing: Relax, unwind and surrender into your body's wisdom.

In that capacity, I also got to view several of thew films that were part of the festival. To say that each one had a profound impact on my life would be a gross understatement. For every film I viewed, there was a message. For me, after viewing nearly a half dozen films; I felt I wanted to do more good in the world. Whether it be bring more awareness to children who were being forced into the sex trade, eating a more healthy diet by ensuring that more of the foods I eat are plant based, or just thinking more compassionately about the world be live in, and how I may as an individual bring that compassion to fruition by doing good things for others and spreading more awareness to the subjects of the movies I was privileged to see. After participating in Illuminate 2015 in a very limited capacity, I am excited to be a much more prevalent partner with Danette and her team to help spread the word and vision of the talented producers of the films for this years festival. ~Jim Reich About ILLUMINATE ILLUMINATE is the world's premier film festival for conscious cinema.

I first experienced her healing work early into our friendship when my girlfriend at the time and I choose to see her for some of her energetic sessions. Originally going to see her more for my girlfriend, with little expectations, to say that she \"wowed\" me would be a gross understatement. It was amazing how spot on her intuitive nature was. She brought up things that surprised me on every level. Since then I started to see her on a weekly basis just so I could gain more clarity in my life. With every session I experienced, I felt like I gained a deeper understanding of myself and how I wish to show up in the world. In short, she is magnificent at what she does and I would recommend her to all my customers for those seeking any type of energy healing or work. She is the real deal, and furthermore she's funny, witty, and makes the whole experience very relaxed. ~Jim Reich Services - Individual, couple, family and group sessions - Healing journeys - Business alignment and expansion sessions - Package programs for individuals to conscious corporations All sessions can be done in person or remotely.
