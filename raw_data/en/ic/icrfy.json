Some [at-home teeth cleaning remedies in Pineville, NC](https://radiantsmilesfamilydentistry.com/) can improve the appearance of your smile, especially if you brush and floss and still feel your teeth are not clean as they should be. Undisputedly, you must clean your teeth regularly-but why is this so? Each time you eat food or drink something, plaque naturally begins to develop, and if you don't remove the plaque quickly, it can hasten bacteria growth that leads to tooth decay or gum diseases. Luckily, your [Pineville dentist, Dr. Raynald L. Desameau, DMD](https://radiantsmilesfamilydentistry.com/meet-the-team/), has seven natural at-home remedies for cleaning your teeth. However, you must be careful and gentle with teeth cleaning home remedies to avoid eroding your enamel and damaging your teeth. Constant use of these at-home remedies could put you at risk for tooth sensitivity and cavities. This is why visiting our [dental office in Pineville, NC](https://radiantsmilesfamilydentistry.com/teeth-cleaning/), is essential to learn how to clean your teeth properly. Read on to learn the seven best at-home teeth cleaning remedies and how to use them safely. Brushing Your Teeth Regularly Clean teeth result from brushing regularly and using the correct brushing technique. Brushing your teeth after eating and drinking to prevent stains and plaque buildup is advised. However, ensure you don't brush your teeth immediately after consuming acidic foods and drinks, as this can lead to tooth erosion. Brush your teeth twice daily for at least 2-3 minutes and ensure you reach the molars, cracks, and crevices. Brush the inside, outside, and chewing surfaces of your teeth while moving your brush gently to protect your gums. In addition, using an electric toothbrush is another way to clean your teeth properly. Use Lemon, Orange, or Banana Peels It is believed that rubbing lemon, orange, tangerine, or banana peels on your teeth will make them cleaner and whiter. In addition, the d-limonene compound and citric acid in some citrus fruit peels can be good teeth-cleaning home remedies. To use this technique, gently rub the fruit peel on your teeth for about 2 minutes and thoroughly rinse your mouth afterward. Be careful when using fruit peels because of their acidic content. The acid can erode your enamel. A [2017 study](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/824/1/012071/pdf) testing the potency of citric acid extracted from different types of citrus fruit indicated that tangerine peel extract was most efficient at removing stains from people's teeth. Although, when using any of these peel extracts, if you notice that your teeth are getting more sensitive, stop use immediately. Use Baking Soda and Hydrogen Peroxide Homemade toothpaste made from baking soda and hydrogen peroxide removes stains, plaque, and bacteria buildup. Research on toothpaste made with baking soda indicates that it is safe and very effective for removing stains and whitening teeth and can be used daily. Mix one tablespoon of baking soda with two tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide to make your toothpaste. Stir until it becomes pastelike. You can then brush with this paste for about 2-3 minutes and your mouth will be thoroughly cleaned afterward. Moreover, you can use the same mixture proportion to make a mouthwash or mix baking soda with water to create a natural tooth-cleaning mouthwash. Both items are easy to find at the grocery store or online. Use Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar in small quantities can be used to whiten teeth. However, it should be noted that apple cider vinegar can cause damage to the enamel and surface structure of your teeth. Hence, it's crucial that you use it with caution, in small quantities, and only for a short period. To use this remedy for teeth cleaning, mix two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar with six ounces of water to make a mouthwash. Swish the solution in your mouth for 30 seconds before rinsing with water and brushing your teeth. Use Coconut Oil Pulling Coconut oil pulling is another natural tooth cleaning home remedy in Pineville, NC, that removes plaque and bacteria from the mouth and also helps with [teeth whitening](https://radiantsmilesfamilydentistry.com/teeth-whitening/). In addition, [a 2015 study](https://dx.doi.org/10.4103%2F0300-1652.153406) noted that oil pulling using sunflower and sesame oil could reduce gingivitis caused by plaque growth. To use this remedy, swish one to two teaspoons of liquid coconut oil in your mouth for 10 to 30 minutes. Be careful not to allow the oil to touch the back of your throat, and also do not swallow, as the oil will contain toxins and bacteria from your mouth. Afterward, spit the oil into the toilet or a waste basket (coconut oil can clog drains in your home). Next, rinse your mouth with water and drink a full glass before brushing your teeth. Finally, when shopping for coconut oil, ensure you select high-quality, organic oil that does not contain harmful ingredients. Use Activated Charcoal Charcoal is believed to remove stains and pigment from your teeth because it is absorbent. Hence, you can use activated charcoal to remove stains from your teeth and eliminate bacteria and toxins in your mouth. To use this remedy, open a capsule of activated charcoal and place the contents on your toothbrush. Then, brush your teeth using small, gentle circles for at least two minutes. But be careful in the gum area, as activated charcoal can be abrasive. Finally, spit it out. Should your teeth become sensitive teeth or if you want to reduce the abrasiveness of the charcoal, you can rub the charcoal on your teeth and leave it on for two minutes. You can also make mouthwash from activated charcoal. Mix the activated charcoal with a small amount of water and swish the solution for two minutes before spitting it out\u2014then rinse your mouth thoroughly with water. Eat Fruits and Vegetables with Higher Water Concentration Eating raw fruits and veggies with high water concentration can help keep your teeth healthy. The water content in fruits is believed to help eliminate plaque and bacteria from your teeth and gums. In addition, eating crunchy fruits and vegetables after a meal can increase saliva production, and this helps to remove food particles stuck in your teeth and wash away any harmful acids. Consuming a diet high in fruits and vegetables is highly recommended for oral health and overall health; however, there is no scientifically proven evidence that this helps with teeth cleaning. However, fruits and vegetables provide the necessary vitamins for your oral health, and eating these healthy foods daily won't harm you. However, [ a survey in 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573376/) indicated that toothpaste containing papain (an enzyme found in pawpaw) and bromelain (an enzyme present in pineapple) can help remove stains from people's teeth.
