April's edition is dedicated to National Minority Health Month. In 2002, National Minority Health Month received support from the U.S. Congress with a concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 388) to promote educational efforts on the health problems currently facing racial and ethnic minorities and other underrepresented populations. This movement originated in 1915 with Booker T. Washington (1856-1915), the founder of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, who understood the connection between poverty, poor health, and high mortality rates of Blacks/African Americans during the early 20th century. His efforts brought awareness to health inequities and in collaboration with the U.S. Public Health Service, to what is now known as National Minority Health Disparities Month. It is well known that health disparities continue to impact racial, ethnic, and other diverse underserved communities in the U.S., and there is increased interest in addressing health disparities to improve health care outcomes. National Arab American Heritage Month and National Autism Acceptance Month are also celebrated in April. During this month, let's acknowledge, reflect and confront the inequities of the past, reveal the inequalities of the present and act for change aiming toward an equitable and respective environment for those we serve and those who serve with us. We need to be centered to bring change, be innovative and be prepared to hear and accept new solutions for health transformation to eliminate health inequities. With respect, Leslie Garcia, M.P.A. Assistant Dean for Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion OHSU School of Medicine April Observances National Minority Health Month This year's theme is \"Give Your Community a Boost!\" COVID-19 vaccination, including a booster, is one of the strongest tools we have to end the COVID-19 pandemic that has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic communities.

April 23 | Spanish and English Language Day This United Nations Spanish Language Day was moved from October 12 (Dia de la Hispanidad) to April 23 to mark the anniversary of the deaths of the Spanish literary Miguel de Cervantes and of English playwright William Shakespeare. Today, in the U.S. (and Oregon) English is the most prominent spoken language with more than 254 million English speakers. Spanish is undoubtedly second with more than 43 million speakers.

In 1970, the Autism Society launched a nationwide effort to promote autism awareness and assure that all who experience autism are able to achieve the highest quality of life possible. The first annual National Autistic Children's week in 1972 evolved into Autism Acceptance Month (AAM). Today in the U.S., autism prevalence has risen from 1 in 125 children in 2010 to 1 in 54 in 2020 galvanizing the AAM to further educate the public about autism signs, characteristics, and opportunities to build inclusive experiences.

National Arab American Heritage Month Arab Americans have ancestry from northern Africa through western Asia. Though sharing some common cultural and linguistic heritage they are ethnically, politically, religiously and individually diverse. The 22 Arab nations include Algeria, Bahrain, the Comoro Islands, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Yemen. In the U.S., many people conflate \"Arab\" and \"Middle Eastern,\" but linguistically and geographically that these terms are not fully interchangeable, according to the Arab American National Museum (AANM). The Middle East includes non-Arabic nations such as Iran, Israel, and Turkey. Similarly, not all Arabic nations are located in what is considered the Middle East \u2014 including Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco. According to the 2017 Census, approximately 31,974 Arab Americans reside in 28 of Oregon's 36 counties. Arab Americans health status has been historically understudied and their health needs and risks have been poorly documented.
