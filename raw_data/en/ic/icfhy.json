This course is truly thoroughly thought out. It is a bit hard because we must assimilate more new concepts (with all the scientific and lab assessments), but it's a good challenge, and I feel it will prepare us for this profession, what we can expect to encounter. It also gives us in -depth knowledge to gain respect and authority as an aromatherapist, in case we must explain or educate our future clients or consumers about our products. It also makes us investigate more the composition or constituents of essential oils and their effects, that are important to know, for health and safety reasons.\" Maria S.
