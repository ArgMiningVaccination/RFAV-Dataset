Naturopathic physicians are trained to diagnose, treat and manage acute and chronic conditions. Rather than focusing on a collection of individual symptoms a naturopath looks at a person as a whole - body, mind and spirit. Naturopaths seek to identify and treat the root cause of any symptoms. They believe in the principle 'First do no harm', which means they will select the most gentle and non- invasive treatment possible to restore the body to balance. A naturopath also aims to educate the patient - empowering them to take responsibility for their own health, so that they may prevent future disease and enjoy optimal vitality. Naturopathy is a blend of many different disciplines that were passed down through the ages. It has its roots in Eastern medicine and was added to over the ages with herbal lore and nature cure methods. Knowledge of naturopathic philosophy will help you understand your client's symptoms and to be able to unravel how they arrived at them. Not only does this help alleviate the symptoms but also puts the client back in control of their health. This is the role of the naturopath as 'Docere' or teacher. This course is written in line with the National Occupational Standards (NOS) for the practice of NaturopathyIntroduction Page 5Page 61. Certification The course is accredited by the Society of Naturopaths (SoN). We offer several certificate points from the Naturopathy course, the highest level of graduation gains registration with the SoN. 2.

The Healing Power of Nature Naturopaths believe that nature has an innate ability to heal. 2. Identify and Treat the Causes Treating symptoms does not stop those symptoms reappearing. Naturopaths seek to find the underlying cause, which may be physical or emotional. 3. First Do No Harm A Naturopath will always choose the most natural, least invasive and least toxic treatment, to avoid creating other imbalances or side effects. 4. Doctor as Teacher Part of the Naturopath's role is in educating the patient to take responsibility for their own healing and maintenance of health. 5. Treat the Whole Person The body is seen as an integrated whole - all aspects of a person are taken into account and the treatment plan encompasses mind, body and spirit. 6. Prevention Avoidance of toxins and changes to diet and lifestyle are recommended to prevent the onset of future disease.The six fundamental principles of naturopathic medicine Page 11Page 12This course may be used in a verity of ways: for personal interest, or as a foundation course (to learn about several types of medicine), or as the start of your naturopathic training, or if you are already a therapist as post graduate training to extend your practice to become a naturopath, or for gaining registration with other accrediting organisations. Naturopaths are trained in many natural health disciplines to become experts in holistic healthcare enabling them to assist their clients from many different perspectives selecting the optimum natural healthcare treatment plan. This course provides an in depth study of Eastern medicine and Naturopathy. It is the only programme, to our knowledge, that combines the four main Eastern medicines and Naturopathy disciplines in one programme. The one year course is written as a continual course and can be taken as a whole or you can cherry pick the individual units. Naturopathy Course Overview Units: 1-10Study Hours: 800-900Time: Estimated 12 months (timing up to you)Enrolment period: 2 Years (with option to extend)Books: Purchased separatelyCertification: Certificate in Naturopathic Medicine (Nat.Dip)Study Options: E-learning (online) or Correspondence (paper) \"Having trained in various disciplines over the years of being a practitioner and seeing how they all enhanced my understanding of health and disease I decided to write a course that I would have loved to have done 25 years ago, when I was first starting out on my alternative medical training. The course starts with Eastern medicine and provides a detailed study of Ayurveda, Chinese five elements, Tibetan Medicine and Unani (Greek/Persian) medicine. Once you have this grounding you then study homeopathic philosophy which underpins naturopathic philosophy. By the time you reach the naturopathic module you will find that the philosophy is second nature to you. The rest of the course builds on this foundation and covers iridology, hydrotherapy, an introduction to Homotoxicology, psychology and psychosocial skills and finishes with a detailed module about dentistry and health. I have added in this last module because I believe it is of the utmost importance for practitioners to understand the effects of dentistry and oral health upon the overall health of the body\". Mary Sharma, Course AuthorNaturopathy course Page 13Unit 4: Homeopathy The history of homeopathy, the underlying philosophy, and the homeopathic view of disease. You will then learn some practical homeopathy that you can use in your clinic. It is important, as a naturopath, to have an understanding of the most useful homeopathic remedies that your clients will have easy access to and quite possibly be already using at home. Unit 5: Naturopathy The art of modern naturopathy is to be able to blend advances in modern medicine with the ancient traditions. Science is beginning to prove what the ancient Eastern medical traditions have been teaching for centuries. This unit aims to bring the science of Western medicine and the ancient Eastern knowledge together in the hope that practitioners can truly understand how to help their patients. Unit 6: Homotoxicology This is a blend of naturopathy, homeopathy and modern medicine. The basis of Homotoxicology is the function of the extra cellular matrix, which works in the same way as the humours of Eastern medicine; as a regulatory mechanism. The science of Homotoxicology builds on the old understanding of the humoral theory and looks to relate it modern scientific research.Unit 1: Ayurveda Medicine Ayurveda, the science of life, is the mother of all medical systems, and as such will enhance your understanding of any medical discipline and of how we interact with our universe. A study of Ayurveda provides a firm foundation to build your knowledge of health and disease upon. With this foundation you will understand how to support your clients in their return to health. Unit 2: Chinese Medicine The Chinese Law of the Five Elements provides a wonderful view of observing the universe and making sense of our surroundings. An understanding of how these five elements affect us on every level can only enhance the practice of naturopathy, nutrition and other therapies. Unit 3: Tibetan and Unani Just as Ayurvedic medicine is influenced by Hinduism and Chinese medicine is influenced by Taoism, so Tibetan medicine is influenced by Buddhism. The gentle Buddhist approach to life shines through in this amazingly powerful branch of ancient medicine. Unani Medicine developed out of ancient Greek medicine. In this unit you will learn about the similarities between other medical disciplines and Greek medicine.Unit 7: Psychosocial This unit looks at the role of psychology and psychoanalysis on health. All disease stems from the mind; Eastern medicine teaches us that the mind and body directly affect and influence one another. New research is proving how important the mind is in maintaining health. Unit 8: Iridology Iridology is a technique in which the patterns, colours and other characteristics of the iris can be examined to determine information about a patient's health. Practitioners match their observations to iris charts, which divide the iris into zones that correspond to specific parts of the human body. Unit 9: Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy is all about water; water is a particularly unique substance and is used in all of its forms in hydrotherapy practice - as steam baths, hot and cold applications and as ice packs. You will look at the various techniques and the science behind Hydrotherapy and how to apply it . Unit 10: Dentistry The importance of dental health and how modern dental techniques can impact upon the overall health of the body. This Unit has been included because the effects of dentistry are often overlooked, ignored or worse still, attributed to something else.Course overview Page 14Page 15Unit 1: Ayurveda Medicine Ayurveda is an ancient system of healing that has its roots in the depths of Indian antiquity. It is the oldest medical system on the planet and most other medical traditions have their roots in Ayurveda. In this unit you will learn about the history and philosophy of Ayurvedic medicine (Sankya philosophy, the three Gunas, the Five Great Elements of Panchamahabhuta), the Tri Dosha theory (Vata, Pitta and Kapha), Ayurvedic anatomy and physiology, tongue diagnosis, Ayurvedic diet and nutrition, Ayurvedic Samprapti (the course of disease) and balancing techniques. Interest in Ayurvedic medicine has substantially increased in the last 20 years. In this course you will learn how you can incorporate Ayurvedic principles into your current practice, regardless of your discipline. The course will teach you how to understand your clients both from an emotional and physical perspective; have the tools to provide your clients with a diet and lifestyle to correct and balance their symptoms, and also provide you with an in-depth understanding of the disease process. Units: 1 Study Hours: 40 - 60Time: Estimated 2 months (timing up to you)Enrolment period: 4 months (with option to extend)Books: Purchased separatelyCertification: in Ayurvedic MedicineStudy Options: E-learning (online) or Correspondence (paper)Unit 2: Chinese Medicine Chinese medicine is much better known than Ayurvedic medicine. The Chinese have done an excellent job of introducing Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to the west. The Chinese Law of the Five Elements provides a wonderful view of observing the universe and making sense of our surroundings. An understanding of how these five elements affect us on every level can only enhance naturopathic and nutritional practice. This module will give you a unique approach to understanding human nature that will help in clinical practice. You will learn how to relate the five elements to health, disease, diet and lifestyle which will enhance your understanding of the universal rhythms and also help you make sense of your client's psychology and physical ailments. The module enhances your understanding of Eastern energetic nutrition and how to apply Eastern medical wisdom in practice. Units: 1 Study Hours: 40 - 60Time: Estimated 2 months (timing up to you)Enrolment period: 4 months (with option to extend)Books: Purchased separatelyCertification: Certificate in Chinese MedicineStudy Options: E-learning (online) or Correspondence (paper) Page 16Unit 3: Tibetan and Unani Tibetan and Unani medicine, together with Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine, make up the four main Eastern medical approaches to health and disease. Each discipline offers its own unique blend of amazing knowledge and when combined, gives the student a knowledge and understanding of health, disease and human nature that is unsurpassed in modern medical approaches. An understanding of these combined four approaches provides an excellent foundation to progress to studying Naturopathic medicine in detail. The Eastern medicine modules will provide an unrivalled approach to Eastern nutrition which will set you apart from other practitioners using more orthodox nutritional approaches to health. Part A: Tibetan Medicine, just as Ayurvedic medicine is influenced by Hinduism and Chinese medicine is influenced by Taoism, so Tibetan medicine is influenced by Buddhism. Part B: Unani Medicine developed out of ancient Greek medicine (Unani=Greek; Tibb=medicine in Arabic). Units: 1 Study Hours: 100Time: Estimated 2 months (timing up to you)Enrolment period: 4 months (with option to extend)Books: Purchased separatelyCertification: Certificate in Tibetan & Unani MedicineStudy Options: E-learning (online) or Correspondence (paper)Unit 4: Homepathy Homeopathy is a system of alternative medicine that is based on the Law of Similars. The Law of Similars states that a substance, when taken in a large amount will cause certain adverse symptoms, but if a minute amount of the substance is taken, then it will heal the symptoms that it would cause if taken to excess. This concept is more commonly known as 'like cures like'. Homeopathy is perhaps the best known of all the natural medical disciplines. Most people have heard of homeopathy; it is an in-depth subject that requires a minimum of 4 years' study to become a professional homeopath. However, in this module you will learn the fundamentals of homeopathic philosophy, methodology and case taking so you can look after your patients in a basic way with commonly used remedies. You will learn about 30-40 remedies so that you can carry out simple prescribing in your practice. If you have already completed a homeopathy course, you can complete Herbal Medicine as an alternative unit. Units: 1 Study Hours: 100Time: Estimated 2 months (timing up to you)Enrolment period: 4 months (with option to extend)Books: Purchased separatelyCertification: Certificate in HomeopathyStudy Options: E-learning (online) or Correspondence (paper) Page 17Page 18Unit 5: Naturopathy Naturopathy has become an amalgamation of different disciplines, all of which aim to treat the body naturally and respect and acknowledge the vital energy in the body. Although the therapies differ, the underlying message of promoting health and supporting the body's own healing processes runs through them all. They are: healthy living, natural diet, detoxification, exercise, physical therapy, and mental, emotional and spiritual healing, all using natural therapeutic agents. An understanding of Naturopathy provides an insight in to disease symptoms that few other disciplines can match. Not only does it provide knowledge of what the body is trying to achieve with its myriad of symptoms that health practitioners are continually confronted with, but it also provides simple answers in the form of dietary and lifestyle changes together with naturopathic techniques. Learning naturopathy gives you the tools to fully understand your clients' symptoms and how to help them return to improved health. Units: 1 Study Hours: 100Time: Estimated 2 months (timing up to you)Enrolment period: 4 months (with option to extend)Books: Purchased separatelyCertification: NaturopathyStudy Options: E-learning (online) or Correspondence (paper)Unit 6: Homotoxicology With its roots in naturopathy, the basis of Homotoxicology is that the body is trying to maintain homeostasis via the elimination of toxicity. All routes of elimination therefore need to be supported. Homotoxicology is a blend of Homeopathy, Naturopathy and modern scientific research. It therefore brings these disciplines 'up to date' by studying the science that underlies them and how they work. Study of Homotoxicology offers the student an in-depth scientific understanding of disease which encompasses the humoral foundation of Eastern medicine, Homeopathy and Naturopathy. Students will build on their understanding of the regulatory processes in the body and how toxicity will hinder these processes resulting in pathology. This module brings together everything that has been learnt so far in the course and views it from a modern scientific perspective whilst at the same time maintaining the underlying naturopathic foundation. Units: 1 Study Hours: 100Time: Estimated 2 months (timing up to you)Enrolment period: 4 months (with option to extend)Books: Purchased separatelyCertification: Certificate in HomotoxicologyStudy Options: (paper) Page 19Unit 7: Psychosocial Naturopaths need to have an understanding of the history of psychology and the different schools of thought within the psychology and psychoanalysis sector. They also need to have an understanding of how the brain influences the physical body from a modern scientific perspective and have tools at hand that they can offer to their clients in order to help deal with the various stresses that we all have to cope with. This unit is therefore divided into two parts. Part A: Psychotherapeutic Models, The Human Stress-Trauma Response, The Therapeutic Process , Psychotherapeutic Treatment Strategies, Relieving Stress-Trauma Manifestation Part B: The Stress Response, Stress, Allostasis and Allostatic Load, Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome, Stress and Endocrine changes, Monitoring and Supporting Stress Levels, Flower and Tree Formulas and Remedies, The Enneagram, Jungian personality types, Myers Briggs and David Keirsey Units: 1 Study Hours: 100Time: Estimated 2 months (timing up to you)Enrolment period: 4 months (with option to extend)Books: Purchased separatelyCertification: 8: Iridology Iridology is an amazing diagnostic tool which sits comfortably alongside any alternative medical discipline. This module will provide you with the tools to use this discipline in your practice and enhance your understanding of your client's emotional traits, overall health, constitution, predispositions and inherited factors. The course content will provide you with the necessary information to use Iridology extremely effectively in your practice and also to act as a firm foundation for more advanced study of this incredible discipline. Iridology includes the anatomy of the iris, iris charts and zones of the iris, pupil size and shape, the iris (colour in the iris, the stomach ring, the intestinal ring, the collarette, contraction furrows, nerve rings, scurf rim, lymphatic rosary, circulatory or venous ring, the anaemia ring, cholesterol ring, sodium ring, arcus senilis, bulge), degrees of disease in the iris and lacunae, crypts and defect signs, pigment on the iris, radii, transversals, spleen signs hypothalamus signs, constitutions, emotional / behavioural iridology, miasms, modern iridology and the latest research.

Hydrotherapy is still practiced today, although it has been developed since the days of Kneipp who generally preferred to use cold water. Certainly cold water swimming has been found to be very beneficial for depression. Modern hydrotherapy includes the use of warm water together with exercises given by physiotherapists for various ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism, muscular pain and anxiety. Traditional hydrotherapy techniques help to build immunity, improve circulation, improve the quality of the blood and lymph and balances the autonomic nervous system. This module provides detailed information about the history, science and practice of hydrotherapy allowing you to use this simple but extremely effective tool safely in your practice.

Many dentists are not aware of how the work they are doing on individual teeth will affect the overall health of the body. This is particularly important in light of the latest trend of 'cosmetic dentistry'. It is now accepted that gum disease is associated with heart attacks. Dentists are also aware that the process of dental caries can result in extensive conservation work which can have a biochemical and physiological effect upon the body. For example, they know that procedures such as implants, crowns or root canal treatments should not be carried out when there is overt periodontal disease present in the mouth. Many dentists however are not fully aware of the extent of the effects that these procedures can have upon the otherwise healthy or asymptomatic body.
