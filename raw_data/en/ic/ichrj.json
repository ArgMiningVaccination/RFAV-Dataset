The aim of this review is to explain what happens to the immune system after recovery from COVID-19 and/or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease. We detail the way in which the immune system responds to a SARS-CoV-2 infection, including innate and adaptive measures. Then, we describe the role of vaccination, the main types of COVID-19 vaccines and how they protect us. Further, we explain the reason why immunity after COVID-19 infection plus a vaccination appears to induce a stronger response compared with virus exposure alone. Additionally, this review reports some correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we reinforce that vaccination is safe and important in achieving herd immunity.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-10-29", "cleaned_text": "What Happens to the Immune System after Vaccination or Recovery from COVID-19? [https://doi.org/10.3390/life11111152](https://doi.org/10.3390/life11111152) [Ecology, Evolution and Epidemiology of Coronaviruses]( /journal/life/special_issues/ecology_evolution_epidemiology_coronaviruses )) Abstract: 1. Introduction 2. The Immune Response after SARS-CoV-2 Contact 2.1. Innate Immune Response against SARS-CoV-2 [1](#B1-life-11-01152)]. Despite this powerful apparatus, SARS-CoV-2 is able to overcome these barriers and establish an infection. [2](#B2-life-11-01152)]; accordingly, studies have suggested that approximately 100 airborne particles may be sufficient to initiate a SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [3](#B3-life-11-01152)]. Upon inhalation, SARS-CoV-2 employs cell-surface angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as receptor for entry into host cells [ [4](#B4-life-11-01152)]. ACE2 is more highly expressed in the oropharyngeal mucosal and endothelial cells, oral and alveolar tissues, kidneys the gastrointestinal tract [ [5](#B5-life-11-01152), [6](#B6-life-11-01152)]. [7](#B7-life-11-01152)] and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These patterns are host-derived molecules released from damaged or dying cells [ [8](#B8-life-11-01152)]. From these interactions, soluble mediators (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, effector mechanisms, and the complement system) can be produced to inhibit the establishment of an infection [ [9](#B9-life-11-01152)]. Although knowledge in this area is still limited, some studies have shown higher plasma levels of DAMPs in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls, which may be evidence of DAMPS' participation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [ [10](#B10-life-11-01152), [11](#B11-life-11-01152)]. This initial inflammation can eliminate the infected cells before the virus spreads, resolving the infection or, alternatively, the inflammatory mediators produced by host innate immune defences may cause dysregulated responses, leading to damage to lung and vascular tissues, for example [ [12](#B12-life-11-01152), [13](#B13-life-11-01152)]. [14](#B14-life-11-01152), [15](#B15-life-11-01152)]. However, been observed dysregulating type I interferon [ [23](#B23-life-11-01152)] and inflammatory responses, leading to hyperactive cytokine release, termed cytokine storm [ [24](#B24-life-11-01152)], a condition observed in most severe patients. [ [31](#B31-life-11-01152)]). These inflammatory molecules have been associated with T cell depletion and disease severity, since excessive and persistent inflammation can cause lung injury with the development of ARDS and, in extreme cases, multiple organ failure that may lead to death [ [23](#B23-life-11-01152), [32](#B32-life-11-01152), [33](#B33-life-11-01152)]. Furthermore, the induction of tissue damage is exacerbated by the impaired type I IFN response in infected cells, which allows viral replication [ [32](#B32-life-11-01152), [34](#B34-life-11-01152)]. [16](#B16-life-11-01152), [35](#B35-life-11-01152), [36](#B36-life-11-01152), [37](#B37-life-11-01152)]. [38](#B38-life-11-01152)]. In this regard, aspects of the SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune response on disease severity and/or patient recovery will be discussed in the next section. 2.2. Adaptive Immune Response against SARS-CoV-2 [39](#B39-life-11-01152)], the adaptive immune response mediated by B and T cells via antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is crucial to the body's defence. [40](#B40-life-11-01152), [41](#B41-life-11-01152)]. Activated CD8+ T cells may present a cytotoxicity profile, releasing perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis of infected target cells [ [42](#B42-life-11-01152)]. In turn, CD4+ T cells can produce cytokines that influence the activation and differentiation of other immune cells, including APCs, helping them destroy ingested virus, CD8+ T lymphocytes kill infected target cells, and B cells secrete SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, including immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG [ [42](#B42-life-11-01152)]. [42](#B42-life-11-01152)]. Alternatively, the host immune response can be dysfunctional and suboptimal, leading to worse clinical patient conditions [ [43](#B43-life-11-01152)]. Different clinical outcomes have been studied, but they may depend on several characteristics of the host, including the presence of comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension); variations in genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 replication and immunomodulatory processes (differential expression of ACE2 receptor and genes associated to inflammation); and HLA polymorphisms associated with severe cases of allele) [ [44](#B44-life-11-01152), [45](#B45-life-11-01152)]. [46](#B46-life-11-01152), [47](#B47-life-11-01152), [48](#B48-life-11-01152), [49](#B49-life-11-01152)]. been proposed to explain the reduction of platelet counts, such as hematopoietic cells' viral invasion that could lead to inhibition of hematopoiesis, decreasing platelet production. Besides, the presence of immune complexes and autoantibodies could lead to platelet destruction and lung injury, which could promote platelet activation and aggregation, generating microthrombi, increasing platelets consumption [ [50](#B50-life-11-01152)]. Regarding lymphopenia induction, T cells may exhibit functional exhaustion [ [46](#B46-life-11-01152)] or activated profile in the presence of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, collaborating with tissue damage [ [38](#B38-life-11-01152), [51](#B51-life-11-01152), [52](#B52-life-11-01152)]. [53](#B53-life-11-01152)]. Additionally, although the authors were not able to relate antigen-specific T cell responses to disease severity, they found evidence for a negative correlation between viral loads and CD4+ T cell counts [ [53](#B53-life-11-01152)]. In this respect, Mathew et al. (2020) reported that in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, three different patterns of adaptive immune response with mortality occurred in all of them. In the first immunotype associated with disease severity, they observed activated CD4+ T cells, dysregulation of CD8+ T cells, and the presence of plasmablasts; the second immunotype was not correlated with disease severity and revealed less CD4+ T cell activation, the presence of effector-like CD8+ T cells and memory B cells; finally, the third immune response pattern showed a negative correlation with disease severity and was defined by lack of activated T and B cell responses [ [54](#B54-life-11-01152)]. These examples indicate the complex interplay between the adaptive immune response and SARS-CoV-2 infection. [52](#B52-life-11-01152), [55](#B55-life-11-01152), [56](#B56-life-11-01152)]. In addition, the authors observed that T cell responses of COVID-19 recovered donors are directed against the membrane, spike and nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 proteins, with the production of TNF- and IFN- by CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes displaying a cytotoxic profile by the expression granzyme B and perforin [ [55](#B55-life-11-01152)]. [57](#B57-life-11-01152), [58](#B58-life-11-01152), [59](#B59-life-11-01152)], when IgM levels rise rapidly; then become undetectable generally within 2 months after diagnosis [ [60](#B60-life-11-01152)]. Thus, virus-specific IgG levels start to be detected approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms, reaching their peak in 21-25 days [ [61](#B61-life-11-01152)]. [56](#B56-life-11-01152)]. Although antibodies gradually decay over time after infection, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells, which are able to expand and differentiate rapidly into antibody-secreting plasmablasts [ [62](#B62-life-11-01152)], have been identified in recovered COVID-19 patients 1 to 7 months after the onset of symptoms [ [56](#B56-life-11-01152), [63](#B63-life-11-01152), [64](#B64-life-11-01152)], and the frequency of B cells was higher than that in healthy controls [ [63](#B63-life-11-01152)]. [65](#B65-life-11-01152), [66](#B66-life-11-01152)]. These residual symptoms could disable individuals from returning to their normal life. Although the mechanisms behind the persistence of symptoms have not been identified yet, they may be related to sequelae of organ damage, hyperactivation of the immune system/generation of autoantibodies, and the presence of comorbidities or adverse effects from medication administered [ [67](#B67-life-11-01152)]. [56](#B56-life-11-01152)]. Studies have shown that regardless of disease severity, most recovered individuals have detectable specific adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 [ [68](#B68-life-11-01152), [69](#B69-life-11-01152)]. Answers to the questions of whether these responses provide protection against severe COVID-19 reinfection, mainly to new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and if there is a relation between immune system responses and the occurrence of \"long COVID\", remains to be explored. 3. Immune Response Induced by COVID-19 Vaccines [70](#B70-life-11-01152)]. Among the approved vaccines, different platforms have been used: inactivated virus, viral vectors, and RNA-based vaccines. (Sinopharm/China National Biotec Group Co/Beijing Institute of Biological Products) vaccines, both approved by the WHO, were based on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. [73](#B73-life-11-01152)], which are capable of introducing encoding viral antigens, such as the spike protein/RBD, into the host cell. In turn, the infected cell produces and releases these viral antigens, stimulating the immune response [ [73](#B73-life-11-01152)]. The production of this type of vaccine is simple; thus, it does not require adjuvants [ [74](#B74-life-11-01152)]. However, people who may have previously been exposed to other adenoviruses could have some vectors neutralized by pre-existing vectorial immunity [ [73](#B73-life-11-01152)]. Ad26.COV2.S and ChAdOx1 (chimpanzee adenovirus) were considered to decrease the probability of this cross-reaction. The use of adenovirus as a non-replicating viral vector is a technique applied in the approved vaccines AZD122 ChAdOx1-S (University of Oxford-AstraZeneca), Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen Pharmaceuticals by Johnson & Johnson) and Ad5-nCoV (Convidecia, CanSino Biologics Inc., Beijing Institute of Biotechnology). [75](#B75-life-11-01152)]. Since mRNA is a very unstable molecule and easily degraded, especially in the presence of RNases, lipidic nanoparticles (LNPs) are used to deliver this molecule, which can protect and facilitate mRNA delivery and translation in the cytosol [ [70](#B70-life-11-01152), [71](#B71-life-11-01152), [74](#B74-life-11-01152)]. Due to the instability mentioned above, this vaccine requires an ultra-low temperature for storage. Examples of mRNA-based vaccines are BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), which were the first ones widely distributed. [74](#B74-life-11-01152)]. Viral vector-based vaccines simulate a viral infection through SARS-CoV-2 transgene expression, mimicking the characteristics of the natural infection, stimulating a strong antibody production and cytotoxic response, which leads to infected cells destruction [ [76](#B76-life-11-01152)]. In turn, the mRNA molecules, products of mRNA-based vaccines, are taken up by APCs and are recognized by TLR, which activates type I interferon, that potentialize the stimulation of Th1 response. Also, similar to a viral infection, the antigenic protein is produced by host cells favoring presentation via MHC I, which stimulates a cytotoxic response [ [77](#B77-life-11-01152)]. Thus, the type of vaccine can modulate the immune system in different ways, leading to more or less potent immune responses. [78](#B78-life-11-01152)]. [Table 1](#life-11-01152-t001)). Thus, it is important to emphasize the need of standardized protocols for the assessment of cellular response induced by vaccines. [79](#B79-life-11-01152)]. Exploring this technology, Kramer and colleagues analyzed the single-cell profiling of the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) antigenic response. Data revealed a novel expanding population of non-canonical memory CD4 and CD8 T-cells following vaccination [ [80](#B80-life-11-01152)]. In addition, Cao and colleagues also explored this technique and described the immune dynamics during immunization with the viral vector based-vaccine Ad5-nCoV that revealed enhanced cellular immunity and boosted SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies [ [81](#B81-life-11-01152)]. Data derived from the scRNA-seq technology has the potential to describe novel markers of protection following anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. [Table 1](#life-11-01152-t001)summarizes some important information about the seven main vaccines already approved by WHO. [82](#B82-life-11-01152)], and these variants are more infectious with a high transmission rate. [97](#B97-life-11-01152)]. On the other hand, Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) respectively showed 81.7% and 75% efficacy against this variant [ [98](#B98-life-11-01152), [99](#B99-life-11-01152)]. For the Alpha variant, ChAdOx1 (University of Oxford-AstraZeneca), BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) vaccines showed a slight effectiveness reduction, with 70%, 90% and 80% of protection, respectively [ [98](#B98-life-11-01152), [99](#B99-life-11-01152), [100](#B100-life-11-01152)]. For the Gamma variant, CoronaVac (Sinovac Research and Development) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) vaccines did not show significant reduction in protection [ [98](#B98-life-11-01152), [101](#B101-life-11-01152)]. Finally, concerning the Delta variant, it was shown that BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines did not elicit antibody neutralization responses against this variant, which demonstrated 6.8 times more resistance to neutralization [ [102](#B102-life-11-01152)]. On the other hand, another group demonstrated that sera from BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccinated individuals were capable of neutralizing the Delta variant viruses at titres of at least 1:40 [ [103](#B103-life-11-01152)]. [104](#B104-life-11-01152)], these events are rare. Therefore, once COVID-19 severe cases continue to be reduced, it seems that currently used vaccines are quite effective. New variants were expected to emerge after the COVID-19 outbreak, and while progress in developing and disseminating vaccines has been made, there are no variants completely resistant to the vaccines to date. 4. The Immunity and Virus Transmission after Vaccination [105](#B105-life-11-01152)]. In addition, much evidence has demonstrated that they can considerably reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Concerning the protective effect, vaccinated individuals who become infected are up to 78% less likely to spread the virus to household members than unvaccinated people [ [106](#B106-life-11-01152)]. [106](#B106-life-11-01152)]. This observation is extremely important given the gradual development of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells also observed by other groups [ [107](#B107-life-11-01152), [108](#B108-life-11-01152)], which reach maximal levels after the second vaccine dose. These data point to the immunological benefit of two vaccine doses in SARS-CoV-na\u00efve subjects and emphasize coordination between the different arms of the adaptive immune response following mRNA vaccination. In addition, the preferential induction of Th1, Tfh, and central memory-like T-cells, in concert with robust humoral immunity, indicates that the immune response is specifically focused on the main features of long-term antiviral immunity, which are likely to provide lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 [ [109](#B109-life-11-01152)]. [110](#B110-life-11-01152), [111](#B111-life-11-01152)]. Allam and Sayed (2021) reported a case in which a man (47 years old) from Saudi Arabia who received the first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) became infected with COVID-19 and transmitted the infection to his family. This was the first case in that country of a person receiving the first dose of this vaccine who became infected afterwards. The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine was shown to elicit effective humoral and cellular responses a week after the second dose [ [112](#B112-life-11-01152)], and in the case of this patient, it seems that the virus was transmitted to him between Day 3, when he tested negative, and Day 12, when he became symptomatic. Although the first dose may have reduced the infection\u00b4s impact, it did not prevent the virus from spreading. Once his family confirmed that they had not come in contact with anyone else, this patient was, in fact, the primary source of infection for them. This case report confirms that the first dose of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) is not sufficient for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection or transmission [ [110](#B110-life-11-01152)]. [113](#B113-life-11-01152)], McEllistrem et al. (2021a) evaluated the effect of a single dose of a BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine on viral loads among 10 individuals who developed asymptomatic COVID-19 while residing at a Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) Community Living Center [ [114](#B114-life-11-01152)]. Five residents without a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 received the vaccine's first dose, and all of them became positive by detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples between 12-15 days after vaccination. The other five residents were unvaccinated prior to diagnosis. The comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals concerning the mean log10 viral load was significantly higher in unvaccinated residents (9.5) than in vaccinated residents (7.1). Although the five vaccinated individuals became positive after vaccination, these results showed that the single dose of a BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine may help control outbreaks, but not stop them, since viral load is linked to transmission. [115](#B115-life-11-01152)]. The HCW in his early 60s received the second dose 21 days after the first dose, according to recommendations [ [116](#B116-life-11-01152)], and he became positive 26 days after the booster dose, although full vaccination efficacy has been shown as early as 7 days after the second dose [ [117](#B117-life-11-01152)]. In this case, the HCW acquired high levels of anti-spike antibodies 33 days after the second dose and 7 days after the RT-PCR-positive swab [ [115](#B115-life-11-01152)], although this range of antibody levels was seen after complete vaccination with mRNA-based vaccines. Therefore, the risk of transmission by fully vaccinated individuals can occur with their close contacts [ [115](#B115-life-11-01152)]. Additionally, in Barnstable County (Massachusetts), which had several public events, 469 COVID-19 cases occurred among Massachusetts residents between July 6 and July 25. Overall, 346 (74%) individuals reported symptoms. From 133 individuals, 119 (89%) were diagnosed with the Delta variant, which is highly transmissible [ [118](#B118-life-11-01152)]. [119](#B119-life-11-01152)]. Additionally, Li et al. (2021), aiming to find measures to block community SARS-CoV-2 transmission, studied the CoronaVac (Sinovac Research and Development) and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm/China National Biotec Group Co/Beijing Institute of Biological Products) vaccines against the Delta variant, which has been associated with high transmissibility [ [120](#B120-life-11-01152)]. In this study were included 366 participants during the outbreak of the Delta variant in May 2021 in Guangzhou city, China. They observed that a single dose of a vaccine was not sufficiently protective (vaccine effectiveness: 13.8%) against the Delta variant. On the other hand, the vaccine effectiveness for full vaccination with two doses was estimated to be 59.0%, markedly higher than the single-dose [ [120](#B120-life-11-01152)]. Some of reported studies were performed before detection of the Delta variant, which has a significantly higher transmission capacity than other strains and can be more easily spread by vaccinated individuals. In fact, this can explain the rebound of the virus in many countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), where the proportion of vaccinated individuals is high and some prevention and control measures are still in place [ [121](#B121-life-11-01152)]. [122](#B122-life-11-01152)]. This finding could also represent an increase in the transmissibility of the Delta variant, but these data need further exploration [ [105](#B105-life-11-01152)]. In Israel, where 60% of the population was fully vaccinated with BNT162b2, cases of the Delta variant have risen sharply. Therefore, a third (booster) dose of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine has been approved in this country aimed at reducing transmission and curbing disease severity [ [123](#B123-life-11-01152)]. [124](#B124-life-11-01152)]. [91](#B91-life-11-01152)]. The ingestion of droplets into the lung leads to a lower respiratory tract illness ranging from mild respiratory infection to ARDS [ [12](#B12-life-11-01152)]. Thus, if the location of the initial infection is primarily through the lungs, the best route of vaccine administration seems to be inhalation delivery directly to this organ. [125](#B125-life-11-01152), [126](#B126-life-11-01152), [127](#B127-life-11-01152)]. To effectively prevent viral replication within mucosal primary target cells, adequate local production of secretory IgA (SIgA) is necessary. Consequently, Mercado and collaborators (2020) concluded that protection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts will be required to prevent transmission and disease in humans [ [126](#B126-life-11-01152), [127](#B127-life-11-01152)]. In this regard, several COVID-19 inhaled vaccine candidates are in development, and they have shown good results in preclinical studies [ [111](#B111-life-11-01152)]. There are six vaccines that have progressed to clinical trials: 1) AdCOVID sponsored by Altimmune (Codagenix Inc.) [ [133](#B133-life-11-01152)]. [105](#B105-life-11-01152)]. Several studies found that vaccination with mRNA-based vaccines in individuals who had previously been infected elicits a strong and rapid immune response [ [87](#B87-life-11-01152), [134](#B134-life-11-01152)]. Harris and collaborators (2021) studied 365,000 households in UK and predicted that infected individuals were 40-50% less likely to spread the infection if they had received at least one dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or AZD122 ChAdOx1-S (University of Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine at least three weeks previously [ [135](#B135-life-11-01152)]. Salo et al. (2021) demonstrated that spouses of infected HCWs in Finland who had received one dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine were 43% less likely to become infected than spouses of unvaccinated health workers [ [136](#B136-life-11-01152)]. [137](#B137-life-11-01152)]. This study demonstrated that previous infection increased the magnitude and quality of the adaptive immune response after a single dose of vaccine. Antibody titres were 34 times higher after vaccination in previously infected residents than before vaccination. This enhanced antibody response in those with a history of infection was also observed by Krammer et al. (2021) and Manisty et al. (2021) [ [134](#B134-life-11-01152), [138](#B138-life-11-01152)]. In addition, Angyal et al. (2021) observed that people with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection have 15-fold higher humoral responses after vaccination against the Beta (B.1.531) variant than participants with no previous infection [ [139](#B139-life-11-01152)]. [137](#B137-life-11-01152)]. In addition, no significant difference was observed between BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (University of Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccines. [140](#B140-life-11-01152)]. Wang and colleagues observed a notable evolution of neutralizing breadth after infection and a robust enhancement of serologic responses and B cell memory achieved with mRNA vaccination, which suggests that convalescent individuals who are vaccinated should have high levels of protection against VOCs without a need to modify existing vaccines. If a similar process occurs with naive individuals who receive vaccines, an additional dose should lead to protective immunity against circulating variants. [141](#B141-life-11-01152)]. Immunization of previously infected individuals with CoronaVac showed no significant differences in neutralizing antibody (NAb) titres after the first dose or when comparing the first and second doses. Significantly increased NAb titres were observed after both doses of CoronaVac, suggesting that infection induces a robust B-cell memory response. On the other hand, vaccination of seropositive individuals with mRNA and adenovirus-based vaccines induced high NAb titres after the first dose [ [87](#B87-life-11-01152), [98](#B98-life-11-01152)]. 5. Immune Correlates of Protection from SARS-CoV-2 Infection [142](#B142-life-11-01152)]. Additionally, depending on the endpoint used, the correlate can refer to protection from infection, disease, severe disease or mortality [ [143](#B143-life-11-01152)]. [144](#B144-life-11-01152)]. Although the nature of the stimulus may be different, studies suggest that in both cases, infection or vaccination, there is the development of an antibody response capable of generating protection [ [144](#B144-life-11-01152), [145](#B145-life-11-01152), [146](#B146-life-11-01152)]. [147](#B147-life-11-01152)]. These data emphasize the importance of both humoral and cellular immunity for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and provide clues of possible correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. [146](#B146-life-11-01152)]. Additionally, a recent publication has shown evidence for antibodies as protective correlates for COVID-19 vaccines. The authors evaluated seven vaccines currently in use worldwide (Pfizer, Moderna, Gamaleya, AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson) for efficacy and antibody induction. A robust correlation between antibody titres and efficacy was observed, with higher titres correlating with higher vaccine efficacy [ [78](#B78-life-11-01152)], corroborating antibodies as correlates of protection. [148](#B148-life-11-01152), [149](#B149-life-11-01152), [150](#B150-life-11-01152)]. In turn, some authors have found sustained T-cell immunity despite a decline in the antibody response months after infection [ [151](#B151-life-11-01152), [152](#B152-life-11-01152)], suggesting that other immune components contribute to protective immunity. 6. Vaccination and Herd Immunity [153](#B153-life-11-01152)] (most common ones described in [Table 1](#life-11-01152-t001)), mass vaccination is likely the main strategy to guide us to the end of this worldwide unprecedented tragedy [ [154](#B154-life-11-01152)]. In this case, it is well understood that all advantages of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination overcome the risks of possible adverse events. [155](#B155-life-11-01152)]. Confirmed cases, deaths and hospital admissions are sharply decreased in countries with a major population fully vaccinated [ [156](#B156-life-11-01152)]. Bauer et al. (2021) reinforced that the safest long-term strategy is keeping a low number of COVID-19 cases to preserve reduced mortality and morbidity. This strategy creates better conditions in the case of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that can escape the immune system and as governments reduce restrictive measures with progressing vaccinations [ [157](#B157-life-11-01152)]. [158](#B158-life-11-01152)]. [159](#B159-life-11-01152)]. [160](#B160-life-11-01152)]. Another public health concern is immunocompromised and immune-mediated inflammatory patients, who deserve special attention after vaccination, generally regarding whether patients on biologics will generate a sufficient immune response to the vaccine [ [161](#B161-life-11-01152)]. To address this issue, the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended that people with severely weakened immune systems should have a third vaccine dose [ [162](#B162-life-11-01152)]. Findings after a six-month follow-up in a cohort of HCW in Belgium also suggested the third dose scheme for individuals who were seronegative before vaccination [ [163](#B163-life-11-01152)]. [164](#B164-life-11-01152)]. An insight is making vaccination easy and promoting autonomy by simplifying services and offering the public choices, so it may increase uptake in those who remain deliberative [ [165](#B165-life-11-01152)]. Having a skilled and knowledgeable health care team, as well as an open dialogue between patients and these professionals, is fundamental to the creation of a vaccine-positive culture. Then, we could easily identify barriers and determine solutions to improve vaccine uptake [ [166](#B166-life-11-01152)]. Undoubtedly, the influence of vaccine hesitancy is closely linked to skepticism and misinformation, and social media is currently a major contributor to this damage [ [167](#B167-life-11-01152)]. Additionally, Doustmohammadi and Cherry (2020) suggest that a long-term approach would be to introduce science and epidemiological education in grade school to college. 7.
