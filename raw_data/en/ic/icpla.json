Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834-3000 National Hospitalist Day in Pictures The inaugural National Hospitalist Day was celebrat- ed on Thursday, March 7, 2019. Occurring the first Thursday in March annually, National Hospitalist Day will serve to acknowledge the fastest-growing specialty in modern medicine and hospitalists' enduring contributions to the evolving health care landscape. National Hospitalist Day was approved by the National Day Calendar and was 1 of approximately 30 national days to be approved for 2019 out of an applicant pool of more than 18,000. In addition to celebrating hospitalists' contributions to patient care on this date every year, the Society of Hospi- tal Medicine plans to highlight the varied career paths of hospital medicine professionals, from frontline hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants to practice administrators, C-suite executives, and academic hospitalists. In 2019, SHM also launched the first #HowWeHospitalist social media contest. Nearly 1,000 submissions across all so- cial media platforms exuded pride and passion for hospital medicine. Hospitalists described the contributions they and their colleagues make to improving patient care, what makes them proud to be hospitalists, and how they make a differ- ence in their hospitals and in the lives of their patients. We have collected a selection of these images shared on a variety of social media platforms. Find more by searching the hashtag #HowWeHospitalist.

This year, hospitalists who care for children will gather at Pediatric Hospital Medicine (PHM) in Seattle from July 25 to 28, with the goal of enhancing participants' knowledge and competence in the areas of innovation, clinical med- icine, education, health services, practice management, quality im- provement, and research. But what makes this year partic- ularly special is the launch of the subspecialty exam for certification in pediatric hospital medicine coming later this fall, solidifying its growth and importance within hospital medicine and the entire health care landscape. The Amer- ican Board of Pediatrics (ABP) has approved PHM as the newest board subspecialty with a 2-year fellowship accredited by the Ac- creditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). This conference will be a great opportu- nity to join with others to review competencies for board review, as well as to network with those who are also navigating the road ahead. During 2019, the Pediatric Hospi- talist Special Interest Group (SIG) of SHM has been working tirelessly on several initiatives, including a revision of the Pediatric Hospital Medicine Core Competencies as well as additional work to develop Choosing Wisely 2.0 recommenda- tions. These will help us ensure we are developing the best curricula for the next generation of pediatric hospitalists, while cutting back on unnecessary tests and procedures for those practicing today. Each of these initiatives, as well as the July conference, highlights the opportu- nities that we have within SHM to work with other like-minded pro- viders who care for children. While we partner with all professionals across many organizations, like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Academic Pediatric Asso- ciation to name a few, I wanted to share my reflections on SHM and my appreciation for the \"big tent\" philosophy that has served us so well thus far. Having an opportunity to sit on the board of SHM has allowed me a chance to really appreciate the ef- forts that this organization invests in all who care for patients in the hospital; we have an active group of advanced-practice providers, practice administrators, residents, students, and academic hospital- ists, and the list goes on and on. We collaborate with a number of spectacular societies dedicated to medical specialties, and we are al- ways open to new ways of improv- ing the methods of delivering care to patients, in hospitals, post-acute care facilities, homes - you name it! As health care delivery models continue to evolve, I believe we are well positioned to be leaders in the delivery of acute care medicine in the hospital and beyond. I have also learned of happenings at the grassroots level by attend- ing SHM chapter meetings across the United States. For example, the Hampton Roads Chapter led a great Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) workshop, and influenced by that, I shared an idea at home in Nashville - borrowing my son as a model to demonstrate ultrasound techniques that hospitalists can use to assist in clinical care. I hope you, as pediatric hospitalists, will see if you have a local chapter and attend a meeting; whether you are a mem- ber of SHM or not, you can mingle with those who provide acute care treatments to all your communities and share best practices. If you don't see an SHM chapter close by, let's get one going! SHM is here to help launch a chapter that can help bring your community together and provide education and networking closer to home. If you can't attend PHM in Seattle this year, I hope you will make every effort to be at PHM 2020, where our own SIG leader, Jeffrey Grill, MD, from Louisville, Ky., will be chairing the next rendition of this amazing conference. The SHM Meetings team led by Michelle Kann will be working tirelessly to make it a great event with continued growth in con- tent and attendance.

UH Cleveland is an affiliate of Case Western Reserve University.Survey Insights Dealing with staffing shortfalls Five options for covering unfilled positions By Tierza Stephan, MD Being in stressful situations is part of being a hospitalist. During a hospitalist's work shift, one of the key determi- nants of stress is adequate staffing. With use of survey data from 569 hospital medicine groups (HMGs) across the nation, one of the topics examined in the 2018 State of Hos- pital Medicine Report is how HMGs cope with unfilled hospitalist physi- cian positions. The survey presented five options unfilled hospitalist phy- sician positions: using existing hospitalists volun- teer for extra shifts, requiring extra shifts, and leaving some shifts un- covered. Recipients were instructed to select all options that applied, so totals exceeded 100%. The data are organized according to HMGs that serve adults only, children only, and both adults and children. For all three types of HMGs, the most common tactic to fill coverage gaps is through voluntary extra shifts by existing clinicians, report- edly used by 70.3% of HMGs that cover adults only, 66.7% by those that cover children only, and 76.9% by those that cover both adults and children. Data for adults-only HMGs were further broken down by geographic region, academic status, teaching status, group size, and em- ployment model. Among adults-only HMGs, there is a direct correlation between group size and having members voluntarily work extra shifts, with 91.1% of groups with 30 or more full-time equivalent posi- tions employing this tactic. For HMGs that cover adults only and those that cover children only, the second most common tactic is to use moonlighters (57.4% and 53.3%, respectively), while use of moon- lighters is the third most commonly employed surveyed tactic for HMGs that cover both adults and children (53.8%). HMGs that serve both adults and children were much more likely to utilize locum tenens to cover unfilled positions (69.2%) than were groups that serve adults only (44.0%) or children only (26.7%). The variability in the use of locum ten-ens is likely because of the willing- ness and/or ability of the respective groups to afford this option because it is generally the most expensive option of those surveyed. Requiring that members of the group work extra shifts is the least popular staffing method among adults-only HMGs (10.0%) and HMGs serving both chil- dren and adults (7.7%). This strategy is unpopular, espe- cially when there is little ad- vance warning. Surprisingly, 40.0% of HMGs that see chil- dren only require members to work extra shifts to cover unfilled slots. This could be because pediatric HMGs are often smaller, and it would be more difficult to absorb the work if the shift is left uncovered. In fact, many pediatric HMGs staff with only one clinician at a time, so there may be no option besides requiring someone else in the group to come in and work. Of the options surveyed, perhaps the most uncomfortable for those hospitalist physicians on duty is to leave some shifts uncovered. The rapid growth and development of the specialty of hospital medicine has made it difficult for HMGs to continuously hire qualified hospi- talists fast enough to meet demand. The survey found 46.2% of HMGs that serve both adults and children and 31.4% of groups that serve adults only have employed the staff- Dr. Stephan is a hospitalist at Alli- na Health's Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis and is a member of the SHM Practice Analysis Committee. ing model of going short-staffed for at least some shifts. HMGs serving children only are much less likely to go short-staffed (20.0%). I work with a large HMG that has more than 70 members, and when it has been short-staffed, it tries to ensure a full complement of evening and night staff as the top priority because these shifts are typically more stressful. Since we have more hospitalist capacity during the day to absorb the loss of a physician, we pull staff from their daytime rounding schedules to execute this strategy. While go- ing short-staffed is not ideal, this option has worked for many groups out of sheer necessity.FROM THE SOCIETY Dr. Rankin I work with a large HMG that has more than 70 members, and when it has been short- staffed, it tries to ensure a full complement of evening and night staff as the top priority because these shifts are typically more stressful. July 2019 | 10 | The HospitalistThe Future Hospitalist Becoming a high-value care physician 'Culture shift' comes from collective efforts By Mary Lacy, MD, and Celine Goetz, MD It's Monday morning, and Mrs. Jones still has abdominal pain. Your ward team decides to order a CT. On chart review you notice she's had three other abdominal CTs for the same indication this year. How did this happen? What should you do? High-value care has been defined by the Institute of Medicine as \"the best care for the patient, with the optimal result for the circumstanc- es, delivered at the right price.\"1 With an estimated $700 billion dol- lars - 30% of medical expenditures - spent on wasted care, there are rising calls for a transformational shift.2 You are now asked to consider not just everything you can do for a patient, but also the benefits, harms, and costs associated with those choices. But where to start? We recommend that trainees integrate these tips for high-value care into their routine practice. 1 Use evidence-based resources that highlight value A great place to begin is the \"Six Things Medical Students and Train- ees Should Question,\" originally published in Academic Medicine and created by Choosing Wisely Cana- da. Recommendations range from avoiding tests or treatments that will not change a patient's clinical course to holding off on ordering tests solely based on what you as- sume your preceptor will want (see the full list in Table 1).3 Other ways to avoid low-value care include following the United States Choosing Wisely campaign, which has collected more than 500 specialty society recommendations. Likewise, the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are designed to assist providers with ordering the appropriate imaging tests (for a more extensive list see Table 2). 2 Express your clinical reasoning One driver of health care expendi- tures that is especially prevalent in academia is the pressure to demon- strate knowledge by recommending extensive testing. While these tests may rule out obscure diagnoses, they often do not change manage- ment. You can still demonstrate a mastery of your patients' care by expressing your thought process overtly. For instance, \"I considered secondary causes of the patient's severe hypertension but felt it was most reasonable to first treat her pain and restart her home medica- tions before pursuing a larger work- up. If the patient's blood pressure remains elevated and she is hypoka- lemic, we could consider testing for hyperaldosteronism.\" If you explain why you think a diagnosis is less likely and order tests accordingly, others will be encouraged to consid- er value in their own medical deci- sion making. 3 Hone your communication skills One of the most cited reasons for providing unnecessary care is the Dr. Lacy is assistant professor and associate clerkship director at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, as well as division director of high-value care for the division of hospital medicine. Dr. Goetz is assistant professor at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago. They met as 2015 Co- pello Fellows at the National Phy- sician Alliance. Both have been involved in numerous high-value care initiatives, curricular develop- ment, and medical education at their respective institutions.COMMENTARY Six Things Medical Students and Trainees Should Question 1. Don't suggest ordering the most invasive test or treatment before considering other less invasive options. 2. Don't suggest a test, treatment, or procedure that will not change the patient's clinical course. 3. Don't miss the opportunity to initiate conversations with patients about whether a test, treatment or procedure is necessary. 4. Don't hesitate to ask for clarification on tests, treatments, or procedures that you believe are unnecessary. 5. Don't suggest ordering tests or performing procedures for the sole purpose of gaining personal clinical experience. 6.Don't suggest ordering tests or treatments pre -emptively for the sole purpose of anticipating what your supervisor would want. Published with permission of Choosing Wisely CanadaTable 1time required to discuss treatment plans with patients - it's much faster to just order the test than to explain why it isn't needed. Re- search, however, shows that these cost conversations take 68 seconds on average.4 Costs of Care (see Table 2) has an excellent video series that highlights how effective commu- nication allows for shared decision making, which both promotes pa- tient engagement and helps avoid wasteful care. Physicians' first instincts are of- ten defensive when a patient asks for care we perceive as unnecessary. However, exploring what the patient hopes to gain from said test or treat- ment frequently reveals concern for a specific, missed diagnosis or complication. Addressing this un- derlying fear, rather than defending your ordering patterns, can create improved rapport and may serve to provide more reassurance than a test ever could.5 As a physician-in-training, try to observe others having these conver- sations and take every opportunity to practice. By focusing on this key skill set, you will increase your com- fort with in-depth discussions on the value of care. 4 Get involved in a project related to high-value care While you are developing your own practice patterns, you may be inspired to tackle areas of overuse and underuse at a more systemwide level. If your hospital does not have a committee for high-value care, per- haps a quality improvement leader can support your ideas to launch a project or participate in an ongoing initiative. Physicians-in-training have been identified as crucial to these projects' success - your front- line insight can highlight potential problems and the nuances of work- flow that are key to effective solu- tions.6 5 Embrace lifelong learning and reflection The process of becoming a physician and of practicing high-value care is not a sprint but a marathon. Multi- ple barriers to high-value care exist, and you may feel these pressures differently at various points in your career. These include malpractice concerns, addressing patient expec-tations, and the desire to take action \"just to be safe.\"6 Interestingly, fear of malpractice does not seem to dissipate in areas where tort reform has provided stronger provider protections.7 Practitioners may also inaccurate- ly assume a patient's desire for additional work-up or treatment.8 Furthermore, be aware of the role of \"commission bias\" by which a pro- vider regrets not doing something that could have helped a previous patient. This regret can prove to be a stronger motivator than the po-the-hospitalist.org | 11 | July 2019COMMENTARY High Value Care Resources Resource: What it offers: Choosing Wisely and Choosing Wisely CanadaHighlights low value care identified by various professional societies.

As a physician-in-training, you may feel that your decisions do not have a major impact on the health care system as a whole. However, the culture shift needed to \"bend the cost curve\" will come from the collective efforts of individuals like you. Practicing high-value care is not just a matter of ordering few- er tests - appropriate ordering of an expensive test that expedites a diagnosis may be more cost ef- fective and enhance the quality of care provided. Increasing your own awareness of both necessary and unnecessary practices is a ma- jor step toward realizing system change. Your efforts to resist and re- form the medical culture that prop- agates low-value care will encourage your colleagues to follow suit.References 1.

Rivaroxaban tied to higher GI bleeding than other NOACs Real-world studies have been limited By Doug Brunk MDedge News REPORTING FROM DDW 2019 / SAN DIEGO / Patients on rivaroxaban had significantly higher rates of GI bleeding, compared with those taking apixaban or dabigatran, results from a large pop- ulation-based study showed. \"This may be due to the fact that rivaroxaban is administered as a single daily dose as opposed to the other two non-vitamin K anticoagulants, which are given twice daily,\" lead study author Arnar B. Ingason said at the annual Digestive Dis- ease Week. \"This may lead to a greater variance in plasma drug concentration, making these pa- tients more susceptible to bleeding.\" Mr. Ingason, a medical student at the Universi- ty of Iceland, Reykjavik, said that, although sev- eral studies have compared warfarin with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), it remains unclear which NOAC has the most favorable GI profile. In an effort to improve the research in this area, he and his associates performed a nationwide, pop- ulation-based study during March 2014-January 2018 to compare the GI bleeding risk of patients re- ceiving rivaroxaban to that of a combined pool of patients receiving either apixaban or dabigatran. They drew from the Icelandic Medicine Registry, which contains all outpatient drug prescriptions in the country. Next, the researchers linked the personal identification numbers of patients to the Landspitali University diagnoses registry, which includes more than 90% of all patients hospitalized for GI bleeding. They used 1:1 nearest neighbor propensity score for matching and Ka- plan-Meier survival estimates and Cox regression to compare rates of GI bleeding. The study outcome of interest was any clinically relevant GI bleeding. Mr. Ingason reported that the baseline charac- teristics were similar between the rivaroxaban group and the apixaban/dabigatran group. They matched for several variables, including age, sex, Charlson score, the proportion being anticoagu- lant naive, moderate to severe renal disease, mod- erate to severe liver disease, any prior bleeding, and any prior thrombotic events. During the study period, 3,473 patients received rivaroxaban, 1,901 received apixaban, and 1,086 re- ceived dabigatran. After propensity score match- ing, the researchers compared 2,635 patients who received rivaroxaban with 2,365 patients who re- ceived either apixaban or dabigatran. They found that patients in the rivaroxaban group had sig- nificantly higher rates of GI bleeding, compared with in the apixaban/dabigatran group (1.2 and. 0.6 events per 100 patient-years, respectively). This yielded a hazard ratio of 2.02, \"which means that patients receiving rivaroxaban are twice as likely to get GI bleeding compared to patients on apixaban or dabigatran,\" Mr. Ingason said. When the researchers examined the entire unmatched cohort of patients, the rivaroxaban group also had significantly higher rates of GI bleeding, com- pared with the apixaban/dabigatran group (1.0 and 0.6 events per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.75). Mr. Ingason and his colleagues observed that patients in the rivaroxaban group had higher rates of GI bleeding, compared with the apixaban/ dabigatran group, during the entire follow-up pe- riod. At the end of year 4, the rivaroxaban group had a 4% cumulative event rate of GI bleeding, compared with 1.8% for the apixaban/dabigatran group, a highly significant difference at P = .0057). When a meeting attendee asked Mr. Ingason why patients taking apixaban or dabigatran were combined into one group, he said that it was done to increase the power of their study. \"Our theory was that rivaroxaban was different because it is administered as a single daily dose, while the oth- ers are given twice daily,\" he said. The researchers reported having no financial disclosures.Mr. Ingason July 2019 | 12 | The Hospitalist Accreditation Statement: The Society of Hospital Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians.

Before I knew it, I had passed my internal medicine boards and practiced hospital medicine at an academic medical center. One day last fall, I received notice from the American Board of Internal Medicine that it was time to recer- tify. I was surprised - had it already been 10 years? What did I have to do to maintain my certification? As I investigated what it would take to maintain certification, I discovered that the recertification process provided more flexibility, compared with original board cer- tification. I now had the option to recertify in internal medicine with a Focused Practice in Hospi- tal Medicine (FPHM). Beginning in 2014, ABIM offered hospitalists, or internists whose clinical practice is mainly in the inpatient setting, the option to recertify in internal med- icine, but with the designation that highlighted their clinical practice in the inpatient setting. The first step in recertification for me was deciding to recertify with the focus in hospital medicine or maintain the traditional inter- nal medicine certification. I talked with several colleagues who are also practicing hospitalists and weighed their reasons for opting for FPHM. Ultimately, my decision to pursue a recertification with a focus in hospi- tal medicine relied on three factors: First, my clinical practice since com- pleting residency was exclusively in the inpatient setting. Day in and day out, I care for patients who are acutely ill and require inpatient med- ical care. Second, I wanted my board certification to reflect what I consid- er to be my area of clinical expertise, which is inpatient adult medicine. Pursuing the FPHM would provide that recognition. Finally, I wanted to study and be tested on topics that I could utilize in my day-to-day prac- tice. Because I exclusively practiced hospital medicine since graduation, areas of clinical internal medicine that I did not frequently encounter in my daily practice became less ac- cessible in my knowledge base. The next step then was to enter the FPHM Maintenance of Certifica- tion (MOC) program. The ABIM requires two attesta- tions to verify that I met the re- quirements to be a hospitalist. First was a self-attestation confirming at least 3 years of unsupervised inpatient care practice experience, and meeting patient encounter thresholds in the inpatient setting. The second attestation was from a \"Senior Hospital Officer\" confirming the information in the self-attesta- tion was accurate. Once entered into the program with an unrestricted medical license to practice, I had to complete the remaining requirements of earning MOC points, and passing a knowl- edge-based assessment. I had to ac- cumulate 100 MOC points in the past 5 years, which I did through par- ticipating in QI projects, recording CME credits, studying for the exam, and even taking the exam. I tracked my point totals through the ABIM Physician Portal, which updated my tally automatically for activities that counted toward MOC, such as at- tending SHM's Annual Conference. The final component was to pass the knowledge assessment, the dreaded exam. In 2018, I had the op- tion to take the 10-year FPHM exam or do a general internal medicine Knowledge Check-In. Beginning in 2020, candidates will be able to sit for either the 10-year FPHM exam or begin the Hospital Medicine Knowl- edge Check-In pathway. I had al- ready decided to pursue FPHM and began to prepare to sit for an exam. I scheduled my exam through the ABIM portal at a local testing center. The full-day exam consists of four sections broken up by lunch and section breaks. Specifically, the 220 single best answer, multiple-choice exam covered diagnosis, testing, treatment decisions, epidemiology, and basic science content through patient scenarios that reflected the scope of practice of a hospitalist. The ABIM provided an exam blueprint that detailed the specific clinical topics and the likelihood that a question pertaining to that topic would show up on the exam. Content was described as high, medium, or low importance and the number of questions related to the content was 75% for high importance, no more than 25% for medium importance, and no questions for low-importance content. In addition, content was dis- tributed in a way that was reflective of my clinical practice as a hospital- safety, and clinical reasoning. Beginning 6 months prior to my scheduled exam, I purchased two critical resources to guide my studying efforts: the SHM Spark Self-Assessment Tool and the Amer- ican College of Physicians Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Pro- gram to review subject matter con- tent and also do practice questions. The latest version of SHM's pro- gram, Spark Edition 2, provides updated questions and resources tai- lored to the hospital medicine exams. I appreciated the ability to answer questions online, as well as on my phone. Moreover, I was able to track which content areas were stronger or weaker for me, and focus attention on areas that needed more work. Im- portantly, the questions I answered using the Spark self-assessment tool closely aligned with the subject matter I encountered in the exam, as well as the clinical cases I encounter every day in my practice. While the day-long exam was chal- lenging, I was gratified to receive notice that I had successfully recer- tified in internal medicine with a Fo- cused Practice in Hospital Medicine!

A hospitalist's dilemma By Bibhusan Basnet, MD I had just received my sign-out for the day. My pager beeped, and I heard it overhead \"Code Blue Room X.\" Hospitalist physicians lead the code team in our hospital; I quickly headed to the room. A young man in his forties was found to be unconscious on the floor. One of the nurses had start- ed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as the patient was uncon- scious and had no palpable pulse. It was a long, drawn-out battle: CPR, cracking bones, shouting, lots of needles - an extreme roller coast- er -style situation. The patient had recently had a hip surgery and our suspicion was a massive pulmonary embolism. We ran the exhaustive code for more than an hour and then I started to debrief with my code team; discussed that treatment was getting futile and asked for opinions. Finally, I asked the team to stop and pronounced the patient dead. I felt terrible. Later that day I returned to my house, tossed my bag in the corner, and sympathized with myself - \"Hello Dr. B, It was a tough one.\" Stopping resuscitation was one of the toughest decisions I had ever made, and I wondered if I would be able to make such a decision the next day. What if I had carried on? I had led code teams during my resi- dency training and as an attending physician; but there was something different that day. This patient was a young man with no history of medical problems. Every physician knows how to initiate resuscitation for cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA); only a few know when to stop it. Did I miss this learning during my in- ternal medicine training? I checked my red pocket leaflet with advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algo- rithms, and it had no mention of it. I searched Google Scholar, PubMed, and UpToDate and surprisingly, I found no predetermined rule but only a few recommendations on when CPR should be stopped. The American Heart Association is clear that the decision to terminate resus- citative efforts rests with the treat- ing physician in the hospital. In my experience, the length of time to continue a code can vary widely and is mostly dependent on the physician running the code. I have seen it last 15 minutes (which is reasonable) and I have seen it last for 50 minutes when the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. And if perhaps the patient regains a pulse temporarily, only to lose it again, we restart the clock. One needs to take into account various factors including time to CPR, time to defibrillation, comorbid disease, prearrest state, and initial arrest rhythm in making these decisions. It's well understood that none of these factors alone or in combi- nation is clearly predictive of out- come.1 Some selected patients potentially have good outcomes with prolonged, aggressive resuscitation. So when should we stop, and when should we continue resuscitation? This is always challenging. Physicians hate to stop CPR even when they know it's time. We are guided by the Hippocratic Oath to save lives. Sometimes, even if we want to stop, we tend to continue to avoid being criticized for stopping; we are sys- tematically biased against stopping CPR. We routinely run long codes, in part because we are not sure which patients we can bring back. A 2012 Lancet study highlighted that the median duration of resus- citation was 12 minutes for patients achieving the return of spontaneous circulation and 20 minutes for non- survivors.2 The ethical guidelines is- sued by AHA in 2018 highlight that, in the absence of mitigating factors, prolonged resuscitative efforts for adults and children are unlikely to be successful and can be discontin- ued if there is no return of sponta- neous circulation at any time during 30 minutes of cumulative ACLS. If the return of spontaneous circula- tion of any duration occurs at any time, however, it may be appropriate to consider extending the resuscita- tive effort.3 I believe a careful balance of the patient's prognosis for both length of life and quality of life will deter- mine whether continued CPR is ap- propriate. The responsible clinician should stop the resuscitative effort when he or she determines with a high degree of certainty that the arrest victim will not respond to further efforts. But what will help me guide my decisions next time if I ever come across this situation again? I discussed my dilemma with one of our intensivist physicians; he expressed that in a similar scenario he would ask for opinions from oth- er members of the code team. The role of good communication among code team members is necessary to exchange relevant knowledge in real time in a collaborative, nonhierar- chical environment. The code team can provide the team leader with quick, accurate information about the patient's clinical history that is critical to good decision making. Family support is also an essential part of any resuscitation. Health care providers need to offer the opportunity to be present to family members during the resuscitation attempts whenever possible. One team member should be assigned to the family to answer questions, clarify information, and offer com- fort, but physicians should not be asking family members to decide to stop the code. It is important to note that the decision should be made by the team leader and not the patient's family members. Regardless of the age or condition of the patient, the loss of a loved one is difficult to deal with, even if expected. The issue be- comes more difficult with changes in legal, cultural, or personal per- spectives. The AHA in 2018 stated that the treating physician is expected to un- derstand the patient and the arrest features, and the system factors that have prognostic importance for re- suscitation.3 For clinicians who work in critical care settings, the frame- work presented by AHA is intuitive. As a code leader, I can always give more epinephrine, try a clot-busting drug, or deliver another shock. Sit- uations vary greatly during a code, and the amount of time spent resus- citating a patient before terminating efforts is not set in stone. In many cases, it is a judgment call. The pro- cess of CPR is almost as dishearten- ing as its bleak outcomes. In-hospital CPAs are inevitably gruesome. Each day as an attend- ing physician, we are faced with difficult decisions, but experienc- ing these incredibly difficult and life-changing events can make for good learning. A CPA situation in action is very difficult for all con- cerned, particularly when there is almost no chance of success. But an unsuccessful or aborted resus- citation is also a huge loss for both the family and the code team. One of the critical functions of the code Dr. Basnet is a hospitalist physi- cian in the department of internal medicine at Eastern New Mexico Medical Center, Roswell. team leader is to review the events of a code and exercise judgment while evaluating the length of a code. This can be an intense and emotional experience, but with these principles in mind, we can feel reassured that we are making the best decision possible, for the pa- tient, the family, and our team.

By Jacob G. Imber, MD; Sarah J. Burns, MD; Krystal Chan, MD Brief overview Management of gram-negative (GN) bacteremia remains a challenging clinical situation for inpa- tient providers. With the push for high-value care and reductions in length of stay, recent literature has focused on reviewing current practices and attempting to standardize care. Despite this, no overarching guidelines exist to direct practice and clinicians are left to make decisions based on prior experience and expert opinion. Three key clinical questions exist when caring for a hospi- talized patient with GN bacteremia: Should blood cultures be repeated? When is transition to oral antibiotics appropriate? And for what duration should antibiotics be given? Overview of the data When considering repeating blood cultures, it is im- portant to understand that current literature does not support the practice for all GN bacteremias. Canzoneri et al. retrospectively studied GN bacteremia and found that it took 17 repeat blood cultures being drawn to yield 1 positive result, which suggests that they are not necessary in all cases.1 Furthermore, repeat blood cultures in- crease cost of hospitalization, length of stay, and inconvenience to patients.2 However, Mushtaq et al. noted that repeating blood cultures can provide valuable information to confirm the response to treatment in patients with endovascular infection. Furthermore, they found that repeated blood cultures are also rea- sonable when the following scenarios are sus- pected: endocarditis central line-associated infection, concern for multidrug resistant GN bacilli, and ongoing evidence of sepsis or patient decompensation.3 Consideration of a transition from intrave- nous to oral antibiotics is a key decision point in the care of GN bacteremia. Without guidelines, clinicians are left to evaluate patients on a case- by-case basis.4 Studies have suggested that the transition should be guided by the condition of the patient, the type of infection, and the cul- ture-derived sensitivities.5 Additionally, bioavail- ability of antibiotics (see Table 1) is an important consideration and a recent examination of oral antibiotic failure rates demonstrated that lower bioavailability antibiotics have an increased risk of failure (2% vs. 16%).6 In their study, Kutob et al. highlighted the im- portance of choosing not only an antibiotic of high bioavailability, but also an antibiotic dose which will support a high concentration of the antibiotic in the bloodstream.6 For example, they identify ciprofloxacin as a moderate bioavail- ability medication, but note that most cases they examined utilized 500 mg b.i.d., where the con- centration-dependent killing and dose-dependent bioavailability would advocate for the use of 750 mg b.i.d. or 500 mg every 8 hours. The heterogeneity of GN bloodstream infections also creates difficulty in standardization of care. The literature suggests that infection source plays a significant role in the type of GN bacteria isolat- ed.6,7 The best data for the transition to oral anti- biotics exists with urologic sources and it remains unclear whether bacteria from other sources have higher risks of oral antibiotic failure.8 One recent study of 66 patients examined bac- teremia in the setting of cholangitis and found that, once patients had stabilized, a switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics was noninferior, but randomized, prospective trials have not been per- formed. Notably, patients were transitioned to orals only after they were found to have a fluoroquino- lone-sensitive infection, allowing the study authors to use higher-bioavailability agents for the transi- tion to orals.9 Multiple studies have highlighted the unique care required for certain infections, such as pseudomonal infections, which most experts agree requires a more conservative approach.5,6 Fluoroquinolones are the bedrock of therapy for GN bacteremia because of historic in vivo experience and in vitro findings about bioavail- ability and dose-dependent killing, but they are also the antibiotic class associated with the highest hospitalization rates for antibiotic-asso- ciated adverse events.8 A recent noninferiority trial comparing the use of beta-lactams with fluoroquinolones found that beta-lactams were noninferior, though the study was flawed by the limited number of beta-lactam-using patients identified.8 It is clear that more investigation is needed before recommendations can be made re- garding ideal oral antibiotics for GN bacteremia.The transition to oral is reasonable given the following criteria: the patient has improved on intravenous antibiotics and source control has been achieved; the culture data have demonstrat- ed sensitivity to the oral antibiotic of choice, with special care given to higher-risk bacteria such as Pseudomonas; the patient is able to take the oral antibiotic; and the oral antibiotic of choice has the highest bioavailability possible and is given at an appropriate dose to reach its highest killing and bioavailability concentrations.7 After evaluating the appropriateness of transi- tion to oral antibiotics, the final decision is about duration of antibiotic therapy. Current Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines are based on expert opinion and recommend 7-14 days of therapy. As with many common infections, recent studies have focused on evaluating reduction in antibiotic durations. Chotiprasitsakul et al. demonstrated no difference in mortality or morbidity in 385 propensity-matched pairs with treatment of En- terobacteriaceae bacteremia for 8 versus 15 days.10 A mixed meta-analysis performed in 2011 evalu- ated 24 randomized, controlled trials and found shorter durations (5-7 days) had similar outcomes to prolonged durations (7-21 days).11 Recently, Ya- hav et al. performed a randomized control trial comparing 7- and 14-day regimens for uncompli- cated GN bacteremia and found a 7-day course to be noninferior if patients were clinically stable by day 5 and had source control.12 It should be noted that not all studies have found that reduced durations are without harm. Nelson et al. performed a retrospective cohort analysis and found that reduced durations of antibiotics (7-10 days) increased mortality and recurrent infection when compared with a longer course (greater than 10 days).13 These contrary findings highlight the need for provider discre- tion in selecting a course of antibiotics as well as the need for further studies about optimal dura- tion of antibiotics. Application of the data Returning to our case, on day 3, the patient's fe- ver had resolved and leukocytosis improved.

Case A 42-year-old woman with uncon- trolled diabetes presents to the ED with fever, chills, dysuria, and flank pain for 3 days. On exam, she is febrile and tachycardic. Lab results show leu- kocytosis and urinalysis is consistent with infection. CT scan shows acute pyelonephritis without complication. She is admitted to the hospital and started on ceftriaxone 2 g/24 hrs. On hospital day 2, her blood cultures show gram-negative bacteria.the-hospitalist.org | 15 | July 2019TABLE 1.

Tissue penetration reflects the drug movement from the vascular to the interstitial and intracellular com- partments of a particular body site. Drugs passively diffuse through fenestrated capillaries into the interstitial compartment of most tissues. However, some tissue sites (eg, the brain and pros- tate) contain nonfenestrated capillaries and/or active transport pumps that prevent entry or remove the drug. Tissue concentrations are methodologically dependent on the various techniques used in their quantification, and, in some body sites, are influenced by the presence or absence of inflammation (eg, brain tissue). Thus, the values presented here are best approximations. repeat blood cultures were not performed. On day 4 initial blood cultures showed pan-sensitive Esch- erichia coli. The patient was transi- tioned to 750 mg oral ciprofloxacin b.i.d. to complete a 10-day course from first dose of ceftriaxone and was discharged from the hospital. Bottom line Management of GN bacteremia re- quires individualized care based on clinical presentation, but the data presented above can be used as broad guidelines to help reduce excess blood cultures, avoid prolonged use of intra- venous antibiotics, and limit the dura- tion of antibiotic exposure.

Specifically the presence of sinus rhythm occurred in 94% in the early cardioversion group and in 91% of the delayed one (95% confidence interval, -8.2 to 2.2; P = .005 for noninferiority). Both groups received anticoagulation per current standards. This was a noninferiority, open-la-bel study that was not powered enough to study harm between the two strategies. It showed a 30% incidence of recurrence of AFib regardless of study assignment. Hos- pitalists should not feel pressured to initiate early cardioversion for new-onset AFib. Rate control, anti- coagulation (if ap- plicable), prompt follow-up, and early discharge (even from the ED) seem to be a safe and practical approach. BOTTOM LINE: In patients presenting with symp- tomatic recent-onset AFib, delayed in a wait-and-see approach was noninferior to early cardioversion in achieving sinus rhythm at 4 weeks' follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resis- tant more difficult to treat than is drug-susceptible TB. The 2011 World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB, based on very-low-quality and conditional evidence, consists of an intensive treatment phase of 8 months and total treatment duration of 20 months. Although cohort studies have shown promising cure rates among patients with multidrug-re- sistant TB who received existing drugs in regimens shorter than that recommended by the WHO, data from phase 3 randomized trials were lacking. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized phase 3 noninferior trial. SETTING: Multisite, international; countries were selected based on disease burden of TB, multidrug-resistant TB, and TB-HIV coinfection (Ethiopia, Mongolia, South Africa, Vietnam). SYNOPSIS: 424 patients were randomized to the short and long medication regimen groups with 369 included in the modified in- tention-to-treat analysis and 310 included in the final per protocol efficacy analysis. The short regimen included IV moxifloxacin, clofazi- mine, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide by kanamycin, isoni- azid, and prothionamide in the first 16 weeks, compared with 8 months of intense treatment and total 20 months of treatment in the long regimen. At 132 weeks after random- ization, cultures were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in more than 78 % patients in both long- and short-regimen group. Unfavorable bacteriologic outcome (10.6%), cardiac conduction defects (9.9%), and hepa- tobiliary problems (8.9%) were more common in the short-regimen group whereas patients in long-regimen group were lost to follow-up more frequently (2.4%) and had more met- abolic disorders (7.1%). More deaths were reported in the short-regimen group, especially in those with HIV coinfections (17.5%). Although the results of this trial are encourag- ing, further studies will be needed to find a short, simple regimen for multidrug- resistant tuberculosis with improved safety outcomes.

This is primarily because of the ability to avoid central line- associated blood- stream infections (CLABSI) since these catheters terminate in the peripheral veins and cannot be reported as such. Ad- ditionally, they are potentially able to dwell longer than are traditional peripheral intravenous catheters. However, insufficient data exist to accurately describe the rate of com- plications in these catheters, as prior studies are based on single-center experiences. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter pro- spective cohort study. SETTING: Hospital medicine ward or medical ICU.1. Early or delayed cardioversion in recent-onset atrial fibrillation 2.

Aspirin and warfarin together leads to increased bleeding without reducing thrombotic eventsIN THIS ISSUE Dr. Abdo Dr. Kamath Dr. Marcantonio the-hospitalist.org | 19 | July 2019SYNOPSIS: With use of a large data- base of adult patients from a quality initiative supported by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Blue Care Network, this study identified 1,161 patients who had midline cathe- ters placed and showed a 10.3% com- plication of which 66.7% were minor (dislodgment, leaking, infiltra- tion, or superficial thrombophlebi- tis) rather complications (occlusion, symptomatic upper-ex- tremity deep venous thrombosis, or bloodstream infection). However, a similar rate of removal of the cathe- ters was reported for major and mi- nor complications (53.8% vs. 52.5%; P = .90). Across sites, there was substantial variation in utilization rates (0.97%-12.92%; P less than .001), dwell time and indication for use, and complication rates (3.4%-16.7%; P = .07). The article does not provide guidance on when and how midline catheters should be used in order to minimize risk; nor does it include a comparison with traditional periph- eral intravenous catheters or with PICC lines. Further studies are need- ed to guide indications and practices for catheter placement in order to minimize risk. Providers should con- tinue to carefully consider the risks and benefits of midline catheter placement in individual cases. BOTTOM LINE: Midline catheter placement more commonly leads to minor rather than major complica- tions, though patterns of use and outcomes vary substantially across sites. CITATION: Chopra V et al.

By Shree Menon, DO, MPH 4Reducing low-value preop care for cataract surgery patients CLINICAL QUESTION: Can a qual- ity improvement project decrease low-value, preoperative testing for cataract patients? BACKGROUND: Although multiple randomized, controlled trials have shown that routine preoperative testing prior to cataract surgery has low yield, most Medicare beneficia- ries continue to undergo this test- ing. The American Board of Internal Medicine started the Choosing Wisely campaign to help educate pa- tients and providers about a crisis of unnecessary testing and procedures. This prompted multiple centers to create quality improvement (QI) projects to decrease low-value care. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study of a health system quality improvement ini- tiative. SETTING: Two ac- ademic, safety-net hospitals in Los Angeles. SYNOPSIS: The intervention hos- pital's QI nurse underwent an extensive formal QI training program, followed by edu- cating all health care team members involved in preoperative care for cat- aract patients. New guidelines were created and circulated, with a stated goal of eliminating routine preoper- ative visits and testing. The control hospital continued their usual pre- operative care. Preoperative visits decreased from 93% to 24% in the interven- tion group and increased from 89% to 91% in the control group (between-group difference, 71%; 95% confidence interval, -80% to -62%). Chest x-rays, laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms also had a similar decrease in the intervention group. The intervention hospital lost $42,241 the first year because of training costs but 3-year projections estimated $67,241 in savings. The authors estimated $217,322 savings in 3 years from a societal perspective. Interestingly, the decrease in utiliza- tion would lead to financial loss in fee-for-service payment ($88,151 loss in 3 years). No causal relationship can be established since this was an obser- vational study. Several assumptions were made for the cost analysis. Re- sults are less generalizable since the study was at hospitals in a single city and health system. It is unclear which component of the QI initia- tive was most effective. BOTTOM LINE: A multidisciplinary, multicomponent initiative can be successful in decreasing low-value preoperative testing of patients un- dergoing cataract surgery. Although this results in cost savings overall and for capitated payment systems, it would actually cause revenue loss in fee-for-service systems.

By Danielle Richardson, MD, MPH 5Patients' perceptions and high hospital use CLINICAL QUESTION: What are patients' perspectives of factors as- sociated with the onset and continu- ation of high hospital use? BACKGROUND: A small proportion of patients accounts for a large pro- portion of hospital use and readmis- sions. As hospitals and hospitalists focus efforts to improve transitions of care, there is a paucity of data that incorporates patients' perspec- tives into the design of these programs. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative re- search study. SETTING: North- western Memorial Hospital, a single urban academic medical center in Chicago. SYNOPSIS: Eligible patients had two unplanned 30-day readmissions within the prior 12 months in addi- tion to one or more of the following: at least one readmission in the last 6 months; a referral from a patient's medical provider; or at least three observation visits. A research coordinator conducted one-on-one semistructured inter- views. Each interview was recorded, transcribed, and then coded using a team-based approach; 26 patients completed the interview process. From the analysis, four major themes emerged: Major medical problems were universal but high hospital use onset varied; partic- ipants noted that fluctuations in their course were often related to social, economic, and psychological stressors; onset and progression of episodes seemed uncontrollable and unpredictable; participants preferred to avoid hospitalization and sought care when attempts at self-management failed. The major limitation of this study was the small sample size located at one medical center, creating a data pool that is potentially not generalizable to other medical centers. These findings, however, are an important reminder to focus our interventions with patients' needs and perceptions in mind. BOTTOM LINE: Frequently hospi- talized patients have insights into factors contributing to their high hospital use. Engaging patients in this discussion can enable us to create sustainable patient-centered programs that avoid rehospitaliza- tion. per- ceptions of factors contributing to high hospital use.

BACKGROUND: Limited research suggests IV treatment of asymp- tomatic hypertension may be widespread and unhelpful. There is potential for unnecessary treatment to have adverse outcomes, such as hypotension. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective co- hort study. SETTING: A SYNOPSIS: Of 2,306 inpatients with asymptomatic hypertension, 11% were treated with IV medications to lower their blood pressure. Pa- tients with indications for stricter blood pressure control (such as stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, aortic dissection) were excluded from the study. Following the baseline period, an education inter- vention was employed that includ- ed presentations, handouts, and posters. A second phase of quality improvement intervention includ- ed adjustment of the electronic medical record blood pressure alert parameters from more than 160/90 to more than 180/90. After these interventions, a lower percentage of patients received IV blood pres- sure medications for asymptomatic hypertension without a significant change in the number of rapid re-sponse calls, ICU transfers, or code blues. Limitations include that this is a single-center study and it is un- clear if the performance improve- ment seen will be maintained over time. BOTTOM LINE: IV antihyper- tensive use for asymptomatic hy- pertension is com- mon despite lack of data to support its use, and re- duced use is possible using quality improvement interventions.

BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation of AFib (primarily pulmonary vein isolation) has been shown to result in better maintenance of sinus rhythm than medications. Small studies of QOL have shown mixed results. Larger trials were needed. STUDY DESIGN: Open-label ran- domized multisite clinical trial of catheter ablation (pulmonary vein isolation with additional ablation procedure at the treating physician discretion) versus standard rate and/or rhythm control medications (chosen by clinician discretion). Pa- tients were included for paroxysmal or persistent AFib and either age 65 years or older or age younger than 65 years with one additional stroke risk factor. Quality of life surveys - the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT) question- naire and the Mayo AF-Specific Symptom Inventory (MAFSI) - were completed at baseline, and at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. SETTING: 126 centers in 10 countries. SYNOPSIS: The study included 2,204 patients with median age of 68 years, diagnosed with AFib a median of 1.1 years prior, who were followed for a median of 48 months. The me- dian CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3.0. Self-reported AFib dropped from 86.0% to 21.1% in the ablation group and from 83.7% to 39.8% in the medication group at 12 months.

ED visits attributable to cannabis most commonly associated with inhaled use Observational study shows that at a single urban academic hospital, visits to the emergency department attributable at least in part to cannabis were more frequently associated with the inhaled form (90.7%) rather than the edible form (9.3%), though the latter accounted for more visits than expected and a higher proportion of acute psychiatric symptoms and intoxication.

MAF- SI symptom frequency score and symptom severity score also showed improvement in symptoms favoring ablation. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed that those with the most severe symptoms had the largest benefit from ablation. The primary limitation is the lack of patient blinding (may bias self-re- ported symptoms). While the CABANA trial efficacy study (published separately) showed that catheter ablation results in no significant difference in the com- bined outcome of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest, the CABANA QOL study, reviewed here, shows that ablation does result in improved QOL and reduced symptoms, compared with medical therapy. BOTTOM LINE: Catheter ablation of AFib can be done safely and success- fully at experienced centers. In pa- tients with AFib-related symptoms, ablation reduces symptoms and improves QOL somewhat more than medications do. The most severely symptomatic patients appear to ob- tain the most benefit.

By Adam Wachter, MD 8Aspirin and warfarin together leads to increased bleeding without reducing thrombotic events CLINICAL QUESTION: In patients taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation (AFib) or venous thromboembolism (VTE), how often is aspirin used without a clear indication, and what are the clinical outcomes for these patients? BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend against using aspirin in combination with warfarin for patients with AFib, unless the pa-tient has another indication for aspirin such as recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or a mechanical heart valve. These rec- ommendations are based on limited clinical trial data that showed an increased risk of adverse events with combination therapy without clinical benefit. Despite these rec- ommendations, recent studies have shown that aspirin use without a clinical indication remains common in patients taking warfarin for AFib. The prevalence of aspirin use with- out a clinical indi- cation in patients taking warfarin for VTE is less well studied. STUDY DESIGN: Registry-based cohort study. SETTING: Six anticoagulation clinics in Michigan. SYNOPSIS: Of the 6,539 patients included in the study, 2,453 patients (37.5%) were taking both warfarin and aspirin without an indication for aspirin therapy; 3,688 propen- sity score-matched patients (1,844 in each group) were compared to assess rates of bleeding and rates of observed thrombosis at 1 year in patients taking warfarin alone ver- sus warfarin plus aspirin. Patients treated with warfarin plus aspirin experienced more bleeding events than did patients on warfarin mono- therapy (95% confidence interval, 23.8%-28.3% vs. 95% CI, 18.3%-22.3%; P less than .001). Rates of observed thrombosis were similar between the two groups (95% CI, 1.6%-3.1% vs. 95% CI, 2.0%-3.6%; P = .40). This study demonstrates that aspirin use without a clinical indication remains common in patients taking warfarin for AFib or VTE, and that reducing inappropriate aspirin use in this patient population may help prevent adverse outcomes. BOTTOM LINE: Use of aspirin with- out a clinical indication in patients taking warfarin is common and is associated with an increased risk of bleeding without significant clinical benefit.

While TAVR shows prom- ise in the low-risk surgical patient, the authors do comment that one major limitation of this study is the short duration of follow-up, and caution that conclusions on the advantages and disadvantag- es of TAVR compared to surgery will depend on long-term follow- up.

Pradeesh Sivapalan, MD, of the University of Copenhagen, and coauthors reported the out- comes of a multicenter, controlled, open-label trial comparing eosinophil-guided and standard therapy with systemic corticosteroids in 318 pa- tients with COPD. They wrote that eosinophilic inflammation had been seen in 20%-40% of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Patients with higher eo- sinophilic blood counts were at increased risk of acute exacerbations but were also more likely to benefit from corticosteroid treatment. In the eosinophil-guided therapy arm of the study, 159 patients received 80 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone on day 1, then from the sec- ond day were treated with 37.5 mg of predniso- lone oral tablet daily - up to 4 days - only on days when their blood eosinophil count was at least 0.3 x 10 cells/L. In the control arm, 159 patients also received 80 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone on day 1, followed by 37.5 mg of prednisolone tablets daily for 4 days. After 14 days, there were no significant differ- ences between the two groups for mean days alive and out of hospital. There were 12 more cases of readmission with COPD, including three fatalities, in the eosino- phil-guided group within the first month. How- ever the authors said these differences were not statistically significant, but \"because the study was not powered to detect differences in this absolute risk range, we cannot rule out that this was an actual harm effect from the intervention- al strategy.\" The eosinophil-guided therapy group did show more than a 50% reduction in the median dura- tion of systemic corticosteroid therapy, which was 2 days in the eosinophil-guided group, com- pared with 5 days in the control group ( P less than .0001), and the differences between the two groups remained significant at days 30 and 90.July 2019 | 22 | The HospitalistHM19 REVIEW HM19: One chapter's experience By Amith Skandhan, MD, SFHM The Society of Hospital Medi- cine is an organization vest- ed in improving the quality of inpatient medicine by empowering its members with ed- ucation and providing venues for professional development including networking, advocacy, and leader- ship advancement. Every year, SHM holds a national conference which is a focused meeting point for over 5,000 hospitalists. SHM hosts more than 50 local chapters nationwide to increase networking, education, and collabo- ration within the hospital medicine community. The Wiregrass chapter of SHM is based in the southeast corner of Alabama, covering the counties of lower Alabama and the panhandle of Florida. This year we were recognized as a platinum status chapter, which is the highest status, based on our work and par- ticipation to improve the quality of inpatient medicine. As part of winning the platinum ribbon, we were awarded three com- plimentary registration scholarships to the SHM Annual Conference in 2019. The chapter leadership met and selected three individuals who have been involved with the chap- ter actively but have never had an opportunity to experience SHM's Annual Conference. We selected a first-year resident, Avani Parrekh, a hospital Madison Rivenbark, NP; and a fourth-year medical student who is about to start his internal medicine residency, William Bancroft, MS IV . After the meeting we interviewed them to better understand their ex- perience. Below are their thoughts.Avani Parekh, MD First year, Internal Medicine Residency Southeast Health Medical Center Dothan, Ala. I am so thankful for the opportu- nity that was given to me by the Wiregrass chapter by sponsoring my attendance at the 2019 SHM Annual Conference in Washington. This was my first SHM conference, and it was truly a rewarding experience. I thoroughly enjoyed attend- ing the lectures. They were very informative and engaging. Every presenter was so passionate and inspiring. Coming from an \"all-female class\" of PGY-1 at my program, I especially enjoyed the \"Fe(male) in Medicine\" talk, as well as Quick Talks on women in medicine. The \"Updates in Hospital Medicine\" session on various topics such as heart failure, pneumonia, and sepsis was outstanding. I was excited to apply the knowledge I gained from this event into my pa- tient care. Overall, it was a well-organized and up-to-date event. I am looking forward to attending more SHM conferences in the future. Madison Rivenbark, NP Department of Hospital Medicine Southeast Health Medical Center Dothan, Ala. I was extremely fortunate to be se- lected to receive a scholarship that covered the conference fee for the 2019 SHM Annual Conference. This was my first SHM conference, and it was quite the learning experience. I enjoyed each educational session that I attended. I felt like I was able to bring something home with me that I can incorporate into my prac- tice to better care for the patients that I see each day. As mentioned above, I learned from each ses- sion, but my personal favorite was the \"Up- dates in Hospital Medicine\" ses- sion. I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of the two speakers. The information provided was presented so that it engaged each attendee. Not only did I learn a wealth of valuable information that will help me in my career, I gained affirma- tion concerning my future educa- tional endeavors. I was inspired to pursue a higher level of learning regarding my career. I witnessed this awesome organization that is filled with encouraging and motivating people, and I realized I wanted to be more involved on a local level, and maybe one day, on a larger level. In addition, this con- ference inspired me to continue to be a lifetime learner and to always crave more knowledge. I am blessed to be a part of hospital medicine. I look forward to the future of this specialty. William Bancroft, MS IV Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine Dothan, Ala. I was honored to have been chosen by the Wiregrass chapter as the medical student representative for the SHM Annual Conference. I have been serving in the local chapter during both my 3rd and 4th years in different roles, from helping as a student liaison for our medical students to executive planning coor- dinator for events. It was a surprise when I got asked by the chapter to be their student representative, but one that I was very excited to accept. This was my first medical con- ference. I had heard about what different conferences were like from many of my attendings, so I had some expectations, but this experience was so much better. I enjoyed meeting and networking with people. I also found myself eagerly waiting to get to the next lecture because I was getting an op- portunity to hear about different case studies, new research outcomes, and new stan- dards of care. It was a real treat to learn about all the new changes to treatment, but even more encouraging to know that most of it was just rein- forcing everything my attendings have been teaching us as medical students. I enjoyed my time at the SHM Annual Conference so much that I emailed all my new coresi- dents and encouraged them to join the Society.

Apodaca, DNP , FHM As an academic nurse practitioner hospitalist with faculty and leadership roles, I found that HM19 had many important and helpful topics that apply directly to my practice. The \"Onboarding Best Practices\" session provid- ed specific examples and tips for clinical ramp up, enculturation, and orienting staff to an academic career. As a result of this talk, I began the process of establishing a formal enculturation activity for new hires that includes a panel of senior ad-vanced practice provider (APP) hospitalists to give career path advice. The \" Adaptive Leadership for Hospitalists\" workshop provid- ed the opportunity to practice emotional intelligence and effective communication in managing routine and difficult leadership interactions. The \"Practice Models/Models of Care for Optimal In- tegration of NPs and PAs\" presentation provided insight into variable team structures at other in- stitutions that could be considered for improved efficiency in my group. The \" Academic NP/PA \" session provided ideas for how to apply for facul- ty positions in academic institutions. It also gave APPs who have faculty appointment specific illustrations of using current educational, quality improvement, and research projects to promote.

Sepsis costs U.S. health care over $27 billion dollars each year. Because of the wide range of etiologies and variation in presentation and in- tensity, it is a challenge to establish homogeneous evidence-based guide- lines.1 The definition of sepsis based on the \"SIRS\" criterion was developed initially in 1992, later revised as Sepsis-2 in 2001. The latest Sepsis-3 definition - \"life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection\" - was developed in 2016 by the Third Inter- national Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock. This new- est definition has renounced the SIRS criterion and adopted the Se- quential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Treatment guidelines in sepsis were developed by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign starting with the Barcelona Declaration in 2002 and revised multiple times, with the development of 3-hour and 6-hour care bundles in 2012. The lat- est revision, in 2018, consolidated to a 1-hour bundle.2 Sepsis is a continuum of every severe infection, and with the com- bined efforts of the Society of Criti- cal Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, evidence-based guidelines have been developed over the past 2 decades, with the latest iteration in 2018. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services still uses Sepsis-2 for diag- nosis, and the 3-hr/6-hr bundle com-pliance (2016) for expected care.3 Session summary Dr. Kritek, of the division of pul- monary, critical care, and sleep medicine at the University of Washington, Seattle, presented to a room of over 1,000 enthusiastic hospitalists. She was able to cap- ture everyone's attention with a great presentation. As sepsis is one of the most common and se- rious conditions we encounter, most hospital- ists are fairly well versed in evidence-based practices, and Dr. Kritek was able to keep us engaged, describing in detail the evolving definition, pathophysi- ology, and screening procedures for sepsis. She also spoke about important studies and the latest evidence that will positively im- pact each hospitalist's practice in treating sepsis. Dr. Kritek explained clearly how the Surviving Sepsis Campaign developed a vital and nontradi- tional guideline that \"recommends health systems have a performance improvement program for sepsis including screening for high-risk pa- tients.\" In a 1-hour session, Dr. Kritek did a commendable job untangling this bewildering health care chal- lenge, and aligned each component to explain how to best use available resources and address sepsis in indi- vidual hospitals. She talked about the statistics and historical aspects involved in the definition of sepsis, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. With three good case scenarios, Dr. Kritek explained how it was difficult to accurately diagnose sepsis using the Sepsis-2/SIRS criterion, and how the SIRS criterion led to several false positives. This created a need for the new Sepsis-3 definition, which used delta SOFA score of 2 indicating \"or- gan failure.\" Key takeaways: Screening Sepsis-3 with delta SOFA score of at least 2 and Quick SOFA (qSOFA) of at least 2 was best at predicting in-hospital death, ICU admission, and long ICU stay in ED. qSOFA was not helpful in the admitted ICU population. An in- crease of at least 2 points in SOFA score within 24 hours of admission to the ICU was the best predictor of in-hospital mortality and long ICU stays. SIRS has high sensitivity and low specificity. The Early Warning Score has accuracy similar to qSO- FA. Understanding that there is no perfect answer regarding screen- ing, but having a process is vital for each organization. This ap- proach led to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guideline: \"Recommend health systems have a perfor- mance improvement program for sepsis including screening for high-risk patients.\" Key takeaways: Treatment Meta-analysis showed that spe- cifically goal-di- rected treatment (specifically, central venous pressure 8-12 mm Hg, central venous oxygen satu- ration greater than 70%, packed red blood cell inotropes used) did not show any improvement in 90-day mortality, and actually generated worse outcomes, in- cluding cirrhosis, as well as high- er costs of care. Antibiotics: Though part of the 3-hour bundle, antibiotics are recommended to be administered within 1 hour. Intravenous fluids: Patients with sepsis-induced saline and lactated ringer are preferred. Lactated ringer has the advantage over normal saline, with a reduced incidence of major adverse kidney events. Importance of bundle compliance: N.Y. study showed use of protocols cut mortality from 30.2% to 25.4%. Refractory septic shock Adding hydrocortisone and flud- rocortisone improved mortality at 28 days, helped patients get off va- sopressors sooner, and ultimately resulted in less organ failure, but no difference in 90-day mortality. A study of vitamin C use in septic patients needs further studies to validate, as it included only 47 pa- tients. Early renal replacement therapy showed no difference in mortality or length of stay. Dr. Kritek's presentation made a pos- itive impact by helping to explain the reasoning behind the estab- lished and evolving best practices and guidelines for care of patients with sepsis and septic shock. Her approach will help hospitalists provide cost-effective care, by un- derstanding which expensive inter- ventions and practices do not make a difference in patient care.

A 25-year-old pa- tient with a history of injection heroin use is in your care. He is admitted for treatment of endocarditis and will remain in the hospital for intravenous antibiotics for several weeks. Over the first few days of hospitalization, he frequently asks for pain medicine, stating that he is in severe pain and withdrawal, with opioid cravings. On day 3, he leaves the hospital against medical advice. Af- ter 2 weeks, he presents to the ED in septic shock and spends several weeks in the ICU. Or, alterna- tively, he is found down in the community and pronounced dead from a heroin overdose. These cases occur all too often, and hospitalists across the nation are actively building knowledge and programs to improve care for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). It is evident that opioid misuse is the public health crisis of our time. In 2017, over 70,000 patients died from an overdose, and over 2 million patients in the United States have a diagnosis of OUD.1,2 Many of these patients interact with the hospital at some point during the course of their illness for management of over- dose, withdrawal, and other complications of OUD, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and skin and soft tissue infections. Moreover, just 20% of the 580,000 patients hospitalized with OUD in 2015 presented as a direct sequelae of the disease.3 Pa- tients with OUD are often admitted for unrelated reasons, but their addiction goes unaddressed. Opioid use disorder, like many of the other conditions we see, is a chronic relapsing remitting medical disease and a risk factor for premature mortality. When a patient with diabetes is ad- mitted with cellulitis, we might check a hemo- globin A1c, provide diabetic counseling, and offer evidence-based diabetes treatment, including medications like insulin. We rarely build similar systems of care within the walls of our hospitals to treat OUD like we do for diabetes or other commonly encountered diseases like heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We should be intentional about separating prevention from treatment. Significant work has gone into reducing the availability of prescription opioids and increasing utilization of prescription drug monitoring programs. As a result, the av- erage morphine milligram equivalent per opioid prescription has decreased since 2010.4 An unin- tended consequence of restricting legal opioids is potentially pushing patients with opioid addic- tion toward heroin and fentanyl. Limiting opioid prescriptions alone will decrease opioid overdose mortality by only 5% through 2025.5 Thus, treat- ment of OUD is critical and something that hos- pitalists should be trained and engaged in. Food and Drug Administration-approved OUD treatment includes buprenorphine, methadone, and extended-release naltrexone. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that treats withdrawal and cravings. Buprenorphine started in the hos- pital reduces mortality, increases time spent in outpatient treatment after discharge, and reduces opioid-related 30-day readmissions by over 50%.6-8 The number needed to treat with buprenorphine to prevent return to illicit opioid use is two.9 While physicians require an 8-hour \"x-waiver\" training (physician assistants and nurse practitioners require a 24-hour training) to prescribe buprenor- phine for the outpatient treatment of OUD, such certification is not required to order the medica- tion as part of an acute hospitalization. Hospitalization represents a reachable moment and unique opportunity to start treatment for OUD. Patients are away from triggering environ- ments and surrounded by supportive staff. Un- fortunately, up to 30% of these patients leave the hospital against medical advice because of inad- equately treated withdrawal, unaddressed crav- ings, and fear of mistreatment.10 Buprenorphine therapy may help tackle the physiological piece of hospital-based treatment, but we also must work on shifting the culture of our institutions. Importantly, OUD is a medical diagnosis. These patients must receive the same dignity, autonomy, and meaningful care afforded to patients with other medical diagnoses. Patients with OUD are not \"addicts,\" \"abusers,\" or \"frequent fliers.\" Hospitalists have a clear and compelling role in treating OUD. The National Academy of Medicine recently held a workshop where they compared similarities of the HIV crisis with today's opioid epidemic. The Academy advocated for the devel- opment of hospital-based protocols that empower physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practi- tioners to integrate the treatment of OUD into their practice.11 Some in our field may feel that treating underlying addiction is a role for behavioral health practitioners. This is akin to having said that HIV specialists should be the only providers to treat patients with HIV during its peak. There are simply not enough psychiatrists or addiction medicine specialists to treat all of the patients who need us during this time of national urgency. There are several examples of institutions that are laying the groundwork for this important work. The University of California, San Francisco; Oregon Health & Science University, Portland; the University of Colorado at Denver, Aurora; Rush Medical College, Boston; Boston Medical Center; the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York; and the University of Texas at Austin - to name a few. Offering OUD treatment in the hospital setting must be our new and only acceptable standard of care. What is next? We can start by screening patients for OUD at the time of admission. This can be accomplished by asking two questions: Does the patient misuse prescription or nonprescription opi- oids? And if so, does the patient become sick if they abruptly stop? If the patient says yes to both, steps should be taken to provide direct and purposeful care related to OUD. Hospitalists should become familiar with buprenorphine therapy and work to reduce stigma by using people-first language with patients, staff, and in medical documentation. As a society, we should balance our past focus on optimizing opioid prescribing with current efforts to bolster treatment. To that end, a group of SHM members applied to establish a Substance Use Disorder Special Interest Group, which was recent- ly approved by the SHM board of directors. Details on its rollout will be announced shortly. The inten- tion is that this group will serve as a resource to SHM membership and leadership As practitioners of hospital medicine, we may not have anticipated playing a direct role in treat- ing patients' underlying addiction. By empowering hospitalists and wisely using medical hospitaliza- tion as a time to treat OUD, we can all have an in- credible impact on our patients. Let's get to work. References 1. Katz J.
