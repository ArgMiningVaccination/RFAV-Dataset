Before you attend a COVID-19 vaccine clinic, it's important you [prepare for your COVID-19 vaccine](/newsroom/campaigns-projects/preparing-your-covid-19-vaccine) Current Eligibility As of August 10, 2023 Primary Series A primary series is the first couple of vaccine doses a person needs to develop a strong initial immune response against COVID-19. Most people need two doses to complete their primary series. You may need a three-dose primary series if you are immunocompromised (i.e. have a weakened immune system). It is recommended to wait at least eight weeks after a first dose to get a second dose. In some situations, and after discussing the risks and benefits with your health care provider or at a York Region Public Health clinic, appointments for a second dose of Pfizer or Moderna can be booked 28 days after a first dose (i.e. for certain people with a weakened immune system or unexpected travel for compassionate reasons). If you get COVID-19 before finishing your primary vaccine series, you must wait two months (56 days) between infection and vaccination before getting another COVID-19 vaccine. The minimum wait time after a COVID-19 infection for people who are immunocompromised is one to two months (28 to 56 days) after infection before getting another COVID-19 vaccine to finish their primary series. Six months to 11 years of age (paediatric dose) Children six months to 11 years of age are given a two-dose primary series of COVID-19 vaccine. A three-dose primary series is given to children who are immunocompromised. The second dose is usually given eight weeks after the first dose. 12 years of age and older Individuals 12 years of age and older are given aa two dose primary series of COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer vaccine is the preferred vaccine for everyone 12 to 29 years of age. There is no preferred product for people 30 years and older and Moderna or Pfizer vaccine may be given. Individuals who are immunocompromised (i.e., have a weakened immune system because of a disease or medication they are taking) Individuals with a weakened immune system who are six months of age and older should receive a three dose primary series of COVID-19 vaccine. A third dose is available for moderately- to severely-immunocompromised individuals, as identified by the [Ministry of Health](https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/vaccine/COVID-19_vaccine_administration.pdf). Doses in the primary series may be given at least 28 days apart but spreading the doses two months (56 days) apart is ideal. Moderna is the preferred vaccine for moderately to severely immunocompromised people aged 6 months and older. To receive a third dose as part of the primary series, eligible individuals must present a [completed form](/media/108831/download?attachment) or letter indicating their eligibility from their specialist or hospital program. Prescriptions for immunosuppressant medications identified by the [Ministry of Health](https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/vaccine/COVID-19_vaccine_administration.pdf) can also be presented. Booster Doses Booster doses are recommended for all people aged five and older to maintain their protection against the ongoing risk of COVID-19 infection. Consider delaying a COVID-19 booster dose until the fall of 2023. This will maximize protection against COVID-19 before the 2023/2024 Fall and Winter respiratory season. To get a booster, you must have received a complete primary series of COVID-19 vaccines. For most people, this means two doses of an approved vaccine. For individuals with a weakened immune system, it means three doses of an approved vaccine. Everyone eligible for a booster dose must wait six months after their previous dose or six months after a confirmed COVID-19 infection before receiving a booster dose. At a six-month interval, the vaccine response tends to be stronger and the protection against COVID-19 disease lasts longer. Select a COVID-19 Vaccine Clinic Walk-in Clinics Walk-in appointments for COVID-19 vaccines for individuals six months of age and older are available and will be accepted based on clinic capacity.

Vaccinated outside of Ontario If you received a vaccine not approved by Health Canada, you may need additional dose(s) to be considered fully vaccinated. If you have received one or two doses of a vaccine not approved by Health Canada, you should receive a single dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) to be fully vaccinated. If you have received three doses of a vaccine not approved by Health Canada, you may be considered fully vaccinated, depending on the type of vaccine. Find the vaccine you received in the [Appendix of Ontario's COVID-19 Guidance for Individuals Vaccinated outside of Ontario/Canada](https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/vaccine/COVID-19_guidance_for_individuals_vaccinated_outside_of_ontario.pdf) to determine if another dose of mRNA vaccine is recommended. If you have received: - one or two doses of a vaccine not approved by Health Canada and one dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, or - three doses of a vaccine not approved by Health Canada you are eligible for a booster dose of a Health Canada approved COVID-19 vaccine three months (84 days) after your last dose (18 years and older only). Visit a vaccine clinic as soon as you are eligible to receive your booster dose.

Frequently asked questions About the vaccine Are COVID-19 vaccines effective? Beginning about two weeks after the first dose, all COVID-19 vaccines currently approved are safe and effective at preventing COVID-19 infection, particularly serious illness to yourself and to other vulnerable populations. Vaccination helps the immune system protect against disease and is one of our most effective lines of defense as other measures are removed. It's important to get vaccinated and stay up to date. Up to date means a person has received all recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses, including any booster dose(s) when eligible. The Ministry of Health [COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance](https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/vaccine/COVID-19_vaccine_administration.pdf) document provides more information. How well is the vaccine tested? Is it safe? Only vaccines that are safe and effective for widespread use are approved by Health Canada for use in Canada. Vaccines are tightly regulated and closely monitored in Canada and each vaccine has been rigorously tested in a series of large-scale trials. While mild or moderate side effects are possible, they typically subside in a few days. These might include soreness at the injection site, body chills, feeling tired or feverish. Some symptoms can be part of the body's response to developing immunity. Side effects may be more common with the second dose. Serious side effects are rare. Some side effects can be similar to symptoms of COVID-19. If you have concerns about symptoms after immunization, please speak to your health care provider to determine if you need further assessment. Vaccines are continually monitored for safety and effectiveness at federal, provincial and local levels. Health care providers and the public also play a part in this, by reporting any uncommon side effects after a receiving a vaccine. How can the vaccine be developed so quickly? COVID-19 vaccines were developed faster than some other vaccines because of never-before seen levels of collaboration and funding invested around the world. Health Canada only approves vaccines that are safe and effective and meet all standards. Development of the COVID-19 vaccine is progressing quickly for many reasons, including: - Leveraging existing vaccine research programs - International collaboration among scientists, health professionals, researchers, industries and governments - Increased dedicated funding - Quick recruitment of participants for clinical trials - Rapid set-up and analysis of clinical trials to demonstrate vaccine effectiveness - Reduction of unnecessary time delays in the vaccine approval process Is mRNA technology new? Like all vaccines, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been rigorously tested for safety before being approved. mRNA technology has been studied for more than a decade. The \"m\" from mRNA means \"messenger\" which is exactly what the vaccine does - it sends a message to your cells to make antibodies to fight against the virus that causes COVID-19. It blocks the virus from attaching and getting into your body's cells. It cannot change your DNA and it cannot not give you COVID-19. What types of COVID-19 vaccines are approved for use in Canada? mRNA (e.g., Pfizer or Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines are recommended. However, if you are unable or prefer not to receive an mRNA vaccine, you are eligible to receive the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine as part of or all of your primary series or as a booster dose. Astra Zeneca, Medicago and Janssen vaccines are no longer available in Ontario. If you have any additional questions, please call Access York at [1-877-464-9675](tel:1-877-464-9675) between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday to Friday. Access York is closed on weekends and statutory holidays. Vaccines for children and youth Health Canada has approved COVID-19 vaccines for children six months of age and older. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to learn more about the benefits of vaccinating their children. More information is available in these resources and websites: [COVID-19 Vaccines for Children and Youth - Ministry of Health Fact Sheet (English)](https://files.ontario.ca/moh-covid-19-children-youth-vaccination-factsheet-en-2022-01-31.pdf) [COVID-19 Vaccines for Children and Youth - Ministry of Health Fact Sheet (French)](https://files.ontario.ca/moh-covid-19-children-youth-vaccination-factsheet-fr-2022-01-31.pdf) [Max the Vax](https://www.oacas.org/publications-and-campaigns/maxthevax/): COVID-19 Vaccine Information for Children and Caregivers While younger people are less likely to experience serious cases of COVID-19, not all kids will experience mild symptoms. Vaccination remains our strongest line of defense against infection and serious illness as other protective measures, such as mandatory masking, have been removed from most settings. Vaccination is a safe and effective way to provide additional protection for all children and youth, including those who have already had a COVID-19 infection. Getting vaccinated also provides further protection for all family members, especially those who are at risk for more severe illness. VaxFacts+Clinic is a physician-led consult services that supports community members and families to get accurate information about COVID-19 and other vaccines. Family physicians and other local healthcare providers are also a good source of information for families. You may also want to consult the fact sheet [Reduce the Pain of Vaccination in Kids and Teens \u2014 A Guide for Parents](https://caringforkids.cps.ca/uploads/handout_images/Pain-reduction-kids-and-teens.pdf). Will the vaccine still work on new COVID-19 emerging strains? Are the new strains more contagious? The Omicron variant (specifically BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants) are the current dominant variants circulating in our communities. Compared to previous strains, Omicron is much more contagious. Bivalent COVID-19 vaccines target the original SARS-CoV-2 virus from 2019 and the Omicron (BA.1 or BA.4/BA.5) variants and are now the preferred vaccine product for primary series and booster doses. There is no evidence that one bivalent vaccine is better than another. In the future new vaccines may become available offering additional protection against new strains. We are still learning about new COVID-19 strains. It is important we remain vigilant in our efforts to reduce spread and continue to follow all current public health measures. Can I choose which vaccine I get? Are some better than others? All vaccines approved by Health Canada are effective at preventing COVID-19 infection, serious illness, hospitalization and death Bivalent mRNA vaccines are now recommended all people aged 6 months and older for both primary series and booster vaccine doses. For individuals 18 years of age and older, if the vaccine product you received for your most recent COVID-19 vaccine dose is not available at your upcoming appointment (i.e. you received Pfizer but Moderna is available), it's recommended you receive the mRNA vaccine available at that time. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) considers both available mRNA vaccines to be interchangeable, if the same product is not readily available. All COVID-19 vaccines provide sustained, substantial protection approximately 14 days following the first dose. Making the decision to get vaccinated What are precautions for receiving the vaccine? If you experienced a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a COVID-19 vaccine, you should consult with your health care provider to help determine your options for your next dose. If you had a mild to moderate allergic reaction after your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, you are required to bring a letter from your health care provider indicating the vaccine can be administered. Please delay vaccination if you have a fever or have COVID-10 symptoms and are supposed to be isolating. If you have had COVID-19 and have completed your primary vaccine series, you must wait at least six months before you get a booster dose. Waiting for six months may provide even greater protection. If you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and get sick with COVID-19, you must wait two months before getting another COVID-19 vaccine. If you are immunocompromised, the minimum recommended wait time is one to two months. Individuals six months of age and older can receive a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as, or any time before or after, any other vaccines. There is no need to delay COVID-19 vaccination or to wait to receive any other vaccine. Is the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory? Are there restrictions for individuals who choose not to get vaccinated? The COVID-19 vaccine is not mandatory and effective March 1, 2022, the provincial government has lifted proof of vaccination requirements; however, some businesses and organizations may require proof of vaccination at their own discretion. Vaccination policies may also be mandated within certain workforce sectors. Speak to your employer about policies specific to your workplace. I don't feel I am at risk for serious illness or death from COVID-19. Why should I get vaccinated? Anyone can get COVID-19 and become very sick. Even without underlying health conditions or other risk factors, there is no way to know how seriously COVID-19 can impact you. COVID-19 can have serious, life-threatening complications and if you get sick, you could spread the disease to loved ones and others around you. Like all vaccines, people who are vaccinated gain protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick from exposure to the virus. Your choice to receive a vaccine can also help protect others unable to receive a vaccine themselves and those at risk for severe illness. Should I still get vaccinated if I previously had COVID-19? COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for people who have had COVID-19 in the past. The Province of Ontario, in alignment with NACI, continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccines be offered to individuals with previous COVID-19 infection with the suggested intervals below. If you have had COVID-19 and have completed your primary vaccine series, you must wait at least six months before you get a booster dose. Waiting for six months may provide even greater protection. If you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and get sick with COVID-19, you must wait two months before getting another COVID-19 vaccine. If you are immunocompromised, the minimum recommended wait time is one to two months. Can I contract COVID-19 from the vaccine? No. The approved vaccines and do not contain the virus. The vaccines cannot give you an infection or the disease (COVID-19). Should I get the vaccine if I am pregnant or trying to become pregnant or am breastfeeding? COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is effective in protection pregnant individuals from severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalization from COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 vaccination also protects the infant after birth from COVID-19 as protective antibodies are transferred to the fetus during pregnancy. COVID-19 vaccines may be offered at any stage of pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Pregnant and breastfeeding people should receive their eligible doses as soon as they are able to. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommends that all individuals who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or breastfeeding receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Read more in this helpful [information sheet](/media/89086/download?attachment). Precautions after vaccination Where/how do I report vaccine side effects? Serious side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are rare; however, if you are severely unwell or you develop any of the following adverse reactions within three days of receiving the vaccine, call 911 and seek medical attention right away: - Hives - Swelling of the face or mouth - Trouble breathing - Very pale colour and serious drowsiness - High fever (over 40\u00b0C) - Convulsions or seizures - Other serious symptoms IMPORTANT: Seek medical attention if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations following immunization (symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis). There have been rare reports of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart) following vaccination with an mRNA vaccine: - Cases were more commonly reported after the second dose - Symptom onset was typically within several days after vaccination - Cases were mainly adolescents and young adults, and more often males compared to females - Many cases experienced mild or temporary illness, responded well to rest and conservative treatment and symptoms improved quickly If you are concerned about any reactions you experience after receiving the vaccine, contact your health care provider. Can a COVID-19 Vaccine Impact My Mammogram Results? Yes. Speak to your health care provider to let them know you have already received the vaccine, or if you will soon be receiving a first or second dose. Vaccines of all types, including the COVID-19 vaccine, can cause temporary swelling of the lymph nodes as part of the normal immune response to the vaccine. This can happen after the first or second dose. This temporary swelling can cause your mammogram to appear abnormal even when you are ok. The [Canadian Society of Breast Imaging and Canadian Association of Radiologists'](https://car.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021_03_24_CSBI_CAR_Axillary-Adenopathy-Update.pdf) recommends scheduling screening exams prior to the first dose, or six weeks following either dose in average risk patients. Women who are overdue for screening due to pandemic delays or who are experiencing symptomatic breast concerns should proceed to mammography despite timing of vaccinations. Speak to your health care provider for specific advice for your personal health situation. Do I need another dose? Check to see if you are due for a COVID-19 booster dose using the provincial [Booster Dose Eligibility Tracker](https://www.ontario.ca/vaccine-eligibility/). Receiving the vaccine How should I prepare for my appointment? Speak to your health care provider if you have any questions or concerns about your health or getting the vaccine. Do not attend your appointment if you are not feeling well or have signs or symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough or sore throat. More information is also available on our [Preparing for Your COVID-19 Vaccine page](/newsroom/campaigns-projects/preparing-your-covid-19-vaccine). What do I need when I receive my vaccine? When attending your vaccine appointment, you should wear a short sleeve shirt to ensure your arm is accessible when receiving the vaccine. You will also need an ID showing your proof of age and your OHIP card if you have one. I don't drive anymore, how can I get to my vaccination appointment?
