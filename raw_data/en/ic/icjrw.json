Infectious diseases are of particular concern to universities due to the large number of students living, studying and working together in close quarters. Recent outbreaks have occurred on campuses across the United States. The requirements for the University of Cincinnati are based upon review of national and state recommendations and requirements from the: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American College Health Association (ACHA), Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and Ohio Revised Code. Policy Scope and General Requirements Scope of the UC policy: 1. Incoming degree-seeking undergraduate, graduate and professional students. (Note: Requirements for health professions students already exist and are customized to the particular school.) 2. All incoming international and ELS students. 3. Students in distance learning programs would not be included in these new requirements. 2 Required vaccines and health screening: 1. Measles, Mumps, Rubella - 2 doses 2. Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis - booster dose 3. Varicella (chickenpox) - 2 doses 4. Hepatitis B - 3 doses (must have started series) 5. Polio - childhood series 6. Brief tuberculosis screening questionnaire adapted from ACHA screening questionnaire. If \"YES\" on screening questionnaire, then proceed to tuberculosis testing (e.g. blood test or skin test). Strongly recommended (but not required) vaccines: 1. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine 2. Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine Recommended (but not required) vaccines: 1. Influenza 2. Hepatitis A 3. Human papilloma virus The required number of doses and schedules for each of the required vaccinations will be in accordance with current recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Serological proof of immunity, as an alternative to vaccination records, will also be accepted. On an annual basis, University Health Services, in consultation with the Cincinnati Health Department and UC Department of Family and Community Medicine, will review and update the above lists of vaccines required and recommended for UC students. These campus updates will be based on new recommendations from the CDC, American College Health Association (ACHA) and Ohio Department of Health (ODH). On an annual basis, University Health Services, Student Affairs and Enrollment Management will review the policy logistics and make updates as needed. Overview of Process Prior to admission, information about the immunization and health screening requirements will be made available to potential students through the UC Admissions recruitment media, Open House and campus websites. When a student confirms acceptance of admission to the University, as part of their new student checklist, the student will be reminded of the immunization and health screening requirements and be notified of the process to comply. 3 Submission of student data will be done electronically through a secure web portal. A detailed protocol will be developed in collaboration with key campus departments. The electronic immunization information system will review the data provided by the student. The system will communicate regularly with the student regarding any missing immunizations or other issues. In addition, the system will supply the University with necessary reports. International students: The current process for screening incoming international students for tuberculosis will be expanded to include all international students and modified to include these new immunization requirements. Consequences of Non-compliance Class registration: If a student is not compliant with the UC immunization requirements and tuberculosis screening/testing process, the student will not be permitted to register for classes for the subsequent term(s) (e.g. if non-compliant in Fall, then will not be able to register for Spring classes). Once a student has met the requirement, the student will be permitted to register. A protocol will be developed in collaboration with UC Enrollment Management and other key departments. Appeals process: A student may file an appeal regarding the policy and process. If the appeal is for an exemption from the requirements, please see the following section. Appeals will be submitted to University Health Services and decisions made by University Health Services will be final. Exemption Policy To best protect the health of the campus community as a whole, a high level of compliance with the vaccination requirements is required. Two types of exemptions to the vaccination requirements will be considered: 1. Medical exemption. If a student is unable to meet the immunization requirements for medical reasons, the student must complete an Exemption Application. A signed form from a medical provider will be required. 2. Religious exemption. If a student is unable to meet the immunization requirements due to religious beliefs, the student must complete an Exemption Application. A signed form from clergy will be required. Students with exemptions will be asked to sign a form stating they agree to leave campus and not attend classes during an outbreak on campus. 4 To protect the health of unvaccinated students during an outbreak, UHS will keep a list of students with exemptions and, after consulting with the local public health department, will inform the students of the need to leave the campus during an outbreak. Timeline for Implementation Phase 1: Fall Semester 2016 o Health professions students: must meet requirements per school; signed form from healthcare provider and data entered electronically. o UC community and potential applicants: (beginning Spring 2016) receive communications about upcoming requirements. Phase 2: Fall Semester 2017 o Incoming students at UC Clifton: must meet new campus requirements and follow new process. o Health professions students: must meet requirements per school; signed form from healthcare provider and data entered electronically. Phase 3: Fall Semester 2018 o Incoming students at all three UC campuses (Clifton, Blue Ash, Clermont): must meet new campus requirements and follow new process. o Health professions students: must meet requirements per school; signed form from healthcare provider and data entered electronically.
