As advocatesfor advanced inquiry and creativity, we greatly prizethe curious and exceptionally competent student. We value this moment to introduce students and others to the intellectual vision of the GraduateSchool and the programs and faculty that embodythat vision. The bulletin's offerings demonstrate thatgraduate schools are the intellectual nerve center ofthe modern university. Graduate schools makegroundbreaking discoveries, investigate ideas old andnew, and prepare the next generation of scholars,researchers, thinkers, and teachers. As a matter offact, New York University was a pioneer in graduate education. In 1866, New York Universitybecame the second university in the United States to offer an earned doctorate. In 1886, it for-mally opened a graduate division. Today, the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS)houses 45 programs that offer doctoral and master's degrees and enrolls 4,100 students annu-ally. The pioneering continues. As we chart the course of our Graduate School for a new century, we must fuse the strengths of today with a vision of tomorrow's possibilities. To achieve this fusion, GSAS calls on the abun-dant creative energies of New York City. Even more important, the Graduate School draws on theextraordinary New York University faculty to work with students to become intellectual leaders\u2014no matter what career they might eventually choose. Graduate education depends first and fore-most on an institution's faculty and students, on the brains that power the school. Buoyed by its city, rooted in its faculty, the Graduate School of Arts and Science shares this bulletin with those who seek a range of graduate degrees, a balance of disciplinary andinterdisciplinary work, and the core values of intellectual communities: rigorous inquiry, life-long discovery of ideas, and a commitment to the ethics of scholarship.

Wolfson, DirectorThe Graduate School of Arts and Science was founded in 1886 by HenryMitchell MacCracken, a professor ofphilosophy and logic and vice chancel-lor at New York University.MacCracken believed that universitiesshould respond to the needs of moder-nity by giving unprecedented priorityto advanced research and professionaltraining. Guided by MacCracken 's vision, New York University becamethe second university in America toaward a Ph.D. on the basis of academicperformance and examination. In addition to the emphasis on excellence in research, MacCrackenrecognized the urban environment asboth source and inspiration for aca- demic life. He believed that theUniversity 's best interests lay in its interactions with the city. By the early1900s, the Graduate School had intro-duced courses concerned with majorglobal issues, and the curriculumreflected movement toward progressivevalues. MacCracken 's new vision of gradu- ate training attracted ever-growingnumbers of young women and men todoctoral programs. The first femalegraduate students entered theUniversity in 1888. Today, womenconstitute over half of the 4,100 mas-ter's and Ph.D. graduate studentsenrolled in 45 departments, institutes, programs, and interdisciplinaryresearch areas. Mirroring the cultural diversity of New York City, the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science is an urban,diverse, and internationally focusedmajor research center, with studentsfrom more than 100 countries. TheGraduate School still honors the idealexpressed by Albert Gallatin, theUniversity 's first president, who artic- ulated the institution 's primary goal: \"A private university in the public service. \" History of the Graduate School 6 HISTORY OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL Washington Square by Fernand Harvey Lungren (c.1890).

It isdesigned to prepare studentsfor advanced work and teachingin American studies. Interde-partmental by definition, the student 's course of study is arranged with the director ofthe program and the director ofgraduate studies and includesseminars offered in the programand selected courses offered inthe following departments, pro-grams, and institutes: AfricanaStudies, Anthropology, CinemaStudies, Comparative Litera-ture, English, Fine Arts, His-tory, Humanities and SocialThought (the Draper Program),Journalism and Mass Commu-nication, Music, PerformanceStudies, Philosophy, Politics, and Sociology. The program 's committee is made up of faculty from many ofthese departments. The programinterprets \"American \" in a broad sense to include assessments ofthe historical role of the UnitedStates in the Americas and, moregenerally, in world affairs. Inas-much as the program has aregional focus, special attentionis given to studies in urbanismand to New York in particular, aglobal city that comprises manyworld cultures.

TheGraduate Record Examination (GRE)is required of all students. The basis of the program is multi- disciplinary; therefore it tends toadmit exceptional students who areattuned to working across disciplines. MASTER OF ARTS Course of Study: The terminal M.A. program does not lead directly toPh.D. enrollment, though M.A. stu-dents may apply for Ph.D. study alongwith the general Ph.D. applicant poolin any given year. A total of 32 pointsof course credit \u2014at least 24 taken in residence at NYU \u2014is required for the M.A. degree. M.A. students mustcomplete the introductory Americanstudies seminar, a research seminar,and three other courses taught by coreprogram faculty, and they mustdemonstrate reading proficiency in aforeign language. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Matriculation: Students may be admitted to the Ph.D. program eitherfollowing M.A. study at NYU or else-where or directly after receipt of thebachelor 's degree. In either case, the first semesters of enrollment in thePh.D. program must confirm students ' readiness for doctoral work. Thus, stu-dents holding the M.A. upon admis-sion must officially apply to matricu-late for the doctorate after completing12 points of course work in Americanstudies at NYU; those entering withonly a bachelor 's degree must do so upon completing 32 points of coursework. Approval of matriculation isbased on students ' progress to date and on recommendations from facultyfamiliar with their work. Degree Requirements: To qualify for the doctorate, a student must satisfac-torily complete graduate studies total-ing at least 72 points, with a mini-mum of 32 points at the doctoral levelin residence at New York University; pass qualifying examinations; andpresent an acceptable dissertation.Students who have completed relevantgraduate courses elsewhere mayrequest that such courses be creditedto degree requirements within the sec-ond semester of study. Credits may beearned through courses, independentstudy, and group study. Course of Study: All students must take the introductory Seminar inAmerican Studies (G13.3301), GroupResearch Seminar (G13.2319), andIndividual Research Seminar(G13.2306). Beyond this, studentswork with the director of the program,the director of graduate studies, andcommittee advisers to establish theircourse of study; at least 24 points(generally six courses) in addition tothose entailed by the required semi-nars must be earned in courses offeredby the program 's core faculty. The pro- gram offers a range of six fields:(1) culture, work, and consumption;(2) identity, citizenship, and social for-mation; (3) media, communications,and expressive culture; (4) social andpolitical theory; (5) science, technolo-gy, and society; and (6) urban andcommunity studies. Doctoral students choose to concen- trate their course work in two of thesefields and are examined in each. Underspecial circumstances, fields can beconstructed for students with extraor-dinary interests. If they wish, studentsmay concentrate their work in specificdisciplines, although the chief purposeof the field structure is to encouragetransdisciplinary study. Language Requirements: Every matriculant must satisfy the doctorallanguage proficiency requirement.This may be done in one of threeways: (1) demonstrate proficiency at anintermediate level in a second foreignlanguage as described in the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin; (2) demonstrate advanced proficiencyin the same language offered at themaster 's level in the Graduate Schoolforeign language proficiency examina- tion; or (3) in special cases, complete ayearlong course (with a grade of B orbetter) in statistics, computer method-ology, or a technical skill related to thestudent 's research, in addition to demonstrating proficiency in a firstforeign language at the master 's level. Qualifying Examination: Matriculated students who have com-pleted or are completing the appropri-ate courses and have already demon-strated knowledge of the two foreignlanguages must pass the qualifyingexaminations. Each candidate for thePh.D. must satisfy the requirementsset by the faculty committee in twofields. For each field, the candidateprepares a substantial research essaydealing with a wide range of literaturein the field, considering questions andtopics central to a course of reading setin consultation with field examiners.An oral session may be conducted afterthe work is complete. Dissertation: When the student has completed at least one year in resi-dence and all course and languagerequirements, passed the qualifyingexaminations, proposed an acceptablesubject for the dissertation, and beenrecommended by the program, he orshe is formally admitted to candidacyfor the doctorate, and an advisorycommittee is appointed. While mostcommittees are comprised of membersfrom the Program Committee, stu-dents are permitted to work with anyappropriate member of the NYU fac-ulty. Approval of the dissertation bythe committee and a defense of thedissertation examination complete therequirements for the degree.

Myers DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Thomas Abercrombie nthropologists are concerned withevery aspect ofhuman life, past and present. This view makesanthropology a complex disci-pline, its theories and methodstranscending the usual bound-aries of natural science, socialscience, and the humanities. Cultural anthropologists in the department share a beliefthat study and research must befirmly grounded in rigoroustraining in general social andcultural theory, both in contem-porary writings and in the clas-sics of anthropology andsociology. The faculty alsobelieves that basic ethnographyremains the cornerstone onwhich all cultural anthropologyrests and are concerned with therepresentation of anthropologi-cal knowledge in writing andfilm. There is a commitment toan understanding of complexsocieties that is informed by acomparative perspective andknowledge of small-scale soci-eties. Recent field research byfaculty and students has beenconducted in East and WestAfrica, Australia, Melanesia,Polynesia, Egypt, India, France,the United States (includingresearch among Native Ameri- cans), the Caribbean, Spain,Mexico, and South America.Faculty interests convergearound gender relations; emo-tions; belief history; colonialism and post-colonial of andpolitical institutions in complexsocieties; transnationalprocesses; and urban life. Muchfaculty research focuses on themediation of identities throughpopular and public culturalforms \u2014such as art, television, indigenous media, urban space,regional cultures, and ideologiesof language use \u2014in a variety of changing social contexts. Linguistic anthropology focuses on how language is usedto create and maintain thesocial relations and symbolicsystems that constitute everydaylife. Students are encouraged tocarry out ethnographic studiesof language use in communitiesand institutions both withinand outside New York City. Archaeologists in the depart- ment are committed to thebelief that the material remainsof ancient societies provide sig-nificant insights into thedynamics of sociocultural evolu-tion. The department has devel-oped an archaeology programthat focuses on key transforma-tions in cultural evolution; the origins of art and symbolism;archaeology and gender; theemergence of food production;and the development and col-lapse of chieftaincies and earlystates. A diversity of theoreticalperspectives, from cultural ecol-ogy to symbolic archaeology, isrepresented and encouraged.The geographic scope of facultyresearch includes the Near East,Egypt, South Asia, and Europe. Physical anthropologists in this program are committed toa holistic perspective on pri-mate evolution that combines anumber of distinct approachesand techniques. These includethe study of the paleobiology offossil primates, comparativeanatomy of living species, andfield study of popu-lations. Molecular techniquesare used to approach questionsof phylogenetic reconstruction,and also the microevolutionarydynamics of functioning popu-lations, and to integrate thesewith observational studies ofecology and social behavior. Thefaculty 's research takes them and their students to field sitesin Africa, Asia, Europe, SouthAmerica, and the United States. The department is committed to comparative research thatseeks theories allowing for theenormous diversity in humanlife. The program offers a holis-tic approach to the study of RUFUS D.

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to graduate study is based on academic records,scholarly recommendations, and scoreson the Graduate Record Examination.The department offers the Master ofArts and Doctor of Philosophy degreeswith specialization in various subdisci-plines (see below). The departmentdoes not offer a stand-alone M.A. pro-gram. Instead, the M.A. is awarded asa step in fulfillment of requirementsfor the Ph.D. Applicants should applydirectly to the Ph.D. program. Theywill be formally admitted to the Ph.D.program, however, only after fulfill-ment of requirements outlined below. MASTER OF ARTS A total of 36 points of course work isrequired for the M.A. degree, 12 ofthese being in the core courses. Allstudents in each of the subdisciplinesare required to take certain depart-mental core courses. It is recognized,however, that even at the master 's level, students usually have definedtheir subdisciplines of interest. Hence,each student follows within a subdisci-pline a structured program to assurecompetence in anthropology by thetime the M.A. degree is completed.The requirements for each of the sub-disciplines are described below.Cultural and Linguistic Anthropology: All students must take (1) Departmental Seminar(G14.1000) or an alternative courseapproved by the director of graduatestudies and their M.A. advisory com-mittee, Social Anthropology Theoryand Practice (G14.1010), andLinguistic Anthropology (G14.1040)as their core courses; (2) Traditions course, cho-sen in consultation with their M.A.advisory committee; and (3) History ofAnthropology (G14.1636). Archaeological Anthropology: All students must take (1) DepartmentalSeminar (G14.1000) or an alternativecourse approved by the director of grad-uate studies and their M.A. advisorycommittee, AnthropologicalArchaeology (G14.1020), andBiological Anthropology (G14.1030) astheir core courses (in semesters whenG14.1030 is not offered, studentsshould consult the director of graduatestudies or their M.A. advisory commit-tee); (2) either History of Anthropology(G14.1636) or a course in the history ofarchaeology; (3) one archaeology coursefocusing on a specific geographicregion; (4) one course in archaeologicalmethods; and (5) a supervised field tripexperience approved by their M.A.advisory committee. Physical Anthropology: All students must take (1) Departmental Seminar(G14.1000) or an alternative courseapproved by the director of graduatestudies and their M.A. advisory com-mittee, and History of Anthropology(G14.1636); (2) all three of the NewYork Consortium for EvolutionaryPrimatology (NYCEP) core courses;and (G14.3218) or anequivalent seminar approved by theirM.A. advisory committee. On entering the M.A. program, each student is assigned an advisory com-mittee consisting of three facultymembers who meet with the studentonce each semester to plan the stu-dent's course work for the following semester. The department evaluates allM.A. graduate courses taken at otheruniversities, and credit may be trans-ferred within the limits set by theGraduate School of Arts and Science. No later than the middle of the term in which all M.A. course workhas been completed, usually the thirdsemester of full-time course work, thestudent selects an M.A. paper commit-tee, consisting of a supervisor and areader, from among the faculty. Thetopic of the paper is selected in consul-tation with the M.A. paper commit-tee, and this committee must approvethe M.A. paper before the master 'sANTHROPOLOGY 21degree is awarded. Note: Students in the master 's program may take no more than 8 points in research or read-ing courses. During the second year of graduate study, students may petition to enterthe Ph.D. program, as describedbelow. No student, however, may reg-ister for more than 12 points beyondthe M.A. until the master 's paper has been accepted, and she or he has provi-sional entry to the doctoral program. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY There are two ways to apply for admis-sion into the Ph.D. program. Studentswho already have a master 's degree in anthropology may apply for admissiondirectly through the Graduate School ofArts and Science. Students enrolled inthe M.A. program may petition forentry into the Ph.D. program at anytime after their first year of coursework. To petition, a student mustdevelop a program of study that hasbeen approved by his or her Ph.D. com-mittee, consisting of three facultymembers in the department who for-mally agree to supervise the student 's research. The head of the Ph.D. com-mittee is the student 's main dissertation adviser. A successful petition must be awritten statement indicating a plan ofstudy and research, formulated in con-sultation with the proposed Ph.D. committee and then approved by theentire departmental faculty. Finalacceptance is conditional upon success-ful completion of the master 's course work and master 's paper. These course points are then applied toward thePh.D., which requires a total of72 points. Students who have been for-mally admitted to the Ph.D. programmay take a maximum of 24 points inresearch courses. On completion of 64 points or more of course work, a student must takethe written Ph.D. comprehensiveexaminations. These examinationscover work in three areas of specializa-tion. Ph.D. committees may also setother course requirements, dependingon the particular needs of the student.The language requirement must befulfilled as well as an oral defense ofthe dissertation proposal. Once theserequirements are completed, the stu-dent has achieved Ph.D. candidacy andmay pursue dissertation research. Atthis time, the student files for thedegree of M.Phil. After completion ofthe dissertation, the student defendsthe dissertation at a final oral examina-tion conducted by members of thePh.D. committee and two additionalscholars. Three members of the exam- ining committee must be from theanthropology faculty. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS The department requires that all stu-dents in the Ph.D. program demon-strate proficiency in one foreign lan-guage. The language is usually chosenfrom Arabic, Chinese, French,German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese,Russian, or Spanish. Petitions to takeother languages should be made to thedirector of graduate studies. Students at the master 's level are not required to demonstrate compe-tence in a foreign language, but thedepartment recommends that suchcompetence be developed. URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY The special area of study in urbananthropology is open to students inthe departmental curriculum but hasspecific requirements. It emphasizesapplication of anthropological method-ology to the problems of urban societyin the United States and abroad. NewYork City provides excellent trainingconditions for studies of urban life, aswell as access to urban institutions andagencies at the local, state, national,and international levels. Special atten-tion is given to the development ofmeaningful careers in urban anthropol-ogy outside academia, such as in thefields of social service delivery, legalsystems, housing, business, and popu-lar culture. Questions about this areaof study may be directed to Owen M.Lynch, Charles F. Noyes Professor ofUrban Anthropology. CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA (See the Program in Culture and Media section in this bulletin for furtherinformation.) The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a joint course ofstudy leading to the AdvancedCertificate in Culture and Media. Corefaculty are Professor Faye Ginsburg,director, and Assistant ProfessorMargaret McLagan of the Departmentof Anthropology, as well as ProfessorToby Miller of the Department ofCinema Studies. The program isdesigned for graduate students ineither the Department ofAnthropology or the Department ofCinema Studies. This graduate program provides a focused course of graduate studiesintegrating production with theoryand research. Training in this programwill enable students to pursue the following: 1. Production of work in 16 mm film and state-of-the-art digital video basedon their own research, resulting in ahalf-hour documentary. 2. Ethnographic research into the uses and meanings of media in a range ofcommunities and cultures. Studentsfrom the program have been doingPh.D. research on the development ofmedia in diverse settings, from theemergence of media in Papua NewGuinea, to circulation of religiousmedia in northern Nigeria, to the useof media in linking the Tibetan diaspora. 3. Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documen-tary and related issues in cinema andmedia studies. 4. A career in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such asspecialized programming and distribu-tion of ethnographic film and video,community-based documentary produc-tion, management of ethnographicfilm/video libraries and archives, orwork in new media. The program 's philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationships betweenculture and media in a number ofdomains including ethnographic film 's significance for the fields of anthropolo-gy and cinema/media studies; problemsin representation of cultures throughmedia; the development of media inindigenous, diaspora, and non-Westerncommunities; the emerging social andcultural formations shaped by newmedia practices; and the political economy shaping the production, dis-tribution, and consumption of mediaworldwide. Curriculum: The program requires approximately one additional year ofwork beyond the M.A. degree andconsists of an original project andeight courses, two of which may becounted toward the M.A. degree.Courses include seminars in historyand theory of ethnographic film, issuesin culture and media, productioncourses in film and/or video in thefilm school, culture theory and thedocumentary, and electives on topicssuch as Third World cinema and femi-nist film criticism. Students may not take courses in the culture and media pro-gram unless they are enrolled in anM.A./Ph.D. program in either anthropolo-gy or cinema studies at NYU. Students with prior training in media may be22 ANTHROPOLOGYable to substitute other courses from the extensive curriculum offered incinema studies, anthropology, ormedia production \u2014including other forms such as photography and newmedia. Internships: The program also arranges supervised internships forcourse credit, tailored to individualresearch and professional interests.Students work in a variety of program-ming and production positions forinstitutions, such as the AmericanMuseum of Natural History, theMuseum of the American Indian, theAsia Society, and the Jewish Museum. The program works closely with the Center for Media, Culture, andHistory (see page 23). THE NYCEP PROGRAM New York University participates inthe New York Consortium forEvolutionary Primatology (NYCEP), agraduate CityUniversity, Columbia University,Wildlife Conservation International atthe Bronx Zoo, and the AmericanMuseum of Natural History. The con-sortium provides an integrated train-ing program that allows students totake courses, seminars, and internshipsat any of these institutions given byapproximately 30 physical anthropolo-gists, primatologists, and vertebratepaleontologists participating in theprogram. In addition to the departmental requirements, students in physicalanthropology must take three NYCEPcore courses. These are the foundation-al courses Primate Behavior, Ecology,and Conservation; EvolutionaryMorphology; and Genetics andEvolutionary Theory. Students alsogain practical experience throughrequired internships, where they workindividually on research projects withNYCEP faculty.

Ethnographic film has a pecu-liar and highly contested status withinanthropology, cinema studies, and doc-umentary practice. This seminar situ-ates ethnographic film within thewider project of the representation ofcultural lives, and especially of\"natives. \" Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of thegenre, the course examines how theseemerged in a particular intellectualcontext and political economy. It thenconsiders the key works that have26 ANTHROPOLOGY defined the genre, and the epistemo- logical and formal innovations associ-ated with them, addressing questionsconcerning social theory, documentary,as well as the institutional structuresthrough which they are funded, dis-tributed, and seen by various audi-ences. Throughout, the course keeps inmind the properties of film as a signi-fying practice, its status as a form ofanthropological knowledge, and theethical and political concerns raised bycross-cultural representation. Culture and Media II: Ethnography of Media G14.1216 Open only to grad- uate students in the Departments ofAnthropology, Cinema Studies, andPerformance Studies. Prerequisite:G14.1215. Ginsburg, McLagan.4 points. In the last decade, a new field \u2014the ethnography of media \u2014has emerged as an exciting new arena of research.While claims about media in people 's lives are made on a daily basis, sur-prisingly little research has actuallyattempted to look at how media ispart of the naturally occurring livedrealities of people 's lives. In the last decade, anthropologists and mediascholars interested in film, television,and video have been turning theirattention increasingly beyond the textand the empiricist notions of audi-ences (stereotypically associated withthe ethnography of media), to consid-er, ethnographically, the complexsocial worlds in which media is pro-duced, circulated, and consumed, athome and elsewhere. This work theo-rizes media studies from the point ofview of cross-cultural ethnographicrealities and anthropology from theperspective of new spaces of communi-cation focusing on the social, econom-ic, and political life of media and howit makes a difference in the daily livesof people as a practice, whether in pro-duction, reception, or circulation. After some introductory sessions on precursors to the current research dur-ing and after World War II and thenew scholarship on the broad histori-cal and ideological context that shapedearly ethnographic film, the class isorganized around case studies thatinterrogate broader issues that are par-ticularly endemic to questions ofcross-cultural media, includingdebates over cultural imperialism vs.the autonomy of local producers/con-sumers, the instability and stratifica-tion of reception, the shift fromnational to transnational circuits ofproduction and consumption, and theincreasing complicity of researchers with their subjects over representa-tions of culture. These concerns areaddressed in a variety of locations,from the complex circulation of films,photographs, and lithographs thatdemonstrates the historically and cul-turally contingent ways in whichimages are read and used; to the everincreasing range of cul-ture\u2014from state-sponsored melodra- religious soap operas,to varieties of public television; to theactivist use of video, radio, theInternet, and small media. The classalso has an opportunity to participatein a conference on the impact of JeanRouch 's participatory cinema, in West Africa, and in seminars on the work ofMaya Deren and on the Truth andReconciliation Commission in SouthAfrica.

Tries to convey what is involved in studying the various symbolic systemsin use in various societies \u2014both \"Western \" and \"non-Western \"\u2014con- sidering the role of these expressivesystems in myth, ritual, literature, andart. Also reviews the history anddevelopment, over the last 150 yearsor so, of a specifically anthropologicalperspective on the nature of symbolicprocesses, showing the relevance oflanguage and how the study of lan-guage has informed these anthropolog-ical perspectives on human beings as\"symbol-using \" creatures. Close exam- ination of important theoretical dis-ANTHROPOLOGY 27cussions is combined with extended case studies from ethnographic litera-ture, allowing the nonspecialist tobecome familiar not only with thedetails of symbolic systems in use in anumber of actual communities, butwith anthropology 's emerging claim to a special kind of perspective, and aspecial kind of method, for their study.

Genetic determinants of behavior.Programs and RequirementsAdmission: In addition to the general Graduate School of Arts and Sciencerequirements for admission, applicantsare expected to have an average of B orbetter in the sciences and to have com-pleted the equivalent of an undergrad-uate major in biology. Admission tograduate study is based on academicrecords, recommendations, assessmentsof the applicant 's scientific potential, and scores on the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE). These examina-tions are required of all applicants tothe Ph.D. program and recommendedfor applicants to the M.S. program.The advanced GRE test in biology isalso recommended. Consideration isgiven to applicants with an undergrad-uate major other than biology; remedi-al work to make up any undergraduatedeficiencies may be taken prior to, orconcurrent with, the master 's program but must be completed within the firstyear in the Ph.D. program. Applications for graduate study are accepted on a continuing basis. M.S.students may begin study in the fall,spring, or summer semester; however,Ph.D. students may start only in thefall semester. All students with international cre- dentials whose native language is notEnglish should refer to the Admissions to Degree Programs section of this bul- letin regarding the required Test ofEnglish as a Foreign Language(TOEFL). In some cases, prior to tak-ing graduate courses, students may berequired to enroll in noncredit Englishcourses at their own expense. In special cases, a student may be accepted as a nonmatriculant. A nonde-gree student may take up to 12 pointsin the Department of Biology before applying for matriculated status in theM.S. or Ph.D. program. The applica-tion for matriculation is only consid-ered if the student has received a B orbetter in each course included in the12 points. Deadlines for applying fornonmatriculant status are the same asfor the M.S. program. Seminars: All faculty and doctoral stu- dents attend the weekly departmentalseminar, at which scholars from otherinstitutions discuss their research find-ings. In addition, the departmentsponsors special topical seminarsthroughout the year. Special Notes: Although master 's stu- dents may start their program in anysemester, some courses are full-yearcourses and must be started in the fall. Full-time students are expected to carry three courses or the equivalent inapproved research per semester. Allstudents in both programs are expectedto maintain a B or better average eachterm. Permission must be received from the director of graduate studies for anycourse work taken outside of thedepartment. MASTER OF SCIENCE The Master of Science program offersthree courses of study: biological sci-ences; computers in biologic research;and recombinant DNA technology. Inaddition, biomedical journalism isoffered jointly with the Department ofJournalism and Mass Communication,and a combined M.S./M.B.A. programis offered jointly with the New YorkUniversity Leonard N. Stern School ofBusiness. The options are described in the Graduate Student Handbook, avail- able on request from the Departmentof Biology. Courses numbered in the1000-level and 2000-level ranges areopen to students in the M.S. program. Degree Requirements: Students are awarded a Master of Science degree on(1) completion of 36 points with anaverage of B or better and (2) satisfac-tory completion of a research paper. Ofthe 36 points required, 28 must befrom the Department of Biology atNew York University. Only 8 pointsmay be transferred from outside theUniversity and any other departmentin the Graduate School of Arts andScience. Students working within oneof the special M.S. programs may berequired to take additional courses.

Further informa-tion on developmental genetics can beobtained from Professor Philip N.Benfey. All doctoral students mustmaintain an average of B or better. Qualifying Examination/Admission to Candidacy: The written Ph.D. qualifying examination (preliminaryexamination) is generally taken at theend of two years of full-time study (atthe completion of the course workphase of study), that is, in the springsemester of a student 's second year. The examination consists of two parts. Thefirst part is an independent and origi-nal research proposal on a topic relatedto the theme of the spring seminarseries. The proposal is submitted to anexamination committee consisting ofthree faculty members chosen by thestudent. The proposal may not be inthe area of the student 's thesis research.The second part is an oral examination before the examination committee,which is intended to test further thestudent 's understanding of the topics contained in the written proposal.Satisfactory completion of the qualify-ing examination constitutes admissionto Ph.D. candidacy. Students in the special collaborative Program in Environmental HealthSciences must take a two-phase writtenqualifying examination. EHS studentsmust pass sections of the departmentalwritten examination that cover cellularbiology and molecular biology, includ-ing the \"problem \" question (two-thirds of the examination), if given; the sec-ond phase is a special version of theBasic Environmental HealthExamination, principally covering areasof statistics, toxicology, and oncology. Sometime during the first or second year, the student must secure a facultysponsor and a research advisory com-mittee of at least three faculty mem-bers from within the department whohave formally agreed to supervise thedissertation research. A dissertationproposal for the completion of originalbiological research must be filed andapproved by the sponsor (generallyduring the semester following success-ful completion of the written qualify-ing examination). The student mustthen pass an oral examination on theresearch proposal before the student 's examining committee. Doctoral Dissertation: The plan of study and the dissertation research areformulated in consultation with thefaculty sponsor and the research adviso-ry committee. The dissertation mustrepresent original, independentresearch in a significant area of biologyat a level comparable to research pub-lished in recognized journals or as pro-fessional monographs. When the dis-sertation is completed and has beenapproved by the sponsor and by theresearch advisory committee, the candi-date defends the results of the researchbefore a faculty committee and invitedoutside examiners with expertise in thefield of research. No less than sixmonths may lapse between the oralproposal examination and the disserta-tion defense.

In 2001, the AmericanChemical Society officially des- ignated the site on which thechemistry department is locatedas a Historical Chemical Land-mark. Robert Morrison andRobert Boyd, who both taughtin the department, coauthored atextbook on organic chemistrythat has trained a whole genera-tion of chemists. GertrudeElion, winner of the 1988Nobel Prize in physiology ormedicine, received her M.S.from New York University.New York University 's pro- grams in chemistry have trainedthousands of B.S., M.S., andPh.D. students since awardingits first Ph.D. in 1866. The department has about 18faculty members directing research, approximately 70 full-time graduate students, and asubstantial number of postdoc-toral fellows and affiliated scien-tists. Seminars and colloquia area regular part of the departmen-tal programs, and visiting scien-tists and students from all partsof the country and abroad pre-sent the results of currentresearch. Distinguished guestspeakers are drawn from aca-demic and industrial institu-tions throughout the world.These visits expose graduate stu-dents to diverse and cutting-edge research work and allowthem to exchange ideas withleading scientists.

The Graduate RecordExamination scores from the generaltest and the advanced chemistry (orother appropriate advanced-level area)test are required. Students whose native language is not English must submit the scorefrom either the Test of Spoken Englishor the Test of English as a ForeignLanguage.Students beginning graduate study are usually accepted only for Septemberadmission. Part-time candidates for the M.S. degree are accepted only if they are ableto attend classes in the daytime, sincevery few courses are offered in theevening. MASTER OF SCIENCE Requirements: Students must satisfac- torily complete 32 points (at least 24 inresidence at New York University) witha GPA of B (3.0) or better, and one ofthe following alternatives: (1) presenta-tion of a seminar on an advanced topic in the major field; (2) preparation of aninterpretative review of the literature ofa selected area of chemistry; (3) prepara-tion of a dissertation based on originalresearch; (4) passing an oral examina-tion in the major field. The suggested courses in each field are Physical The Doctor of Philosophy is a researchdegree. It signifies that the recipientis able to conduct independentresearch and has both a broad basicknowledge of all areas of chemistryand a comprehensive knowledge ofone field in particular. Since graduate students arrive with a variety of backgrounds, many withM.S. degrees from other institutions inthe United States and abroad, the pro-gram of courses for each student isdesigned in consultation with thedirector of graduate studies, takingeach student 's specific background, experience, and interests into account. While there are no specific course requirements for the Ph.D. in chem-istry, students in the Ph.D. programmay choose to participate in one of thefollowing three tracks. Each track rep-resents an area of study reflecting boththe current research foci of the facultyand the evolving interests of studentsand is designed to provide a morestructured academic experience. Eachtrack provides a guideline for 24 of the72 points required for the degree.These tracks may also be modified inconsultation with the adviser and thedirector of graduate studies to better fitthe individual needs of students. Note: Each of the following courses carries 4 points. Organic/Bioorganic Chemistry Track: Organic Reaction Mechanisms(G25.1314)Structural Aspects of OrganicChemistry (G25.1313)Instrumental Analysis (G25.1413)And 12 points selected from the following:Advanced Organic Chemistry I:Reactions of Organic Compounds(G25.1311) Advanced Organic Chemistry II:Organic Synthesis (G25.1312) Synthetic Organic Chemistry(G25.2232) (G25.2641)Quantum Mechanics (G25.2666)Statistical Mechanics (G25.2651)Molecular Modeling (G25.2601) Students must satisfactorily complete at least 72 points derived from coursesand research, at least 32 of which mustbe taken in residence at New YorkUniversity. Students usually gain labo-ratory research experience during theirfirst year in one or more groups. Thislaboratory experience provides studentswith direct exposure to techniques andmethodology used in the various labsand helps them to choose a thesisadviser. In order to gain matriculation into the Ph.D. program in chemistry, a stu-dent must present a public lecture atthe beginning of the second year andpass a research progress exam at the endof the second year of graduate study.The exam is designed to ensure thatstudents are ready to embark on seriousresearch and scholarship. It consists of awritten report (5-10 pages) and an oralexam before a thesis advisory commit-tee (thesis adviser plus two other facul-ty members). If performance is not sat-isfactory, one more attempt is allowed.Students who pass are graduated to thestatus of a Ph.D. candidate. A further requirement for the Ph.D. program in chemistry is the preparationand successful oral defense of tworesearch proposals. At the beginning ofthe fourth year of graduate study, awritten and oral research proposal exammust be passed. The exam tests studentskills in scientific writing, reasoninganalysis, integration of scientific con-cepts, interpretation of data in the liter-ature, and creativity in the design ofnew experiments. Feedback on studentabstracts submitted prior to the exam isintended to help students identifypromising research directions. The finalwritten proposal (10-12 pages) and oral exam are evaluated by an appointedcommittee. A passing grade must beachieved at least nine months beforethe thesis defense. The thesis defense,performed before the thesis advisorycommittee, is the last step of the Ph.D.program. All doctoral candidates are expected to participate in the seminar programoffered by their division and to attendthe departmental colloquia presentedby distinguished visiting scientists. Doctoral Dissertation: The heart of the doctoral program is the researchleading to the preparation of the disser-tation. The accumulation of highgrades in formal courses, while impor-tant, is secondary to the demonstrationof a capacity for original thinking andthe completion of an investigation thatcontributes significantly to chemicalknowledge. When a student is formallyadmitted to matriculation for the doc-torate, a committee consisting of theresearch adviser and two other facultymembers is selected to advise the can-didate and monitor the progress of theresearch by meeting with the student atscheduled intervals and wheneverrequested by the student. When thedissertation is completed, it is read bythe research committee and two addi-tional faculty. Up to two outside read-ers who are experts in the field of thedissertation research may be appointedas dissertation readers. A public oraldefense of the approved dissertation isthen held. DEPARTMENTAL FELLOWSHIPS, PRIZES, ANDAWARDS A comprehensive list of University, Graduate School, and departmental fel-lowships, prizes, and awards appears inthe Financing Graduate Education section of the application at the back of thisbulletin.CoursesMost courses are lecture oriented; others emphasize individual study with atten-tion to the needs of each student.

Theapproach to cinema is interdisci-plinary and international inscope and is concerned withunderstanding films in terms ofthe material practices that pro-duce them and within whichthey circulate. While film con-stitutes the primary object ofstudy, the department also con-siders other media that fallwithin the realm of sound/imagestudies (e.g., broadcast television, video art, and on-line technolo-gies) to be within its purview. Three graduate programs are offered in the department: theM.A. Program in Cinema Stud-ies, the M.A. Program in Mov-ing Image Archiving andPreservation, and the Ph.D. Pro-gram in Cinema Studies. Graduate students may take a production course only in thesummer through the Depart-ment of Film and Television.Students enrolled in the Certifi-cate Program in Culture andMedia are required to take fur-ther production courses. Stu-dents enrolled in the M.A.Program in Moving ImageArchiving and Preservation arerequired to take their secondyear of study at the GeorgeEastman House in Rochester, New York. Most courses in cinema stud- ies include extensive filmscreenings that are supple-mented by a weekly cinemath-eque. Students also have accessto extensive film and film-related resources in the depart-ment 's George Amberg Study Center. In addition, the ElmerHolmes Bobst Library andStudy Center houses a substan-tial video collection that islocated in the Avery Fisher Cen-ter for Music and Media. OtherNew York City institutions suchas the Museum of Modern Art,the Library of the PerformingArts at Lincoln Center, and theAnthology Film Archives offerfurther invaluable resources forthe film student. 721 BROADWAY , 6TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6807 (212) 998-1600 T FacultyRichard Allen, Associate Professor.

Students also have the opportu-nity to pursue internships for credit atfilm libraries and archives in the city orin the film and media industries inorder to further their professional devel-opment. Many lecture classes areoffered in the evening for the conven-ience of working students. Graduates ofthe program have gone on to successfulcareers as film curators, programmers,preservationists, as well as film critics,instructors, screenwriters, filmmakers,and industry professionals. The M.A. Program in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation is a self-contained curriculum that provides stu-dents with the academic study and pro-fessional training necessary to take lead-ership roles in this emerging field. Inaddition to two semesters of academicstudy at New York University and asummer internship in a professional set-ting, the program includes nine monthsof training, at the George EastmanHouse in Rochester, New York, thatwill equip students in every aspect ofworking in a moving image archive:programming and exhibition, cata-loging, collection management, budg-eting, print preparation, inspection,image reconstruction, laboratory work,and vault and storage management.Study at the George Eastman House,during the second academic year,entails extensive hands-on experience.Students work closely with curators inthe Motion Picture Department, fol-lowing the routine of a 9-to-5 day, fivedays per week. Within this time, lec-tures and demonstrations are scheduled.All students are required to spendblocks of time working with the muse-um staff in a wide range of areas ofarchival activity, including inspection,repair, and identification of movingimages; nitrate film handling; cata-loging, documentation, and program- ming; and conservation of film stills,posters, and other moving image-relat-ed artifacts. Students rotate throughthese services, spending roughly equalamounts of time in each service, gradu-ally acquiring the skills necessary towork in an archival institution.Evaluation of each student 's work is provided in written form, at the end ofa block assignment, by the museumstaff member working with the studenton his or her daily assignments in thatblock. This written evaluation is drawnup in consultation with faculty andguest faculty. Because of the profession-al obligations of some of the guest lec-turers who teach in the program at theGeorge Eastman House, some courses(generally 2-point courses) are taught inconcentrated form, over the span of 10-14 days, rather than the entirety of asemester. The Ph.D. Program in Cinema Studies prepares students to developteaching competence and to pursueresearch in cinema studies. The curricu-lum draws on the methods of a numberof disciplines, including art history, cul-tural studies, American studies, psycho-analytic theory, and philosophy andinvolves intensive seminar-level studyin film theory, history, and researchmethods. Graduates of the programhave gone onto positions of academicleadership in the field. Admission: Although instruction, administration, and financial aid areprovided by the Tisch School of theArts (TSOA), graduate degrees in cine-ma studies are conferred by New YorkUniversity through the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science (GSAS).Admission is granted by both schools.Applications are processed by the TischSchool of the Arts. Students shouldrequest an application from the Officeof Graduate Admissions, Tisch Schoolof the Arts, New York University, 721Broadway, 8th Floor, New York, NY10003-6807; (212) 998-1900.

Internships: It is possible for Ph.D. students to receive independent studycredit for work at various film libraries,associations, and archives (such as theDonnell Library, the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers,and the Museum of Modern Art).Permission of a faculty adviser isrequired for such work. Incompletes: The department strongly discourages \"incompletes, \" even if they are made up before the end of the nextsemester. Outstanding incompletes mayrender a student ineligible for assistant-ships and financial aid. See the GSASguidelines for completion deadlines forincompletes. The dissertation defensecannot be scheduled if outstandingincompletes exist. Qualifying Examinations: Each stu- dent must pass three exams: one in thefield of film/culture/media theory, onein the field of film/media history, andone in a third area drawn from theexisting exam offerings or drawn up asa special area of study that relates to thestudent 's proposed dissertation topic in consultation with the student 's faculty adviser. The theory exam areas includegender, sexuality, and representation;race, nation, and representation; cultur-al theory; media theory and genre; of sound andimage. The history/historiographyexam areas include the followingoptions: American film \u20141895 to 1929, American film \u20141927 to 1960, or American film \u20141960 to the pres- ent; history of French film; history ofItalian film; history of Japanese film;history of Soviet and post-Soviet film;history of German film; history theinternational avant-garde; history ofdocumentary film; history of LatinAmerican film; history of British film. All exams are take-home exams. The take-home exam consists of six ques-tions, of which three are to be answeredin the form of a 10-page essay per ques-tion. The student has one week to com-plete the take-home exam. Each subjectarea is offered for examination once ayear either in the fall or spring semes-ter. A schedule of the areas offered in aparticular semester is available from thedepartment at the beginning of eachacademic year. Exams are graded bythree faculty members. The studentreceives a grade of high pass, pass, orfail. If a student fails an examination,the exam in the same subject area mustbe taken the next time it is offered.Upon failing an exam in any one areatwice, the student must leave the Ph.D.program. Students sit for their qualify-ing exams in their second, third, andfourth semesters of course work. Foreign Language Requirement: ACINEMA STUDIES 69student must demonstrate proficiency in one foreign language. Five languagesare accepted toward fulfilling the Ph.D.language requirement: French, German,Italian, Russian, and Spanish. Studentsproficient in another language mayrequest an exemption from this require-ment from the director of graduatestudies. Language proficiency may be demon- strated by any of the following:(1) passing the foreign language profi-ciency examination given by theGraduate School of Arts and Science;(2) passing a departmental examination;or (3) completing, or having completednot more than two years before matric-ulation, a full or final intermediate-level college course in the languagewith a transcript grade of B or better. School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) courses donot satisfy this requirement; however,students with no previous knowledge ofa foreign language or those who wish areview are encouraged to enroll in theSCPS special reading courses for gradu-ate degree candidates. A two-semestersequence is offered in French, German,and Spanish (plus Italian and Russianin the summer session). For informa-tion, call the SCPS Foreign LanguageProgram, (212) 998-7130. Students who have met the language requirement in another graduate schoolnot more than two years before matric-ulating in the department may requestthat such credentials be accepted by thedepartment.

Ph.D. Adviser: Ph.D. students are advised by the director of graduatestudies or chair of the department untilsuch time as they select their disserta-tion adviser. Ph.D. students shouldselect their dissertation adviser no laterthan their fourth semester of Ph.D.course work. Dissertation Seminar and Proposal: All Ph.D. students must takeDissertation Seminar in their fourthsemester of Ph.D. course work. Thisseminar is used to develop the disserta- tion proposal that will be defended inthe Ph.D. oral examination. The disser-tation proposal consists of a documentof no more than 20 pages that outlinesin detail the candidate 's proposed area of study. It should include (1) an out-line of the research to be undertaken;(2) a statement of the project 's contri- bution to the field in context of a briefreview of the literature; (3) an outlineof the method to be used; (4) a state-ment of how the candidate intends tocomplete the research; and (5) a chap-ter-by-chapter breakdown of project. Abibliography must be attached to theproposal. Ph.D. Oral Examination: At the end of their fourth semester of Ph.D. coursework, students take an oral examinationconducted by a faculty committee andchaired by their adviser. In this exam,students are questioned on their thirdarea examination and their dissertationproposal. If a student fails the oralexam, she or he will have the opportu-nity to retake it in the next semester.The oral exam must be successfullycompleted before a student may beginwriting the dissertation and in order fora student to be eligible to receive a dis-sertation award. Doctoral Committee : Each student must select two faculty members toserve as members of the core committeealongside his or her adviser. All stu-dents must have their dissertation pro-posal approved by their adviser and twocommittee members to be eligible toreceive a dissertation award.

No student should begin the final draft of the dissertation until he or shehas consulted (in person, except inextraordinary circumstances) with allthree of the core members of his or herdissertation committee. Where possi-ble, core members should receive a copyof each chapter of the dissertation as it is drafted. Dissertation Defense: When the final draft of the dissertation has beenapproved by the core committee, thestudent establishes a date for the disser-tation defense and submits the finaldraft to the additional examining read-ers. The date of the dissertation defensemust be set at least three weeks after allcommittee members have received thefinal draft. Following the defense, theexamining committee votes on whetheror not to accept the dissertation; thecommittee has the option of passing thedissertation \"with distinction. \" Doctoral Dissertation: A dissertation title card and a preliminary outline ofthe dissertation are kept on file in thecandidate 's department. The disserta- tion must show the ability to follow anapproved method of scholarly investiga-tion and evidence of exhaustive study ofa special field. It should add to theknowledge of the subject or represent anew, significant interpretation. Everydissertation should contain a clearintroductory statement and a summaryof results. The dissertation mustinclude an analytical table of contentsand a bibliography and, when submit-ted to the Degree and Diploma Officeof the Office of the UniversityRegistrar, must meet formattingrequirements and be accompanied byan abstract. A doctoral candidate must complete all requirements no later than ten yearsfrom matriculation into the M.A. pro-gram or seven years from the time ofmatriculation into the Ph.D. program ifthe candidate already holds the master 's degree.

Faculty members offercourses that embrace the ancientand modern periods of world lit-erature and explore critical, the-oretical, and historical issues andproblems of representation inthe broadest sense. This type ofanalysis expands the field of lit-erature to include a wide varietyof cultural practices \u2014from his- torical, philosophical, and legaltexts to artifacts of visual and popular culture \u2014revealing the roles literature plays as a form ofmaterial expression and sym-bolic exchange. Focus falls onhow literature is defined at spe-cific times or in specific places;how rhetoric, genre, and aes-thetic styles create literary lan-guage; and how such languageinflects or transforms social cate-gories of gender, race, and power.

The general test of theGraduate Record Examination (GRE) isrequired of all M.S. applicants. Ph.D.applicants must submit GRE generaltest scores plus the computer sciencesubject test score. Applicants whosenative language is not English mustsubmit the Test of English as a ForeignLanguage (TOEFL) scores. The minimum prerequisite back- ground for admission to the M.S. pro-gram consists of 1. Languages: Deep working knowl- edge of C and familiarity with object-oriented concepts and work with someobject-oriented language such as Javaor C++. 2. Data structures and mathematics: Understanding and working knowl-edge of pointers, lists, stacks, queues,trees, arrays, and recursion; induction,order of magnitude growth, probablityand elementary combinatorics, setnotation. 3. Working familiarity with Windows and Unix. Promising students who do not have this background will be conditionallyadmitted with the priviso that theycomplete the one-year preparatorycourse (PAC). Students without ade- quate mathematical training shouldtake Discrete Mathematics, which isoffered in the summer only. In addition, applicants to the M.S. program in information systems areexpected to have at least two years ofwork experience in the software industry. It should be emphasized that these are minimum requirements and thatadditional undergraduate study in com-puter science and mathematics is desir-able. In mathematics, study of discretestructures, logic, abstract algebra, graphtheory, and numerical methods is espe-cially relevant. The published syllabusfor the GRE subject exam in computerscience is a good guide to appropriateadvanced undergraduate study in com-puter science. On entry, students areexpected to be competent C program-mers and to have a good understandingof assembly language; this is assumedin all graduate computer science cours-es, including first-year core courses.Students who are not proficient in Cmust remedy this deficiency beforebeginning graduate study.

For courses requiring programming, students may use the CourantInstitute 's computing facilities. PREPARATORY ACCELERATED COURSE (PAC) PROGRAM Applicants to the master 's programs who have insufficient background incomputer science but are otherwiseadmissible are referred to PAC. Thisprogram is a series of two courses (partone, which is offered in the fall, andpart two, in the spring) intended to fillin the minimum prerequisites forbeginning a master 's program in com- puter science or information systems.Those admitted to the M.S. programwith the requirement to complete PACare considered M.S. degree studentswhile they are enrolled in PAC courses,although the credits for the courses donot count toward the M.S. degree. Applicants may choose to apply to PAC directly, if they feel certain ofneeding the prerequisites for graduatestudy. In this case, prospective studentswould apply to the nondegree program.When in doubt, applicants are encour-aged to apply for the degree that theyultimately want. Note: International applicants are generally unable to obtain student visasto take PAC.

Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documen-tary and related issues in cinema andmedia studies.4. Careers in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such asspecialized programming and distribu-tion of ethnographic film and video,community-based documentary pro-duction, management of ethnographicfilm/video libraries and archives, orwork in new media. The program 's philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationshipsbetween culture and media in a num-ber of domains including ethnographicfilm's significance for the fields of anthropology and cinema/media stud-ies; problems in representation of cul-tures through media; the developmentof media in indigenous, diaspora, andnon-Western communities; the emerg-ing social and cultural formationsshaped by new media practices; andthe political economy shaping the pro-duction, distribution, and consump-tion of media worldwide. INTERNSHIPS The program can arrange supervisedinternships for course credit, tailoredto individual research and professionalinterests. Students work in a variety ofprogramming and production posi-tions for institutions, such as 1. American Museum of Natural History/Margaret Mead Film Festival 2. National Museum of the American Indian, Film-Video Center 3. The Asia Society4. The Jewish Museum RESOURCES The Department of Anthropology has a film and multisystem video theatrethat seats up to 40 and has an excel-lent collection of over 600 ethno-graphic film and video works. TheDepartment of Cinema Studies has acollection of over 1,000 films. NewYork University 's Avery Fisher Music and Media Center has over 2,000 doc-Courses Culture and Media I G14.1215 Ginsburg, McLagan. 4 points. This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnograph-ic film, the central debates it hasengaged around cross-cultural repre-sentation, and the theoretical and cine-matic responses to questions of thescreen representation of culture, fromthe early romantic constructions ofRobert Flaherty to current work infilm, television, and video on the partof indigenous people throughout theworld. Ethnographic film has a pecu-liar and highly contested status withinanthropology, cinema studies, and doc-umentary practice. This seminar situ-ates ethnographic film within thewider project of the representation ofcultural lives, and especially of\"natives. \" Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of thegenre, the course examines how theseemerged in a particular intellectualcontext and political economy. It thenconsiders the key works that havedefined the genre and the epistemo- logical and formal innovations associ-ated with them, addressing questionsconcerning social theory, documentary,as well as the institutional structuresthrough which they are funded, dis-tributed, and seen by various audi-ences. Throughout, the course keeps inmind the properties of film as a signi-fying practice, its status as a form ofanthropological knowledge, and theethical and political concerns raised bycross-cultural representation. Culture and Media II: Ethnography of Media G14.1216 Ginsburg, McLagan. 4 points. In the last decade, a new field \u2014the ethnography of media \u2014has emerged as an exciting new arena of research.While claims about media in people 's lives are made on a daily basis, surpris-ingly little research has actuallyattempted to look at how media ispart of the naturally occurring livedrealities of people 's lives. In the lastdecade, anthropologists and media scholars interested in film, television,and video have been turning theirattention increasingly beyond the textand the empiricist notions of audiences(stereotypically associated with theethnography of media), to consider,ethnographically, the complex socialworlds in which media is produced,circulated, and consumed, at home andelsewhere. This work theorizes mediastudies from the point of view of cross-cultural ethnographic realities andanthropology from the perspective ofnew spaces of communication focusingon the social, economic, and politicallife of media and how it makes a dif-ference in the daily lives of people as apractice, whether in production, recep-tion, or circulation. After some introductory sessions on precursors to the current research dur-ing and after World War II and thenew scholarship on the broad historicaland ideological context that shapedearly ethnographic film, the class is CULTURE AND MEDIA 97umentaries available to students in its video library facility. In addition, someof the best film, video, and broadcastlibraries are available in New YorkCity, including the Donnell FilmLibrary, Museum of Modern Art FilmLibrary, and National Museum of theAmerican Indian Film and VideoArchive.

Social Anthropology Theory and Practice G14.1010 Myers. 4 points. This course is intended to acquaint graduate students in anthropologywith some core issues in social/culturalanthropology. It cannot pretend to bea comprehensive introduction to thediscipline; matters are too complex.Instead it seeks to highlight basicissues in social theory and the relation-ship of theory and ethnographic prac-tice. It proceeds through a considera-tion of key controversies within thefield and through mapping some con-temporary directions. Although thecourse covers material from the 19ththrough the 20th centuries, it is not ahistory of anthropological thought;students are expected to complementthis course with History ofAnthropology (G14.1636) and a life-time of reading in anthropology andrelated fields.

V . Starr Center for Applied EconomicsFaculty of Arts and Science, 269 Mercer Street, 3rd Floor, New York, NY10003-6687; (212) 998-8936 Director: Professor Mark Gertler Assistant Director: Ms. Anne Stubing Graduate students in the Department of Economics at New York Universitymay participate in the research of theinternationally renowned C. V . StarrCenter for Applied Economics.Students have the opportunity to asso-ciate with the Center 's prominent visi- tors and distinguished research scholars. PURPOSE The C. V . Starr Center for AppliedEconomics is the research branch of theDepartment of Economics at New YorkUniversity. The Center seeks to bridge the gap between academic research andeconomic decisions in both businessand government. The Center analyzesissues of important economic and socialconsequences to improve tomorrow 's economic decisions. These goals arepursued by the Center in three ways:analysis of current economic issues,design of tools to facilitate economicdecision making in the future, andwide dissemination of research resultsthrough publications, seminars, andconferences. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES The research activities of the Center areorganized into two categories: short-term projects and long-term projects. Short-term projects are major research projects that seek to completea specific piece of applied economicresearch in a period not exceeding 12months. Long-term projects are major research endeavors focusing on topics ofsuch fundamental intellectual impor-tance that one can expect the projectwill be continued past the terminationof the Center 's funding. These projects typically involve at least two membersof the Center/Department of Economicsat New York University. VISITORS PROGRAM Since its inception, the Center hasECONOMICS 101funded a vigorous visitors program for leading academics from both theUnited States and abroad. These visitorshave immersed themselves in manyCenter research activities, including seminar presentations, working paperpublications, and research collabora-tions. Because of the Center 's close affil-iation with the Department of Economics, graduate students have theopportunity to exchange ideas withthese distinguished visitors. Programs and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to graduate studies in economics is limited to stu-dents of outstanding promise. Allapplicants must take the general test ofthe Graduate Record Examination(GRE), administered by theEducational Testing Service, Princeton,NJ 08540. All international studentsmust take the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL). Exceptionsto this rule include students whoattended English-speaking college-levelinstitutions. Students from English-speaking countries, such as the UnitedKingdom or Ireland, are also exemptfrom taking the TOEFL. The M.A. program is designed to accommodate both full-time and part-time students. The Ph.D. program isdesigned for full-time students only.Any student applying to the M.A. pro-gram should have mastered intermedi-ate-level microeconomics and macro-economics, at least one semester of cal-culus, as well as one semester of statis-tics. For students applying to the Ph.D.program, the M.A. requirements shouldbe supplemented by at least one addi-tional semester of calculus and onecourse in linear algebra. In evaluatingapplicants for either of the above pro-grams, members of the departmentaladmissions committee consider the fol-lowing criteria: previous academic per-formance, quantitative GRE scores, let-ters of recommendation, personal state-ment, and economics as well as mathe-matics backgrounds. Because of thediverse nature of such information, theadmissions committee does not adhereto strictly defined cutoff points ongrade point averages or GRE scores. All incoming Ph.D. students are guaranteed financial aid, renewable forfour years, conditioned on satisfactoryacademic performance. Financial sup-port includes certain obligations to pro-vide teaching assistance and may beconditioned on the presence or absenceof outside funding. There is no fundingfor M.A. students. It is important to note that stu- dents who want to enter the Ph.D.program should NOT start off withthe M.A. program. The Ph.D. andM.A. programs are separate and dis-tinct; entry into the M.A. programdoes NOT guarantee entry into thePh.D. program.MASTER OF ARTS Course of Study: Formal requirements for the Master of Arts degree in eco-nomics are the satisfactory completionof graduate studies totaling at least32 points (at least 24 in residence atNew York University) and the writingof a thesis. Most courses carry 3 points,while the thesis is usually written in areading and research course for the final2 points. Students must maintain a Baverage to graduate. Course requirements include Mathematics for Economists(G31.1001), Microeconomic Theory(G31.1003), Macroeconomic Theory(G31.1005), Applied Statistics andEconometrics and Econometrics II(G31.1102), plus five elective courses.Students may take two approved cours-es outside the Department ofEconomics. One-Year Master of Arts: While full- time students normally complete theM.A. program in one and a half to twoyears, this accelerated option allowsoutstanding students to complete thedegree in a single year by starting inthe summer. Applicants should indicatetheir interest in this option on theirapplication and should begin theirstudies in the summer by takingrequired core courses. MASTER OF ARTS AND ADVANCED CERTIFICATEPROGRAM IN APPLIED ECO-NOMIC ANALYSIS The department offers specialized pro- grams in industry analysis, economicdevelopment and planning, and inter-national economics. Participating stu-dents must take the required corecourses (listed above) and complete theM.A. thesis. After receiving the M.A.degree, students may continue theirstudies to earn an advanced certificatewith the opportunity to focus on one ofthe following areas of study. (Theadvanced certificate option is also avail-able to qualified master 's-level students holding degrees from institutions otherthan New York University.) A mini-mum of six specialized courses isrequired. When certain required cours-es are not offered, the department maysubstitute other appropriate courses tosatisfy the requirements for the advanced certificate. Industry Analysis: This area of study aims to produce economists who canunderstand current business conditionsand proposed government economicpolicies (both macro and micro) andexplain these conditions and policies tononeconomists; evaluate forecasts offuture economic activity at the macrolevel and assess their implications for aparticular industry; undertake a com-plete analysis of the industry, includingits institutional characteristics and fac-tors that determine industry supply anddemand conditions; and act as a linkbetween the corporation and major sup-pliers of economic information. Requirements include the core cours- es; G31.2208, 2209; and Economic andFinancial Forecasting (B30.2361). Atotal of 32 points and a master 's thesis complete the M.A. requirements.

Schain ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER: Professor Jan Tomasz Gross he Center sup- ports and pro-motes the studyof contemporary Europe, both West and East,within the College and theGraduate School of Arts and Sci-ence and between the latter andthe professional schools of theUniversity. It complementsexisting European programs inboth the humanities and thesocial sciences, such as the Insti-tute of French Studies, the pro-gram in Italian studiescoordinated by the Casa ItalianaZerilli-Marim \u00f2, and the Alexan- der S. Onassis Program in Hel-lenic Studies, by offering coursesand lectures on other majorWestern European societies andcultures as well as on Centraland Eastern Europe. It alsooffers courses, research opportu-nities, and noncurricular lectures and seminars on the EuropeanCommunity and on Europeanissues that transcend nationalborders. Normally, the Centerdoes not offer courses in subjectsthat are covered by other depart-ments. The Center offers anundergraduate major and minorin European studies as well as aMaster of Arts program. The programs, activities, and funding opportunities offered bythe Center and listed below arepartly supported by funds fromthe U.S. Department of Educa-tion, which in 1991 designatedthe Center, along with Europeancenters at Columbia Universityand New School University, as aNational Resource Center forWestern Europe, which admin-isters the Foreign Language andArea Studies (FLAS) FellowshipProgram. The three units oper-ate together as the New YorkConsortium for European Stud-ies in outreach efforts towardother schools and colleges in theregion, research planning, andthe sharing of visiting lecturers. In 2001, the Center for Euro- pean Studies, together withNew School University and CityUniversity of New York, wasredesignated one of 15 Centersof Excellence for the Study ofthe European Union in theUnited States. The Center was also awarded two additional grants from theFund for the Improvement ofPostsecondary Education(FIPSE) to fund two projectsthat will provide graduate train-ing to students interested incomparing the European Unionand the United States as federalsystems and to those interestedin issues of transnationalism,international migration, race,ethnocentrism, and the state. The Center represents the University in the Council forEuropean Studies, a nationalassociation of European pro-grams, and in expanding rela-tions with similar programs inEuropean universities. THE LILLIAN VERNON CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 58 WEST 10TH STREET NEW YORK, NY 10011-8702 (212) 998-3838 FAX: (212) 995-4188 TPrograms and RequirementsMASTER OF ARTS The Master of Arts program in European studies is an interdisciplinaryprogram in the social sciences andhumanities designed to prepare stu-dents for professions requiring anadvanced understanding of Europe. Theprogram draws upon the establishedresources of existing country programsin French studies, Italian studies, andHellenic studies, as well as the discipli-nary programs, and also offers courses ofits own. M.A. students choose one ofthree tracks for specialization: Europeanpolitics and society or humanities, cul-tural trends in Western and/or EastCentral Europe, and European Unionstudies. Special programs of study arealso possible. Ten courses (40 points) as well as a thesis and an oral examination arerequired for the M.A. degree.Knowledge of a European language(other than English) at the advancedlevel is also required. Students canprove this advanced knowledge eitherby having completed during theirundergraduate studies an advanced-level language course or by passing theGSAS language requirement examina-tion prior to graduation. Knowledge ofa second European language is alsoencouraged. An internship approved bythe M.A. adviser is recommended. Of the 10 courses, two (one in histo- ry, the other a seminar in Europeanstudies) are required, and two othersmust be chosen from the program 's core courses in either the social sciences orthe humanities, depending on which ofthe two tracks the student chooses forspecialization. Five additional coursesare taken in the chosen track. Aninternship (4 points/one course),arranged and approved by the Center, isaccepted as the final course. Studentsmay take a research seminar in lieu ofan internship, with the approval of theCenter. The M.A. thesis, normally therevised version of a research paper com-pleted in the field, is defended at anoral examination. STUDY ABROAD Candidates for the M.A. degree inEuropean studies are encouraged tospend one semester abroad.The Center for European Studies at NYU, as part of the TIRES(Transnationalism, International migra-tion, Race, Ethnocentrism and theState) consortium, representing eightU.S. and European universities, hasreceived a three-year grant from theFund for the Improvement ofPostsecondary Education (FIPSE, U.S.Department of Education) for a pro-gram to promote collaborative teachingand research on issues related to TIRES. The consortium 's focus is on training students to understand the dynamics ofstate policies ' on refugees and immi- grants, especially with regard to howthese are evolving under the impact ofincreasing transnational integration andpopular reactions against expandedimmigration. These reactions havesometimes taken the form of extremexenophobic or nativist social move-ments. NYU students are able to take courses at the Europa-Universit \u00e4t the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po). RESEARCH WORKSHOPS AND EVENTS Research Workshops: These ongoing study groups are made up of facultyand graduate students, principally fromNew York University and New SchoolUniversity, and aim to help refine anddesign research projects, both individ-ual and collective. Application formembership in any one academic yearmay be made to the workshop directorsnoted below. Currently the organized workshops are as follows: European Culture andArts (Dorothy Nelkin, Sociology; VeraZolberg, Theory Workshop(Bertell Ollman). Humanities Council Faculty Colloquia: Two series of public lectures are organized by the Center in coopera-tion with the Humanities Council, pri-marily to bring specialists from Europeand from other American universities tothe NYU community. The Colloquiumon East European Politics and Societyprovides a forum for comparative dis-cussion of the political, economic, andsocial transitions occurring in theregion and the continuing evolution ofgovernments there. The Colloquium on Western European Politics and Society exploresthe historical and contemporary rela-tionship between European politics andchanges in European social and eco-nomic systems. Speakers from theUnited States and Europe focus on suchproblems as immigration, industrialconversion, class relations, the politicalconstruction of Europe, nationalism,and the relationship between politicsand culture. Conferences: From time to time, the Center organizes national or regionalconferences on European subjects, opento faculty and graduate students. The2000-2001 conferences included \"The New Face of the European City:Immigration in an Urban Perspective, \" hosted by the New York Consortiumfor European Studies with partial fund-ing from the U.S. Department ofEducation. Film Festival: Each year the Center for European Studies addresses timely andrelevant European issues through itsfilm series. After each film, a distin-guished panel leads the audience in dis-cussion. All events are free and open tothe public. The spring 2001 film series, \"The View of Innocence: Europe and Its Childrenon Film ,\" will screen five films that aim to depict events in the history of 20th-century Europe as felt and understoodby children and their families:Everybody 's Fine (Giusseppe Tornatore, 1990), Europa, Europa (Agnieszka Holland, 1990), The Dark Years (Arantxa Lazcano, 1992), Anna: From 124 EUROPEAN STUDIESADVISORY COMMITTEE Edward Berenson, History, French Studies; Tom Bishop, French, Comparative Literature; Herrick Chapman, History, French Studies;Francesco Erspamer, Italian Studies; James D.

Of the 36 points taken in lecturecourses, seminars, colloquia, and read-ing courses for independent study, atleast one course must be taken in fourof the six following major areas:(1) East Asia, India, and Islam;(2) ancient Near East, Egyptian, Greek,and Roman; (3) Early Christian,Byzantine, and Western medieval art to1400; (4) Western art, 1400 to 1780;(5) Western art, 1780 to the present;and (6) arts of Africa, Oceania, and theAmericas. In addition, one coursemust be taken in the conservation ofworks of art. Students planning to specialize in East Asian art may, with the writtenapproval of their advisers, take two ofthe distribution requirement courseslisted under (1) above. T wo Qualifying Papers for the Master's Degree: One qualifying paper is required in each of two differentmajor areas, as defined above. Eachpaper is written under the direction of adifferent instructor. The papers must bein publishable form. Topics may bedeveloped from seminar reports, fromthe first-term paper, in connection witha lecture course, or independently inconsultation with a faculty member.For students enrolled in the conserva-tion training program, one qualifyingterm paper may be supervised by amember of the conservation faculty. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Qualifying as a Matriculant for thePh.D. Degree: The applicant must have fulfilled all requirements for theM.A. degree in art history and be spon-sored by a faculty member. A studententering the Institute with a master 's degree must complete all M.A. degreerequirements of the Institute of FineArts (or provide evidence of equivalentwork) within one academic year.During this probationary period, thestudent must also find a faculty spon-sor. Students may be requested to showa reading knowledge of languages nec-essary for their special fields of study. 130 FINE ARTSStudents completing the master 's degree at the Institute may take up to8 points of additional course workbefore acceptance into the Ph.D. pro-gram. These courses are taken entirelyat the student 's risk and must be approved by the director of graduatestudies and the student 's adviser. Candidacy Interview and Faculty Review: Acceptance into the Ph.D pro- gram is determined by (1) an interviewwith a three-member faculty committeeat the time the student completes allInstitute of Fine Arts requirements forthe M.A. degree and (2) an all-facultyreview of the student 's record and the results of the interview. Timing: The interview must be held before the end of the first term aftercompleting the requirements for theM.A. degree, except in the case of stu-dents holding an M.A. degree obtainedelsewhere, who must schedule theinterview no later than the end of theirsecond term of residence. Reviews bythe full faculty are scheduled inSeptember, January, and May of eachyear. (See the calendar in theAnnouncement of Courses for dates.) Sponsorship: Application for the inter- view must be sponsored by a regularmember of the Institute faculty.Adjunct professors may serve as cospon-sors only if a regular faculty memberhas first agreed to serve as sponsor.Advisers from other institutions canserve as dissertation advisers onlythrough prior arrangement between aregular faculty member and the studentand with the permission of the directorof graduate studies. Character of the Interview: The inter- view is administered by a committee ofthe faculty and is oral. The student dis-cusses his or her proposed program ofstudy, i.e., choice of major and minorconcentrations and possibly the subjector area he or she expects to treat in thedissertation. The committee, in review-ing the student 's record, assesses his or her basic knowledge of the history ofart as well as intellectual qualificationsand understanding of the areas inwhich the student plans to work. Amajor factor in determining the stu-dent's eligibility for matriculation for the Ph.D. degree is the evaluation ofthe student 's proposed program in rela- tion to the quality of his or her previ-ous qualifying papers, seminar reports,and course work. For those entering with an M.A. degree, admission to the Institute doesnot imply acceptance of all graduatecourses taken prior to enrollment at theInstitute. If transfer of such courses isdesired, the candidate must petition the faculty for approval immediately fol-lowing acceptance into the doctoralprogram. Distribution of Course Points: A total of 72 points is required for thePh.D. degree, including the 36required for the M.A. degree. At least24 points (or 16 beyond the M.A.degree) must be in classroom seminars,8 of these outside the student 's major area of study. Of the total 72 points, 8may be taken as the internship in cura-torial studies. With the prior written consent of the director of graduate studies and aninstructor, one or more SpecialProblems courses may be taken individ-ually with a faculty member in lieu oflecture courses or, in exceptional cases,of a seminar. Students specializing in East Asian, ancient Near Eastern, Egyptian, andIslamic art may be allowed up to 16points for undergraduate languagestudy in their field; 8 of these may betaken for the M.A. degree. Final Examination in Major and Minor Concentrations: Students matriculated for the Ph.D. degree arerequired to pass examinations in onemajor and two minor concentrations. Acandidate may not take the final exami-nation, or any part thereof, more thantwice. Timing: A student may take the examination in the major and relatedminor concentrations in the term inwhich the required classroom coursesare completed, but no later than thefollowing term. Character of the Examinations: Two examinations, one written in the minorthat is unrelated to the major; the otherin the major and related minor (oraland written). Students may requestexemption from examination in theunrelated minor if they have completedthree courses (including a seminar)within the respective concentrationwith an average of B+ or better. Major and Minor Concentrations: Each field listed constitutes a minor concen-tration. Normally two contiguous fieldsconstitute a major concentration. Anadditional concentration, the relatedminor, must be directly related to themajor, while a second concentration,the unrelated minor, should be distinct-ly removed from the major. A relatedminor outside the history of art isencouraged, and, in the special areas ofstudy of East Asian art and archaeology,classical art and archaeology, and NearEastern art and archaeology, it isrequired. The minor fields from which a student selects the major and minorconcentrations for examination are:(1) prehistoric and protohistoric art ofthe Old (2) African and Oceanicart; (3) pre-Columbian art; (4) earlyChinese art through the Han Dynasty;(5) Chinese art from the Northern andSouthern Dynasties to the YuanDynasty; (6) later Chinese art, MingDynasty to the present; (7) Chinese pic-torial art; (8) Japanese art, ca. 600-1300; (9) Japanese art, ca. 1300 to thepresent; (10) Buddhist art; (11) Indianart (non-Muslim); (12) of art; (15) Aegean Greek art; Roman art;(18) early Christian through Carolingianart; (19) Byzantine art; (20) Islamic artto the Mongol conquest, 690-1250;(21) Islamic art after the Mongol con-quest, 1250-1800; (22) Romanesqueart; (23) Gothic art; (24) to1500; (25) Italian art of the16th century; (26) art outside Italy from1400 to 1600; (27) art in Italy, France,and Spain from about 1580 to the endof the 17th century; (28) art of theNetherlands, Germany, and Englandfrom about 1580 to the end of the 17thcentury; (29) European (includingEnglish) and American art from 1660to 1780; (30) European (includingEnglish) and American art from 1780to the end of the 19th century; (31) artof the 20th century; (32) LatinAmerican art; (33) conservation andtechnology, in relation to a field orfields designated above, upon petitionto the faculty. Dissertation Proposal: A dissertation proposal must be approved by theentire faculty, usually prior to the majororal examination. A Special Problemscourse may be taken with the adviser inpreparation of the proposal. The pro-posal consists of a statement describingthe project and current research (1,000words maximum), a chapter outline(one page), and a short bibliography. Dissertation: The dissertation is nor- mally no longer than 250 pages of text.Permission to exceed this limit can begranted only through petition to thefaculty. It is expected that the complet-ed dissertation will be submitted with-in four years of the completion of themajor oral examination. In addition tothe copy of the dissertation required bythe Graduate School of Arts andScience, candidates are required to file asecond copy with the Institute of FineArts. Further information may beobtained from the Academic Office.FINE ARTS 131Final Oral Defense of the Dissertation: Each candidate in the Institute of Fine Arts submits to a finaloral defense of the dissertation before acommittee of five scholars, three ofwhom are members of the GSAS facul-ty. Scholars who are not members of theInstitute may be invited to consider the dissertation and take part in theproceedings.

CONSERVATION CENTER The Institute 's Conservation Center at 14 East 78th Street is dedicated to thestudy of the technology and conservationof works of art and historic artifacts. TheCenter prepares students for careers inconservation through a four-year pro-gram that combines practical experiencein conservation with art historical,archaeological, curatorial, and scientificstudies of the materials and constructionof works of art. Students participate inresearch projects, laboratory work, andseminars in special areas of conservation,such as climatology or the problems ofethnographic and archaeological arti-facts, and gain intensive conservationexperience through advanced fieldworkand an internship. Conservation studentsmay elect to obtain additional conserva-tion experience during summer archaeo-logical excavations or other formal workprojects. The Center provides special courses for students pursuing studies in art his-tory, archaeology, and curatorial studies,which are intended to acquaint themwith the physical structure of works ofart, the need for conservation, and thepossibilities and limitations of conser-vation. These students participate inresearch projects, laboratory work, andcourses dealing with materials, care,repair, and presentation of objects. Admission: Candidates for admission to the conservation training programmust first satisfy the requirements foradmission to the Institute of Fine Artsas candidates for the M.A. degree in thehistory of art as described above. In addition, applicants must have a mini-mum of four semesters of science (twosemesters must be in organic chemistry)at the college level with grades of B orbetter. Candidates must also presentevidence of familiarity with a range ofartists ' materials as demonstrated by a portfolio. Candidates for the master 's degree in art history at the Institute may applyfor transfer to the conservation trainingprogram after completing the requisitescience and studio preparation. The maximum number of students admitted per year is eight. One or twoself-supported students from abroadmay be accepted each year as specialstudents or observers. Course of Study: A total of 69 points is required for the combined M.A.degree in art history and AdvancedCertificate in Conservation. Six art his-tory courses (24 points) in three majorareas must be taken, including at leasttwo seminars that must be in two dif-ferent areas. Fifteen conservation cours-es (45 points), a noncredit course inmicroscopy, and a noncredit internshipmust also be taken. The student normally registers for two consecutive semesters for theinternship, which may be taken in aconservation establishment, either inthis country or abroad, selected toafford the best possible training in thestudent 's area of specialization. Arrangements are made in consultationwith the chair of the ConservationCenter. All requirements for the M.A. degree offered by the Institute, including lan-guages, first-term paper, timing, aca-demic standards, and two qualifyingpapers, apply equally to students in theconservation training program.

This contextis very important, as it grows more andmore distant from our own time andculture, for French no less than forAmerican students. On the other hand,just as any director must stage thoseplays from a contemporary viewpoint,the critic must also interpret themwith today 's tools (philosophical, psy- choanalytical, etc.) The student 's per- sonal involvement (extensive reading)is essential.

Andr Masson, Pierre Mabille, an indelible on theFrancophone Caribbean. Notions of cre-ole culture, le merveilleux, and anti-essentialist thought proposed byJacques Ren \u00e9 Depestre, Magloire St. Aude, Edouard Glissant,and arguably in the later Aim \u00e9 C\u00e9saire can be traced back to this period andmakes a radical break with the Sartreanpoetics of authenticity that markParisian n \u00e9gritude after the forties. Neither Nomads nor Nationalists: Identity Redefined in RecentFrancophone Writings Dash. 4 points. This course examines recent Francophone writing, especially experi-mental prose fiction from theFrancophone Caribbean. In many ways,this writing emerges in the wake of thepostmodern insistence on the nontran-scendental and the particular as well ason the absence of grand narratives forcontemporary writing. However, thesenovels also represent a reaction againstthe idealogical binarisms of the post-modern by exploring a pluralistic uni-versalism and a transnational cos-mopolitanism.

This course, intended to develop stu- dents ' writing abilities in French fic- tion, is meant for advanced studentswho command near-native fluency inFrench. It resembles other advancedworkshops in creative writing, such asthat given in the Department ofEnglish (G41.1920). Discussion andanalysis of student work in one ormore fictional modes (short story orshort novel) is the focus of this course.The approach is both theoretical andpractical.

While the traditional history of litera- ture focuses primarily on describing,evaluating, and classifying literary phe-nomena in terms of their nature, signif-icance, and order of appearance, histori-cal poetics seeks to define the system inwhich these phenomena function andwhich, though coherent, is subject tohistorical and generic variabilities. Aseach of these approaches to literary his-tory has its merits, the objective of thiscourse is to examine literature of theFrench Renaissance from both perspec-tives\u2014a panoramic view of French lit- erature from the late Middle Agesthrough the early Baroque and aninvestigation of the correlation betweenliterary discourse of the Renaissance eraand literary discourse in general or,strictly speaking, Honor \u00e9 d'Urf\u00e9, Rousseau, Louis S \u00e9bastien course focuses on retracing the evolution ofthe theme of the Golden Age up until1789, all the while dealing with a moretheoretical perspective of an old ques-tion, which regained popularitythrough the works of Claude Bremondand Thomas Pavel: What is a literarytheme? Autobiography as Novel: The Birth of a Genre Doubrovsky. 4 points. Autobiography, long neglected by criti- cal studies, has become a major trend incontemporary French writing. Mostcritical theorists contrast, as antithetical\"genres, \" autobiography, which strives to retrieve the true story of a man 's life as narrated by himself, and fiction,which invents a fanciful tale of imagi-nary characters.

Furtherdetails on the joint M.A. program withjournalism are available in the applica-tion at the back of this bulletin andalso from the Institute. THE DOCTORAL PROGRAMS The Institute offers small, highly selec-tive doctoral programs that prepare stu-dents for careers involving research andteaching on contemporary France. Theprograms offer two kinds of Ph.D.degrees: (1) the Ph.D. degree in Frenchcivilization, focusing on French societyand culture rather than on literature andlanguage; and (2) the joint Ph.D. degreein French studies and either anthropolo-gy, history, politics, or French literature. Admission: Students applying for a joint Ph.D. with anthropology, French,history, and politics submit a singleapplication, which must then beapproved by both the IFS and the part-ner department. In most cases, bothapprovals will be granted at the time ofacceptance to the IFS, but partnerdepartments will sometimes deferapproval until the second or third yearof study. (Students applying for thePh.D. degree in French studies requireacceptance only by the IFS.) Studentsinitially admitted to an M.A. programwho wish to continue on to a Ph.D.must formally apply for the Ph.D. pro-gram of their choice. Only a few suchapplications will be approved. Course of Study: The Ph.D. programs all require successful completion of72 points of course work, a written andoral qualifying examination, and a doc-toral dissertation. All students mustfirst complete the requirements for themaster 's degree (see M.A. course144 FRENCH STUDIESrequirements described above). Remaining course work is chosen fromInstitute offerings and from coursesoffered by other departments (mainlyanthropology, French, history, or poli-tics) according to the kind of doctoratepursued, the area of specialization, andcareer interests of the student. Full-time students usually take three coursesper term and finish their courserequirements in three years. Most doctoral students spend one or two semesters of their third year inParis, where they take courses at theFrench institutions with which theInstitute has formal exchange agree-ments: the Ecole des Hautes Etudes 'Etudes Politiques, and the Ecole NormaleSup\u00e9rieure. Full New York University course credit is given for courses suc-cessfully completed in Paris. With theiradviser 's permission, students may work at other Paris institutions, such asthe University of Paris. After returning to New York, Ph.D. candidates who have completed72 points of course work design a dis-sertation research project and take thewritten and oral qualifying examinationfor the Ph.D. After successfully com-pleting this examination and obtainingapproval of a dissertation proposal, stu-dents generally spend a year in France(normally their fifth year of matricula-tion) conducting dissertation research.Sixth-year students typically have com-pleted their research and spend the yearwriting their dissertation. Once the dis-sertation has been accepted, all Ph.D.candidates must defend their work in afinal oral examination. The Ph.D.therefore normally requires six to sevenyears of full-time study. Ph.D. Program in French Studies The Ph.D. program in French studies provides the student with a broadknowledge of French society and cul-ture as well as a concentration in a spe-cialized field of interest to be defined inconsultation with faculty advisers. Thisprogram prepares graduates for teach-ing civilization courses in Frenchdepartments. Joint Ph.D. Programs The joint Ph.D. programs in French studies and anthropology, history, andpolitics combine multidisciplinary approaches to the study of contempo-rary France with rigorous disciplinarytraining in one of the social sciences,history, or literature. Joint degree can-didates normally pursue programssupervised by advisers from both theInstitute and the disciplinary depart-ment concerned. Joint degrees preparestudents for teaching in history orsocial science departments and/or in the\"civilization \" track of French depart- ments. The joint degree with Frenchprepares for teaching in both the civi-lization and literature tracks in Frenchdepartments. Students in joint degree programs divide their 72 points of course workevenly between the Institute and thedisciplinary department, with mostInstitute course work being completedprior to receiving the M.A. degree andmost disciplinary work being complet-ed after receiving the M.A. degree. ThePh.D. qualifying examination for eachof the joint programs consists of sec-tions on French studies, on the disci-pline in question, and on the integra-tion of the two. Examiners include fac-ulty from both the Institute and therelevant department. Similarly, the dis-sertation defense committee includesfaculty from both units.

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: The Department of History accepts applicants for falladmission only. Applicants must show aminimum undergraduate grade pointaverage of 3.3 to be considered, andGraduate Record Examination (GRE)scores are required. A complete applica-tion includes a sample of academic writ-ing, a personal statement, and three let-ters of recommendation.

Consult theapplication at the back of this bulletin for application deadline information. MASTER OF ARTS The program for the master 's degree in history offers students graduate workthat serves a variety of needs and pur-poses. It can be an end in itself for stu-dents whose personal and/or profession-al goal is an M.A. degree. It can becombined with a certificate in thearchives or public history, or world his-tory program. It can be used to earn aspecialized degree in women 's history or world history. Last, the M.A. can be apreparatory graduate degree en route to the doctorate. Thus, many NYU students enroll in the M.A. program because they needbackground for their interests andcareers, for example, as secondary schoolteachers, writers, or filmmakers or inpublic service. A significant proportionof these students begin master 's work after being out of academia for sometime, and many elect to study part timewhile maintaining a full work schedule.The department particularly encouragesnontraditional students who are study-ing part time to attend graduate stu-162 HISTORYdent events when possible, get to know their colleagues, and take time to workwith their advisers and with the facultyand to recognize their own valuable andrespected presence in the department. The Master of Arts degree requires the completion of 32 points, of whichat least 24 must be within the historydepartment. No more than 8 pointsmay be transferred from other graduateschools. A request for transfer creditsmust be made within the first year ofenrollment. There is no area specializa-tion requirement at the master 's level, but students must take at least oneseminar in which a substantial researchpaper is completed. The student mustachieve a grade of B or better in theseminar. There is no general language require- ment. However, a student specializingin Middle Eastern history for an M.A.degree must demonstrate proficiency inArabic, Persian, or Turkish by passing,with a grade of B or better, at least twocourses at the advanced level or beyondin one of those languages. Students who expect to apply for admission to the Ph.D. program shouldconsult with their advisers during theirM.A. studies regarding the applicationprocess, financial aid, and generalcourse and major field selection. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The program for the Ph.D. degree pro-vides a framework within which stu-dents can acquire the following train-ing and experience: (1) broad exposureto a general area of interest and to itscurrent literature and controversies;(2) more intense training in the specialfield in which the student intends toconduct research and do his or her pri-mary teaching; (3) a sound but morelimited introduction to a second field;(4) training in research procedures andmethods; (5) an appropriate linguisticcompetence; and (6) the completion ofa dissertation judged to be a significantpiece of historical research and writing. To achieve these aims, the program is made up of the following compo-nents. (For a more complete discussion,see the Handbook for Graduate Students, available in the Department ofHistory.) Ph.D. Fields:1. Medieval Europe (fall of Rome to 1453) 2. Early modern Europe (1400 to 1789)3. Modern Europe (1750 to present)4. United States (contact to present)5. Latin America and the Caribbean 6. Modern Middle East7. East Asia8. Early modern Middle East (c. 1200- 1800) 9. Islamic History (600-1200)10. African diaspora11. Atlantic world12. AfricaCourse of Study: Ph.D. students must complete 18 courses (72 points), whichis the equivalent of six full-time semes-ters. All students must take the one-semester course Approaches toHistorical Research and Writing intheir first year and a dissertation writ-ing seminar in their third year. There isno limit on the number of coursestaken within the consortium memberuniversities; nonetheless, each studentshould consult with his or her adviseron the appropriateness of the coursesand their relationship to the student 's course of study. Such courses cannot betaken in a student 's first year of gradu- ate work without special permission.Doctoral students can transfer no morethan 40 points from outside thisdepartment. The request for transfer ofcredits must be made within one yearof enrollment. Language Requirement: This require- ment should be satisfied within thefirst year of graduate study and must besatisfied by the completion of48 points. The minimal departmentalrequirement is one modern foreign lan-guage; additional languages may berequired by the student 's advisory com- mittee. Students who choose theMiddle East as their major field mustfulfill the language requirements speci-fied for the joint Ph.D. program in his-tory and Middle Eastern studies; fordetails, see the Department of Middle Eastern Studies section in this bulletin. Other areas requiring a foreign lan-guage for research may set particularadditional requirements. Studentsshould consult their advisers aboutwhat rules apply in their case. Students must demonstrate profi- ciency in one of the following lan-guages: Arabic, Chinese, French,German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian,Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, orSpanish. Consent of the director ofgraduate studies must be obtained tosubstitute a language not on this list.Students may satisfy proficiency in oneof the following ways: (1) by passingthe examination in the language givenby the Graduate School of Arts andScience; (2) by passing the department 's examination, given each term, based onthe translation and explication of schol-arly texts (dictionaries and word proces-sors are permitted); or (3) by havingearned a grade of B+ or better in anintermediate or advanced languagecourse in a college or university nomore than two years prior to enroll-ment. Exceptions may be made for lan-guages required for primary research,by which a student 's adviser may speci- fy the department 's examination, or some other procedure, as necessary todemonstrate sufficient competence. Thelanguage examination is offered by thedepartment in the fall and spring andby the Graduate School three times ayear. Qualifying Examination: Students must pass a written qualifying exami-nation in a broad area of interest (U.S.history, medieval Europe, early modernEurope, modern Europe, LatinAmerica, Middle East, Atlantic world,African diaspora, Africa, or East Asia).The students ' second field will also be examined. Full-time students enteringwith a bachelor 's degree take this exam- ination at the end of the second year ofstudy; other students take the examina-tion within one semester after the com-pletion of 12 courses (48 points). Thoseentering with M.A. degrees from out-side the history department are normal-ly expected to take the qualifyingexamination directly after they havecompleted six courses, of which onemust be a \"literature of the field \" course. Students who have done gradu-ate work elsewhere must, before sittingfor the exam, complete all work for thenumber of courses the director of grad-uate studies has determined to beappropriate in each case. A student whodoes not pass the examination has theright to retake it once. The qualifying examination is not a comprehensive examination. It isintended to test how well each studentunderstands and can explain historicalarguments and issues and bring to bearpertinent information and knowledgein discussing them, not how much heor she knows. Prospectus Defense and Major Field Examination: Each student must pass a 90-minute oral examination in his orher major field after the language andcourse requirements have been com-pleted. Full-time students normallytake this examination at the end of thethird year of study. Those entering witha master 's degree should take the exam- ination at the end of the second year.HISTORY 163For other students, the precise time is arranged with the director of graduatestudies, but it must be as soon after thecompletion of course work as is practi-cable. The student must submit a disserta- tion prospectus prior to the examina-tion. The discussion of this proposalwill be a major component of theexamination. The committee for theexamination consists of three facultymembers, of whom one is the student 's major adviser, and the other two arenormally readers of the dissertation.Where appropriate, one member of thecommittee may be from outside thedepartment. No student may sit for themajor field examination without theprevious completion of the languageproficiency specified for that field. (Aswith the qualifying examination, stu-dents who fail the major field examina-tion may sit for it one more time, inthe following fall term.) Dissertation: Each student must write a dissertation under the supervision of amember of the department (joint advis-ers are permitted). The dissertationcommittee, including the adviser, hasfive members, of which a minimum ofthree must be GSAS full-time faculty. Planning a Program: Ph.D. students should arrange their schedules so thatthey can complete the required \"litera- ture of the field \" courses and at least one seminar by the end of the first year.Although the qualifying examination islikely to be a major concern of doctoralstudents in the first two years, studentsshould also ensure that they begin seri-ous work in the major field duringthese years, for the sake of their overallprofessional development and because astudent 's progress toward these goals is taken into account during the generalevaluation the department undertakesfor each student following the qualify-ing examination. The third year should be devoted primarily to the student 's major field, including the planning of the disserta-tion project. It may also, if necessary, beused for completing the second field. Choosing a Major Field: Each doctor- al student must designate a major field,within which the subject of his or herdissertation falls and presumably thefield in which the student expects to beprincipally involved as a writer andteacher. Major fields should be broadenough so that they can prepare stu-dents to teach an upper-level under-graduate course or a graduate colloqui-um, but narrow enough so that stu-dents can develop professional compe-tence in a body of literature and each student 's own primary research can con- tribute to the preparation. Major fieldsmay be defined in chronological andgeographical terms, or they may bepartly topical. In each case a student 's major field should be worked out indiscussion with his or her adviser andwith one additional faculty memberwho has agreed to participate in exam-ining it. Each field must be approvedby the director of graduate studies. Here are some examples of major fields: colonial and RevolutionaryAmerica; the Civil War andReconstruction; the United States fromWorld War I to the end of the 20thcentury; industry and labor in America,1890 to the present; the AmericanSouth from colonial times to 1865;women in the United States since1890; the 19th-century Americanintellectual; Europe in the centralMiddle Ages; nationalism the 19th-century Spanish Caribbean; themedieval monarchy andEngland; the church 17th-century England; RenaissanceItalian their the Germany, 1815-1945; in 19th-century culture in France between the wars; Alexander II to Gorbachev; Chinafrom to revolution; Japansince the Meiji restoration; Brazil in the20th century. Setting Up a Second Field: Each doc- toral student must choose, by the endof the third semester, a second field anda second field adviser. The second fieldadviser has responsibility for ensuringthat the student presents a coherentsecond field program and for examiningthe student in the qualifying exam.Normally the program consists of threecourses. The second field is tested onthe qualifying exam. A second field may have the same dimensions as the major field, or it maybe more purely topical, where such afield seems the best way to foster a stu-dent's development. In every case, how- ever, the second field may not be con-tained within the student 's major field, but must introduce some significantnew area or dimension. Second fieldsmay also be arranged in some fields inwhich no major fields are available andmay be comparative. Archival manage-ment and historical editing also qualifyas second fields, without respect to themajor field. Women 's history and public history, if comparative, also qualify assecond fields without respect to the major field. Transnational Fields: Historians are increasingly moving away fromapproaches that focus exclusively on theinternal development of one nationaltradition and toward treatments thatrecognize the interconnectedness of theearly modern and modern worlds andthe great themes \u2014the movement of peoples both free and unfree, economicinterdependence, religious transforma-tions, intellectual currents, and mixingof plants, animals, and microbes \u2014that cut across boundaries and forced newforms of consciousness. In response tothis trend, New York University 's Department of History has institutedtwo new doctoral fields: African diaspo-ra and Atlantic world. Students whoelect either of these transnational fieldsare encouraged to develop, in consulta-tion with their major adviser, a focuswithin the broad field and to combinecourses to allow them to pursue theparticular themes they have identified.This focus complements the student 's field in a national or regional history.As they develop dissertation topics,they take a methods course that empha-sizes transnational themes and compar-ative history. Students who chooseAfrican diaspora or Atlantic world asone field take their second field in atraditional national program. Half oftheir general examinations focus on thetransnational field, and the other halffocus on the traditional field(American, African, Latin American,European, etc.) most closely correspon-ding to the student 's period of focus. African diaspora or Atlantic world mayalso be selected as a second field. African Diaspora: The African diaspo- ra field focuses on the dispersal andactivities of people of African descent,their role in the transformation and cre-ation of new cultures, institutions, ideasoutside of Africa, and the problems ofcreating transnational communities in amodern world in which nation, race,ethnicity, gender, and class have beenthe cornerstones of identity formation.Extending from the 15th century to thepresent and incorporating Africa, SouthAmerica, the Caribbean, NorthAmerica, and Europe, the African dias-pora field is primarily a study of con-nections. Students examine, amongother things, the historical constructionof diasporan identities; the role intellectuals torethinking West; and thecontinual reinvention and thediaspora through culture, migrations, transforma-164 HISTORYtions in communication, and the glob- alization of the economy. Atlantic World: Newer comparative analysis builds on studies treating devel-opment within one system and thereforecomplements rather than replaces tradi-tional work. The Atlantic world fieldbuilds on the contributions of both theolder imperial school and the morerecent local studies and incorporates theperspective of newer methodologies suchas ethnohistory. All of the continentsthat rim the Atlantic are seen as equallyinvolved in the creation of the earlymodern and modern systems; no one tra-dition is privileged over the others. Thedepartment allows students maximumflexibility in shaping this field, so thatthey can take full advantage of the richresources of NYU and follow their owninterests. Students who elect theAtlantic world field are encouraged todevelop, in consultation with their major adviser, a focus within the broadfield and to combine courses to allowthem to pursue the particular themesthey have identified. This focus comple-ments the student 's field in a national or regional history. As they develop disser-tation topics, they take a methods coursethat emphasizes transnational themesand comparative history. FINANCIAL AID, ASSISTANT- SHIPS, AND EXTERNALFUNDING Students are admitted into the Ph.D. program only if they receive a fellow-ship from NYU. NYU fellowships arefive-year packages, which require thatstudents work as teaching assistants forthree years. Students who have outsidefellowships (e.g., Javits Fellowships)will also be admitted.There is some financial aid available for M.A. students in the archives pro-gram, but not for other M.A. students. Graduate students studying Arabic, Persian, or Turkish may be eligible fora Foreign Language and Area Studies(FLAS) Fellowship; for details, contactDirector, Hagop Kevorkian Center forNear Eastern Studies, Faculty of Artsand Science, New York University, 50Washington Square South, New York,NY 10012-1073. Graduate students are encouraged to seek external sources of funding, when-ever and wherever possible. The direc-tor of graduate studies makes availableto graduate students an up-to-date listof grants and fellowships. Smallergrants for special purposes are alsoavailable. CoursesCourses are of several kinds: 1. Colloquia, dealing with specific peri- ods or problems, based on commonreading and discussion (in some casessupplemented by occasional lectures),and in which students normally writeinterpretive papers, book critiques andreview essays, and/or bibliographicalsurveys. 2. Seminars, in which, after an initial period of common readings, studentswork primarily on a research project.(In certain cases students may also writeresearch papers in courses that are tech-nically \"colloquia. \") 3. \"Literature of the field \" courses, designed to provide entry to a broadarea of history, through reading anddiscussion of a number of major issues,problems, and controversies that repre-sent traditional and contemporaryapproaches to the area as a whole. Thesecourses introduce students to the kindsof materials and issues that are testedon the qualifying examination and pro-vide a framework for preparing to takethe qualifying exam. In some cases,however, students aiming only at theM.A. degree may be admitted to thesecourses with the instructor 's permis- sion. 4. Methodology courses, intended to introduce students to a wide spectrumof issues, theories, and research strate-gies. Ph.D. students are required totake a methodology course in their firstyear. 5. Independent study courses, devoted to reading, research, or some combina-tion, and set up between a student (or a small group of students) and a particu-lar faculty member. 6. Dissertation prospectus seminars. Ph.D. students are required to take adissertation prospectus seminar in theirthird year. Doctoral students may, with the approval of their advisers, enroll in upto four courses in other departments.The limit is two for M.A. students.Doctoral students may also, with simi-lar approval, prepare their second fieldsoutside the history department. Coursesare also available at nearby universi-ties\u2014Columbia, New School, CUNY , and Fordham \u2014through the Inter- University Doctoral Consortium.Interested students should consult theliterature available in the department.

Since 1977, this program has trained graduate history students for careers asarchivists, historical editors, adminis-trators, and manuscript curators. Theprogram provides students with a solidfoundation in the theory, methodology,and practice of archives. It also empha-sizes the broad humanistic training inhistory necessary for archivists to devel-op a vision for their work. Course workin complementary disciplines and newtechnologies is stressed, ensuring thatprogram graduates remain current withprofessional trends and developments.New York City offers a unique settingand laboratory for students exploringhistory and archives, and the programtakes full advantage of the city 's reposi- tories in providing internships andpracticum experiences for its students.Program graduates work as archivists ina wide variety of academic, nonprofit,corporate, and governmental venues.The program 's unique historical editing component also trains historians foralternative careers in preserving anddisseminating historical documents inbook, microform, CD-ROM, and elec-tronic formats. All students enroll in a sequential, two-semester colloquium(G57.1010 and G57.2010) that offers abroad overview of the field and com-bines classroom instruction with hands-on experience in an archival setting.Over the course of two semesters, stu-dents complete a major research paperon an appropriate archival topic andarrange and describe two archival col-lections in conjunction with theirpracticum. Students are also required totake a course in historical editing,which focuses on the location, arrange-ment, and publication of documents.As part of this course, students under-take research to identify and annotatetheir documentary collection. M.A. students enroll in a 44-point program of study, leading to the Masterof Arts degree in history and to the cer-tificate.

JOINT AND DUAL DEGREE PROGRAMS Joint degree programs at the doctoral level are available with the Institute ofFrench Studies, the Skirball Department of Hebrew and JudaicStudies, and the Department of MiddleEastern Studies. A dual degreeM.A./J.D. program is available with theSchool of Law, although studentsadmitted into this program are expect-ed to earn the doctorate in history.Admission to these joint and dualdegree programs must be granted byboth departments or institutes or pro-grams or schools upon entry or at thepoint of screening. Students in theseprograms normally are expected tocomplete the \"literature of the field \" courses and take the history depart-ment 's qualifying examination and a major field examination that maybridge the two disciplines. Joint anddual degree candidates are exempt fromthe departmental requirement for a sec-ond field. SPECIAL PROJECTS The Margaret Sanger Papers Projectcollects, assembles, and publishesrecords documenting the life and careerof the founder of the American birthcontrol movement. Located in thedepartment since 1987, the SangerPapers Project microfilmed the SmithCollege Collections Series, consisting ofalmost 45,000 documents; in 1995 anadditional 9,000 documents gatheredin an international search were micro-filmed as the Collected DocumentsSeries. Both microfilmed series arebeing published by UniversityPublications of America, along with areel guide and index. The project ispreparing an electronic edition of themicrofilmed documents for distributionon CD-ROM or via the Internet. The project will then work on a four-vol-ume book edition of selected Sangerletters. The project employs graduateassistants and other students.Documents from the Sanger Papers col-lection are available for student and fac-ulty research and serve as practicalexamples for the course on historicalediting. For additional information, contact Dr. Esther Katz, codirector/editor of theMargaret Sanger Papers. The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project is collecting, transcribing, and translat-ing the entire extant public and privatecorrespondence of early New York gov-ernor Jacob Leisler (1640-1691) forpublication in microfilm and annotatedbook editions. Considered by somecolonial historians as the \"Father of American Democracy \" and best known for the 1689 New York uprising thatbears his name, Leisler played a promi-nent role in the economic and socialdevelopment of colonial New York andearly America. Housed in the depart-ment since 1988, the Leisler Papers col-lection contains over 3,000 documentsin Dutch, French, German, and Englishthat provide a wealth of information onthe Atlantic world in the early modernera. The project employs graduate andother students to assist in making thecollection available to scholars and thepublic.

Atleast two new positions areexpected to be filled before thebeginning of the 2001-2002academic year. Specific strengthsof the faculty lie in the fields ofmedieval and Renaissance stud-ies; 20th-century literature,film, and culture; postmodernItaly; the of newtechnologies to the humanities;and cultural theory. In additionto courses taught by facultymembers, the program offerscourses taught by eminent visit- ing professors from Italy and theUnited States. The newly estab-lished Tiro a Segno FoundationFellowship in Italian AmericanCulture allows the departmentto appoint prominent visitingprofessors to teach courses con-cerning the experience and con-tribution of Italian immigrantsand Italian Americans toAmerican culture and society. The Italian program attracts full-time graduate students ofsuperior quality from all parts ofthe world. In addition to train-ing capable and creative schol-ars, one of the program 's objec- tives is to promote the effectiveteaching of Italian at all levels.To this end, students teach sev-eral Italian language and litera-ture courses, normally duringthe second and third years. TheItalian program also welcomesqualified part-time studentswho wish to obtain a Master 's degree. An interdisciplinaryapproach is recommended: stu-dents are encouraged to enroll inadditional courses outside of thedepartment, e.g., courses in his-tory, cinema, comparative litera- ture, and the fine arts. NYU offers graduate students in Italian a number of uniqueresources. Students may takecourses, pursue dissertationresearch, and do independentwork at the magnificent Villa LaPietra, NYU 's center for study abroad in Florence, and at theUniversity of Florence. Anexchange agreement with theUniversity of Rome providesone student per year the oppor-tunity to spend the academicyear in Rome. Graduate stu-dents may also take advantage ofthe resources of Casa Italiana,one of the most active Italiancultural centers in New York.Casa Italiana hosts colloquia,lectures, film series, concerts,and art exhibits throughout theyear. In addition, theDepartment of Italian Studiesand Casa Italiana organize theZerilli-Marim \u00f2 Prize for Italian Fiction, awarded every year tothe author of a new Italiannovel, and host the winner andother authors.

Solomon Inquiries: (212) 998-7995; business.journalism@nyu.edu DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTING: Professor William Inquiries: (212) believethat journalismhas a serious pub- lic mission and can make a dif-ference. We want to educatethose who agree. Opportunities abound in the media world, but the opportu-nity to do compelling work thatinforms, engages \u2014and mat- ters\u2014is what drives our faculty, motivates our students, andinforms our entire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities ofthe globe, and there is no betterplace to learn the craft than the city of New York \u2014where power and wealth concentrate,news and culture originate, anddaily events fascinate. Centrally located in Manhat- tan's Greenwich Village, the department immerses studentsin the richness and vitality ofthe city, while attracting tocampus many of the leaders andthinkers in the journalism pro-fession. New York City is ourlaboratory \u2014and our inspira- tion. The very first lesson weoffer students is: Tap into it,with our help. NYU students study as interns in almost every majornews organization in the city.They often graduate to jobs innewspapers, magazines, broad-cast outlets, and on-line opera-tions headquartered in NewYork, though some choose to goelsewhere. And every day, stu-dents move outward from theclassroom to the city, on assign-ments that take them all overtown. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the jour-nalism world. As writers,reporters, producers, and critics,NYU professors continue topractice the journalism theyteach and preach, holding theprofession to its highest stan-dards of public service. Theadjunct faculty features workingprofessionals from all the majornews media, who share theirwealth of experience and a com- mitment to craft. Major areas of study are in newspaper, magazine, andbroadcast journalism, alongwith a growing list of courses injournalism for the digital age.Each area pairs accomplishedfaculty who have worked in thefield with students who seekpractical instruction and intel-lectual depth. Most classes arekept small (12 to 18 students)to allow for one-on-one instruc-tion. In addition to the generalM.A. program, the departmentoffers specialized curriculabased on subject matter: a con-centration in cultural reportingand criticism; a program inbusiness and economic report-ing; and a program in scienceand environmental reporting.Students may also enroll in oneof the department 's four joint programs: journalism and LatinAmerican and Caribbean stud-ies; journalism and Near East-ern studies; journalism andFrench studies; or biomedicaljournalism. Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing,and research, but simultaneouslystudents are taught what jour-nalism at its best can be \u2014and what it should accomplish in afree and democratic society. Theyare also encouraged to publishtheir work, with assignments,internships, and on-line projectsgeared to this end. AHoused within the arts and sciences core of a leading univer-sity, the department sees jour-nalism as an essential strand inthe liberal arts tradition and acritical factor in public culture.But we also recognize that newsthese days is a business. Whenour skilled graduates enter thatbusiness, they are prepared toimprove and enliven it.Department facilities include state-of-the-art computerequipment; classrooms fash-ioned to generate whichoffers NEXIS/LEXIS and DIA-LOG capabilities; and a fullyequipped broadcast facility witha TV studio and linear and non-linear editing and digital andbeta field equipment. The department is also home to theCenter for War, Peace, and theNews Media, which works toimprove foreign news coveragein the U.S. media and conductsmedia assistance programsthroughout the world.

Harrington he Institute for Law and Society isa center for faculty,graduate students, and law students studying lawand legal institutions from atransdisciplinary standpoint. As an interschool program, sup-ported by New York Univer-sity's School of Law and the Faculty of Arts and Science, theInstitute convenes the NYULaw and Society Colloquium,holds conferences, and hosts vis-iting scholars. The graduate Lawand Society Program (LSP) offers the Ph.D. degree in law andsociety and the J.D./Ph.D. andJ.D./M.A. dual degrees. TheLSP combines theoretical andempirical approaches to study-ing law in its social contexts. BUTTERICK BUILDING, 161 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS NEW YORK, NY 10013-1205 (212) Institute a dual degree Ph.D./J.D. program in law and societythat is designed to study law in light ofchanging cultural, economic, and polit-ical forces. In addition, the Institutesupports conferences, research projects,and a scholars-in-residence program. The graduate program in law and society locates disciplinary studies oflaw, such as law and politics, legal anthropology, economic analysis of law,sociology of law, criminology, and legalhistory in a coherent academic programat the graduate level. The programfacilitates the educational goals of stu-dents who plan careers in a number ofacademic disciplines including socialscience fields, law at the undergraduatelevel as well as in professional law school, policy analysis, and appliedresearch on law-related issues. Essentially, three student groups are served by the program: (1) Ph.D. stu-dents seeking a multidisciplinaryapproach to the study of law; (2) J.D.students who want to expand their the-oretical and empirical knowledge of LAW AND SOCIETY 197American constitutional theory; use of multiple intelligences and reasoningstyles in the work of lawyering; effectsof culture and discourse styles on legalprocesses and on the development oflaw.

Courses offered in the law and socie- ty program combine theoretical andempirical approaches to studying law inits social contexts. These can begrouped under the following threeheadings: I. Sociolegal Theory Students may take courses coveringbasic sociolegal theory, including femi-nist and critical race approaches, andlegal history. For example, The Sociology of Law and The Politics of the Legal Orderprovide students with a foundation insocial theory and institutional struc-tures that shape law 's place in society. The Sociolegal Seminar focuses on analytical, doctrinal, institutional, andphilosophical perspectives and approach-es to the study of law and society. In State, Law, and Politics in Society, students study the social sci-ence literature and the doctrinal theo-ries on state power to question whetherand how law is \"autonomous \" from the political powers of the state. Introduction to Legal Philosophy studies the concept of law viewedthrough the work of philosophers inthe 20th century and discusses therelationships among law, coercion,morality, politics, and the nature oflegal reasoning. Law and Economics examines basic economic concepts and demonstratestheir application to legal problems. Culture and Disputing uses read- ings from sociology and legal anthro-pology to explore the embedding ofdisputes and dispute processing in dis-tinct forms of social life. Gender Politics and Law focuses on debates within legal discourses on gen-der and how these debates produce acontext for the development, adminis-tration, and interpretation of genderedpolicies. II. Social and Legal Policy Students may also take courses focusingon social and legal policy areas, such ascriminal law, family law, science andtechnology, and health care. Law and Social Policy critically examines the relationship between lawand social policy through a series ofcase studies, including landmarkSupreme Court cases, state court deci-sions, determinations by regulatoryagencies, and policy formation byCongress. Criminology gives students a back- ground in the historical development ofcriminology, criminal behavior systems, etiology of crime and delinquency, andefforts at crime control. Corruption and Corruption Control examines the pervasive problem ofofficial corruption and the variousbodies of law and legal institutionsthat exist to prevent, detect, and pun-ish corruption. Deviance and Social Control pro- vides a framework for analyzing classi-cal and contemporary texts representingdifferent theoretical and research tradi-tions dealing with the designation ofsome types of behavior and conditionsas deviant, and the policies used to con-trol them. The Lawyering Theory Colloquium and Expert Evidence are two of severalcourses taught in conjunction with pro-fessors in the Clinical Law Program atthe School of Law. Law and Science focuses on legal issues that emerge as science increasing-ly illuminates the mechanisms for sus-taining and reproducing life. Policing in Democratic Societies focuses on the origins, sociology, andpolitics of democratic policing, as wellas the mechanisms of its organizationand function. American Health Law considers how the law influences the availability,quality, and cost of medical care. III. Comparative and Global PerspectivesA number of course offerings study lawand legal practices from comparativeand global perspectives. Law and Society in Japan looks at the interaction of the legal system andlegal institutions with Japanese society,politics, and economics. Comparative Law and Social Change is a seminar on theoretical and compar-ative frameworks for analyzing andinterpreting the interrelationshipsbetween law and society in contempo-rary Eastern Europe. Race and the Law: U.S. and South Africa is a comparative analysis of thelegal process in South Africa and theUnited States where race is involved.The course also addresses the similari-ties and differences in the educationlaws of both countries. Admission: Admission to the graduate law and society program is based onacademic records and letters of recom-mendation. The Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) is required of allstudents. While the basis of the pro-gram is multidisciplinary, its aim is tobe transdisciplinary, and therefore ittends to admit exceptional studentswho are attuned to transcending con-ventional disciplinary boundaries in the study of law and social relations. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Degree Requirements: To qualify for the doctorate, a student must satisfacto-rily complete graduate studies totalingat least 72 graduate credits, with aminimum of 32 credits at the doctorallevel in residence at New YorkUniversity; pass comprehensive qualify-ing examinations; and present anacceptable dissertation. Most graduatecourses carry 4 credits. Students whohave completed relevant graduatecourses elsewhere may request that suchcourses be credited toward the degreerequirements, but only after complet-ing three courses at New YorkUniversity and on approval by thedirector of graduate studies. Course of Study: Each student is assigned an adviser on entering the pro-gram. Students enrolled in the Ph.D.program in law and society may takeup to 12 credits in the School of Lawafter consultation with their adviserand with the permission of the instruc-tor. Students work with a committee ofadvisers to establish their course ofstudy, but all students should do somecourse work for general backgroundpreparation in the law and society pro-gram fields, which include sociolegaltheory; social and legal policy; andcomparative and global perspectives.All students are required to take thetwo-semester Sociolegal Studies I andII, designed to provide students with afoundation in social theories, concepts,approaches, and methodologies. Law andSociety Program (LSP) students arerequired to take one semester of a grad-uate-level Methods Survey course andone semester of an AdvancedMethodology course selected from theLSP methods lists. Students are furtherurged to study QuantitativeMethodology so as to acquire basiccompetency and literacy with terminol-ogy, applications, etc. Language Requirement: Proficiency in at least one language other thanEnglish is required of all doctoral can-didates. Foreign language proficiencyexaminations are at once an examina-tion of both the foreign language andEnglish. Currently, a student maychoose to demonstrate proficiency inancient Greek, French, German,Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin,Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, orSpanish. Students who use a foreignlanguage other than the above as anintegral part of their dissertationLAW AND SOCIETY 199research may petition for a substitution. Language proficiency may be demon-strated by any of the following:(1) passing the foreign language profi-ciency examination given by theGraduate School of Arts and Science(GSAS); (2) passing the departmentalexamination, if one is regularly sched-uled by the department in which thestudent is registered; or (3) completing,or having completed, not more thantwo years before matriculation, with agrade of B or better, a full or final inter-mediate-level college course in the lan-guage. Students who have met the lan-guage requirement in another graduateschool not more than two years beforematriculation in GSAS may request thatsuch credentials be accepted, with theapproval of the dean. Qualifying Examinations: As part of the requirements for the doctoral pro-gram, students must pass the LSPComprehensive QualifyingExaminations in three fields: (1) thelaw and society field; (2) an area field;and (3) a discipline subfield. Prior totaking the examinations, students mustselect an adviser, in consultation withthe director of graduate studies (DGS),and submit the Law and SocietyProgram Adviser form. The compre-hensive examinations are given twice ayear. Written or 24-hour take-homeexaminations are given one week priorto the start of the Law School 's fall and spring semesters, and oral examinationstake place within the first month of eachsemester. Students who fail an examina-tion may petition the DGS to take itagain. Students are not permitted toretake an examination more than once. 1. Law and Society Field ExaminationThis examination tests students ' com- prehensive knowledge of theoreticaland empirical approaches in the LSPsubfields: (1) sociolegal theory;(2) social and legal policy; and (3) com-parative and global perspectives. Theexamination covers material and sup-plementary reading lists from therequired LSP courses (The SociolegalSeminar and Law and Social Policy) andother material, as specified by theadviser and the law and society e xami- nation committee. Students must sub-mit the Law and Society FieldExamination form to the DGS forapproval one month prior to the exami-nation. Students may choose to take afour-hour written examination or a 24-hour take-home examination. Each aca-demic year, the director of the Institutefor Law and Society appoints a law andsociety examination committee, in con- sultation with the associate director.Two members of this committee, alongwith the student 's adviser, write and evaluate the examination. 2. Area Field Examination In consultation with the adviser, stu-dents identify an area of study aboutwhich they will develop comprehensiveknowledge that is related to one ormore frameworks or backgroundthemes important to their researchinterests. The adviser, in consultationwith the student, identifies two mem-bers of the NYU faculty, in addition tothe adviser, to sit on the area examina-tion committee. The student mustreceive approval of the area field fromthe adviser and the DGS by submittingthe Approval of Area Field form.Students submit a concept paper (15-20 pages plus a bibliography), whicharticulates the main theoretical con-cepts, methods, debates, and future tra-jectory of the area. They then take atwo-hour oral examination. 3. Discipline Subfield Examination In consultation with the adviser, stu-dents identify a discipline other thanlaw and society (e.g., political science,sociology, anthropology, psychology,economics, history, or law) and selectone subfield within that discipline inwhich to take a comprehensive exami-nation. Approval by the LSP-DGS isrequired; the Discipline SubfieldExamination form must be submittedone month prior to the examination.The adviser, in consultation with theLSP-DGS, makes appropriate accom-modations so that the comprehensiveexamination procedures of the disci-pline selected are followed and the for-mat, timing, and evaluation of theexamination are congruent with therules, policies, and procedures of thediscipline. Students complete their doctoral com- prehensive examinations no later thanthe end of the third year of graduatework. Dissertation: When the student has prepared an acceptable dissertationprospectus (20-30 pages plus a bibliog-raphy), describing his or her project,and it has been recommended by thestudent 's three-member dissertation committee, he or she submits to theDGS a copy of the dissertation propos-al, an abstract (one to two pages), andthe Dissertation Committee form. Thedissertation abstract is distributed to allInstitute of Law and Society facultymembers. At this point, the student isformally advanced to candidacy for the doctorate. Once the adviser hasapproved a copy of the completed dis-sertation, the student submits copies ofthe dissertation to all members of his orher dissertation committee. A two-houroral dissertation defense is then sched-uled, to include the dissertation com-mittee, two additional faculty (selectedby the adviser and the student), and thestudent. The dissertation should becompleted and the degree awarded nolater than the end of the eighth year ofgraduate work. DUAL JURIS DOCTOR AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Admission: Students with a special interest in law may wish to pursue thedual degree program leading to theJ.D. and Ph.D. degrees. Students whowish to enroll in the dual degree pro-gram must apply separately to theSchool of Law and to the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science (GSAS).Students may apply to both schoolssimultaneously or to one school whilein the first year of study at the other.There are no specific admission stan-dards or applications for dual degreeapplicants at either school. Once admit-ted to both schools, the student quali-fies for the dual degree program. Degree Requirements: The School of Law requires the completion of82 credits in six semesters of full-timestudy for the J.D. degree. Full-timestudy is defined as 12 or more credithours per semester, primarily in coursescommencing prior to 6 p.m. Onesemester of full-time graduate study, orup to 12 credits, from the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science is countedtoward the J.D. degree. Thus, at leastone of the student 's semesters in GSAS must be full-time and consist of amajority of credits in daytime courses.For a complete description of coursesrequired for the J.D. degree, consultthe School of Law Bulletin. As stated above, the Ph.D. degree requires72 credits of graduate study, of which12 credits are accepted from the Schoolof Law. The two degrees thereforerequire a total of 130 credits (70 at theSchool of Law and 60 at the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science). Becausesome of the credits earned in each pro-gram are counted toward the otherdegree, it is possible to complete thecourse requirements for both degrees infive years of full-time study. Course of Study: Normally, students pursuing the dual degree programspend their first year completing mostCoursesThe G62 course numbers are for use only by LSP students. Other studentsshould register under the primarycourse number. The semester at the School of Law starts and ends approximately one weekearlier than that of the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science.

This seminar (1) surveys approaches for understanding the relationship betweensocial and legal thought and (2) exam-ines their methodologies. Readingsexamine the extent to which social sci-ence and law have common theoreticaland methodological foundations. Focusis on analytical, doctrinal, institutional,and philosophical perspectives andapproaches to the study of law and soci-ety. The interface between legal andsocial, cultural, economic, and politicalphenomena is studied through criticaldebates as well as from a historical andcomparative perspective.Sociolegal Studies II: Law and Social PolicyG62.1002/G53.2360/G93.3462/L06.3580 (Law and Society) Staff. Critical examination of the relationship between law and social policy through aseries of case studies, including land-mark Supreme Court cases, state courtdecisions, determinations by regulatoryagencies, and policy formation byCongress. The substantive issuesexplored (such as toxic contamination,tobacco, school desegregation, HIV ,affordable housing, and assisted suicide)contribute to an understanding of theprocess through which various institu-tions make policy, the capacities ofthese institutions to confront complexpolicy issues, and the extent to whichdifferent institutions are more or lesssuccessful in defining and achievingpolicy goals. For comparative under-standing, students explore the relation-ship between courts, administrativeagencies, and legislatures in several set-tings outside the United States. Introduction to Legal Philosophy G62.1003/L06.3005 (Law) Murphy. Survey of 20th-century contributions to legal philosophy. In addition to thecentral debate between H. L. A. Hartand Ronald Dworkin over the conceptof law, students discuss natural law the- ory, legal realism, critical legal studies,feminist jurisprudence, critical race the-ory, and some aspects of postmodernlegal theory. The course begins with anintroduction to the methods of moraland political theory. There is a take-home examination, with a paper optionfor half the credit for this course. Law and Modern Society G62.1004/L06.3560 (Law) Garland. This seminar explores the changing forms and functions of law in modernsociety and the sociological theoriesthat seek to interpret these develop-ments. The concept of modernity formsthe background for the first half of thecourse, in which the work ofDurkheim, Marx, and Weber arereviewed in some detail. Thereafter theclass addresses a body of work, by writ-ers such as Foucault, Selznick, andTeubner, that argues that the characterof modern law \u2014and modern society \u2014 is changing in ways that require us torevise our understanding of the rela-tionship of \"law\" to \"society. \" Themes include the decline of the rule of law;the emergence of responsive or reflexivelaw; law in the welfare state; laws,norms and discipline; the relationbetween law and other systems of regu- 200 LAW AND SOCIETYof the first-year curriculum at the School of Law and the two sociolegalseminars at GSAS. Thereafter, thecourse of study is constructed in con-sultation with the student 's adviser. All other course requirements for the Ph.D.degree are the same as those indicatedabove for the J.D. degree. Consult theSchool of Law Bulletin for more details. Language Requirement: Proficiency in at least one language other thanEnglish is required of all doctoral can-didates in the J.D./Ph.D. program. SeeLanguage Requirement under Doctor of Philosophy. Qualifying Examinations: Students enrolled in the J.D./Ph.D. dual degreeprogram take their comprehensiveexaminations no later than the end ofthe fifth year of enrollment in the pro-gram. See Qualifying Examinations under Doctor of Philosophy. Dissertation: The dissertation should be completed and the degree awardedno later than the end of the ninth yearof work for those also enrolled in thedual degree program. See Dissertation under Doctor of Philosophy.DUAL JURIS DOCTOR AND MASTER OF ARTS Admission: Students who wish to enroll in the J.D./M.A. dual degreeprogram must apply separately to theSchool of Law and to the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. Studentsmay apply to both schools simultane-ously or to the Graduate School of Artsand Science when in the first or secondyear of study at the School of Law.There are no specific admission stan-dards or applications for dual degreeapplicants at either school. Once admit-ted to both schools, the student quali-fies for the dual degree program. Course of Study: The School of Law requires 82 credits of study for the J.D.degree; however, in the dual degreeprogram, 8 credits for courses taken inthe Graduate School of Arts andScience are applied to the J.D. degree.The Graduate School requires 32 cred-its of study for the M.A. degree; how-ever, in the dual degree program,8 credits for courses taken in the Schoolof Law are applied to the M.A. degree.Students in this program are requiredto take a total of 98 credits for the two degrees (74 and 24 credits, respective-ly). Typically the first year is spent atthe School of Law; during the remain-ing years, courses are taken at bothschools. It is possible to complete thisprogram in four years. Language Requirement: Reading proficiency in a foreign language isrequired, demonstrated by any of themethods accepted by the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. SeeLanguage Requirement under Doctor of Philosophy.

Thecourse does not presuppose any priorknowledge of social theory. Classic Sociological Theory G93.2111 (Sociology) Garland. Examines major figures of modern soci- ology, including Marx, Durkheim,Weber, Simmel, Mead, Freud, andParsons. Focuses on the conditions andassumptions of social theory, theprocess of concept formation and theo-ry-building, general methodologicalissues, and the present relevance of theauthors examined. An effort is made tospeculate on the nature of the growthof knowledge in sociology. Advanced Theory Seminar: Foucault G62.1010/G93.3112 (Sociology) Garland. This seminar is concerned with devel- oping an in-depth understanding of thework of Michel Foucault and its impli-cations for social and historical research.The class studies several of his substan-tive historical studies (Discipline and Punish, Madness and Civilization, TheBirth of the Clinic, and The History of Sexuality) and explores key concepts in Foucault 's work, such as archaeology and genealogy, power/knowledge, gov-ernmentality, and subjectification.Critical responses to Foucault 's work are discussed, as are attempts by otherauthors to put Foucaultian concepts totheir own use. The Sociology of Punishment G62.1020/G93.2508 (Sociology)Garland. This seminar discusses the literature of the sociology of punishment and thevarious theoretical traditions throughwhich the institutions of penality havebeen understood. It is particularly con-cerned with developing a sociologicalaccount of contemporary patterns ofpenal practice in the United States andelsewhere. Seminar in Sociology of Law: Gender Politics and LawG62.1021/G93.3534 (Sociology)Dixon. More than statutes, rules and court cases, law constitutes a discursive fieldwhere structured inequalities and sharedcultural understandings are defined,reinforced, and transformed. This coursefocuses on the development and changesin U.S. legal discourses and how thesedebates produce the context for thedevelopment, administration, and inter-pretation of gender relations. Studentsexplore the historical development of the liberal legal system in the UnitedStates as it relates to gender as well ascritiques of liberal legalism from thestandpoint of legal realism, critical legaltheory, and literary criticism. In addi-tion, students examine legal debates invarious substantive areas, such as consti-tutional law, abortion, reproduction,homosexuality, domestic and sexual vio-lence, employment discrimination,divorce, and custody. Race and Legal Scholarship G62.1022/L06.3545 (Law) Caldwell. This seminar considers how concepts of prejudice and theoretical work on theoperation of racial ideology affect devel-opments in the law concerning the pro-tection against racial discriminationafforded by specific constitutional andstatutory laws as well as interpretationsof the impact of race generally in othersubstantive legal areas. Recent develop-ments in the study of race in the socialsciences are considered. Students exam-ine contemporary problems in race rela-tions in light of the theoretical founda-tions of classical legal scholarship, lawand economics, critical legal scholar-ship, and the emerging critical scholar-ship on race \u2014much, but not all, of which is written by legal scholars ofcolor. Race, Values, and the American Legal Process G62.1023/L06.3512 (Law) Higgenbotham Jr. This seminar examines the use of the law to both perpetuate and eradicateracial injustice in the United Statesfrom the inception and rise of slaveryduring the colonial period through theU.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The major institutions studied are thecourts and the legislatures (predomi-nantly at the colony or state level). Thecourse explores both criminal and civillaw and focuses particularly on theirrole in the preclusion or allowance oftraditional family relations, educationoptions, due process in the courts, andother \"rights \" for blacks. Law and Economics G62.1024/L06.3020 (Law) Kornhauser. The first part of this course is a survey of intermediate microeconomic theory,with an emphasis on welfare economics.It provides a framework for the secondpart of the course, which is an econom-ic analysis of tort and property rulesand consideration of similar problemsin law and economics. Voting, Game Theory, and the Law G62.1025/L06.3035 (Law) Beno\u00eet. This course first addresses the proper- ties of various voting methods and pro-cedures. The class considers desirableproperties that a voting method mightpossess and determines which methods,if any, have these properties. The ideasdeveloped are used to analyze practicalproblems, such as voting in union elec-tions and the provision of minority rep-resentation within the context of theVoting Rights Act. Next, the class con-siders the concept of power and exam-ines the distribution of power amongvoters in different states and withinvoting bodies, such as the UnitedNations Security Council and congres-sional committees. Finally, the coursedevelops concepts related to strategicthinking used in game theory andapplies these concepts to voting situa-tions and legal problems. Seminar in Labor Law Theory G62.1026/L07.3560 (Law) Estreicher. Theoretical perspectives in the study of labor and employment law. Topicsinclude the theory of the Wagner Act,reformist perspectives, economic cri-tiques of regulation of labor markets,the critical legal studies movementchallenge, and comparisons with laborand employment law systems of othercountries. The seminar requires a sub-stantial research paper. Gender Issues in Law and Culture G62.1028/L06.3567 (Law) Bruner, Gilligan, Richards. This seminar explores, from both a historical and contemporary perspec-tive, the role of various interpretiveperspectives on gender in law and cul-ture as tools for the understanding,diagnosis, and remedy of racism andsexism as interlinked evils that afflictboth men and women, heterosexualsand homosexuals. Its central topic isthe terms of the struggle to introduceunconventional, gender-subversivevoices and topics into public discourse,criticizing cultural racism, sexism, andhomophobia. Justice and Authority in Groups G62.1029/G89.3404 (Psychology)Tyler. Introduction to psychological research on social justice. Three areas of justiceare considered: distributive justice, pro-cedural justice, and retributive justice.Distributive justice is concerned aboutthe impact of people 's assessments of the fairness of the distribution of resourcesor opportunities within groups, organi-202 LAW AND SOCIETYzations, or societies. Procedural justice examines the importance of judgmentsabout the fairness of decision-makingprocedures. Retributive justice explorespeople 's views about fair ways to punish those who break social rules. Emphasisis on reading and discussing recent the-oretical and empirical writings on thesetopics. State and Political Development Politics of the Legal Order G62.1101/G53.2355 (Politics)Harrington. The role of law in politics. Overview of approaches that shape the theoreticaland empirical contours of the publiclaw field and contribute to multidisci-plinary law and social science studies.Examines institutional, judicial behav-ior, legal impact, dispute processing,ideological, and neoinstitutionalapproaches. Studies multidisciplinarypolitical movements and debates, suchas liberal legalism, legal realism, legalpluralism, law and society, law and eco-nomics, feminist jurisprudence, criticallegal race theory, and interpretive soci-olegal theory. Focus is on legal andpolitical development, legal institu-tions, judicial politics, litigation, andlegal-political mobilization. The objectis to investigate both the politics of lawandthe law of politics. State, Law, and Politics in Society G62.1102/L06.3565/G53.2356 (Law)Chevigny, Harrington. Examines the relationship between law and the state by asking whether andhow law is autonomous from the politi-cal powers of the state. Studies theinstitutional powers of the legal profes-sion and the judiciary, doctrinal, andlegal rights. Examines sociolegal theo-ries of interpretation. Investigates theideology of law in legal formalism,both contemporary and in the past, lawand society, and critical legal studies. Law and Society G62.1103/G93.2434 (Sociology) Heydebrand. Designed to provide a broad theoretical framework for analyzing and interpret-ing the interrelationships between law,politics, and society. Begins with a con-sideration of the intellectual andmethodological differences between lawand social science; then examines theinterface between law and social sciencefrom two perspectives. First, the rela-tionship between law and society istraced from the point of view of theinfluence of norms and customs, socialstructure, and class and power on thedevelopment, form procedure, and sub-stance of law. Second, the impact of law on society is examined in the areas ofrights and social movements, race dis-crimination, gender discrimination, andcrime and justice. Critical race theoryand critical gender theory receive spe-cial attention here. A section on law,courts, and the administration of justiceexamines the institutional structure andtransformation of the American legaland judicial system, and a final sectionon the legal profession, legal education,and critical legal theory deals with thecontradictory role of lawyers as agentsof the status quo and of social change. Large-Scale Organizations G62.1104/G93.2132 (Sociology)Heydebrand. Introduction to the rapidly changing field of large-scale organizations. Beginsby locating the field at the intersectionof various social science disciplines aswell as business management, publicadministration, the anarchist theory oforganization, Marxism, and critical the-ory. Major organizational theories andapproaches discussed include Weber,scientific management, human rela-tions, decision theory and systemsmodels, contingency theory, resource-dependence and strategic choice, insti-tutionalism, population ecology, andthe phenomenology of organizations.After considering various methods oforganizational analysis, the coursefocuses on a number of organizationalenvironments, with particular emphasison the political economy, the policynetworks of the state, and the transfor-mation of the judiciary and the courts.Finally, certain dimensions of internalstructure and change are discussed, par-ticularly organizational control struc-tures from markets and hierarchies totechnocratic corporatism and democrat-ic participation. State and Local Government G62.1105/L01.3016 (Law) Jacobs, Viteritti. Explores the power that state and local governments have to regulate, providepublic services, redistribute wealth,spend, finance private projects, tax, andborrow, and ways in which law tries tokeep that power accountable. Some ofthe doctrinal issues considered includeconflicts between state and localauthority, controls imposed as condi-tions on federal or state grants, limitson borrowing and deficit spending,direct democracy, nondiscriminatoryaccess to services, and local governmentliability for damages for violations ofcivil rights and antitrust law. Land Use, Housing, and Community Development in NewYork City G62.1106/L10.3506 (Law) Schill, Upham. Overview of the theory and practice of urban development in low- and moder-ate-income neighborhoods. Focus is onthree specific subject areas: land use,housing, and community development.Begins with background readings onthe growth of cities and urbaneconomies, the interaction of demo-graphics and markets, and the legalframework of local government in gen-eral. Then looks in detail at a series ofcase studies selected to illustrate thefundamental legal, political, and eco-nomic issues in land use and housing.The primary goal for the seminar is thefamiliarization of the students with thelegal and political frameworks withinwhich development takes place in low-and moderate-income neighborhoods inNew York City. A second goal is theexplication in several concrete settingsof the relationship between legal doc-trine\u2014the presentations of \"legal frameworks \" that begin the seminar and each case study \u2014and what actually results from the interaction of legal,political, and economic forces. A thirdgoal is the training of students inempirical fieldwork and sociolegalmethodology. Fieldwork reports pro-vide an opportunity for students tointegrate empirical investigation withtheory building. Constitutional Practices The American Constitution G53.2350 (Politics) Randall. Analysis of the political, social, eco- nomic, cultural, and legal circum-stances surrounding the great conflictsin American constitutional develop-ment. Particular attention is given tohow those conditions and events affect-ed and were affected by theConstitution and its interpretation, inhistorical context and in Americanpolitical thinking. The American judi-cial tradition and its discontents areexplored through the work of individ-ual justices of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court and the Constitution G53.2359 (Politics) Randall. Examines the third branch of govern- ment as chief interpreter of theConstitution and reviewer of the workof government. The structure, proce-dures, personnel, and informal organi-zation of the Court are considered alongwith the appointment process. SomeLAW AND SOCIETY 203attention is given to the impact of the Court 's decisions and to public opinion about the Court. Emphasis is on theCourt 's political role in a democratic polity. Current Constitutional Issues G62.1201/L01.3536.01 (Law) Bell. Students learn best by doing, that is, by active participation in the subjectmatter. Using simulation models, stu-dents perform the functions of bothjustices of the U.S. Supreme Court andattorneys handling litigation beforethat Court. By simulating the Court 's perspective, on the litigation in whichit grants or denies remedies, studentsbetter understand the often opaque rea-soning the Court provides in adoptingor rejecting principles, doctrines, andstandards. This structure enables partic-ipants to gain a good understanding ofhow factors, neither stated nor even rec-ognized, can influence the judicialprocess. American Legal History G62.1202/L06.3010 (Law) Reid. Beginning with the colonial period and emphasizing the 19th century, thiscourse covers the formative era ofAmerican law in early MassachusettsBay; the constitutional controversyleading to the American Revolution;the growth of law in the early republic;the law of the clan and of the bloodfeud among the Cherokees; theAmerican law of slavery; and the fugi-tive slave controversy. Readings in American Legal History G62.1203/L06.2521 (Law) Prerequisite: U.S. Constitutional Law or permission ofinstructor. Reid. Readings in the history of American law, with emphasis on studies castinglight on the nature of law and its rela-tionship to society. Assigned books andarticles are reported on, reports are dis-tributed, and class hours are devotedlargely to discussion. Students are askedto submit two-page evaluations ofworks read. Readings include suchpublications as William Cronon,Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonistsand the Ecology of New England; Morton J. Horowitz, The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860; Robert A.

Examines the law of free speech and censorship from an interdisciplinaryperspective. Explores the followingquestions: What are the roots of theimpulse to censor? What culturalassumptions are embedded in FirstAmendment law and theory? How doescensorship law reflect or reinforce cul-tural anxieties about certain subjects,such as gender and class, and about cer-tain forms of expression, such as tech-nology and art? In what ways does cen-sorship law shape literature, art, andpopular culture? Readings include FirstAmendment case law and theory as wellas selections from other disciplines. Culture and Language Discourse Culture and Disputing G62.1301/L06.3500 (Law) Chase, Chevigny. Study of various types of dispute reso- lution found in societies ranging fromprimitive to technocratic as well asvariations in disputing models within agiven society. In order to give theoreti-cal grounding to the foregoing, selec-tions from texts on anthropology, law,and society and from the work of legalcomparativists are assigned. The goal isto obtain a deeper understanding of thecultural relativism of legal institutions. Language and Problem Solving: The Legal Process and Narrated SelfG14.1702 (Anthropology) Schieffelin. Analysis of language as a particular type of problem-solving activity. Views lan-guage as a significant form of socialaction and, as such, as a resource for par-ticipants and researchers. Groundingthemselves in comparative materials,theories, and methodologies drawn fromthe literature on comparative studies ofdispute resolution, symbolic interaction,political economy of language, narra-tive, and the \"narrated self, \" students explore how two speech genres \u2014dis- puting and narrating \u2014come together in the context of small claims court, animportant legal institution in contem-porary American society. The courseintroduces students to research in theethnography of speaking, pragmatics,conversation analysis, narrative analysis,and interpretive sociolinguistics. Language Ideologies, Social Change, and Language Use G14.2701 (Anthropology) Prerequisite: Linguistic Anthropology G14.1040. Schieffelin. Language choice is one of the principal arenas of struggle in achieving individ-ual and group status in multicultural societies. This course explores variousapproaches to analyzing language ide-ologies and their relation to languagechoice and use in multicultural soci-eties undergoing social change.Through examining language practicesand language-related institutions, stu-dents ask how authority, identity, andpower are contested, reformulated, andchanged, and how (or whether) linguis-tic diversity is valued. Through a seriesof ethnographically oriented case stud-ies, students evaluate different theoreti-cal frameworks for looking at the socialand symbolic relationships betweenethnic and national languages and theirspeakers. Students also explore varioustypes of multilingualism, both writtenand spoken, and the speech practicesthat accompany such complex sociocul-tural contexts. Empirical Theory and Methods Research Methods and Statistics I: Introduction to Methods ofSociological ResearchG62.1404/G93.2331 (Sociology)Guthrie. First course in a sequence of three that is required of all Ph.D. students in soci-ology. The sequence serves as an intro-duction to quantitative research in soci-ology, integrating the study of researchmethods and statistics. This courseintroduces basic methodological issuesand basic statistics. Research Methods and Statistics II: Introduction to Statistics G93.2332 (Sociology) Prerequisite: grade of B or bet- ter in Research Methods and Statistics IG93.2331 or permission of the instructor.Greenberg or Guthrie. Second course in a sequence of three that is required of all Ph.D. students insociology. Covers such multivariate sta-tistical methods as multiple regressionand path analysis, dummy variables,interaction terms, path analysis, theelaboration model for the analysis ofcontingency tables, factor analysis,complex sample designs, and scale con-struction. Emphasis is on social scienceapplications. An accompanying laboffers instruction in the use of SPSS forWindows to carry out statistical analy-ses on social science data sets. Qualitative Methods G93.2303 (Sociology) First priority is given to soci- ology graduate students. Prerequisite: anintroductory methods course. Gerson,Horowitz. Two-semester course that involves stu- dents in constructing, implementing,204 LAW AND SOCIETYand completing a fieldwork project using interviews and/or participantobservation. Class participation is anintegral aspect of the course. Coversboth epistomological and \"how to \" issues and debates, and includes ongo-ing discussions of issues raised by stu-dent projects. Students should have ageneral idea for a project that focuseson issues of class, race, and/or genderstratification. Interpretation, the Human Sciences, and the Law: The Lawyering TheoryColloquium G62.1401/LO6.3555 (Law) Amsterdam, Bruner, Davis, Morawetz. Looks at legal thinking and institutions through the lenses of epistemologicaland humanistic disciplines, such as psy-chology, ethnology, linguistics, and liter-ary criticism. Each year these approachesare explored in relation to a set of legalissues that includes questions of consti-tutional interpretation. (Recent topicsincluded the U.S. Supreme Court 's treat- ment of issues of African slavery in the19th century and racial equality in the20th century; murder and the deathpenalty as crime and punishment, propi-tiation and atonement, and images ofterror and authority; a combination ofthese two themes \u2014racial discrimination in capital sentencing.) Students work inteams of three to five to prepare presen-tations to the group at each week 's collo- quium session. Students also work indi-vidually or in pairs on a research project,which may produce either (1) a paperthat satisfies part A of the writingrequirement and is completed withinthe semester or (2) a detailed thesis, pro-posal, and bibliography for such a paper,to be written as directed research for anadditional 2 credits in a later semester. Expert Evidence G62.1402/L09.3522 (Law) Davis, Dudley, Hertz. Uses seminar and simulation formats to explore issues concerning the use ofexpert opinion. Focuses on two equallyimportant processes: (1) the process bywhich expert advice and testimony areused for the purpose of establishingfacts at issue between parties at trialand (2) the process by which expertadvice, testimony, and publications areused to inform judicial interpretation ofa law. Students explore legal constraintsand policy considerations surroundingthese processes. Simulations involveexperts in psychiatry, psychology, andsocial work and concern questions ofcriminal procedure and child custodyadjudication. The lessons of the course,however, cut across expert disciplinesand substantive areas of the law.Law and Social Science G62.1403/L06.3008 (Law) Tyler. Introduction to the interface between law and the social sciences. Explores theuse of social science research findings ina variety of areas of the law. Theseinclude jury decision making; the use ofprofiles in identifying suspects; evidencesuch as lie detectors, eyewitnesses, andrepressed trademark confu-sion; psychological assumptions under-lying Constitutional law; citizen dissat-isfaction with the law and legal authori-ties; and a variety of other topics. II. SOCIAL AND LEGAL POLICY Law and Social Policy Law and Science G62.2001/L06.3544 (Law) Nelkin. This seminar examines the intersection of law and science, drawing from policydisputes over human genetics, biotech-nology, and AIDS. In each of theseareas, courts and administrative agen-cies have generated and mediated con-flicts between scientific and social val-ues. The course addresses issues of pri-vacy, property, and informed consentthat arise in disputes over genetic test-ing and biotechnology. It then address-es the role of science in shaping AIDSpolicies. This course is offered for partA writing credit. Health Law G62.2002/L13.3525 (Law) Law. Considers how the law influences the availability, quality, and cost of medicalcare, and demands a sophisticatedunderstanding of many bodies of law,including the Constitution; state andfederal administrative law; the regula-tion of insurance; the Byzantinestatutes defining benefit and regulatoryprograms; tort principles of duty, con-sent, confidentiality, and malpractice;corporate law (profit and not-for-prof-it); labor law; tax law; and more.However, the focus is not primarilylegal. Rather, the effort is to grapplewith defining life experiences and toexplore the political, philosophical, andpersonal values that shape these experi-ences. Statutes, regulations, and judicialdecisions are primary source materials,but these are placed in an empiricalpolicy context. Science and Culture: Who Controls the Body? G62.2003/G93.3407 (Sociology) Nelkin. This seminar examines controversies over the ownership and control of thebody that have resulted from advancesin genetics, biotechnology, and repro- ductive technology. Embryos, blood,human tissue, and DNA have becomevaluable resources \u2014raw materials for the development of biotechnologyproducts and sources of predictiveinformation for social institutions.Readings and seminar discussions userecent disputes to examine the relation-ship of science to law, commerce, andsocial policy, and to explore the influ-ence of the applications of biotechnolo-gy and genetics on questions of privacy,identity, and rights. Empirical Issues in Land Use and Environmental LawG62.2004/L10.3501 (Law) Been. This seminar explores the empirical assumptions that underlie leading theo-retical justifications for various aspectsof land use and environmental law, sur-vey and critique existing empirical evi-dence bearing upon those assumptions,and formulate research plans for furthertests of the assumptions. Particularattention is given to the empirical basesfor various theories regarding whencompensation should be paid for envi-ronmental and land use restrictionsimposed upon property. The coursedoes not assume statistical or econo-metric knowledge, nor are studentsasked to conduct statistical tests.Instead, the emphasis is on learning toidentify often hidden empiricalassumptions, gaining rudimentaryunderstanding of empirical methodolo-gies, and developing an ability to for-mulate research questions for persons(such as expert witnesses) who do havethe econometric skills necessary toactually execute the studies. Studentsprepare short critiques of existingempirical studies and present a proposalfor an empirical study. Students whowish to use the seminar for a part Apaper may use the proposal as thespringboard for a longer analysis. Theseminar lays the groundwork for devel-oping a clinic in which students pro-vide empirical analyses necessary forinformed land use and environmentalpolicy discussions. Although a back-ground in land use or environmentallaw is not an absolute prerequisite,some familiarity with at least one ofthose areas is desirable. Allocating Authority for Biomedical Decisions G62.2005/L08.3528 (Law) Dubler. The law 's response to new biomedical technologies and the role of law inexercising control over these develop-ments. Topics covered include geneticengineering; reproductive technologies;LAW AND SOCIETY 205prenatal diagnosis and treatment and genetic counseling; abortion andadvances in neonatology; life-sustainingtechnologies at the beginning and endof life and for those with poor qualityof life; organ transplantation; artificialorgans; testing and screening for healththreats; and allocating health careresources and rationing. Women and Law G62.2006/L08.3508 (Law) Ellis, Goldscheid. Taught by feminist practitioners, this course seeks to integrate feminist theo-ry with the practice of women 's rights law by examining a wide range of con-temporary women 's rights legal issues. Beginning with the development ofconstitutional protection for genderdiscrimination, the course examinestopics such as reproductive rights, edu-cational equity, violence againstwomen, employment, and gender biasin the courts, with attention to howwomen 's rights concerns intersect with issues of race, class, and sexual orienta-tion. The course discusses how litiga-tion, public policy, and legislativestrategies have and can be used toachieve feminist visions of equality. Sexuality and the Law G62.2007/L08.3509 (Law) Ehelbrick. Begins with the development of consti- tutional, medical, and theoretical con-structions of sexuality. The question ofhow state regulations and legal analysispromote or reflect certain views of sexu-ality, gender, and sexual orientation iscentral to discussion and study. Thelater part of the course applies thisbackground to three specific institu-tional contexts in which the social rulesof sexuality and gender are challengedand charged through the legal process:the military, marriage and the family,and the workplace. Rights of the Mentally Disabled G62.2008/L08.3535 (Law) Levy. Study of the delicate balance between government benevolence and individualautonomy. The seminar considers therights of persons with mental disabili-ties in institutional and community set-tings and explores issues involving psy-chiatric expertise, involuntary commit-ment, the right to treatment, the rightto refuse treatment, discrimination, therights of newborns with mental disabil-ities (the \"Baby Doe \" cases) and med- ical decision making for incompetentpersons (Cruzan, et. al.). Students exam- ine the development of case law andstatutes and the social policies underly-ing them, analyze briefs and transcripts from selected cases, and attend a com-mitment hearing. Government Benefits Programs G62.2009/L13.3005 (Law) M. Davis, Law. Examines the principal policy choices faced in government benefit programsfor the poor, including the definition ofthe category of recipients; the design func-tions of judicial review. Focuses on Aidto Families with Dependent Children,Social Security, and the SupplementalSecurity Income program. Crime Deviance and Social Control G62.2020/G93.2160 (Sociology)Greenberg. Broad, introductory course in the soci- ology of deviance and social control.Students read and analyze classical andcontemporary texts representing differ-ent theoretical and research traditions,dealing with the designation of sometypes of behavior and conditions asdeviant; ideologies and methods ofsocial control; the etiology of deviance;deviant subcultures; and the politics ofdeviance. An attempt is made to exam-ine a wide range of normative viola-tions, such as crime, mental illness,witchcraft, scientific deviance, alcoholand drug use, and various types of sexu-al deviance. Criminology G62.2021/G93.2503 (Sociology) Dixon. Critical evaluation of the historical development of the study of crime.Readings offer a variety of theoreticaland methodological approaches to theanalysis of various areas of crime (vio-lent, property, victimless, white collar).The class provides a forum for criticallydiscussing the variety of theoreticalframeworks, issues, research methodolo-gies, and findings used to explain theformation, violation, and administra-tion of criminal law. Assigned readingsinclude Criminological Theories by Ronald Akers, The Real W ar on Crime by Steven Donziger, and numerousjournal articles. Criminal Sanctions G62.2022/ L04.3525 (Law) Garland. This seminar examines current issues in the sentencing and sanctioning ofoffenders. Using historical, sociological,and philosophical approaches, it aims to develop a critical understanding of con-temporary policies and practices of pun-ishment. Readings deal with policiessuch as incapacitation, just desserts,expressive justice, and retribution andlook at the decision making and prac-tices of the institutions that implementthem. The aim is to ground normativeanalysis (as developed by the philosoph-ical literature) in a more empiricalknowledge of how penal institutionsactually work. Students may choose tobe examined by means of a term paperthat will satisfy the part A writingrequirement. Policing in Democratic Societies G62.2023/L04.3533 (Law) Fijnaut, Skolnick. What are the origins of democratic policing? How are police organized,and how do they function? Why do lawenforcement officials act the way theydo, in patrolling, searching, seizing,interrogating? What are the occasions,explanations, and remedies for policebrutality, corruption, and perjury?What kinds of rules, organizations, andinstitutions are appropriate and effec-tive for maintaining police accountabil-ity in a democratic society? Althoughstudents discuss some constitutionalcases, this is not a systematic seminar inthe doctrine of police practices. Rather,the focus is on the history, sociology,and politics of the police. Policeaccountability through politics and lawis a major concern. Regulation of Vice G62.2024/ L04.3559 (Law) Skolnick. What is vice and how does it differ from crime? If we criminalize it, can weregulate it? And if we decriminalize it,how shall we regulate it? This seminardiscusses a range of \"vices\" and regula- tory strategies that might be applied.Because students need to know muchabout the nature of the \"vice\" in order to sensibly discuss policy options, thereis considerable reading, some of itrequired, others recommended. Gun Control G62.2025/L04.3525 (Law) Jacobs, Noble. This seminar examines the problem that firearms and other weapons posefor contemporary society and the con-stitutional, statutory, administrative,and court-made laws relating to theregulation of firearms and otherweaponry. Topics include firearms andcrime; firearms and self-defense; theSecond Amendment as a limitation oncongressional regulation; federalism and206 LAW AND SOCIETYthe federal role in the regulating of firearms; the role of the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; theconflict between state and local govern-ment in regulating firearms; criminallaw issues (including aggravated offens-es, prophylactic offenses, and presump-tions); sentencing law issues (bootstrap-ping and other enhancements forcrimes committed with firearms); theprohibition and regulation of subcate-gories of firearms (e.g., \"Saturday night specials \" and \"assault rifles \"); products liability and gun control; controls onammunition; controls on less lethalweaponry (knives, mace, and brassknuckles); and controls on more lethalweaponry (explosives and militaryweapons). Students are required towrite a paper either for the part A orpart B writing requirement and presenttheir work in class. Corruption and Corruption Control G62.2026/L04.3510 (Law) Limit 16 students. Goldstock. This seminar examines the pervasive problem of official corruption and thevarious bodies of law and legal institu-tions that exist to prevent, detect, andpunish corruption. Topics includebribery and antigratuity statutes; thefederal role in investigating and prose-cuting state and local corruption underthe Hobbes Act and mail statutes; con-flict of administrative enforcement strate-gies and sanctions. The seminar fulfillsthe part A writing requirement. Race, Poverty, and Criminal Justice G62.2027/L04.3512 (Law) Stevenson. Examines the influence of race and vic- tim-offender economic status in theadministration of criminal justice.Conscious and unconscious racism aswell as overt and more complicatedmechanisms for creating bias againstthe poor are explored. Students studyracial disparities in charging, discre-tionary judgments in the prosecution ofcriminal cases, sentencing, and the for-mulation of crime policy in the UnitedStates, and discuss issues of race andclass in criminal case court decisions.Students assess the effectiveness ofantidiscrimination law in the crime andpunishment area and review data andempirical studies on a variety of issuesthat impact the poor and people ofcolor in the criminal justice system.Particular attention is paid to the roleof legislators, prosecutors, state and fed- eral judges, defense attorneys, andjurors, and litigation and other reformstrategies aimed at bias against racialminorities and the poor are discussed. III. COMPARATIVE AND GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES Comparative Law and Social Change G62.3001/G93.3534 (Sociology)Heydebrand. This seminar explores the historical and structural interrelationships betweenlaw, politics, and economy in theUnited States and Europe in the 20thcentury. Starting with the theories ofMarx and Weber and the historicalwork of Horwitz, Hurot, Merryman,and Tigar and Levy, the focus is on theanalysis of 20th-century developmentssuch as legal realism, the legal processapproach, feminist jurisprudence, criti-cal legal studies, and the economicanalysis of law. Parallel jurisprudentialmovements are analyzed for Europe(e.g., the work of the early critical legaltheorists Fraenkel, Kirchheimer, andNeumann and the theories ofLuhmann, Teubner, and an inquiry into theunderpinnings of state socialist, fascist,and postsocialist legal systems. Topics in Advanced Property G62.3002/L10.3537 (Law) DeVita, Upham. This seminar addresses a range of issues in contemporary property law from theperspectives of American, European,and Japanese law. Topics include theo-ries of property, security of title, land-use controls, the intergenerational trans-fer of wealth, intellectual property, andthe role of property rights in economicdevelopment. Students may write theirpart A paper for this seminar. Race and the Law: U.S. and South Africa G62.3003/L06.3542 (Law) Higgenbotham Jr. Comparative analysis of the legal process in South Africa and the UnitedStates. Focus is primarily on (1) thepolitical leadership and in-court advo-cacy by lawyers and (2) the similaritiesand differences in the education lawsand cases in South Africa and in theUnited States. Law and Society in Japan G62.3004/L05.3006 (Law) Upham. Looks at the interaction of the legal system and legal institutions withJapanese society, politics, and econom-ics. The goal is to use Japan as a casestudy of the role that law can play in contemporary advanced democraciesand thereby test current social theory oflaw and society against a non-Westernexperience. Looks closely at several dif-ferent areas of law in Japan, includingenvironmental protection, patients ' rights, freedom of religion, civil rightsissues in employment discriminationand affirmative action, criminal proce-dure and police practices, HIV/AIDS,and family law. Readings consist oftranslated cases, statutes, and othertypes of legal documents, and second-ary materials. Evaluation is based pri-marily on a take-homeexamination/essay, although in particu-lar circumstances permission is grantedto students who wish to write researchpapers. No particular background isrequired or recommended, and studentswith no previous interest or experiencein Japan are welcome. Law and Society in China G62.3005/L05.3009 (Law) Scogin. Deals with the development of the indigenous Chinese legal tradition,within the context of the Confucian,legalist, and Taoist philosophy; thereform of law in modern China; and theemerging legal framework for foreigninvestment in China. The Confucianlegal tradition is at the core of the legalcultures of East Asia including Japan,Korea, and much of Southeast Asia.The first part of the course serves as anintroduction to that tradition.Contemporary China has seen an effortto create a new legal system within thecontext of transforming a Communistcommand economy into a market sys-tem. The second part of the courselooks at the role of law in this processfrom the perspective of domestic actorsas well as foreign investors. Islamic Law and Society G62.3006/G77.1852/L05.3560(Middle Eastern Studies) Haykel. The aim of this seminar is to expose graduate students to a variety of writ-ings in and on Islamic law. The firstreadings consist of introductory sur-veys. These are followed by recent stud-ies on the theoretical foundations ofIslamic law (usul alfiqh) . Students then sample some substantive legal materialas it is presented in the classical legalmanuals. The aim here is to give asense of the way in which Islamic lawwas traditionally presented and howthese manuals were then used by schol-ars. This is followed by an examinationof the methods and forms of transmis-sion of Islamic legal knowledge andLAW AND SOCIETY 207expertise. Students then look at a num- ber of studies that depict Islamic law asit was understood, practiced, andenforced. Next, students look at thetreatment of Islamic jurists of margin-als and minorities in theoretical writ-ings as well as historical experience inorder to explore how norms were estab-lished and enforced and how those whodid not fully fit these were conceivedand treated by the law. Finally, studentssurvey the attempts to reform Islamiclaw in modern times. Women and Islamic Law G62.3007/G77.1854 (Middle EasternStudies) Haykel. Acquaints students with the ways Islamic law has treated women in theoryand practice. Students are exposed tomedieval and modern texts regardingthe status of women as believers, daugh-ters, wives, mothers, and legal persons.Case studies from different periods ofIslamic history as well as writings fromcontemporary anthropology are read anddiscussed. The aim is to examine theways in which Islamic law has been var-iously defined, invoked, implemented,or not implemented, in different con-texts. Emphasis is on the strategieswomen have sought to transgress \"the law\" in order to achieve a better out- come for themselves. In addition, stu-dents look at the ways in which modernlegislation in the Muslim world hastreated women and discuss the debatesover their rights and identity that havetaken place amongst feminists (bothMuslim and non-Muslim) and Islamistsand in international bodies such as theUnited Nations. Comparative Constitutionalism G62.3008/L05.3027 (Law) Baxi. This seminar addresses the theory and practice of constitutionalism in thelight of contemporary problems.Constitutionalism is not unique to theWest or the North though made to appear so by dominate discourse.Students explore many genres of consti-tutionalism (liberal, socialist, postcolo-nial, postsocialist, postliberal, and post-modern). The political achievement ofmodernity embodied in American con-stitutionalism, in all its complexity andcontradiction, is addressed in a compar-ative setting. Many a paradox character-izes contemporary constitutionalism.Some celebrate the triumph of forms ofliberal democracy; others pronounce thedeath of constitutionalism. freedom of speech postmodernist scholarshipurges us (in complex ways) to dilute, ifnot abandon altogether, the hagiogra-phy of the First Amendment. In themidst of explosive judicial activism,especially in the South, the well-worndiscourse on the legitimacy of judicialreview acquires new edges. And in thisAge of Human Rights, some constitu-tions continue to pose obstacles tonational implementation. How do, if atall, perspectives from comparative con-stitutionalism foster a more adequateunderstanding? International Law: History, Theory, and Policy G62.3009/L05.3050 (Law) Kennedy. Considers the theoretical, doctrinal, and policy arguments that have been usedin addressing international legal issuesin this century. Also considers basicdoctrines of public international law, aswell as relations among the professionaldisciplines of comparative law, andinternational relations. Examines boththe history of international legal argu-ment and innovative contemporaryscholarship, while looking at a selectionof current international regulatoryissues. There is no prerequisite. Bothstudents with and without prior inter-national law study or experience arewelcome.Comparative Public Interest Lawyering G62.3010/L06.3575 (Law) Miyazawa. 1 credit. Research seminar designed to provide students with an opportunity to engagein a comparative study on public inter-est lawyering, which is broadly con-ceived here, ranging from pro bono,legal aid, and public defenders, to causelawyering, political lawyering, andrebellious lawyering. Classroom sessionsare used to review major theoretical andempirical works on the subject.Students present a research plan at thefinal session. A research paper is due onthe last day of the examination period. Reading and Research G62.3304 Staff. Independent study.

Nelson.CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Anna Szabolcsi DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor John Victor Singler he subject matter of linguistics islanguage. At thesame time that linguists work to determine theunique qualities of individuallanguages, they are constantlysearching for linguistic univer-sals, for properties whoseexplanatory power reaches across languages. The members of thefaculty of the Department ofLinguistics have research inter-ests in syntax, semantics, urbansociolinguistics, phonology, pho-netics, computational linguistics,and historical linguistics. The department has strong ties to the Departments ofAnthropology, Computer Sci-ence, Philosophy, and Psychol-ogy, and in recent yearsmembers of the departmenthave cotaught courses with members of the Departments ofAnthropology and Psychology.The bonds to these disciplinesreflect the department 's com- mitment to a broad-based andcomprehensive approach to thestudy of language. The department 's M.A./Ph.D. program prepares students forresearch in linguistics and forcareers in academe and industry. 719 BROADWAY , ROOM 501 NEW YORK, NY 10003-6860 (212) 998-7950 T FacultyMark R.

The department has two different degree programs, and applicants shouldspecify the degree program for whichthey are applying. The department 's principal degree program is theM.A./Ph.D. program, for studentsinterested in a career in research. Moststudents admitted to the departmentenroll in this program. Exceptionally, students may enroll in a terminal M.A. program. A studentwho is permitted to enroll in the termi-nal M.A. program and who subsequent-ly wishes to enter the M.A./Ph.D. pro-gram must apply to the department foradmission to the latter. Acceptance isnot automatic. MASTER OF ARTS A student enrolled in the terminalM.A. program must select a track inaccordance with the student 's interests. Upon selecting a track, the studentthen selects an adviser who specializesin that area. Degree Requirements: 1. Satisfactory completion of graduate studies totaling at least 32 points ofapproved courses (at least 24 in resi-dence at New York University). Coursework in a field other than linguisticsmust be approved in advance by thestudent 's adviser. The M.A. program is organized by track. Each track has its own courserequirements that add up to 28 of the32 points required for the M.A. Thecourses that the student takes for theremaining 4 points are determined bythe student in consultation with thestudent 's adviser. The tracks G61.1220, G61.1310,G61.2110, the following: G61.1220,G61.1410, G61.1510, or G61.1830. Any proposed substitution of some other course for a \"track \" course must be approved both by the student 's adviser and the director of graduatestudies. 2. Reasonable proficiency in a language of clear relevance to the student 's research, subject to approval by thedirector of graduate studies. Proficiencycan be demonstrated either by earning agrade of B or better in at least thefourth term of a college language coursecompleted not more than two yearsbefore the student 's admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Science, orby passing the appropriate GraduateSchool of Arts and Science languageexamination. When proficiency hasbeen demonstrated in some other way,e.g., when a student has received anundergraduate degree from a foreignuniversity where the language in ques-tion was the medium of instruction forthe student 's course of study, the direc- tor of graduate studies may forward toGSAS a request for a waiver of the lan-guage examination. 3. Passing a written examination that should be taken during the term inwhich course work is completed (andmust be taken for the first time no laterthan the term following the one inwhich course work is completed).Students may take the examination asecond time if necessary. MASTER OF ARTS/DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY M.A. Degree Requirements: 1. Satisfactory completion of graduate studies totaling at least 32 points ofapproved courses (at least 24 in resi-dence at only one of the last four coursesis required for the M.A., all four ofthem are required for the Ph.D.Therefore, any of these four courses nottaken for the M.A. should be taken assoon as possible thereafter. The department recommends that students wishing to specialize in soci-olinguistics take at least two courses inlinguistic anthropology, specificallyLinguistic Anthropology (G14.1040)and one other from the following:Ethnographic Methods (G14.2700),Identity and Language (G14.3392), orLinguistic Field Methods (G14.3394). 2. Reasonable proficiency in a language of clear relevance to the student 's research, subject to approval by thedirector of graduate studies. Proficiencycan be demonstrated either by earning agrade of B or better in at least thefourth term of a college language coursecompleted not more than two yearsbefore the student 's admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Science, orby passing the appropriate GraduateSchool of Arts and Science languageexamination. When proficiency hasbeen demonstrated in some other way,e.g., when a student has received anundergraduate degree from a foreignuniversity where the language in ques-tion was the medium of instruction forthe student 's course of study, the direc- tor of graduate studies may forward toGSAS a request for a waiver of the lan-guage examination. 3. An article-quality paper in which the student demonstrates the ability tocarry out original research. In preparingthe paper, the student works with athree-person qualifying-paper commit-tee.

Together the student andthe chair explore potential topics forthe qualifying paper, and together theyselect the two other members of thecommittee. It is the three members ofthe committee who determine whetheror not the student 's paper meets the department 's standard. The paper must be submitted for the first time no laterthan the announced deadline in the firstsemester after the student has complet-ed 32 points. (For part-time students,the paper must be submitted in the firstsemester after the student has complet-ed 32 points or in the first semester ofthe student 's fourth year, whichever comes earlier.) If the student 's paper is not accepted at the time of its first sub-mission, the student is allowed a secondsubmission in the following semester.For the student to be admitted into thePh.D. program, the student 's paper must be found acceptable no later thanits second submission. Ph.D. Degree Requirements:1. A Master of Arts degree in linguis- tics or equivalent preparation. Studentsentering the department after takinggraduate work elsewhere are advised bythe director of graduate studies con-cerning equivalence. A student wishingto enroll at the Ph.D. level yet notholding a master 's degree in linguistics from the department is required to sub-mit an article-quality paper in whichthe student demonstrates the ability tocarry out original research no later thanthe third semester after enrolling in thedepartment (see item 3, immediatelyabove). A student may submit thepaper to the committee twice. Any courses taken prior to the paper 's acceptance may later be counted towardthe doctorate. 2. Completion of 40 points of approved course work beyond the master 's degree, including G61.1340,G61.1410, G61.1510, and G61.1830,if the student did not take them at theM.A. level. Students must offer a totalof 72 points of course work includingwork required for the master 's degree or its equivalent; of this total at least32 points must be taken in residence atNew York University. Students enter-ing the department after taking gradu-ate work elsewhere are advised by thedirector of graduate studies concerningthe transferability of credits for particu-lar courses; requests for transfers ofcredits for particular courses must bemade within the student 's first year in the department. 3. If they have not already done so, either in another department or atanother university, students must meetthe foreign language requirement forthe M.A. degree. In addition, they mustdemonstrate reasonable proficiency in asecond language of clear relevance to thestudent 's research, subject to approval by the director of graduate studies.Proficiency can be demonstrated eitherby earning a grade of B or better in atleast the fourth term of a college lan-guage course completed not more thantwo years before the student 's admission to the Graduate School of Arts andScience, or by passing the appropriateGraduate School of Arts and Sciencelanguage examination. When proficien-cy has been demonstrated in some otherway, e.g., when a student has receivedan undergraduate degree from a foreign university where the language in ques-tion was the medium of instruction forthe student 's course of study, the direc- tor of graduate studies may forward toGSAS a request for a waiver of the lan-guage examination. 4. The student must produce a second article-quality paper in an area of lin-guistics distinct from that in which thefirst article-quality paper was submit-ted. In preparing the second article-quality paper, the student follows thesame procedure as for the first. Thepaper must be submitted no later thanthe announced deadline in the firstsemester following the acceptance ofthe first article-quality paper. If thestudent 's paper is not accepted at the time of its first submission, the studentis allowed a second submission in thefollowing semester. For the student tobe allowed to remain in the Ph.D. pro-gram, the student 's paper must be found acceptable no later than its sec-ond submission. 5. A dissertation is required, proposals for which are to be submitted to thechair shortly after the student has com-pleted course work and the second ofthe article-quality papers. 6. The dissertation is defended during a final oral examination.

McLaughlin DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THEINSTITUTE: Professor Marsha J. Berger CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Joel H. Spencer DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Fedor A. Bogomolov he Department of Mathematics ofthe Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences offers sev-eral degree programs. The Ph.D.programs offer research opportu-nities and instruction at thehighest level in a range of core,multidisciplinary, and computa-tional mathematics. In additionto the Ph.D. programs in mathe-matics, the department cooper-ates in a new Ph.D. program inatmosphere ocean science andmathematics. The master 's pro- grams provide professional train-ing in financial modeling andcomputation, mathematical andcomputational techniques of sci-entific computing, and statisticsand operations research, as wellas in traditional core areas ofmathematics. The philosophy of the Courant Institute, developedover several decades, has been to maintain a balance and interac-tion between pure and appliedmathematics. The Institute haslong been a leader in mathemat-ical analysis, applied mathemat-ics, and scientific computing. Incore mathematics, strengthsinclude differential equa-tions, processes, topology,and dynamical systems. In mul-tidisciplinary mathematics, theInstitute 's program encompasses research activities not found inmost mathematics departments:wave propagation, computa-tional fluid dynamics ocean science,mathematical biology, financialmodeling, and materials science.Much of the research is federallyfunded and involves postdoc-toral scientists. There is anactive program of research semi-nars, and participation by stu-dents is strongly encouraged. New York University is a member of the Inter-UniversityDoctoral Consortium (see page311 of this bulletin), whosemembers include the CUNYGraduate Center and Columbia,Fordham, and New School Uni-versities. With permission, doc-toral students may cross-registerfor courses in these institutions and thus have access to a verybroad range of mathematics andrelated fields. The Department of Mathe- matics is housed in WarrenWeaver Hall, which contains amathematical sciences library of64,000 volumes, over 275 jour-nals, extensive back files, and agrowing array of electronicresources such as Web of Science(ISI) and MathSciNet. Over1,300 electronic scientific jour-nal titles in various disciplinesare available at the University.Workstations and X-terminalsare available in public locationsand in every graduate studentoffice. The Applied Mathemat-ics Laboratory comprises anexperimental facility in fluidmechanics and other appliedareas, coupled with a visualiza-tion and simulation facility. TheCenter for Atmosphere OceanStudies is the locus for multidis-ciplinary studies and research incritical environmental problems,such as global warming, ozonedepletion, monsoon and El Ni \u00f1o cycles, and pollution of air andwater; it organizes a weekly col-loquium and brings togetherinterested faculty and studentsfrom different departments. 251 MERCER STREET NEW YORK, NY 10012-1185 (212) 998-3256 WEB SITE: www.math.nyu.eduMathematicsDEPARTMENT OF (mathematics), Buenos Aires.

Once they are in a program, stu-dents may change advisers after notify-ing the director of graduate studies.However, departmental approval isrequired for selection of a dissertationadviser or change thereof. MASTER OF ARTS Admission: All applicants must sub- mit Graduate Record Examinationscores; graduates of undergraduateinstitutions where instruction is in alanguage other than English must alsosubmit scores from the TOEFL orequivalent. The department stronglyrecommends that applicants havealready acquired proficiency in Arabic,Persian, or Turkish at the intermediatelevel or beyond. The department accepts applicants for fall admission only. Course of Study: The Master of Arts degree requires the completion of32 points of course work, no more than8 points of which may be transferredfrom other graduate schools. All stu-dents must take the following courses:Problems and Methods in Middle Eastern Studies (G77.1687); two cours-es in Middle Eastern history; two on topic; andtwo language courses at the advancedlevel or beyond. Students must also complete a mas- ter's thesis, which may be an expanded seminar paper or an entirely newresearch project. It should demonstratethe student 's mastery of a particular subject and the related scholarly litera-ture as well as his or her ability to ana-lyze a problem and effectively conveythat analysis in written form. Requirements for the Master of Arts degree should be met within two yearsof matriculation at New YorkUniversity. No student who has not yetreceived the master 's degree by that time may register for additional coursework without departmental approval,nor may any student who has alreadyreceived the M.A. degree continuecourse work without departmentalapproval. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Admission: Students already in the department working toward the M.A.degree who want to continue graduate study and pursue the Ph.D. degreeshould apply to the department for per-mission by the beginning of the semes-ter in which they will complete allrequirements for the M.A. degree. Thatapplication should include a statementof research interests, an outlined plan ofstudy, and at least three letters of rec-ommendation from NYU faculty.Departmental permission to continuegraduate work toward the Ph.D. degreeis neither automatic nor guaranteed;students to whom the departmentdenies permission to continue graduatestudy receive the M.A. as their terminaldegree, provided they have met all therequirements for that degree. Students who already have, or are about to receive, an M.A. degree fromanother department, program, or uni-versity should apply for admission inaccordance with the procedures speci-fied by the Graduate School of Arts andScience. At the department 's discretion, students may be granted up to32 points of degree credit for graduate-level course work done elsewhere.

They must alsodemonstrate proficiency in eitherArabic, Persian, or Turkish as well as areading knowledge sufficient forresearch purposes of at least oneEuropean language. A student may berequired by his or her dissertationadviser to learn additional languages, inkeeping with the student 's specific research needs. As early as possible in their gradu- ate studies, students should choose amajor field and begin focusing theirstudies on it. Subject to the availabilityof faculty, major fields may includeancient Egyptian history/language/cul-ture; classical Arabic language and lit-erature; modern Arabic language andliterature; Persian language and litera-ture; and Turkish language and litera-ture. (Students primarily interested inMiddle Eastern history should seebelow for information about the jointPh.D. program in history and MiddleEastern studies.) By the end of their third year of graduate study, students should havetaken and passed the written qualifyingexamination in their major field.Students prepare for this examinationby course work and by workingthrough a reading list for the fieldunder the supervision of the facultymember who will examine them; eachexamination will have a second readeras well. Students who do not pass theirmajor field examination may petitionthe department for permission to takethe examination one more time. Students must also be certified in a minor field, which should be distinctfrom the major field but complementa-ry to it in subject matter or theoreticalconcern. Students should develop acoherent minor field in consultationwith their minor field adviser andobtain the approval of the director ofgraduate studies; certification requiresat least three courses in the minor fieldand a substantial piece of writing,either a major research paper or a sub-stantial bibliographical essay. After completing the major and minor field requirements, the studentshould formulate a dissertation propos-al, in consultation with the student 's primary dissertation adviser as well asthe faculty members on the student 's dissertation committee. On completionof all course work (including all incom-pletes) and the fulfillment of all lan-guage requirements, the student mustpass an oral examination in his or herspecial field, defined in consultationwith the student 's adviser and approved by the director of graduate studies. Thestudent 's adviser and two other faculty members serve as the examiners.Discussion of the dissertation proposaland its relation to the relevant scholarlyliterature is a key component of thespecial field examination.

Admission: Students primarily inter- ested in the history of the Middle Eastshould seek admission to the jointPh.D. program in history and MiddleEastern studies, in accordance with theprocedures specified by theDepartments of Middle Eastern Studiesand History. Admission to the jointprogram is contingent on outstandingacademic performance and provisionaluntil the completion of all M.A.requirements and until qualifyingexaminations are taken and passed. Course of Study: Joint Ph.D. students must complete a total of 72 points,including three graduate seminars; atleast one of those seminars must be in anon-Middle Eastern field. Studentsmust demonstrate proficiency in at leastone Middle Eastern language, in accor-dance with the procedures prescribedby the Department of Middle EasternStudies, as well as a reading knowledgeof at least one European language, inaccordance with the procedures pre-scribed by the Department of History.A student may be required by his orher dissertation adviser to learn addi-tional languages, in keeping with thestudent 's specific research needs. Students should begin defining the fields of historical study in which theywish to specialize and concentrate asearly as possible. Joint program stu-dents must also take the \"methods \" course required of all history graduatestudents. Between their second andthird year of full-time study, students must take and pass a qualifying exami-nation in each of two major fields ofhistory. One field must be MiddleEastern; the other may be MiddleEastern or one of the other fieldsdefined by the Department of History.Subject to the availability of faculty,Middle Eastern fields may includemodern Middle Eastern history (1750-present), early modern Middle Easternhistory (1200-1800), and early Islamichistory (600-1200); other MiddleEastern history fields may be approvedlater. Each student 's choice of fields must be approved by the directors ofgraduate studies of both departments. Both qualifying examinations are normally taken at the end of the samesemester, but students may petition totake one of their examinations no laterthan the end of the following semester.Students who do not pass a qualifyingexamination may petition for permis-sion to take it one more time. Studentspreparing for an examination in any ofthe fields for which the Department ofHistory prescribes \"literature of the field\" courses must take those courses. For Middle Eastern history fields, it islikely that preparation for examinationsin those fields will be done not in for-mal literature of the field courses butthrough reading courses or informally,in a manner to be arranged by each fac-ulty member. In either case, studentsprepare for their qualifying examina-tions by course work in the field and byworking through a reading list for thefield under the supervision of the facul-ty member who will examine them;each examination will have a secondreader as well. After successfully completing the qualifying examinations, the studentshould begin to formulate a dissertationproposal, in consultation with the stu-dent's primary dissertation adviser. On completion of all course work (includ-ing all incompletes) and the fulfillmentof all language requirements, the stu-dent must pass an oral examination inhis or her special field, defined in con-sultation with the student 's adviser (who must be a full, associated, or affil-iated member of the Department ofHistory) and approved by the directorsof graduate studies of the Departmentsof History and Middle Eastern Studies.The student 's adviser and two other fac- ulty members serve as examiners.Discussion of the dissertation proposaland its relation to the relevant scholarlyliterature are a key component of thespecial field examination.

INTERNSHIPS One of the unique opportunities opento students in the program is the indi-vidualized and project-oriented person-al internship placement for one semes-ter or more (approximately 300 hours).As the artistic, financial, and culturalcenter of the country, New York Cityhas the largest concentration of muse-ums anywhere in the world. Thus, stu-dents may work at one of the morethan 90 museums in the metropolitanarea or elsewhere in the United Statesand abroad. Placements are based onthe student 's long-range goals, academ- ic specialization, area of museum careergoals, experience, and skills.Placements are made at (but are notlimited to) the following: AmericanMuseum of Natural History, NationalMuseum of the American Indian, AsiaSociety, Brooklyn Museum, BrooklynHistorical Society, New York StateMuseum, Museum of the City of NewYork, Metropolitan Museum of Art,Museum of Modern Art, New YorkHall of Science, New York PublicLibrary, Staten Island Historical Society,Statue of Liberty NationalMonument/Ellis Island (National ParkService), Whitney Museum,Smithsonian Institution, and Grey ArtGallery at New York University. Inchoosing an internship, the student and the internship coordinator give primacyto matching the goals set by the stu-dent to the experience offered at themuseum. The program considers the intern- ship a catalyst in the workplace forsynthesizing academic and museumstudies and in preparing students forplacement and advancement as muse-um professionals. SPECIAL PROJECTS Students may participate in specialprojects and exhibitions, colloquia, andsymposia organized by the program,according to their abilities and inter-ests. Past activities have included stu-dent work on program contracts for thecollection, registration, and storage ofhistorical collections at the Statue ofLiberty National Monument/EllisIsland (National Park Service) and onthe educational programming develop-ment for and staffing at the New YorkTransit Museum (Metropolitan TransitAuthority).

Continuing the tradi-tions established in the depart-ment by pioneering scholars suchas Curt Sachs and Gustave Reese,the curriculum is research ori-ented; most courses are con-cerned with extending theboundaries of current knowledge.The program is designed for theprofessionally minded studentwho plans a career combiningcollege-level teaching with con-tinuing research and/or composi-tion. Recent graduates holdacademic appointments in some of the most prestigious universi-ties in the United States andCanada and are making distin-guished contributions to scholar-ship on both the national andinternational levels. The University is strong in supporting resources, includingthe Elmer Holmes Bobst Libraryand Study Center, which housesan important collection of music,books, periodicals, and micro-films of early musical sources.The Avery Fisher Center in theBobst Library has built up anenviable collection of videos andrecordings. The Noah GreenbergCollection of Musical Instru-ments (containing the collectionof the New York Pro MusicaAntiqua) forms a nucleus for thedepartment 's ensemble for the performance of early music, theCollegium Musicum. Likewise,the Ethnomusicology Ensemblemakes use of contains a growingvariety of instruments fromthroughout the world. The department houses the American Institute for VerdiStudies, furthering Verdi researchand making that research widelyavailable by providing perhaps the largest collection of Verdisource materials in the world,and the Center for Early Music,committed to the performancepractice of medieval, Renais-sance, and early baroque musicand to combining academicstudy with research in a labora-tory performance setting. Thedepartment also sponsors theWashington Square Contempo-rary Music Society, which pres-ents three professional concertseach year devoted to the mostrecent music of our time. In addition to the resources within the University, the NewYork City area presents limitlesscultural facilities, among themthe New York Public Library, thePierpont Morgan Library, theMetropolitan Museum of Art,the Schomburg Center forResearch in Black Culture, andthe many performing institutionsactive in the city. The depart-ment sponsors a colloquiumseries and frequently offerscourses by eminent visiting pro-fessors; these have included H.Wiley Hitchcock, Jessie AnnOwens, Joshua Rifkin, AllanAtlas, and Lydia Goehr. 24 WAVERLY PLACE, ROOM 268 NEW YORK, NY 10003-6789 (212) 998-8300 T FacultyGage Averill, Ph.D. (eth-nomusicology), B.A. 1984, W ashington. of the Caribbean; Haitian music; popular music; North Americanvernacular.Robert Bailey, Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Music.

MusicDEPARTMENT OF 230 MUSICPrograms and Requirements Admission: All applicants to the department are encouraged to visit thedepartment in advance. Students areadmitted to the department 's graduate program on the basis of a superior aca-demic record as evidenced by tran-scripts and letters of recommendationand, for the program in music theoryand composition, by demonstrated cre-ative ability. Students must also submitscores for the Graduate RecordExamination. Applicants must hold (orbe in the process of receiving) the B.A.,B.M., or an equivalent degree, and theirundergraduate careers should include astrong background in the liberal artsand a special emphasis on music.Entering students should possess a solidbackground in harmony, counterpoint,and analysis, and they must take adiagnostic examination in these areas intheir first semester of study at NewYork University. Students who fail theexamination are strongly encouraged toremedy the deficiency before taking thegeneral examination and before com-pleting the second year of course work. Registration: All students registering for courses must have their choicesapproved by the director of graduatestudies. Students not enrolled in thedepartment must have written approvalof the instructor and the director ofgraduate studies to register for adepartmental course. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY All graduate students admitted inmusic are considered students for thePh.D. and take 72 points of course work. After completing or enrollingin their first 36 points, students takea general examination (see below),administered in the spring semester ofeach year. Students who transfer to thedepartment with a master 's degree from another university are nonethe-less required to take the generalexamination. Students may receive credit for courses taken at other universities thatbelong to the Inter-University DoctoralConsortium if those courses are notavailable at NYU. The consortial insti-tutions are Columbia University, theGraduate Center at CUNY , FordhamUniversity, New School University, andTeachers College (ColumbiaUniversity). After the general examina-tion, students are expected to beginpreparing research papers and composi-tions for public presentation and publi-cation. The faculty believes stronglythat the skills involved in presenting ascholarly or musical argument and insupporting it adequately with the nec-essary apparatus form an importantaspect of graduate training. Language Examinations: Students must demonstrate reading competencyin one modern European language, usu-ally French, German, or Italian, bypassing a written examination adminis-tered by the department before takingthe general examination. Between thegeneral and special examinations, stu-dents must demonstrate reading knowl-edge in a second language (students incomposition and theory are exemptedfrom this requirement). For students in historical musicology, the second lan-guage normally is another of the princi-pal European languages, though a dif-ferent language may be chosen with theapproval of the director of graduatestudies. Students in ethnomusicologyare expected to select a language appro-priate to their research topic. General Examination: For each of the three departmental tracks, the generalexamination tests the student 's knowl- edge of all the major aspects of thefield. Students are expected to displaysophisticated skills in dealing withintellectual problems in the field andshould be able to create and supportthoughtful lines of argument from awide range of evidence. For historicalmusicology, the examiners require stu-dents to have a thorough generalknowledge of all periods of musical his-tory and of the changing stylesemployed. Students are expected to citeand discuss recent musicological writ-ings and to advance and support theo-ries about major issues in response tothe questions posed on the examina-tion. In ethnomusicology, studentsshould demonstrate an understandingof the history of the discipline, its theo-ries and principal ethnographies, andmajor musical cultures. Compositionand theory students are expected to befamiliar with the principal composersand compositional models of the lastcentury and to be able to handle prob-lems of practical analysis. Students ineach track also are expected to have abasic knowledge of the other tracks and MUSIC 231Music from 1350 to 1600; 20th-centu- ry European music; early printing andbibliography; source studies performance.

Preparation forthe examination should thereforeinclude independent study of both thesecondary literature and the musicitself, with extensive listening andanalysis. There are three possible outcomes of the exam. A student may pass the examat a level deemed appropriate for con-tinued studies toward the Ph.D. and, indoing so, will be awarded the M.A.degree in music. Or, a student may passthe exam at the M.A. level (and receivethe M.A.) but not at a level consideredacceptable for further studies in thedepartment. It is also possible for a stu-dent to fail the examination outright.Students who fail the examination mayrepeat it only once, one year after theoriginal, and may register for furtherstudy only provisionally until theexamination is passed. Adviser, Doctoral Committee, and Special Examination: During the third or fourth year of study, the studentselects a principal adviser for the disser-tation. The adviser and the studentselect two other members of the depart-mental faculty to form a dissertationcommittee. In certain cases, a memberof the committee may come from out-side the department, though normallynot from outside the University. Thiscommittee prepares the special exami-nation and works with the student onthe dissertation. The special examina-tion, individual to each student and aprerequisite for dissertation research, isadministered after the general examina-tion, after completion of course work,and at a time deemed appropriate bythe student and adviser. The examshould demonstrate the student 's com- petence in the planned field of research,in surrounding fields, and in currentmethodological and theoreticalapproaches to the topic. A student whofulfills all requirements for the Ph.D.except for the dissertation, and whodeclines to complete a dissertation, mayrequest that the department award theM.Phil. (Master of Philosophy) degree. Dissertation: A dissertation proposal must be submitted to the entire depart-mental faculty for approval. The pro-posal should succinctly state theresearch question to be studied, how itrelates to existing scholarship, themethods (approaches to fieldwork, ana-lytical techniques, etc.), and how thedissertation will expand our under-standing of the field. A proposed chap-ter outline and working bibliographyshould also be included. For composers,the principal part of their dissertation isa composition of significant proportions accompanied by a thesis on a topic inmusical analysis or theory. Composers,in their dissertation proposal, mustinclude a brief description of theintended composition. They should dis-cuss scoring, texts to be set, andplanned structure and size; and discussthe thesis as described above. The dissertation must be approved by all members of the dissertation com-mittee before it can be submitted tothe department. Deadlines for submis-sion of dissertations to the departmentare set at four weeks in the term beforethe deadlines of the Graduate School ofArts and Science. After four weeks haveelapsed, a public oral examination isheld for the candidate to defend theresearch and thesis before the depart-ment faculty. This defense follows rulesestablished by the Graduate School ofArts and Science. Historical Musicology: The track in historical musicology is intended tofamiliarize the student with the modesof thought and techniques of researchin the discipline. Students are expectedto develop skills in document study,archival research, stylistic analysis, edit-ing, and the study of performance prac-tice, as well as to acquire a grasp ofrecent ideas in historiography, analysisand interpretation, and other fields ofcurrent scholarly activity, such as genreand gender studies. The 36 points of course work before the general examination must includeIntroduction to Musicology(G71.2101), Ethnomusicology: Theoryand History (G71.2136), and a coursein musical analysis. Students shouldtake courses from a range of periods ofWestern music history. Ethnomusicology: The training in ethnomusicology should prepare stu-dents for doctoral study by familiariz-ing them with the history of the disci-pline, its principal theories andmethodologies, and a wide diversity ofmusical styles and forms from aroundthe world. Students learn how to designand carry out fieldwork-based researchprojects, perform library and archivalresearch, explore a wide range of multi-media approaches to analysis and publi-cation, and engage in applied/publicethnomusicology. The Ethno Lab incor-porates digital work stations andrecording equipment for documentingand studying performance traditions.Musical ensembles are included as ameans of deepening an appreciation forthe complexities of musical sound, aes-thetics, and performance practice; astraining for learning music in field-work; and as preparation for teaching similar ensembles. Course work requirements in ethno- musicology include Introduction toMusicology (G71.2101) andEthnomusicology: Theory and History(G71.2136) in the first year of study;Musical Ethnography (G71.2166);Musical Sound, Transcription, andAnalysis (G71.2148), one other gradu-ate course from the department (prefer-ably in one of the world 's musical tradi- tions); a course in anthropology or per-formance studies; and at least foursemesters of the ethnomusicologyensembles. Composition and Theory: This track is designed to provide training in origi-nal composition through creative workand through analytical study of othercomposers ' works. In addition to its full-time faculty, the department regu-larly offers semester-long seminars incomposition and theory taught by dis-tinguished (Recent included others.)Concurrently, students develop skills inanalytical methodologies and in musictheory, with particular emphasis onmusic of the 20th century. The depart-ment 's computer music studio includes multiplatform digital (including real-time) sound synthesis capabilities. Thedepartment makes arrangements forstudents to receive regular performanc-es of their compositions by professionalNew York City musicians. Course work requirements comprise the following: 20th-Century Analysis(G71.2163) or Music Since 1945(G71.2132); 20th-Century Theory(G71.2129) or Tonal Analysis(G71.2130); and at least two semestersof Techniques of Music Composition(G71.2162). Students in compositionand theory are required to select atleast one additional course each fromthe offerings in musicology and ethnomusicology. Certificate in Early Music: The department and its Center for EarlyMusic offer a program of study in theperformance practice of medieval,Renaissance, and baroque music thatcombines traditional musicologicalcourse work with performance laboratoryresearch. It is intended for the giftedperformer specializing in the re-creationof early music, for whose work a solidmusicological background is essential.Students seeking admission normallyshould have an undergraduate degree inmusic, including knowledge of musicCourses T wo-Part Courses : A hyphen indicates a full-year course with credit grantedonly for completing both terms.

MASTER OF ARTS The program has three elements: (1) acoherent sequence of courses on theregion, totaling 40 points; (2) a demon-strated ability in one modern languageof the area; and (3) a master 's thesis or report written under the supervision ofan adviser. The program includes an238 NEAR EASTERN STUDIESoptional internship course. The degree can be completed in two years (foursemesters) of full-time study; studentsmay also study part time. Course of Study: The 40 points of course work include two requiredcourses and a distribution requirement.The required courses are (1) the corecourse, Problems and Methods inMiddle Eastern Studies (G77.1687),and (2) History of the Middle East,1750-Present (G77.1642) or, with theapproval of the director, an advancedhistory seminar. Students select theremaining eight courses according totheir individual research interests, inconsultation with the director of gradu-ate studies. The distribution require-ment consists of at least one course eachfrom two of the following disciplines:anthropology, economics, politics, andsociology (e.g., two of the followingcourses: Anthropology for Middle EastStudies [G14.1322]; Economics of theMiddle East [G31.1608]; Middle EastGovernment and Politics [G53.2590];and Sociology of Islam [G77.1612]). Language Requirement: To complete the degree, students must demonstrateproficiency at the upper-intermediatelevel in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, orTurkish. (Other languages may be con-sidered as meeting this requirementwith the approval of the director of theprogram.) Students with no languagebackground may satisfy the require-ment by completing four semesters(16 points) of language training atNYU; however, only two of thosesemesters (8 points of undergraduatelanguage credits) may be countedtoward the degree. Students who haveprior language training or who take anintensive language course in the sum-mer of their first year may satisfy therequirement by testing at an intermedi-ate level of proficiency or by enrollingin an advanced class. Native speakerswith fluency in reading, writing, listen-ing, and speaking may waive thisrequirement with the permission of thedirector. Master 's Thesis or Report: The mas- ter's thesis should generally have the format, style, and length of a substan-tial scholarly article in a MiddleEastern studies field. Alternatively, itcan have the format and style of a pro-fessional report, with a length and sub-stance similar to a scholarly article. Ineither case, it must present the author 's own research and relate this to existingscholarly understandings of the topic orfield. Students should begin discussingpossible topics for the thesis or report by the end of their first semester andshould select a topic and an adviser, inconsultation with the director of gradu-ate studies, before the end of their sec-ond semester. Students are encouragedto conduct research on their topic dur-ing the summer of their first year. Internships: The internship program draws on the resources of New YorkCity as a center of international politicsand culture. Internships provide practi-cal training in the kinds of research andreport writing required for careers inpublic and nongovernmental service,policy research, cultural affairs, andpolitical advocacy. The internship pro-gram enables students to make profes-sional contacts in fields they are inter-ested in joining and to share their skillswith organizations as they explore aparticular field or issue. Organizationsproviding internships include (but arenot limited to) human rights organiza-tions; United Nations agencies andmissions; media organizations; policyresearch groups; and other nongovern-mental organizations. The internshipinvolves 10-15 hours of work per weekduring one semester. Students receiveup to 4 points toward the degree byregistering for Internship (G68.2997).They must submit weekly progressreports on their internship project aswell as mid- and end-of-semesterreports.

Classes are taughtby instructors chosen by a committeefrom the American Association ofTeachers of Persian and the American Association of Teachers of Turkish. The Eastern Consortium is a cooper- ative arrangement of the Middle EastCenters of Georgetown University,Harvard University, New YorkUniversity, Ohio State University,University of Pennsylvania, andPrinceton University; it is sponsored bythe U.S. Department of Educationunder Title VI. The summer program isheld at one of the member schools everysummer. In Summer 2001, NYU host-ed the consortium program. Admission to the Eastern Consortium program requires submis-sion of an application directly to theschool hosting the program. Tuitionfellowships are available for students toattend the Eastern Consortium pro-gram. The Eastern Consortium pro-gram meets the requirements for stu-dents who plan to study under ForeignLanguage and Area Studies Fellowships. NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 241Gender, Empire, and the Nation in the Middle East and South AsiaG68.1999 Balaghi. 4 points. The primary task of this course is toexamine the shifting paradigms of gen-der in the Middle East and South Asiathroughout the process of building,imposing, resisting, and dismantlingempire. The ruptures of colonialismrecast gender relations. The alchemy ofrace, gender, and ethnicity figuredprominently in the formation of anti-colonial nationalisms. The historicalmemory of empire continues to figureprominently in the discourses of post-colonial antifeminist movements. Thiscourse examines the history of womenin Iran, India, and Algeria in the 19thand 20th centuries in order to betterunderstand the interplay of the histori-cal and political networks of colonial-ism and nationalism in the lives ofwomen. History and Memory in the Middle East and South Asia G68.2000 Balaghi. 4 points.This course examines the politics ofmemory at moments of rupture, dislo-cation, and displacement. New nationsrequire a raison d '\u00eatre that binds the political exigencies of the present withan originary myth and a historicallyviable national past. Migration andexile give new impetus to the construc-tion of national memories. Nationalnostalgia helps to determine the borderof nation-states and the frontiers ofdiasporas. Canonicity (a process thatboth writes and elides) is central to theproject of nation-building. Nations andnationalities create and recall memoriesas a means of articulating communal-ism, coalescing distinct identities, andjustifying political positions. Popularmemory can serve as an effective meansof resistance to the national canon andits erasures by groups who are margin-alized in the national narrative.Immigrants may deploy memory as a strategy for creating a bifurcatednationalism: participating as citizens ofone nation-state while maintainingstrong ties to another. Movements ofpeoples, advances in transportation, anddevelopments in the new media in the19th and 20th centuries have given riseto particular expressions of nationalmemories with commensurate modes ofpolitical behavior. The course examinesthe contentious politics of memorywithin a variety of locations and analyt-ical paradigms. Seminar in Safavid History G77.2551 McChesney. 4 points.

DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER: Professor Dan H. Sanes DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Samuel M. Feldman eural science is a collection of dis-ciplines unifiedby a concern for the function of the brain. Exper-imental approaches in neuralscience vary from analyses ofmolecular and cellular mecha-nisms in nerve cells and groupsof nerve cells to behavioral andpsychological studies of wholeorganisms. Theoretical toolsinclude mathematical and com-putational modeling approachesthat have proved useful in other areas of science. Experimentalquestions include issues relatedto biophysical and neurochemi-cal mechanisms within singlenerve cells, functional neural cir-cuits consisting of small num-bers of neurons, the behavior oflarge systems of neurons, andthe relationship between theactivity of elements of the nerv-ous system and the behavior oforganisms. The doctoral program in neu- ral science provides advancedtraining for research careers inneural science. Opportunitiesexist for study in both experi-mental and theoretical aspects ofthe field. Areas of specialization neuro-biology, neuroscience,robotics intelli-gence, and cognitive science.The curriculum of the Ph.D.program is designed to provideresearch training of the highestcaliber to a small group of full-time students with varied back-grounds and interests.

Students seeking admission to the Center for Neural Science should have astrong background in one or more ofthe academic areas involved, such asbiology, chemistry, computer science,experimental psychology, engineeringscience, mathematics, or physics. Aclear statement of the student 's career goals and reason for applying to theCenter is required. An interview ordi-narily is scheduled before a final deci-sion on admission is made. International students must demon- strate their command of written andspoken English by their performance onthe Test of English as a ForeignLanguage (TOEFL) or its equivalentand by an interview. Special arrange-ments are made to interview interna-tional students before acceptance.DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Center accepts students only forthe degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Degree Requirements: A minimum of 72 points is required, at least 37 ofwhich must be taken in residence atNew York University. This includes therequired first-year core curriculum (seebelow). The student is expected to ful-fill the course requirements, completethe doctoral research, and defend thethesis within five years. Curriculum Planning, Advisement, and Examining Committees: An adviser and two other members of thefaculty guide the student in the selec-tion of formal courses until the thesisproposal has been submitted. At thistime a dissertation committee is select-ed, consisting of three members of thefaculty whose research interests areappropriate to help the student in theplanning and execution of the proposeddoctoral research. Examinations: The student 's general knowledge of the field of neural scienceis documented by satisfactory perform- ance in the first-year core curriculumtaught by the staff of the Center.Completion of this requirement quali-fies the student as a candidate for thedoctoral degree. Specific knowledge related to the area of the doctoral thesis is examinedorally at the time of the presentation ofthe thesis proposal to the dissertationcommittee. The formal presentation ofthe dissertation proposal must be filedat least six months before the defense ofthe thesis. The final examination consists of the oral defense of the doctoral thesis. Theexamination committee usually consistsof the three members of the dissertationcommittee plus two additional mem-bers. Passage of the thesis defense iscontingent on all but one of the exam-iners voting to accept the thesis and itsdefense. If there is a dissent, the dis-senter shall provide a written reportdetailing the grounds for the dissent.

It discusses feministaesthetics and includes performancedocumentation, articles on women inhistorical performance, reviews, scripts,and resource listings. Students on staffwork in various phases of production,including writing, copyediting, proof-reading, layout, pasteup, advertising,circulation, and distribution. CURRICULUM To make performance a primary con-cern is to blur radically the boundariesof disciplines, to subvert the hierarchiesand exclusions of the canon, and toexamine cultures for the diversity ofperformance modes and concepts. As adiscipline of \"inclusions, \" performance studies provides an integrating, com-parative perspective on the entire con-tinuum of human action from \"life events, \" sports, public ceremonies, and ritual to aesthetic theatre and dance. Courses in theory and methodology, while developing a distinctive body ofconcepts and approaches, explore theo-ries of performance indigenous to Asia,Africa, Europe, Latin America, andother parts of the world and draw from various disciplines \u2014anthropology, soci- ology, history, literary theory, semiotics,feminist and queer theory, Marxism,psychoanalysis, the study of colonialdiscourse, movement analysis, aesthet-ics, and theatrical theory. Although well established as a dis- cipline, the study of Western theatrehas tended to emphasize a historicalapproach to a canon of dramatic litera-ture. In contrast, the performance stud-ies curriculum focuses on extraliteraryor nonliterary aspects of performance. In keeping with the integrated per- spective on performance, courses dealwith dance not only as a performing artin its own right but also as a vital con-stituent of theatre, ritual, and sociallife. Courses train students to identifythe basic components of movement; tosee, discriminate, and describe move-ment behavior in all its forms and con-texts; and to apply knowledge of move-ment style to studies of dance and cul-ture. Dance history is studied as anaspect of cultural history and in relationto the other arts. Folk performance and popular entertainment (including the modernmedia) have constituted a culturallyand artistically vital alternative theatreand important influence on contempo-rary performance. The forms of popular entertainment, their internal logic andaesthetics, are studied in relation totheir historical formation and culturalsetting. The study of folk performancefocuses on how people in their everydaylives shape deeply felt values intomeaningful form \u2014for example, conver- sational humor and storytelling, impro-vised play and traditional games, com-petitive street dance, domestic rituals,and neighborhood and community cel-ebrations. A major concern is thenature of tradition, which is seen as aprocess rooted in social life as well as intime and space. Courses in performance studies are also developed in order to explore thepolitical and ideological implications ofperformance. Postcolonial, feminist,and queer theory are employed asframes to investigate how artistic formssubvert and uphold particular ideologi-cal forms. While performance studies is not a studio-based program, students areencouraged to take at least one course(but not more than three) in perform-ance practice. On a regular basis, cours-es in performance composition andmovement are offered.PERFORMANCE STUDIES 251European Performance: Seminar on Antonin Artaud H42.2202 Weiss. 4 points.

There are opportu- nities for study and research inboth experimental and theoreti-cal physics. Areas of specializa-tion include astrophysics andcosmology, atomic and molecu-lar physics, condensed matterphysics, earth system sciences,elementary physics,quantum field and stringtheory, low-temperature physics,many-body and statisticalphysics, nuclear physics, quan- tum optics, and sports physics.A joint program with the Cen-ter for Neuroscience, also inMeyer Hall, is under develop-ment. Although the curriculumis designed primarily to meetthe needs of full-time students,opportunities also exist for part-time students. ANDRE AND BELLA MEYER HALL 4 WASHINGTON PLACE, ROOM 424 NEW YORK, NY 10003-6621 (212) 998-7700 TPrograms and RequirementsAdmission: Applicants considered for admission have usually completed theequivalent of an undergraduate majorin physics and maintained an average ofat least B or better in physics and inmathematics. Calculus and ordinarydifferential equations are prerequisite toall courses. Special consideration isgiven to applicants with an undergrad-uate major in mathematics, engineer-ing, or another science. Such studentsordinarily take remedial work to makeup undergraduate deficiencies inphysics before they proceed in the regu-lar degree program. Applicants are required to submit their results on the general and subjecttests of the Graduate RecordExamination and on the TOEFL. Colloquia and Seminars: Faculty and students attend the weekly departmen-tal colloquia, at which speakers fromother institutions discuss research find-ings. The department holds weeklyseminars in astrophysics, particlephysics, atomic and laser physics, non-linear dynamics, condensed matterphysics, theoretical physics, relativity,and cosmology. Distinguished lecturesendowed by the James Arthur andStanley H. Klosk Funds are held period-ically. Informal interactions and \"journal clubs \"\u2014where students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty discuss researchin progress \u2014promote collaboration within and across subfields. Interactionis also fostered with programs at the Courant Institute of MathematicalScience, the Center for Neuroscience(program for theoretical neuroscience),the School of Medicine, and theDepartments of Chemistry and Biology. Special Notes: Although students may be admitted at midyear, many coursesare full-year courses, so it may not bepossible for those students to enroll fora full-time program. Full-time studentsare expected to carry either three cours-es per semester or the equivalent inapproved research. MASTER OF SCIENCE All candidates for the M.S. degree mustachieve 32 points of credit, at least 24of which must be at New YorkUniversity and at least 16 of whichmust be with a grade of B or better.They are further required to pass atleast five of the following seven courses: Dynamics (G85.2001) Statistical Mechanics (G85.2002) Electromagnetism I, II (G85.2005, 2006) Quantum Mechanics I, II (G85.2011, 2012) Experimental Physics (G85.2075) M.S. candidates are permitted to take at most two courses outside the depart-ment, with permission of the directorof graduate studies. In addition to the above courserequirements, M.S. candidates complete their degree requirements via one ofthree options: Option A: Report The report is essentially a comprehen- sive review article based on the litera-ture in a specialized field of physics,prepared under the supervision of a fac-ulty adviser. In addition to submittingthe report, students choosing thisoption must receive credit for nine regu-lar courses (one-semester, 4-point cours-es, not including reading and research). Option B: Thesis The thesis is based on physics research (experimental or theoretical) supervisedby a faculty adviser, at a level of origi-nality and comprehensiveness less thanthat of Ph.D. research. In addition tothe standard course requirements, thestudent is expected to enroll in onesemester (4 points) of a research course(G85.2091 or G85.3301). Option C: Examination In addition to receiving credit for eight regular courses (one-semester, 4-pointcourses, not including reading andresearch), a student choosing thisoption must pass the core-course pre-liminary examinations at a leveldeemed sufficient by the faculty. Theseexaminations are given at the begin-ning of the fall term each year. 258 PHYSICSEdward J. Robinson, Professor. Ph.D. 1964, New York; B.S. 1957, QueensCollege.

FACULTY EMERITI Benjamin Bederson, OF PHILOSOPHY The Ph.D. program is aimed at enabling a student to prepare for and carry outresearch in physics at the frontier ofknowledge. The department encouragesentry into dissertation research under thesupervision of a faculty member as soonas one has attained sufficient mastery ofthe fundamental principles and tech-niques of physics. Depth and breadthwithin the larger context of contempo-rary physics are promoted by a flexibleset of course requirements. Numerousseminars and the weekly PhysicsColloquium provide an excellent oppor-tunity for students to keep abreast ofrecent developments across the full spec-trum of physics research. The biweekly\"Physics, Beer, and Pizza Seminar \" helps students learn about current researchactivities in the department. Entering students who qualify for admission to the Ph.D. program areoffered a five-year departmental finan-cial aid package with a commitment ofat least two, but not more than six,semesters of part-time teaching duties.Departmental support may be with-drawn if a student is deemed to be notmaking adequate progress toward ful-filling the degree requirements.Students who need more than five yearsto complete their degree requirementsmay apply for research assistantshipsand a limited number of fellowshipswithout teaching duties. PH.D. REQUIREMENTS Core Course Requirements The aim is to certify the student 's mas- tery of a traditional body of basic prin-ciples and problem-solving techniquesgenerally considered to be an essentialpart of a research physicist 's training. To this end, a student in the Ph.D. pro-gram is required to get a B or better ineach part of four core subjects: Dynamics Statistical Mechanics Electromagnetism (Parts I and II) Quantum Mechanics (Parts I and II) Optional Preliminary Examination In order to allow well-prepared students to fulfill the core course requirementswithout unnecessary course work, anoptional preliminary examination ineach subject is given at the beginning ofthe fall term. Each part of the examina-tion is designed to be completed in 1hour 50 minutes (with 3 hours permit-ted to eliminate time pressure) and cov-ers the material of the relevant one-semester course at the level of midtermand final examinations. A grade of B orbetter in any of the six parts of the four preliminary examinations fulfills thatpart of the core requirement. A studentmust take in the first year any corecourse whose requirement has not beensatisfied by the corresponding prelimi-nary examination. Experimental Physics Requirement The course Experimental Physics (G85.2075) is required of all students,except for those who have had equiva-lent laboratory experience. Course Requirements Beyond the Core A student is required to take at least six courses beyond the core level (notincluding reading and research coursesor Practicum in the Teaching of Physics[G85.2090]) in the Department ofPhysics. At least two of these coursesmust be outside the student 's research area. For the purpose of satisfying thisrequirement, Experimental Physics(G85.2075) counts as one of the outside-the-area courses, but ComputationalPhysics (G85.2000) does not. Requirements of the Graduate School A student must also satisfy the following requirements of the Graduate School ofArts and Science: a total of at least72 points of graduate-level credit, at least32 of which must be taken at New YorkUniversity and at least 30 of which mustbe passed with a grade of B or better. Formation of a Thesis Committee By the beginning of May of the stu- dent's second year, the student is expected to have arranged for thesissupervision with a member of thephysics faculty. A four-person thesis committee, chaired by the thesis adviser, is set upat this time. The membership of thethesis committee is proposed by theadviser in consultation with the studentand must be approved in writing bythe director of graduate studies toinsure breadth and level of expertise. At the time of its formation, the thesis committee meets with the stu-dent and discusses the student 's course of study, preliminary research plans, andthe timing and scope of the oral qualify-ing examination (see below). The com-mittee conducts an annual review of thestudent 's progress, normally in January. Oral Qualifying Examination The qualifying examination marks the student 's formal entry into dissertation research under the supervision of a par-ticular faculty member. It takes placeafter the student has already embarked on some sort of preliminary researchwith his or her adviser, and is adminis-tered by the student 's thesis committee. The deadline for taking the oral qualify-ing examination is January of a student 's third year, prior to the annual review. The examination itself consists of a prepared talk by the candidate followedby a question period. The aim is toexamine the student 's mastery not only of the specific area of the student 's intended research, but also of relatedareas of physics and of (relevant) generalprinciples of physics. The committeedecides whether the evidence, taken alltogether, presents a convincing pictureof a person with the preparation andskills needed to do original scientificresearch in the proposed area. Annual Review, Progress Report, Thesis Proposal There is an annual review of each stu- dent's progress toward the Ph.D. This includes a progress report submitted bythe student. Prior to the formation of athesis committee, the review is con-ducted by the Ph.D. qualification com-mittee. Afterwards, the student 's thesis committee conducts the review. Thefirst annual progress report followingthe qualifying examination includes aformal proposal for the student 's thesis research. Subsequent progress reportsinform the committee on progresstoward completion of the thesis, as wellas on any significant modifications ofthe original proposal. Oral Thesis Defense The final approval of the student 's thesis, and the oral thesis defense, is conductedby the student 's thesis committee, aug- mented by one additional faculty mem-ber. Three members of the examiningcommittee, including the student 's advis- er, serve as readers of the dissertation. DEPARTMENTAL FINANCIAL AID A number of financial aid programs are available for qualified graduate studentsin physics.

It isan intensive and comprehensive one-year study of the tools required to excelat managing a political campaign orrunning for office. Students in the pro-gram are exposed to all the aspects ofpolitical campaigning from leading aca-demics in the Department of Politicsand top industry professionals at theforefront of the political consultingcommunity. The program offers stu-dents a unique setting with access tothe political marketing, advertising,media, and communications expertswho practice at the world 's media and communications epicenter and who areredefining politics. In addition tostrong offerings in the field ofAmerican political campaign manage-ment, New York University is singularin its attention to political campaignsbeyond the American context. We offercourses by experts and practitioners inpolitical campaigns in Latin Americaand Western and Eastern Europe. Weprovide expertise in the electoral poli-tics of proportional representation sys-tems and emerging democracies. Admission: Admission to the political campaign management program is gen-erally granted for the fall semester only.Admission is limited to students withstrong academic and professionalrecords. The general test of theGraduate Record Examination (GRE) isrequired of all students, including allinternational students applying fromcountries in which the GRE is offered.All international students are alsorequired to submit scores from the Testof English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL). Course of Study: Students are required to take a total of eight courses(32 points). Five of these must be thecore courses in the field, which are list-ed below. The remaining three coursesmay be taken from the list of electives. Before graduation, students must com-plete a major project applying theirnewly mastered skills to a practicalproblem in political campaigningunder the guidance of one of the facultymembers. Typically, this projectrequires students to apply the skillsthey have learned to an actual politicalcampaign. Students are expected to maintain an average of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) inwork for the master 's degree. Each stu- dent should meet each semester with anadviser of his or her choice to discussand agree on a course of study. MASTER OF ARTS Admission: Admission to the general M.A. program in politics is usuallygranted for the fall semester only.Admission is limited to students whoseacademic records and letters of recom-mendation indicate exceptional promiseof success in the advanced study ofpolitical science. This means an out-standing undergraduate record and usu-ally an undergraduate major in politicalscience, history, or another social sci-ence. Applicants with lower averagesmay be admitted where there is indica-tion of a particular strength in politicalscience and clear aptitude for graduatework. Applicants with undergraduatemajors outside the social sciences orhistory may be asked to enroll in appro-priate undergraduate courses toimprove their political science back-ground. The general test of theGraduate Record Examination (GRE) isrequired of all students, including allinternational students applying fromcountries in which the GRE is offered.All international students are alsorequired to submit scores from the Testof English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL). Course of Study: Six departmental fields of study are offered: political phi-losophy and theory, political methodol-ogy, American politics, political econo-my, comparative politics, and interna-tional relations. Students are requiredto complete eight courses (32 points),of which at least six must be in thedepartment and four must be in one departmental field. Courses in themajor field must include the field corecourse. This core course and one addi-tional core course are required and areusually the first courses taken in thedepartment. Students must also complete a major project. The M.A. project con-sists of a seminar paper, which shoulddemonstrate breadth in the conceptionand mastery of political analysis.Students are required to notify thedirector of graduate studies at the initi-ation of research for the master 's proj- ect. The director of graduate studiesmust be notified in all cases, whetherthe paper is to be written in conjunc-tion with, or independent of, a course.The director of graduate studies mustapprove the project and designate anadviser to be the first reader, with writ-ten notice to both student and adviser.If the paper is written in conjunctionwith a course, the adviser would also bethe course instructor. The director 's approval relates only to M.A.-projectstatus and would in no way interferewith assignment or evaluation of theessay for course credit. Once an M.A.-project topic and adviser are designat-ed, the director of graduate studiesmust approve changes to them. Oncethe adviser has read and approved adraft, an M.A.-project evaluations com-mittee, appointed annually by the chairto read all M.A. papers, will evaluate it.If the evaluations committee approvesthe essay, it is accepted as the majorproject. Students are expected to maintain an average of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) inwork for the master 's degree. Each stu- dent should meet each semester with anadviser of his or her choice to discussand agree on a course of study. Foreign Language Requirement: Students must demonstrate proficiencyin one language other than English or,with permission of the director of grad-uate studies, in statistics. Studentsdemonstrate proficiency in a foreignlanguage by passing the GSAS lan-guage proficiency exam or by complet-ing an intermediate-level foreign lan- POLITICS 265Elisabeth Jean Wood, Associate Professor.

Concentration in International Politics and International Business Students complete eight courses, four of which are chosen from a designatedgroup in the department for the specialprogram. The other courses are takenfrom a designated group in other disci-plines in the Graduate School of Artsand Science, the Leonard N. SternSchool of Business, and the Robert F.Wagner Graduate School of PublicService. Each student is also expected towrite an M.A. major project on a topicrelated to his or her program work. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The goal of the Ph.D. program is toprepare students to conduct research, toteach, or to work in applied settings atthe best institutions in the UnitedStates and abroad. To achieve this goal,the program specifies the distributionof courses, the substance and timing ofrequirements, the forms of facultysupervision, and the criteria foradvancement within the program. Admission: The general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) isrequired of all students, including allinternational students applying fromcountries in which the GRE is offered.All international students are alsorequired to submit the Test of Englishas a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.Letters of recommendation must clearlyindicate that an applicant is capable ofsuccessfully pursuing the doctorate.The applicant is also required to submita writing sample and statement of edu-cational background and objectives. Abachelor 's degree is required for admis- sion to the Ph.D. program. A Master of Arts degree is not a requirement for admis-sion to the Ph.D program . Course Requirements: Students must complete 72 points (18 courses) beyondthe B.A. degree. There are no depart-ment-wide course requirements. Toguard against excessive specialization,students must take at least three courses(12 points) in each of at least two fields.Course credits transferred from anotherinstitution may count toward the fulfill-ment of this requirement. The fieldspresently recognized by the departmentinclude (1) political philosophy and the-ory, (2) political methodology,(3) American politics, (4) political econ-omy, (5) comparative politics, and(6) international relations. In consulta- tion with their adviser, students maypetition the director of graduate studies(DGS) to create a field of their ownmaking. Such a field may be interdisci-plinary. Doctoral students are expectedto maintain a 3.5 grade average. When entering the program, stu- dents should declare their intendedmajor, which can be changed at anytime in consultation with the student 's adviser. A student specializing in anyrecognized field may have to satisfycourse requirements established by fac-ulty in this field. Admission to someadvanced courses may be conditional onstudents having taken some othercourses or having an equivalent back-ground. In all cases, students must con-sult their adviser to plan a comprehen-sive program of courses and informtheir adviser of any changes. There are no limits on courses taken in other departments or other universi-ty members of the Inter-UniversityDoctoral Consortium (other than thosespecified by the GSAS). Students areencouraged to develop knowledge andacquire methodological skills in sisterdisciplines. To train themselves in academic research and writing, students areencouraged to write research papers,typically by applying or developing thework of a particular course in subse-quent reading and research courses. Thetwo required papers, the M.A. paperand the Ph.D. qualifying paper (seebelow), are normally prepared in thisway. Students who have satisfied all the requirements of a particular course otherthan the final examination or paper andwho present a written proposal for aresearch paper related to this course mayask the instructor for a research inprogress (RIP) grade. Students whoreceive this grade are expected to take areading and research course during thesubsequent semester(s) to research andwrite the paper. This grade is reportedto the registrar as IP (Incomplete Pass)but is distinguished by the departmentfrom Incomplete grades for all otherpurposes, including financial decisions.On completing the research paper, thestudent receives final grades for thecourses. M.A. Paper: Students who enter the program without an M.A. degree mustpresent a written M.A. paper by nolater than the beginning of their secondyear. The specific requirements for thepaper depend on the field, but the gen-eral rule is that it should have the for-mat of an article in this field. The topicof the M.A. paper should be chosen in consultation with faculty members. Oncompletion, the paper is submitted forreading by two faculty members chosenby the director of graduate studies(DGS), no later than within twomonths after submission. The paper canreceive a high pass, a low pass, or a fail-ing grade. If the paper does not receivea unanimous high pass, the studentmay revise and resubmit it by no laterthan the beginning of the fourth semes-ter of residence. If the paper receives a low pass and the student maintains at least a 3.0grade point average, the student isgranted the M.A. degree but mustleave the program. If the paper receivesa failing grade or if the student 's grade point average is below 3.0, no degree isgranted. If the revised paper receivesdifferent grades from the two readers,the DGS appoints a third reader andthe expanded committee will decidethe grade. A student whose M.A. paperand grade record are satisfactory is con-sidered to have advanced toward thePh.D. M.A. Waiver: Students entering with M.A. degrees from equivalent institu-tions may petition for a waiver of up toone year of course requirements (equiv-alent of 24 points). For this purpose, acopy of the M.A. thesis (in any lan-guage that can be read by at least twofaculty members) must be submitted tothe director of graduate studies (DGS)when the student enters the program.The DGS appoints two faculty mem-bers as readers to decide whether thethesis is equivalent in standards andquality to the department 's require- ments. If the M.A. thesis is approved,the student submits the waiver petitionto the DGS at the end of the first yearof residence. In consultation with thereaders, the DGS decides whether ornot to waive residence requirements onthe basis of the M.A. thesis and thegrade record of the student during thefirst year at New York University. Communications Requirement: Doctoral students must demonstrateproficiency in a language other thanEnglish. The Graduate School of Artsand Science determines which lan-guages qualify, but another languagecan be substituted on recommendationof the student 's adviser and the director of graduate studies and with approvalof the language coordinator. A studentwhose native language is not Englishshould consult the director of graduatestudies regarding fulfillment of thecommunications requirement.POLITICS 267Ph.D. Qualifying Examination: No later than the end of the fifth semesterin residence (third semester for studentswho received an M.A. waiver), studentsmust complete the Ph.D. qualifyingexamination, which consists of the sub-mission of a qualifying paper (QP) andthe oral defense of a syllabus. The QP is a research paper of pub- lishable quality, satisfying all formalrequirements for an article in a givenfield. Before writing the paper, studentsshould submit a brief proposal to atleast two faculty members, who become\"readers \" on approving this proposal. The topic (but not necessarily the field)of the QP must differ from that of theM.A. paper, and the two papers must beread by at least four different readers.The work on the QP can be and shouldbe assisted by faculty. Readers will eval-uate this paper within two months ofsubmission. The readers have the optionof accepting the paper, suggesting revi-sions, or rejecting the paper. If invitedto do so, the student may revise thepaper and resubmit it within sixmonths. If the revision is not acceptedby both readers, the student is consid-ered to have failed this requirement. Students must also submit an origi- nal syllabus for a graduate introductionto a field. This syllabus should attest tothe understanding of the structure ofthe field, as well as to the knowledge ofthe primary and secondary literature.This syllabus is presented at an oralhearing to two faculty members, whothen pass or fail the syllabus and itsdefense. Students who successfully com-plete both of these requirements qualifyas candidates for the Ph.D. degree.Students who do not satisfy bothrequirements by the end of the thirdyear (second year for students whoreceived an M.A. waiver) are requiredby the department to leave the program,save for exceptional circumstances. Dissertation: Having completed the qualifying exam, students must presenta Ph.D. dissertation proposal. The pro-posal ordinarily should be presentedbefore the end of the third year in resi-dence (second year for students whoreceived an M.A. waiver). Students whodo not present a proposal within onecalendar year of passing their qualifyingexamination must petition the DGS tobe allowed to do so. The proposal should specify the problem to be researched, summarizethe current state of knowledge, describeresearch procedures, and identify thebodies of relevant information. It shouldbe no more than 15 single-spaced pages,plus a bibliography. A thesis committee(see below) must approve the proposal. When all members are satisfied withthe proposal, the committee meets withthe student in an advisory hearing.Acceptance of the proposal signals thatthe student has satisfied all the require-ments for the Ph.D. degree other thanthe dissertation. The dissertation must constitute a substantial body of original research ofpublishable quality. Except by theexpressed permission of the chair of thedepartment, the dissertation should notexceed 100,000 words. Once membersof the committee approve the disserta-tion, an oral defense is scheduled. After the student 's thesis director has approved the dissertation and thedissertation committee has agreed thatit is ready for defense, a final oraldefense is scheduled before a panel offive faculty members appointed by thechair of the department or the directorof graduate studies. The GSAS regu-lates the procedures for this defense. The department expects students to complete the dissertation and itsdefense within four years after finishingcourse requirements. GSAS regulationsrequire students to complete themwithin ten years from entering thegraduate program (seven years for thoseentering with an M.A. from anotheruniversity). Advising: On entering the program, each student is assigned a preliminaryadviser after a consultation with theDGS. Students are free to change theiradviser at any time during their resi-dence. They should inform the DGS ofsuch changes. In the month of April of the first year in the program, students meetwith members of their advisory com-mittee (comprising their adviser andone faculty member with whom theyhave worked) to discuss the substanceof their research, progress in the pro-gram, and future plans. Advice for fallregistration may also be given at thismeeting. The DGS notifies all first-yearstudents of the need to schedule thismeeting with the adviser and sends acopy of each notice and report form tothe adviser. Following the meeting, theadviser submits a brief report for thestudent 's file. Before beginning to work on the qualifying paper, students must form aQP committee consisting of two read-ers (see above). Students should keepthis committee informed about theprogress of their research. Before beginning to work on the Ph.D. dissertation, students must forma thesis committee, consisting of atleast three faculty members (the com- mittee chair and two members), ofwhom at least two must be members ofthe department. Students should con-sult with the committee while prepar-ing the proposal and working on thethesis. The Graduate Office maintains a progress checklist for each student,showing the adviser, major and minorfields, M.A. paper topic and readers, QPtopic and committee, and dissertationtopic and committee. The fellowshipevaluation and progress (FEP) commit-tee uses this checklist to oversee theprogress of all students in the program. Regular Progress: A student is consid- ered to be making satisfactory progressas long as she or he does the following: 1. Submits a previously written M.A. thesis on entering the program or con-sults with faculty about writing theM.A. paper during the first semester inthe program. 2. Submits the M.A. paper by the beginning of the third semester or, ifinvited to do so, resubmits it by thebeginning of the fourth semester. 3. Submits the QP and the syllabus and defends the syllabus by the end of thefifth semester (third for students enter-ing with an equivalent M.A. degree) or,if invited to do so, resubmits the QPand defends the syllabus by the end ofthe sixth semester. 4. Defends the Ph.D. proposal within six months of having passed the Ph.D.qualifying examination. Students who are not making satisfacto- ry progress are notified by the DGS andmust petition the fellowship evaluationand progress (FEP) committee to beallowed to continue in the program.With regard to points 1 through 3above, this request is granted only ifthe delay is caused by exceptional rea-sons. With regard to point 4, it is suffi-cient that the student demonstrates rea-sonable progress. All references to time are based on a calendar of effective semesters (normally12 points). Hence, part-time studentsmay take a longer period to satisfy therequirements. Nonmatriculated Students: Under special circumstances, nonmatriculants(students who are not working toward adegree) may enroll for one course persemester with permission of the directorof graduate studies. Nonmatriculantscan earn cumulatively no more than12 points in the Graduate School ofArts and Science.CoursesThe following courses are designed for students in the general M.A. and Ph.D.programs. Students in the politicalcampaign management program maytake these courses only after receivingwritten permission from the politicalcampaign management program direc-tor and consent of the course instructor. T wo-Part Courses: A hyphen indicates a full-year course with credit grantedonly for completing both terms. Acomma indicates credit is granted forcompleting one term.

Ruble; Industrial/Organizational Psychology, Professor Madeline E. Heilman; Quantitative Psychology, Professor Patrick E. Shrout; Social/Personality Psychology, Professor Niall Bolger he Department of Psychology atNew York University approaches the study of thehuman mind and human behav-ior from many basic science per-spectives. Clinical psychologistslook at emotions, stress, rela-tionships, and disruptions of normal psychological function-ing. Psychologists in the cogni-tion and perception programfocus on perception, action,memory, attention, language,and thinking. Community psy-chologists consider how socialsystems and social context influ-ence development and function-ing. Social/personalitypsychologists study persuasionand attitude change, stereotyp-ing and prejudice, judgmentand decision making, and howrelationships form and develop.Industrial/organizational psy-chologists study the behavior ofindividuals in andexamine the theories to Developmentalpsychologists examine both cog-nitive and social functioning asit changes over the life course. Graduate students in the department have the opportunityto obtain sophisticated trainingfrom these perspectives and tointegrate the approaches in novelways. At the doctoral level, stu-dents select one of the first fivespecialty areas but can declare a minor specialty in a second area(including quantitative psychol-ogy in addition to the specialtieslisted above). In addition, stu-dents from all programs have theopportunity to focus on develop-mental psychology, which is across-cutting concentrationrather than a separate program.We believe this format leads toespecially rich developmentaltraining. At the master 's level, students have the opportunity tosample graduate courses in awide variety of topics. They maytake either industrial/organiza-tional psychology or a generalpsychology program. The department takes advan- tage of its location in thenation 's premier city by collabo- rating with important scientificinstitutions, community agen-cies, and corporations. NewYork provides access to almostany population or cultural grouppsychologists might choose tostudy. Experiences in this stimu-lating context supplement thedepartment 's emphasis on basic psychological research.

Admission to grad-uate study in psychology is based onacademic records, Graduate RecordExamination scores, and letters of rec-ommendation. A limited number ofnonmatriculants may be accepted foradmission to the Master of Arts pro-gram (see Nondegree Status, below). Each student is responsible for com- plying with all rules, regulations,requirements, and policies of theUniversity, the Graduate School of Artsand Science, the Department ofPsychology, and the program in whichhe or she is studying. MASTER OF ARTS The Master of Arts degree in psycholo-gy is offered to students wishing toimprove their status in a psychology-related occupation or to strengthentheir background in the field. ManyM.A. students plan for later pursuit ofthe Ph.D. degree. It should be empha-sized, however, that the M.A. programoffers a terminal degree. All studentswho wish to obtain a Ph.D. degreemust apply directly to their programsof choice during the Ph.D. applicationperiod (see under Doctor of Philosophy). Admission: Applicants seeking admis- sion to a Master of Arts program inpsychology should have graduated fromcollege with an average of B or better.All applicants must have completedcourses in introductory psychology andin introductory statistics with grades ofB or better to be eligible for admission.All applicants must provide a reportfrom the general test of the GraduateRecord Examination (GRE) and obtaina score of at least 530 in each section.In addition, international applicants must achieve a score of at least 600(250 on the computerized version) onthe Test of English as a ForeignLanguage (TOEFL). Applications areaccepted for fall, spring, or summeradmission. Fields of Study: Two fields of study are offered to M.A. degree candidates:(1) general psychology, for studentswho wish to shape their course of studyto fit special interests and needs and(2) industrial/organizational (I/O) psy-chology, for those wishing to expandtheir knowledge of the psychologicalprinciples and methods useful in employ-ee relations and human resources fields. Degree Requirements: Formal requirements for the M.A. degree inpsychology are the satisfactory comple-tion of 36 points (at least 27 in resi-dence at New York University) andeither a written comprehensive exami-nation or a master 's thesis. All students must pass Intermediate Master 's Statistics (G89.1016) or the equivalent.Students must pass substantive corecourses with a grade of B or better andmust maintain an overall B average.The specific requirements within eachprogram are listed below. General Program Requirements: Satisfactory completion of four corecourses chosen from three core groups,as follows: a total of three from core A(G89.2010, andG89.2025) and core B (G89.2014,G89.2015, G89.2020, and G89.2034),such that each core is sampled, core C (research: G89.2065,G89.2066, G89.2067, and G89.2126). Note: Students who are admitted without having majored in psychologyas undergraduates are required tocomplete a total of four courses fromcore A and core B, such that each core is sampled.

DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a researchand scholarly degree. It signifies thatthe recipient is able to conduct inde-pendent research and has a broad basicknowledge of psychology and a com-prehensive knowledge of a special area.Specialty programs include clinical,cognition and perception, community,industrial/organizational, andsocial/personality. Students may alsospecialize in developmental psychologyin conjunction with the clinical, cogni-tion and perception, community, orsocial/personality program. Admission: Applicants to programs of study leading to the Ph.D. degreeshould have graduated from collegewith an outstanding undergraduaterecord. An undergraduate major in psy-chology is recommended for admissionbut not required; however, all applicantsmust have completed courses in intro-ductory psychology, introductory statis-tics, a laboratory course in psychology,and one additional course in psychology.The GRE general test is required of allapplicants. In addition, the clinical,social/personality, and industrial/organi-zational doctoral programs require thatall applicants take the GRE psychologytest. Matriculants are admitted only inthe fall term and only on a full-timebasis. See also the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. International applicants are also required to take the TOEFL, includingthe writing test. Degree Requirements: Formal requirements for the doctorate in psy-chology include the satisfactory com-pletion of 72 points (78 in clinical), ofwhich at least 32 points must be in res-idence at New York University; twoterms of statistics (either G89.2228 andG89.2229, or the equivalents); satisfac-tory completion of an oral or writtencomprehensive examination, or equiva-lent; and presentation of an acceptabledissertation. After completion of therequired number of points, doctoralstudents register for at least one courseper year or maintain matriculation byfee each semester until completion ofthe dissertation. Students may registerfor only 6 points of dissertation research in the psychology department.Information regarding requirements ofthe doctoral specialization programsadditional to the preceding departmentrequirements should be obtained fromthe Department of Psychology, NewYork University, 6 Washington Place,Room 550, New York, NY 10003-6634; (212) 998-7900. Four to five years of postbaccalaure- ate study are usually required to com-plete the Ph.D. degree; however, nomore than ten years may elapsebetween matriculation and the comple-tion of all degree requirements (sevenyears if the student enters with a mas-ter's degree). Continuation as a matric- ulant is contingent on the demonstra-tion of satisfactory progress toward thedoctorate. It cannot be overemphasizedthat the accumulation of high grades informal courses, while important, is sec-ondary to the demonstration of thecapacity for original thinking and tothe completion of research that con-tributes significantly to the field and iseffectively presented in the dissertation. The Graduate School 's foreign lan- guage requirement has been waived forthe Department of Psychology. DEPARTMENTAL PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH Clinical Psychology: The doctoral program in clinical psychology atNYU is being reorganized. The pro-gram does not currently expect toadmit students for the fall 2002 class.Prospective applicants are encouragedto check the department Web site atwww.psych.nyu.edu/research/clin/overview.htmlfor current information on the program. Cognition and Perception: Research programs in cognition and human development (Adolph,Marcus). Research in perception and atten- tion deals with the perception of depth,pattern, form, motion, color, and atten-tional processes to various dimensions. Psychophysical methods and computermodeling of visual processes areemployed. Research in memory andcognition deals with reasoning, catego-rization, verbal and auditory informa-tion processing, short- and long-termmemory, conscious and unconsciousprocesses in memory, and visual cogni-tion. Research in language and psy-cholinguistics deals with reading, syn-tactic and semantic structures, Physiological proj-ects cognition and perceptionprogram benefit from the fact thatmany of its faculty are also members ofNew York University 's Center for Neural Science (CNS). Projects examineneuronal interactions projects involve both operantprocedures with animals and behavioraltechniques in human learning. Currentresearch in human developmentincludes the development of visuomo-tor skills, conceptual development, andacquisition of language. Training for research begins when students enter the program and culmi-nates in the doctoral thesis. Studentsbecome active members of one of theproductive research laboratories associ-ated with the program, facilitating con-tact with faculty members, advancedstudents, and postdoctoral scientists.Teaching experience is gained throughassistantships that supplement researchtraining. Recent graduates have takenpositions in a variety of academic, pureresearch, and applied research settings.The interdisciplinary Center for NeuralScience offers opportunities to studentsin the cognition and perception pro-gram to participate in neural sciencecourses along with students of theCenter and, in some cases, to work withfaculty of the Center as well as affiliatedfaculty from the Departments ofBiology, Chemistry, Computer Science,Mathematics, and Physics. There are weekly area seminars, with prominent speakers, in cognitionand perception, developmental psychol-ogy, and neural science. Community Psychology: Community psychology is an action science. In thecommunity psychology program atNYU, rigorous research, theory devel-opment, and preventive interventionsare viewed as fundamental to the searchfor solutions to current and futuresocial problems. Throughout the first278 PSYCHOLOGYthree years of the program, students take a variety of courses covering issuessuch as the conceptualization and meas-urement of transactions between peopleand settings, the design and implemen-tation of preventive interventions, sta-tistics, and methodology. They alsocomplete a one-year supervisedpracticum in which they are engaged incommunity action. Students areinvolved in research throughout theiracademic career and publish articlesand present papers in seminars and atnational conferences. Students are fund-ed with research assistantships, teach-ing assistantships, and fellowships. NYU has been a part of community psychology since its inception as a field.The University 's New York City loca- tion provides students with opportuni-ties to focus on important issues in thelives of diverse populations, includingimmigrant families, homeless adultsand children, and racially diverse andgay and lesbian youth. At present, fac-ulty and student research interestsinclude effects of homelessness on chil-dren and families, racial socializationpractices within black families, schooltransitions among urban adolescents,cultural differences in adolescent par-ent-peer relationships, and HIV riskand prevention. Social/Personality Psychology: The social/personality social-cognition and social-interac-tion framework; ensures extensive train-ing in advanced statistical techniques;and provides opportunities for activecollaboration with cognitive, develop-mental, and organizational psycholo-gists. Research in the program is fund-ed in part by government grants, whichcontribute to the computerized labora-tory environment as well as providesupport for many students for their firstfour years in the program. All facultyare on editorial boards of major journalsin social, developmental, and personali-ty psychology, and all have served aseditors of these journals as well. The program encourages faculty- student interaction, and students regu-larly present papers at regional andnational psychology association meet-ings. Recent graduates have joined thefaculty of major universities and havetaken positions in both public (e.g.,medical schools) and private sectors. Anactive colloquium series regularly fea-tures leading figures from around theworld. Visiting faculty and postdoctoralstudents also contribute to students ' training. Faculty research interests includeattitudes and persuasion; automatic processes in social perception, motiva-tion, and behavior; affect and cognition;developmental social cognition, sexroles, and social comparison and decision study andmotivational responses to social stimuliin a controlled environment; a place forsocial interaction (either in person orover the Internet); rooms for smallgroups and personality research; andextensive computer facilities for dataanalysis and experiment preparation.There is also a large subject pool ofundergraduates each semester, anddiverse subject populations off-site. See also Developmental Training Program, below. Industrial/Organizational Psychology: The objective of the doc- toral program in industrial/organiza-tional psychology is to educate studentsin psychological theories, principles,research methods, and problem-solvingskills relevant to understanding thebehavior of individuals and groups insocial and organizational contexts. Theemphasis is on developing psycholo-gists who are knowledgeable aboutbasic psychological processes, skilled informulating and executing significantand useful research on work behavior,and able to communicate their knowl-edge to professional and lay audiences,through a combination of courses, indi-vidual study, research, and assistant-ships. The opportunities for learning gobeyond the walls of the program.Students have close ties with studentsand faculty in other programs in theDepartment of Psychology. Ongoing faculty research interests include sex bias in work settings,dynamics of stereotyping, and conse-quences of preferential selection proce-dures (Heilman); work motivation andattitudes, organization theory, and negoti-ation, social Part-time research professorsfocus on career development, leader-ship, and employee attitudes. Developmental Training Program: The Department of Psychology at NewYork University offers a unique pro-gram of study in developmental psy-chology. Students who participate inthe training program enroll in the developmental concentration withinone of the department 's core areas (clin- ical, cognition and perception, commu-nity, or social/personality). and cutting-edge research with faculty affiliatedwith both developmental psychologyand their other chosen field of interest.Therefore, students become experts inboth developmental psychology and aspecific content area. The fact that theprogram cuts across different areas ofpsychology assures that students receivebroad exposure to theories of develop-ment and methods of studying develop-mental change across a range of contentareas. The link with a core psychologyprogram ensures depth of knowledgeand expertise in a particular contentarea. This approach offers students con-siderable flexibility as well as advan-tages when they enter the job market. The department 's interdisciplinary approach enables students to pursuebasic, applied, or clinical research pro-grams. State-of-the-art lab facilitiesinclude powerful new technologies forobserving, recording, and analyzingbehaviors on a finely detailed or globalbasis. The University 's location in lower Manhattan provides a unique opportu-nity to study developmental changes ina range of populations and communi-ties. Faculty study development ininfants, children, adolescents, andadults. They use a variety of method-ological approaches, from experimentallab studies and computational model-ing to intervention studies and epi-demiological surveys to diary studiesand naturalistic field research. Areas ofresearch include adolescent develop-ment, behavior regulation, cognition,computational modeling, culture andcognition, perceptual exploration, gen-der and ethnic identity, immigrantchildren, psychopathology, discourseand narrative, homelessness and familyfunctioning, language acquisition,moral reasoning and empathy, motorskill acquisition, racial socialization,and social referencing. Students can alsoreceive excellent training in advancedmethods and statistics relevant tostudying developmental processes. Students pursue a specific course of study in developmental psychologywithin the required curriculum of theircore psychology program. They attendand present their research at a weeklyseminar in developmental psychology.This seminar provides a stimulatingforum in which both faculty and stu-dents discuss their research. Nationallyrenowned scholars are also invited toCoursesCourse enrollment is limited, according to the area of instruction, to ensureeffective supervision and student-facul-ty interaction. In addition to the regu-larly offered courses in the various mas-ter's and doctoral programs, a number of electives are also offered each year. Courses numbered between G89.1016 and G89.2199 are primarilyfor Master of Arts students and arescheduled in the evening, enabling theworking student to attend on a part-time basis. Other courses, for studentsin the doctoral program, are scheduled in the morning or afternoon. Not everycourse is offered each term.

Quantitative Psychology: Quantitative psychology involves math-ematical representations of behavioraldata, using statistical analysis andmeasurement models as well as directmathematical models of psychologicalphenomena. All areas of psychology canbe approached from a quantitative per-spective, so it is possible to pursue aquantitative minor from any of the doc-toral specialty programs. To qualify for the quantitative minor, students take elective courses inadvanced statistical and/or mathematicaltopics and demonstrate an ability tocommunicate mathematical approachesclearly. Quantitative faculty researchinterests include multivariate statisticalmethods, exploratory data analysis,analysis of similarity data, and mathe-matical models of perceptual systems. Alimited number of fellowships for quan-titative students with interests in men-tal health research are available througha training grant funded by the NationalInstitute of Mental Health (NIMH). SUMMER TEACHING PRACTICUM Advanced doctoral graduate students are invited to apply to participate inthis supervised teaching experience.Selected students serve as adjunctinstructors for undergraduate summerschool courses. They are assigned anexperienced faculty mentor and partici-pate in a variety of workshops, evalua-tions, and other exercises for the pur-pose of improving their teaching skills.Applicants are admitted to the programon the basis of their seniority in theirdoctoral training programs, their rele-vant experience as teaching assistants, the appropriateness of the training fortheir career objectives, and their stand-ing in their graduate programs.Participants are awarded a certificatefrom the department at the completionof the program. POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING IN STATISTICS AND MENTALHEALTH The department supports a training program in mental health statisticswith funding by the National Instituteof Mental Health. Postdoctoral fellowsstudy formal statistics (probability andinference) and advanced data analyticmethods while conducting mentalhealth research. FACILITIES The Department of Psychology main-tains laboratories, classrooms, projectrooms, and a magnetic resonance (MR)neuroimaging facility in an 11-storybuilding near Washington Square Park.Modern laboratories are continuallyimproved through grants from founda-tions and federal agencies. The Center for Brain Imaging hous- es a research-dedicated 3 Tesla SeimensMR system for the use of faculty andstudents interested in research usingfunction brain imaging. The centerincludes faculty members from boththe Department of Psychology and theCenter for Neural Science, as well asindividuals whose expertise is in MRphysics and statistical methods foranalysis. The department maintains several computer classrooms and laboratories,and the University offers technicalcourses on emerging computationaltools. Faculty laboratories are equippedwith specialized computer equipmentwithin each of the graduate programs.The department collaborates closelywith the Center for Neural Science inmaintaining a technical shop. Animals are used in studies of learn- ing, neurophysiology, neuroanatomy,and the physiological bases of behavior.Students who work with animalsreceive training in animal health andhandling procedures and in the appro-priate use of animals in scientific inves-tigation. The University 's animal facili- ties are modern and are maintained inaccordance with the strict regulations ofthe U.S. Public Health Service and theDepartment of Agriculture. DEPARTMENTAL FINANCIAL AID Students admitted to the doctoral pro- gram are funded through a combina-tion of fellowships, assistantships, andtraining grants. These funding mecha-nisms cover tuition and provide astipend. Doctoral students in goodstanding are typically supported for fiveyears, through a combination of inter-nal and external sources. In addition,summer research stipends are availableon a competitive basis. In conjunction with financial aid packages, doctoral students are asked toserve as teaching assistants to facultywho teach undergraduate psychologycourses or graduate statistics courses.Workshops on effective teaching meth-ods and support for first-time assistantsare provided. Depending on the sourcesof financial aid, doctoral students havethree to six semesters of teaching expe-rience over the first ten semesters. Students admitted to the Master of Arts programs may request teachingassistant assignments, which providestipends. These assignments are madeon a competitive basis.

Doctoral degree from a program in clinical psychology or a related area ofstudy. 2. Two years of supervised individual adult psychotherapy experience. 3. Eligibility for state certification in a mental health discipline. Program Requirements: Candidates must satisfactorily complete 36 pointsof course work chosen from among thediverse areas of study with the guidanceof faculty. In addition, the candidate is expect- ed to see at least three supervisors for aminimum total of 160 hours. Eachsupervisor must be seen for a minimumof 40 hours. The candidate is expectedto see one patient for a total of 400hours or two patients for a total of 200hours each under supervision in ourlow-cost clinic. Candidates are requiredto begin work with a clinic patient bythe beginning of their second year inthe program and to continue clinicwork until the 400-hour clinic require-ment is met. If a candidate is unable to initiate clinic work, course registrationwill be prohibited. It is required that each candidate be involved in or have completed an inten-sive personal analysis of at least 300hours with a qualified training analyst.The candidate 's training analyst must have had, at the commencement of thecandidate 's analysis, five years of experi- ence following graduation from a post-doctoral analytic training program. Inthose instances in which the candidate 's training analyst does not meet the cri-teria advanced above, a request may bemade, at the time of admission, todetermine the suitability of the analystfor training purposes. The facultyencourages all students to be in a per-sonal psychoanalysis with a frequencyof at least three sessions per week, withsome portion of this analysis to occurconcurrent with their analytic training.The faculty is committed to providingmoderate-cost analysis for those stu-dents whose financial circumstancesmake this necessary. For further infor-mation regarding moderate-cost analy-sis, candidates may speak to the pro-gram director.Candidates are evaluated by faculty following completion of each courseand by supervisors following eachsupervisory experience. Candidates ' progress is monitored by the evaluationcommittee, which may require a candi-date to complete additional coursework, supervision, clinical experience,or personal analysis. Curriculum: The central thrust of the program is to afford candidates theopportunity to take courses from facul-ty representing major orientations inpsychoanalytical theory and practice.Students are encouraged to take coursesreflecting differing points of view andto have supervisory experiences withfaculty of diverse approaches. However,since some individuals apply to theprogram so that they may work withinone orientation, the program providesseveral options to its students. The stu-dent may select a systematic course ofstudy in a modern Freudian, an inter-personal, or a relational orientation.Alternatively, the student may chooseto combine courses from the three ori-entations, as well as courses not alignedwith any particular orientation (inde-pendent). The curriculum is therefore PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS 287DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Adjunct Clinical Professor Lewis Aron he program is designed to pro-vide advancededucation for postdoctoral psychologists in thetheory and practice of psy-chotherapy and psychoanalysis.Established in 1961, at a timewhen psychologists found it dif-ficult to obtain formal trainingin psychoanalysis, the New YorkUniversity postdoctoral programwas the first psychoanalytictraining program housed in a university graduate school of artsand science and established toprovide advanced psychoanalyticspecialization for psychologists. Currently housing four psy- choanalytic orientations (modernFreudian, interpersonal, rela-tional, and independent), eachwith an internationally knownand highly published teachingfaculty and an outstanding cadreof clinical supervisors, the pro-gram enjoys a reputation as oneof the most comprehensive andwell-respected psychoanalyticinstitutions in the world. Con- temporary psychoanalyticthought has become increasinglypluralistic, and the postdoctoralprogram consists of a commu-nity of scholars and practitionersrepresenting the broad spectrumof this diversity of views. A cer-tificate of specialization in psy-chotherapy and psychoanalysis isawarded by the faculty upon sat-isfactory completion of coursework, supervision, clinic work,and personal analysis. 715 BROADWAY , 1ST FLOOR NEW E-mail: gsas.postdoc@nyu.edu WEB SITE: www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/psa TSelected Courses AREA OF STUDY This curriculum encompasses the fun- damental discoveries of Sigmund Freudand the diversity of viewpoints in theo-ry and technique that characterizesFreudian psychoanalysis as it is prac-ticed today. This diversity arises bothfrom the proliferation of ideas withinego psychology and from the increasinginfluence of studies of child develop-ment, of self psychology, and of theoriesof the self in relationship to the objectworld. The program is such that onecan take Freudian training in anydesired proportion in relation to theoverall postdoctoral program. It is alsopossible to participate in a structuredFreudian program, with guaranteedaccess to a planned sequence of courses.Candidates are welcome to contact thechair of the faculty in the Freudian areaof study, Dr. Jo Lang (jpjlw@aol. com) , to discuss individual questions andplanning.

INTERPERSONAL AREA OF STUDY Interpersonal theory rests upon a broad framework of implicit and explicitpremises that departed from the psy-choanalysis of its day and that contin-ues to reflect its unique contribution tothe current psychoanalytic movement.An individual 's experience, acquired inthe context of interactions with others, becomes the focus of analytic inquiry.Central to interpersonal analysis is thedirect engagement of analyst andpatient in their actual and immediateexperience of each other. Interpersonaltheory posits a variety of influences thatproduce diverse and individualizingeffects upon the person. However, noassumptions are made about any preor-dained event or constellation of eventsas being primary determinants of expe-rience. In this way, the uniqueness ofeach patient, each therapist, and eachanalytic dyad is emphasized. Greatimportance is placed on an understand-ing of character formation through anexploration of the interplay of interper-sonal interaction with the social andcultural factors that provide the contextin which this interaction is embedded.Candidates are welcome to contact thechair of the faculty in the interpersonalarea of study, Dr. Elizabeth Goren (elizgor@aol.com), to discuss individual questions and planning.

For specific courses, consult thedirector of graduate studies.CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Kathleen Gerson DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Jeff Goodwin he Department of Sociology empha-sizes both theoret-ical creativity and substantive empirical research onimportant social issues. Itencourages a range of analyticperspectives and maintainsstrength in both quantitativeand qualitative methods. Thegraduate program complementsresearch on the contemporaryUnited States \u2014including New York City \u2014with international and historical studies. Among itsareas of strength are genderstudies; social inequality; crime,law, social movements; urbansociology; race and ethnicity;culture; and theory. In addition to formal course work, the department offers stu-dents a chance to participate incollaborative research projectsthrough its apprenticeship pro-gram. This gives students anearly research experience andleads NYU faculty and studentsto publish an unusually highnumber of coauthored papers.Students also have access to thedepartment 's extensive computer resources. The department organizes five continuing public researchworkshops, where faculty andstudents present and criticizeeach other 's works in progress,encouraging professional collab- oration and exchange. Theseworkshops are Crime, Law, andDeviance; Political Economy;and Culture, Institutions, andSocial Change. The departmentalso organizes an active programof colloquia, conferences, andspeakers, and graduate studentsthemselves organize a conferenceeach year. To prepare students interested in careers as college and univer-sity teachers, the departmentoffers training in the teaching ofsociology. This includes a teach-ing practicum and a graduatedprogram of practical experiencein which students work as teach-ing assistants with increasinglevels of responsibility. 269 MERCER STREET NEW YORK, NY 10003-0831 998-8340 WEB www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/socio T 1989 (sociology), Chicago; M.A. 1982 (sociolo-gy), B.A. 1979 (sociology), Indiana.

W agner Graduate School of Public Service. FACULTY EMERITI Eliot L. Freidson, Edwin M. Schur,Patricia C. Sexton, Dennis H.Wrong. Programs and RequirementsAdmission: All applicants must take the Graduate Record Examination(GRE) general test. Grade and Point Requirements: Graduate School requirements aredescribed in the Degree Requirements sec- tion of this bulletin. The Departmentof Sociology requires all graduate stu- dents to maintain a grade average of Bor better in order to remain in goodstanding. All students must completeat least 12 points per semester in letter-graded work in the Department ofSociology (unless the director of gradu-ate studies gives special permission),until they complete the Ph.D. compre- hensive examinations. To receive detailed information on the current requirements, standards,examinations, and course offerings, visitthe department Web site or contact thedepartment graduate secretary. As thedepartment is constantly developing its298 SOCIOLOGYprogram, some of the information provided here may be superseded. Allstudents must meet the current officialrequirements available from the department. MASTER OF ARTS While the graduate program is a Ph.D.program, it does offer continuing stu-dents a Master of Arts degree. The pro-gram does not admit students for a ter-minal M.A. degree. Formal require-ments for the Master of Arts degree insociology are the satisfactory comple-tion of graduate studies totaling at least36 points (at least 24 in residence atNew York University with at least a Baverage) and either a thesis or a com-prehensive examination. At least 24 ofthe points must be in sociology. Thecourses must include three basic sociol-ogy courses, one basic theory course,Methods and Statistics I (G93.2331),and one additional methods course. There is no language requirement for the M.A. degree in sociology. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a researchdegree. It signifies that the recipientcan conduct independent research, has abroad basic knowledge of sociology, andhas a comprehensive knowledge of atleast two chosen areas of specialization. General Course Requirements: In addition to the requirements shownabove under Admission and under Grade and Point Requirements, Ph.D. require- ments include 72 points of graduatework (at least 36 in residence at NewYork University). At least 48 of thepoints required for the Ph.D. degreemust be in regular sociology courses.Up to 12 of the remaining 24 pointsmay be reading or dissertation coursesthat involve individual work with amember of the faculty. The acceptabili-ty of courses outside sociology dependson the relevance of the work to sociolo-gy as judged by the department. Creditfor work done elsewhere requires theapproval of the director of graduatestudies. In addition, a minimum of4 points in a regular, listed seminar(any 3000-level course except readingand dissertation courses and theminiseminars) must be included amongthe 72 points for the Ph.D. degree. Methods and Statistics Requirement: Ph.D. students must pass with a B orbetter two semesters of the Methods and Statistics sequence and one coursesatisfying the \"second methods course requirement. \" Transfer students should see the director of graduate studieswhen first registering in order to deter-mine what courses may be required ofthem. Theory Requirement: The depart- ment requires that all students becomefamiliar with major sociological theo-ries and theoretical reasoning. Thisrequirement is fulfilled with one basicand one advanced theory course, with atleast a B in each. Basic Course Requirement: This requirement aims to ensure that stu-dents receive a strong base of knowl-edge in selected subfields of sociology.Students early in their careers benefitfrom learning the basics of an area, asorganized by experts currently workingin it. This training facilitates students ' abilities to engage in research in thearea and aids them as they prepare theirareas for the Ph.D. comprehensiveexamination. To meet this requirement,students must achieve a B or better ineach of two departmental 2000-levelcourses, excluding those 2000-levelcourses in theory and methods. Research Paper Requirement: This requirement aims to ensure that all stu-dents gain research experience early intheir graduate student careers. Thepaper is written, ordinarily during thesecond year of study, under the guid-ance of a faculty supervisor and must beapproved as well by a second reader. Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination: This written examination should betaken during the third year of full-timestudy. It is organized around two areasthat the student has studied in consul-tation with members of the faculty. Theexamination tests the student 's knowl- edge of these two areas of study and hisor her ability to draw on the disciplineas a whole in applying both theory andresearch methodology to sociologicalproblems. Dissertation: The proposal for the dis- sertation, and the dissertation itself, areresearched and written in consultationwith a committee of at least threeadvisers. Upon approval of the advisers,the dissertation is defended before anexamining committee of five facultymembers (including the three disserta-tion advisers). At least four affirmative votes are required for passing a disserta-tion defense. Time Limits: All requirements must be completed within ten years of theinception of graduate study, or sevenyears from return to graduate study ifthe candidate holds the master 's degree at the time of readmission. Extensionsof this time limit, if granted, are usual-ly conditional upon reexamination, thetaking of additional courses, or otherconditions. It cannot be overemphasized that the accumulation of high grades in formalcourses, while important, is secondaryto the demonstration of the capacity fororiginal thinking and to the comple-tion of research that contributes signifi-cantly to the field and is effectively pre-sented in publications and the disserta-tion. RESEARCH APPRENTICESHIPS The Department of Sociology has a sys-tem of research apprenticeships forgraduate students. Students takingthese apprenticeships work as profes-sors' research assistants, usually for two semesters. These apprenticeships offerstudents intensive research experienceand often lead to coauthorship of pub-lished work. Students may receive up to24 points of credit toward Ph.D. courserequirements for apprenticeships. Thefirst 8 points of credit (G93.2321,2322) can count as part of the48 points students need in regular soci-ology courses. Additional apprentice-ship credit (G93.2323, 2324, 2325,2326) must count against the 24 pointsallowed toward the doctoral degreefrom the combination of apprentice-ship, reading, dissertation, and outsidecourses. The department encouragesstudents to take research apprentice-ships. See the department 's official statement on research apprenticeshipsfor more details. DEPARTMENTAL FELLOW- SHIPS, PRIZES, AND AWARDS A comprehensive list of University, Graduate School, and departmental fel-lowships, prizes, and awards appears inthe Financing Graduate Education section of the application at the back of thisbulletin.CoursesAll courses are 4 points per term, unless otherwise indicated.
