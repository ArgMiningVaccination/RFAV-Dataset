Bach Flower Remedies Developed by Edward Bach, an English physician, bacteriologist, pathologist and homeopath who realised that emotional imbalance creates diseases. He discovered that flowers had healing qualities and developed a system using the flower essences. Bach flowers address the emotional issues that are present, through re-balancing the negative emotions. Once stable, the body is then able to heal itself. It is a simple protocol which benefits a wide range of people. Often, people can forget how negative emotions can affect all levels - our physical & energetic being. During a session, Miho tunes in to your higher self and uses a pendulum to work with your energy and chooses which remedies are most suitable.
