The two students involved in the case contacted the HBF for help in 2011 after their acceptances had been revoked due to a positive hepatitis B test on a routine physical exam. Since both had been born in the U.S. and vaccinated as toddlers, they were unaware of their chronic infections. \"The HBF first brought these two cases of hepatitis B-related discrimination to national leaders who could make a difference,\" explained Joan Block, HBF executive director. \"And we worked closely with Nadine Shiroma, a community civil rights advocate, who contacted the Department of Justice and persisted in making it a civil rights issue.\" The settlement was reached based on the strength of the Centers for Disease Control's updated HBV recommendations released in 2012 (B Informed, Spring 2012) that clearly state having hepatitis B should not preclude anyone from pursuing studies or a career in health care. This is the first ever ADA settlement reached by the Justice Department on behalf of people with hepatitis B. \"Excluding people with disabili- ties from higher education based on unfounded fears or incorrect scientific information is unac- ceptable,\" explained Thomas Perez, U.S. Assistant Attorney General, DOJ Civil Rights Division. The settlement requires the NJ medical schools to adopt a disability rights policy based on the CDC's recommendations and provide their employees with ADA training. After learning of the DOJ settlement, a student shared with us, \"A sense of relief overwhelmed me. The weights on my shoulders were finally lifted and I could pursue my dream to become a doctor with the law behind me.\"U.S. Dept. of Justice Strikes Down HBV Discrimination HBF Researchers Target cccDNA.

Block, Co-Founder and Executive Director The Hepatitis B Foundation continues to be the beacon of hope for those concerned about and affected by hepatitis B and liver cancer. We are guided by our twin goals: to increase awareness about hepatitis B and deliver new discoveries in pursuit of a cure. Partnerships have been and remain key to our success and future growth. We worked closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Justice to achieve the amazing advocacy success of striking down hepatitis B-related discrimination for health care students (front page). With AAPCHO (Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations), we spearheaded the creation of Hep B United, the first national campaign that includes more than 15 community-based coalitions from around the country and federal partners. This unique initiative has resulted in the first national community action plan to address the enormous challenge of hepatitis B in the U.S. (page 6).We are making noise not only in outreach, but also in discov- ery research. With our academic partner, Drexel University, we have discovered new \"lead\" compounds with promising activity against hepatitis B and liver cancer, as well as new methods for the early detection of liver cancer (page 3). As we make progress in advancing our mission through strategic partnerships in the U.S. and abroad (page 6), we are getting even closer to our goal of ... making hepatitis B history.Making Hepatitis B History In the News HBF's Biotech Center Boosts Economy with $579 Million Impact The Hepatitis B Foundation's Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center, which the Foundation established in 2006 to advance its research mission, announced the impressive results of a 2013 Economic Impact Study by Byler Associates, LLC. From 2009 through 2012, the Center and its affiliated organizations generated $579 million for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and 573 jobs. \"We promised we would deliver,\" said Dr. Timothy Block, president of the Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center, HBF and its research institute, and professor at Drexel University. He added that many of the Center's discoveries are now entering human use studies and can help people. \"All of this ... [underscores the need for] ... continued investment in the Center, since it has prospered during a slow economic period and weathered the most recent economic situation so well.\" Jim Greenwood , president and CEO of Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the region's congressman when the Center was established, notes that, \"[The Foundation] started with an abandoned warehouse that had lost 140 jobs and converted it into a high-tech incubator of innovation, creating hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars of economic development in a field that brings hope to untold numbers of patients.\" Read more at www.pabiotechbc.org.Thanks for your donations!

B Informed | Spring 2013 | Hepatitis B Foundation | hepb.orgEditor: Joan M. Block Managing Editor: Anu Hosangadi Contact: editor@hepb.org The International HBV Meeting, held September 23-26, 2012, and coordinated by the Hepatitis B Foundation, was held in the ancient halls of Christ Church at the University of Oxford, where parts of the popular Harry Potter movies were filmed. The meeting was co-chaired by Maila K. Maini, MD, University College London, and John Casey, PhD, Georgetown University. After 27 years, it continues to be the definitive scientific meeting for hepatitis B. The meeting attracted 350 scientists from around the world to meet, present and discuss their research. This was probably the largest turnout in a decade and confirms the distinct feeling that with hepatitis C now curable, there is a renewed interest in hepatitis B, particularly from the commercial world. See page 5 for the meeting highlights.Some of the most exciting work in the field of hepatitis B is happening at the Hepatitis B Foundation's research institute. A team of HBF and Drexel University scientists has identified several compounds that inhibit the formation and activity of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) found inside the chromosome of the hepatitis B virus. Most scientists think a cure for hepatitis B will require elimination of cccDNA, which is the stable source of all viral replication in the body. Hepatitis B Foundation researchers have now effectively targeted cccDNA and shown that its formation, expression, and perhaps even stability can all be affected by drugs and cytokines. \"When you eliminate or silence the cccDNA, you prevent the virus from ever expressing any of its genes. The viral presence, or footprint, goes to zero,\" says Dr. Timothy Block, HBF president and professor at Drexel University. \"The door has now been opened for drug treatments that can stop the disease in its tracks. Rather than just suppressing the virus, these new compounds could actually destroy it,\" added Dr. Block. Why cccDNA Is Groundbreaking News While scientists at the HBF's 2011 Princeton Workshop voted that a cccDNA inhibitor tops the \"most wanted\" list of new HBV drugs, it remains an elusive goal for now. One approach to destroying cccDNA without harming the human DNA is being taken by Dr. Lorne Tyrrell and his colleagues at the University of Alberta. They are using \"zinc finger\" enzymes, which are designed to specifically cut HBV DNA sequences without, in theory, targeting the human host.Why Patients Should Take Note Many people with chronic HBV must take an oral medication for the rest of their lives, which is not an ideal situation. But by \"zapping\" the virus with an anti-cccDNA compound, HBF scientists are taking a giant step towards finding a cure. \"Currently, chronic hepatitis B can be medically managed with either pegylated interferons or direct-acting antivirals,\" says Dr. Block. \"But our goal is to eliminate HBV , not just manage it. Targeting cccDNA may take us that much closer to developing a cure. And that could make it a game changer.\" Drugs that can target and destroy cccDNA could lower the risk of liver disease and liver cancer significantly. With possibili-ties such as these, it's no wonder the excitement is spreading from the Hepatitis B Foundation in Doylestown, PA, to the rest of the world. 3 B Informed | Spring 2013 | Hepatitis B Foundation | hepb.orgTargeting cccDNA Could Be a Game Changer Harry Potter Meets Hepatitis B: 2012 International HBV Meeting in Oxford 2012 International HBV Meeting co-chairs with HBF organizers.

B Informed | Spring 2013 | Hepatitis B Foundation | hepb.org From the antiviral therapeutic perspective, there is a lot of exciting news to report from the 2012 International HBV Meeting, especially the cccDNA work being done in the Hepatitis B Foundation's research labs. cccDNA can be repressed in culture by interferons and even candidate compounds and recombinant cccDNA-destroying proteins (Lucifora et al., Technische U. et U. Witwatersrand #36; Palumbo et al, U. Rome #37; Liu et al, Drexel and HBF #38; Cai et al., Drexel and HBF #50) Use of toll receptor 7 agonists to control HBV has become a viable target (S. Fletcher, Gilead Sciences) Suppression of HBsAg is becoming a clinical target (A. Vallient, Replicor) The possibility of targeting HBV RNAseH (J. Tavis, St. Louis U.) RNAi is back and entering human trials (Wooddell et al., Arrowhead Research #149) New mouse model for HBV infection might be very useful for therapeutic drug evaluation (Bility et al., U. North Carolina #96) There were a number of other very interesting presentations and topics covered that were more fundamental in nature, rather than serving specific antiviral projects, but were provocative as well.

Hepatitis B Foundation Publication Highlights In 2001 the CDC designated May as National Hepatitis Awareness Month, which is an important opportunity to increase the visibility of 6 million Americans living with chronic hepatitis B or C infections. Every year the HBF has been hosting events to draw attention to hepatitis B. Last year Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter joined our photo flash mob, so this year we hope to see him join our coalition on the \"Rocky Run\" up the Philadelphia Art Museum steps! In addition, we have our Philadelphia Hep B Heroes team (photo) ready to go for the gold in the Independence Dragon Boat Regatta, which draws more than 2,000 enthusiasts.

The Hep B United action plan is the result of a national summit held for coalition and federal partners in August 2012 at the Hepatitis B Foundation's headquarters (B Informed, Spring 2012). By focusing on three priority areas of the HHS Hepatitis Plan\u2014to educate providers and communities, improve testing and linkage to care, and elimi-nate perinatal HBV transmission\u2014Hep B United's action plan has created a national resource with strategies that coalitions can use at at the local level as they combat hepatitis B in their own communities. For example, with the overarching challenges that include lack of awareness, language and cultural barriers, and fund- ing limitations, local coalitions can serve as a trusted coordinator of services and resources to help people gain access to screening, vaccination, and care, and to reduce perinatal HBV transmission. They can also build partnerships with federal agencies that include the CDC, Office of Minority Health, HHS, and the White House Asian and Pacific Islander Initiative. There is a lot to do, but Hep B United and its coalition and federal partners are working together to implement the com- munity action plan, to define success, and to make a measurable impact on eliminating hepatitis B and liver cancer at both the local and national levels. Indonesia's Hepatitis B Crisis By J. Michael Hall, Madison AssociatesHep B United Community Action Plan: A National Resource for Local Coalitions In 2012, while in Indonesia on a 6-month sabbatical from my government relations business in Washington, DC, I interviewed Indonesia's leading health officials and experts in liver diseases to understand the scale of Indonesia's public health problem posed by hepatitis B. An estimated 10% of Indonesia's population of 239 million is infected with the hepatitis B virus, ranking Indonesia third in the world in terms of the number of people infected by hepatitis B. Dr. Poernomo Boedi, chairman of Internal Medicine at Airlangga University in Surabaya, reported that most people in Indonesia are unaware that they have hepatitis B until its later stages. There have been no public health campaigns to increase awareness or to encourage testing, especially among pregnant mothers, because of the expense. And most Indonesians are unaware that hepatitis B treatment is covered under the national health care insurance, according to Dr. Rino Gani, chairman of the Indonesian Liver Research Association. Compounding the lack of awareness is the low immunization rate in Indonesia. Mohammad Subuh, director of the Communicable Diseases Department at the National Health Ministry, observed that very few newborns are vaccinated at birth, a critical means of stopping perinatal hepatitis B transmission.Dr. Boedi believes major improvements in Indonesia's public health system are possible with more resources, so he and others at Airlangga University Medical School have begun discussion with Dr. Timothy Block, president and co-founder of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its research institute. They are also exploring a possible collaborative initiative that could qualify for funding from the University Partnership Program offered by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). A joint venture with USAID and the HBF could provide Indonesia with critical assistance as it tackles the enormous public health challenge of hepatitis B in an era of effective vaccines and treatments. Recently a group of investigators from Johns Hopkins University published a paper with the title \"Comparative Risk of Liver-Related Mortality from Chronic Hepatitis B Versus Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection.\" They found that hepati- tis B is more likely to cause liver-related death than is hepatitis C. Unexpectedly, studies related to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic brought the authors to this conclusion. AIDS was first reported in the United States in 1981. The deadly disease affects all populations, but men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for most of the early cases. MSM also had been identified in the 1970s as having a high incidence of hepatitis B. Fast-forward to 1984. Before the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causing AIDS was clearly identified, sev-eral researchers suggested that a variant of the hepatitis B virus was the cause. Researchers proposed a prospective study of MSM who had been tested for hepa-titis B and a newly reported anti-HIV antibody, but who did not have immune deficiency disease. By following the men over time, the researchers wanted to observe which infection\u2014HIV or HBV or a combination of both\u2014led to AIDS. Between 1984 and 2002, the Multi- center Cohort Study enrolled 6,972 MSM from four U.S. cities. The men were studied until 2010, on average for more than 8 years. Serum samples were collected every 6 months, frozen, and stored. Although the hepatitis C virus (HCV) had not yet been identified in 1984, all the samples were later tested for HIV , HBV , and HCV . All deaths, includ-ing liver-related deaths, were recorded. The results were surprising. Comparable numbers of men were infected with HBV and HCV , but men with chronic HBV were twice as likely to die a liver-related death as the men with chronic HCV . After carefully accounting for the treat- ments of the hepatitis viruses and HIV used during the study, the investigators found that immunodeficiency further increased the risk of liver-related death in the men with chronic HBV over that in the men with HCV . The study showed that in the two and a half decades after 1984, hepatitis B infec- tion was more serious than hepatitis C. Now this difference is even greater. HCV has become a curable disease. Chronic HBV is manageable, but not yet curable. This means that hepatitis B, which was already a worse disease than hepatitis C before the new therapies for hepatitis C, is now a much more impor - tant unsolved health problem. 7Speaking Personally Chronic Hepatitis B or C: Which Is Worse?
