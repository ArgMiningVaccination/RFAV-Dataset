When hormones are out of balance, we don't feel like ourselves. Conversely, hormonal balance can positively influence the health of our body and mind. At Integrative, we assess every patient individually, identifying the root cause of their hormonal imbalance, and formulating a unique treatment plan to move them towards optimal health. Applications Signs and Symptoms of Hormone Imbalances Our endocrine system connects multiple organs, such as the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, and ovaries or testicles. Hormonal imbalances are typically due to complex disturbances within the endocrine system, and can be influenced by the health of our digestive system, nervous system, and detoxification pathways; in turn, hormonal imbalances can have multiple effects throughout our body. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms or conditions, you may benefit from treatment aimed at balancing your hormones: - Low libido - Low or irregular energy level - Insomnia - Low mood, anxiety, depression, and other mental health imbalances - Hair loss - Irregular hair growth - Difficulty losing weight - Hot flashes - Difficulty establishing or sustaining an erection - Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) - PreMenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) - Irregular periods - Heavy periods - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) - Amenorrhea - Metabolic syndrome - Type II Diabetes - Fibrocystic breast condition - Infertility Our Approach An Integrative Approach To Hormone Imbalance At Integrative, our treatment protocols vary with each patient based on their symptoms, history, and lifestyle. We aim to identify the root cause - the core imbalances that are interfering with the endocrine system. Your doctor will include testing methods to identify the root cause. These methods may include: First Visit What does your first visit look like? Your first visit is the opportunity for you to share your health goals, and for your doctor to gather vital health information that will help them to determine the root cause of your health concerns, and the best treatment plan for you. One Complete Medical & Lifestyle History Your Doctor will take a complete history, gathering details regarding your current and past health concerns, lifestyle, as well as current supplements and medications Two Testing If needed, your Doctor will recommend additional tests, either at Integrative or with your medical doctor. They may requisition results from tests you've completed in the past. Your Doctor will likely recommend testing specific to hormonal levels, such as a serum, salivary, or urine hormone panel, or a combination of all three. Treatment Plan Your Treatment Plan Every patient is unique; your doctor will develop a treatment plan that addresses the root cause of your health concerns. Your treatment plan may include a variety of tools, including: Optimal Nutrition To support hormone balance, your doctor may recommend that you eliminate foods you are sensitive to, emphasize certain macronutrients, or include specific micronutrients. They may incorporate visits with our Holistic Nutritionist to provide further support with a specific nutrition plan.
