I have created short and sweet little summer deals for self care during these busy months. Deals work a bit differently than my normal scheduling as they are usually services that can not be found on my usual service menu. They are special offers at a discount rate that you purchase during the deal time which is limited and then you can schedule right away or save them for later time, a bit like a gift certificate. They can also be given as gifts. The current offer available until July 5th, 2019 is a 45 minute foot massage and reflexology session which includes warm stones and customized essential oils for only $30, a great way to relax and give your feet a much needed break! To schedule, the deals must be purchased first from the deals page which I have included here . After purchasing the deal you can contact the studio to schedule your appointment. During the time the offer is active you can also buy multiple deals to save for later or buy one for a friend or loved one. Hope you are enjoying the summer so far and don't forget to take some time for yourself to relax and recharge. February Blessings, Blessed Imbolc, and Saint Brigid's Day! We have made it through the darkest part of winter and each day the light grows stronger! We are now at the halfway point between Winter and Spring, light a candle and sow your seeds of intention. February's focus is on self love and the heart chakra. Self love and an open heart chakra is a foundation that sends out magical ripples that create powerful, positive shifts in health and happiness that not only benefit you but all of those around you. The heart chakra is your control center for compassion, empathy, connection, forgiveness, and unconditional love. It is the great bridge that connects the physical body to the divine, the lower three body chakras with the upper three spiritual chakras. The heart chakra also plays a huge role in connecting us to others. When your heart chakra is healthy and open, you are unafraid to give and receive love. You forgive yourself and others easily, you practice self-acceptance, harmony and experience deep compassion. When the heart chakra is out of balance, however, you may feel emotionally unstable, angry, paranoid, unworthy of love, always in self-pity or unforgiving of yourself or others. If you feel that your heart chakra is in need of some attention, there are many things you can do to balance the energies. The first step toward healing is engaging in self love. Once you fully love and protect yourself, you are able to project this loving energy onto others. Some of my favorite natural go to's to promote self love and balance the heart chakra include: ~Essential oils like bergamot, palmarosa, rose, neroli, ylang ylang, and geranium ~Fresh flowers like the healing high vibration of the rose ~Herbal teas made from rose petals, raspberry leaf, tulsi, motherwort, and hibiscus ~Crystals like rose quartz, healing frequency's in 528hz ~Reiki! There are many services and events here at the studio to help you on your path of self love, not just in February, but each day of the year! I have however chosen February to focus on many of them. The Rose Quartz Integrative Massage & Reiki services started out as a Valentine's Day promotion here at the studio in 2012 and wound up staying on the service menu year round due to the profound impact made, they have become, by far my most popular services.

Dry skin Brushing is an easy and cost effective way to keep your skin soft and smooth as well as keep you healthy. By adding this technique to your daily routine it can help to exfoliate dead skin cells, improve circulation, stimulate nerve endings, relax muscle tissue, and stimulate the lymphatic system Dry skin brushing is also an effective way to support the body in eliminating toxins through the skin. It is very important that the body be able to to adequately eliminate toxins. The body possesses its own natural routes of elimination which need to work optimally in order to avoid storage of toxins and prevent disease. Often our lifestyles do not allow the body to work optimally and need some support from us! Read more about the importance of elimination here. When dry brushing at home it is important to use a natural bristle dry brush (easily found in most bath sections of stores) Incorporate it into your daily routine in the morning start at the feet and and work in small circles upward, do not use water as it takes away the benefits of the friction. Go lightly at first as your skin gets used to the brushing and could be sensitive. Here at the studio I offer a dry brush and massage service which begins with a dry brush exfoliation followed by an relaxing Integrative Massage using a nourishing organic massage creme.

Hot stone massage is an age old healing art that uses warmed basalt stones to massage the body, relax the muscles, and draw out pain and discomfort. The warmed stones are also placed along the energy centers of the body and are able to connect paths of energy to balance the mind, body, and spirit. In addition to the warmed basalt stones other tools of the earth can be integrated into the massage such as crystals and healing essential oils. This service is extremely therapeutic and is beneficial for those that suffer from chronic pain including fibromyalgia and arthritic conditions. Hot stone massage has been around for a very long time. The Chinese used heated stones for healing more than 2,000 years ago. The practice is also found in other ancient cultures including the Egyptians and Native Americans. I feel a great connection with the stones when using them, as being from the earth, they emit and transfer a soothing, grounding energy. A hot stone massage is very much like your usual therapeutic massage but heated smooth flat stones are used. In my massage, I first place large stones over a towel along the spine to warm and relax the muscles, help sedate the nervous system, and align the energy centers. Crystals can also be placed along the energy centers of the body. I then hold the warm stones and use them the same way as I do my hands. Hot stone massage is great for those like me who are always chilly and the heat from the stones will warm you to your core. It is also wonderful for relaxing muscle tension, just like applying a heat wrap would be, and can help to improve a wide range of conditions. The calm, relaxing application of the heated stones also promotes the release of endorphins that help to reduce stress and lower blood pressure. The warm stones will also help to open up the pores of the skin which can increase oxygen intake and improve circulation. Combined with specially selected essential oils for you, your aches and pains will melt away! Hot stone massage is one of my favorite types of massage to get so it's natural for me to want to think that everyone should feel the same way, but I am actually surprised at the amount of people who tell me they have never tried one. I do find, however, that once someone does, it's usually their favorite massage too! Hot stone massage is generally safe for everyone however there are certain situations or health conditions where it may not be right for you. A review of your health history intake form would be done to make sure. We can always customize your hot stone massage to your individual needs, and can be done with or without the use of crystals or added energy work.

This weekend I made some infused oil from my beautiful St. John's wort plant. St. John's wort is traditionally known and used for its ability to promote a feeling of well being but it also has many therapeutic actions that make it great for topical use that include antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-neuralgic, astringent, and antiseptic which can make it a wonderful healing body oil and massage oil for sore muscles. Making an infused oil is easy and rewarding as you use what nature provides us to heal. In this blend there are simple ingredients of sweet almond oil, St. John's wort, and some lavender essential oil which is optional. Other essential oils can also be added to enhance the aroma or therapeutic intention of your blend. Take care in the sun if you are using a body oil with St. John's wort because it could increase your chances of getting sunburn. Some fun herbal and aromatherapy workshops will be scheduled soon here at the studio where we will be making many of these different preparations. Make sure to ask for some of my St. John's wort massage oil for your next scheduled massage! The information provided on this site is for educational purposes only.
