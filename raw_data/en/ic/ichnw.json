Preventive Measures For Dengue: There is no vaccine available to prevent dengue, and, also, there are no specific medications to treat the infection of dengue. So, the prevention of dengue becomes the most crucial step. And, prevention of dengue means to avoid the bites of mosquitoes, particularly if you reside in or are travelling to an endemic area. As an important preventive measure, you can minimize or regulate the exposure to the mosquitoes with the following measures. - Use mosquito-repellent machines and skin-friendly mosquito repellants. - Wear protective clothing with a complete covering - If you have household items, such as birdbaths, bowls, flower vases, and other utensils, which contain water, change or replace the water in them regularly. This is because these household items turn to be stagnant water sourced for the breeding of dengue-mosquitoes. - If you have water coolers in your house, add kerosene oil to the water in them. The addition of kerosene creates a barrier for respiration, and the larvae or the eggs laid by the mosquitoes get killed due to suffocation. - Stay in a well-screened housing - Avoid water storage at nearby places - If anyone in your home is suffering from dengue, take extra care to prevent the mosquitoes from biting the affected dengue-patient and it continues to bite the other people in the household.
