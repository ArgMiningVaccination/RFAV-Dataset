It differs from Eastern, or alternative, medicine, in its approach to treatment, which relies upon industrially produced medications and a strict adherence to the formal scientific process. Naturopathic Medicine: Naturopathic Medicine treats health conditions by utilizing the body's ability to heal. Naturopathic physicians aid the healing process by incorporating a variety of alternative methods based on the patient's individual needs. Diet, lifestyle, work, and personal history are all considered when determining a treatment regimen. [Naturopathic Medicine](https://www.daocloud.com/naturopathic-medicine) is not a single modality of healing, but an array of healing practices, including diet and clinical nutrition, homeopathy, acupuncture, herbal medicine, hydrotherapy, therapeutic exercise, physical therapies including ultrasound and light therapy, therapeutic counseling and herbology. Whether they emphasize the use of hydrotherapy, nutrition, manipulation, herbs or homeopathy, the goal of all practitioners of natural healing is to stimulate the body to heal itself. Vis medicatrix naturae or the healing power of nature remains central to Naturopathic philosophy today. Rather than trying to attack specific diseases, natural healers focus on cleansing and strengthening the body. --Phone consultations available!

Massage Therapy: Massage is the manipulation of superficial & deeper layers of muscles & connective tissue using various techniques to enhance function; aid in the healing process; & promote relaxation & well being. Homeopathy: Homeopathy is a non-toxic system of medicine used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It is particularly effective in treating chronic illnesses that fail to respond to conventional treatment. Homeopathic remedies are generally dilutions of natural substances form plants & minerals.

Bio-puncture is a therapy whereby specific locations are injected with biological products. The majority of the products are derived from plants. Most of these injections are given into the skin or into muscles. But how does Bio-puncture work to help me with my pain or inflammations? In conventional medicine, the drug you take suppresses your symptoms immediately. That is why you need to take high doses of chemical substances in order to suppress, for example, pain or inflammation. And usually it works immediately. But as soon as the medication stops working, you have to take another pill to \"kill the pain\" again. However, in Bio-puncture small doses of products are injected in order to stimulate the natural healing processes. These ultra-low doses \"wake up\" mechanisms which are available anyway. So, the healing effect comes from \"inside\" your body -- not from the products themselves. It's the reaction of your immune system which will produce the proper reactions to regain natural healing. The reaction of your body may be, for example, better local blood circulation, tissue repair, relaxation of muscles or local detoxification. Life Coaching : Not to be confused with therapy or counselling, Life Coaching involves the development of a special relationship between the coach and the client which, rather than looking to the past, plans for the future. As apposed to focusing on one or two past events it has a more holistic approach aimed at dealing with all matters effecting the client's achievement of a fulfilling, successful and stress-free life. Using the old adage 'United we stand...' coaching provides a confidential, non-judgemental, impartial and completely personalised support structure that enables the individual to achieve far more than they ever would 'going it alone'. The Coach guides them towards identifying their own personal potential, clarifying their objectives and seeing their future clearly - undistorted by people, emotions or events. Having a supportive family and friends is invaluable but these people cannot offer advice that isn't clouded by their own wishes, issues or problems. Telephone Sessions are also available. Spirometry Test : Spirometry (meaning the measuring of breath) is the most common of the pulmonary function tests (PFTs), measuring lung function, specifically the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled.

Resting Metabolic Rate Test (RMR) : Did you know that your metabolism can differ by hundreds of calories from people of the exact same height, weight, age and gender? For the first time, technology previously available only in research facilities and hospitals makes is possible for your metabolic rate to be accurately measured through a simple, 10-minute breathing test. The Resting Metabolic Rate test (RMR) determines the amount of energy (calories) your body is using at rest. This measurement is made by analyzing the amount of oxygen your body uses and the amount of carbon dioxide your body produces. Almost all of the energy your body produces is created through aerobic (oxygen utilizing) metabolism. The oxygen is combined with carbohydrates and fats to make energy in your body's tissue. This energy is used to keep your organs and tissues working properly. When carbohydrates and fats are broke down to make energy carbon dioxide is produced. The percentage of the energy from carbohydrates and fats are broken down to make energy carbon dioxide is produced. The percentage of the energy created from carbohydrates and fats can be determined by measuring the carbon dioxide your body produces. "}
