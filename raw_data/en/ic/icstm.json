The motiva-tion for studying HCW resilience, a more positively framed approach to addressing HCW burnout, is rooted in the unsus-tainable levels of burnout among HCWs. High levels of HCW burnout in the United States (U.S.) are a significant problem for both patients and HCWs (NASEM, 2019). Burnout is defined as ongoing and unmitigated stress that results in symptoms of emotional exhaustion, depersonaliza-tion, and a decreased sense of personal accomplishment (World Health Organization, 2019). Research shows nearly 44% of physicians (Shanafelt et al., 2019) and 35% of nurses (Dyrbye et al., 2019) experience at least one burnout symp-tom. Burnout is associated with lower patient satisfaction (McHugh et al., 2011), higher rates of infection (Cimiotti et al., 2012), medical errors (Melnyk et al., 2018), and patient mortality (Aiken et al., 2002). Therefore, burnout is not without consequence. Research shows increasing resilience in HCWs can be a way to safeguard against the effects of burnout (Adair et al., 2020a; Guo et al., 2018; Matheson et al., 2016). Resilience involves a process of recovery from adversity or stress while also providing an opportunity for further personal growth and positive adaptation (American Psychological Association [APA], 2020). Two of the main resilience paths are recovery and thriving (Szanton & Gill, 2010). Recovery is characterized as a return to baseline functioning after experiencing \"diminished functional capacity\" from the challenge or adversity (Szanton & Gill, 2010, p. 330). Thriving, on the other hand, takes a positive trajectory from a challenge or adversity, whereby the HCW grows beyond their previous baseline (Szanton & Gill, 2010). Emotions are a central component in building capacity for recovery 1017515 WJN XXX10.1177/01939459211017515Western Journal of Nursing ResearchRink et al. research-article 2021 1Duke School of Nursing, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA 2Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA 3Duke Center for Healthcare Safety and Quality, Duke University Health System, Durham, NC, USA Corresponding Author: Lesley C.

Humphreys1, and J. Bryan Sexton2,3 Abstract Engaging in well-being behaviors may promote resilience, which can protect against burnout. This descriptive, correlational analysis utilized baseline data from health care workers enrolled in the Web-based Implementation of the Science for Enhancing Resilience longitudinal study (N = 2,383). The study aimed to describe the association of (a) types of well-being behaviors (regular exercise, yoga, meditation, spent time with a close friend, vacation) and (b) total number of well-being behaviors with resilience (emotional thriving and emotional recovery), covarying for sociodemographic and professional characteristics. General linear model findings indicated that each well-being behavior was significantly associated with greater emotional thriving, while only exercise and spending time with friends were significantly related to greater emotional recovery. Emotional thriving and emotional recovery were also significantly higher among health care workers reporting more well-being behaviors. Engaging in well-being behaviors may be one part of the solution toward increasing resilience in health care workers that warrants further investigation. Keywords resilience, psychological, burnout, psychological, well-being behaviors, health personnel 2 Western Journal of Nursing Research 00(0) and thriving. In particular, positive emotions can serve as fuel for the resilience growth process (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004). As such, the two components of emo-tional recovery and emotional thriving serve as the two constructs representing resilience in this study. The term \"resilience\" is commonly used in psychological science but has acquired a negative connotation of blame among some HCWs, i.e., \"your problem is that you are not resilient enough\" (Balme et al., 2015) or the expectation that HCWs must \"compensate for the fundamental fissures in the health care system\" (Rushton & Pappas, 2020, p. 143). We recog-nize that system level issues are a predominant contributor of burnout (NASEM, 2019), and we regard resilience as one of many components in addressing HCW burnout. Individual-level strategies are particularly important as HCWs endure stress during the Covid-19 pandemic (Dzau et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020) that needs to be deployed promptly while longer-term strategies are addressed. Of additional note, a negative relationship between resilience and burnout has been shown in research (Guo et al., 2018). However, physicians with burnout symptoms have also reported high resilience (West et al., 2020). Less is known of this nonreciprocal relationship between resilience and burnout in nurses, though the current research on physi-cians suggest that high resilience does not necessarily equate to low burnout. The construct of resilience has evolved from being regarded as a static trait to one that can be strengthened with intentional practices and supports (APA, 2020; Jackson et al., 2007; O'Dougherty-Wright et al., 2013). Theory also supports the notion that resilience is \"both a process and a capacity\" that can be strengthened at multiple levels, includ-ing individual focused strategies (Szanton & Gill, 2010, p. 332). Engaging in well-being behaviors may be one such individual level strategy that theoretically may fuel the pro-cess of resilience and strengthen resilience capacity (Szanton & Gill, 2010). Research has demonstrated that well-being behaviors such as exercise (Guo et al., 2018; Oskrochi et al., 2016; Shanafelt et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2018), relationships with family and friends (Rippstein-Leuenberger et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018), meditation (Gauthier et al., 2015; Goodman & Schorling, 2012; Muir & Keim-Malpass, 2020; van der Riet et al., 2018), yoga (Alexander et al., 2015), going on vacations (Shanafelt et al., 2012), and reflecting on the positive things in life (Sexton & Adair, 2019) are associated with lower burnout or higher resilience. Current research often assesses well-being behaviors separately from one another (Cleary et al., 2018; Joyce et al., 2018) or with focus on certain HCW groups (Lebensohn et al., 2013; Shanafelt et al., 2012). However, limited research has been conducted to investigate the total number and types of well-being behaviors that various groups of HCWs are collectively engaged in and their asso-ciation with resilience.Purpose Understanding the type and total number of well-being behaviors related to resilience could help researchers develop resilience-enhancing tools for HCWs. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship of well-being behaviors with resilience in HCWs as a first step in developing future interventions to enhance resilience among HCWs. Two aspects of resilience were examined, emotional thriving and emotional recovery. Emotional thriving assessed HCWs' ability to flourish while emotional recovery assessed HCWs' capacity to bounce back from difficulties (Adair et al., 2020a). The aims of this study were to (a) identify types of well-being behaviors associated with emotional thriving and emotional recovery and (b) determine the relationship between total number of well-being behaviors with emo-tional thriving and emotional recovery, covarying for sociodemographic and professional characteristics of the HCWs. Methods Design This descriptive, correlational study was a secondary analy- sis of baseline data from HCWs enrolled in the Web-based Implementation of the Science for Enhancing Resilience (WISER) longitudinal study (R01 HD084679-01, Co-PI: Sexton, J. B.). The participating institutional review board approved this study prior to initiation of the WISER longitu-dinal study and the analysis of the baseline data. Sample and Setting The sample included U.S. HCWs (N = 2,383) enrolled in the WISER study (R01 HD084679-01, Co-PI: Sexton, J. B.) with resilience data who completed the baseline survey between June 1, 2018 and April 24, 2019. The WISER data-set is comprised of responses from U.S. HCWs age 18 years or older. HCWs were recruited from a wide variety of health care systems, hospitals, and clinics across the United States through educational webinars, web links, and attending sci-entific presentations given by the third and last authors. Data were collected electronically via Qualtrics and stored on a secure server. Measures Participants reported sociodemographic and health care pro-fessional characteristics. Sociodemographic measures were sex, race, and ethnicity. There were five options for race that were collapsed in the following categories: White, Black/African American, and other minorities (Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Rink et al. 3 Alaska Native). Ethnicity included Hispanic/Latinx or non- Hispanic/non-Latinx. Professional characteristics included HCW role, shift length, total years of professional experience, years in cur - rent position, work department, clinical population, and clin-ical setting. HCW role included 23 positions that were collapsed into five categories: (1) nurse (registered nurse, nurse manager, charge nurse), (2) physician (attending/staff medical doctor, fellow physician, resident physician), (3) physician assistant or nurse practitioner, (4) other HCWs (clinical support/nurse assistant, clinical social worker, chap-lain/clergy, dietician/nutritionist, occupational therapist, pharmacist, physical therapist, speech therapist, respiratory therapist, technologist/technician, EMT-B, paramedic), and (5) other (administrative support, environmental support, other manager, student, and those who selected other). Shift length included 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and other with the smaller frequency of 24 hours com-bined into the other category. Total years of professional experience and years in current position included seven options that were collapsed into five categories: (1) <1 year, (2) 1-4 years, (3) 5-10 years, (4) 11-20 years, and (5) 21+ years. Work department included 16 options that were col-lapsed into seven categories: (1) emergency medicine, (2) critical care, (3) family & internal medicine, (4) anesthesiol-ogy and surgery, (5) obstetrics and gynecology, (6) pediat-rics, and (7) other (not applicable, neurology, physical medicine, and rehabilitation, preventative medicine, psychi-atry, radiology, urology, and other). Clinical population included those who practice with adults, pediatrics, or both, and not applicable. Clinical setting options included inpa-tient, outpatient, and not applicable. HCWs were asked to select well-being behaviors they had engaged in over the last month. The response options were as follows: (1) regular exercise, (2) yoga, (3) meditation, (4) spent time with a close friend, (5) vacation, and (6) other. A version of this item using an open-ended response was used in prior exploratory research by the last author. The most fre-quently identified responses (e.g., regular exercise, yoga, meditation, spent time with a close friend, and vacation) were selected as options for this survey in addition to the \"other\" option. The selection of \"other\" and the related open-ended responses were not included in this analysis; however, an overview of the self-reported \"other\" well-being behav-iors are included in the descriptive results. Engaging in each type of well-being behavior was coded either no (0, not selected) or yes (1, checked). A total score (ranging from 0 to 5) was derived by summing the types of well-being behav-iors endorsed. Resilience was measured using eight-items, including the emotional thriving subscale (items 1-4) and the emotional recovery subscale (items 5-8). Both of these scales were cre-ated and psychometrically tested by the third and last author (Adair et al., 2020a). Established resilience metrics are not currently well-suited for HCWs because they are either long (e.g., 25 items; Wagnild, 2009), focused exclusively on the \"bounce back\" aspect of resilience and do not assess the thriv-ing aspect of resilience (e.g., Smith et al., 2008), or include items that cover a broad range of resilience related concepts beyond that of thriving and recovery (e.g., Connor & Davidson, 2003). To address the need for brief, appropriate, and psychometrically valid metrics for HCWs, the Emotional Resilience scales were developed as a part of the NIH funded research on HCW resilience awarded to the last author. Items were piloted in other samples to establish psychometric valid-ity and used in prior research (Adair et al., 2020a). Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = disagree strongly, 2 = disagree slightly, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree slightly, 5 = agree strongly). Each subscale score was the average of the four items, with higher scores indicating greater resilience. The emotional thriving subscale (current study Cronbach = 0.81) assessed the HCW level of flourishing (e.g., \"I feel like I am thriving at my job\") (Adair et al., 2020a). The emotional recovery subscale (current study Cronbach = 0.82) assessed the ability to bounce back from difficulties (e.g., \"I always bounce back quickly after difficulties\") (Adair et al., 2020a). Emotional thriving and emotional recovery were the primary outcomes for this analysis. Data Analysis Sample characteristics and a description of key study mea-sures were provided using descriptive statistics. All statisti-cal tests were nondirectional and had a significance level set at 0.05. Effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to address clinical relevance. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.2 \u00ae software (SAS Institute, Inc., 2015). General linear models (GLM) were used to examine the association of types of well-being behaviors as well as total number of well-being behaviors in the last month with emo-tional thriving and emotional recovery scores. First, bivariate analysis of variance models were conducted to (a) examine the relationship of each type of well-being behaviors with emotional thriving and emotional recovery scores and (b) examine the relationship of total number of well-being behaviors with emotional thriving and emotional recovery scores. Next, an analysis of covariance was conducted to fur - ther examine these relationships after adjusting for ten covariates in the model. Covariates are as follows (1) sex, (2) race, (3) ethnicity, (4) HCW role, (5) shift length, (6) total years of professional experience, (7) years in current posi-tion, (8) work department, (9) clinical population, and (10) clinical setting. These sociodemographic and professional characteristics were selected as covariates due to their pos-sible relationship with HCW resilience and/or burnout (Dyrbye et al., 2007, 2017; Shanafelt et al., 2012, 2019; Templeton et al., 2019; Walsh, 2013). The full multivariable model for emotional thriving/recovery included all five well-being behaviors and ten covariates. An iterative backward 4 Western Journal of Nursing Research 00(0) elimination approach was used to reduce each full model to a final parsimonious model that included the five well-being behaviors and only those covariates significant at the p .05 level. The aforementioned bivariate and covariate-adjusted approach was also applied when evaluating the relationship of total number of well-being behaviors with emotional thriving and emotional recovery. The a priori power calculation indicated that the sample size of 2,383 would provide at least 80% statistical power to detect an association of each well-being behaviors or total number of well-being behaviors with emotional thriving and emotional recovery using a GLM adjusting for ten covari-ates, assuming small effect sizes (eta squared of 0.01) and significance set at p .05 for each two-tailed test. Results Sample Characteristics Table 1 summarizes the characteristics for the 2,383 HCWs. The sample was primarily female (82.3%), White (87%), and non-Hispanic/non-Latinx (94.8%). Most were nurses (31.9%) and physicians (20.9%), and most reported working 8-hour shifts (39%), followed by 12-hour shifts (28.4%). The category of total years professional experience with the high-est percentage was 21 or more years (35.2%) while the cate-gory of years in current position with the highest percentage was 1 to 4 years (37.8%). HCWs worked in a variety of departments including pediatrics (13.5%), critical care medi-cine (8.9%), emergency medicine (7.3%), or in the other cat-egory (54.9%). HCWs primarily worked in the inpatient setting (48.8%) followed by those that reported working in the outpatient setting (31.7%). Well-being Behaviors and Resilience Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of well-being behav-iors and resilience scores among HCWs. The most common types of well-being behaviors HCWs reported engaging in over the last month was spending time with a close friend (65.5%) and exercise (52%) followed by vacation (32.7%), meditation (24.3%), and yoga (14.9%). On average, partici-pants reported engaging in 1.9 of the five well-being behav-iors. The mean score for the emotional thriving and emotional recovery subscales were both 3.7, with each subscale score ranging from 1 to 5. In addition to the five well-being behav-iors (regular exercise, yoga, meditation, spent time with a close friend, vacation), participants provided open-ended responses for engaging in other activities related to well-being. HCWs often mentioned variations of the five well-being behavior options including, \"time with family,\" \"a day off,\" \"not really vacation,\" or qualifying the type or amount of self-reported exercise, e.g., \"walking\" or \"intermittent exercise.\" Additionally, journaling\" were included in the responses.

The bivariate results in Table 3 indicate that each of the five types of well-being behaviors were significantly related to emotional thriving (all p .0015), with those who reported each behavior having significantly higher mean emotional thriving scores when compared to those who did not report the behavior. In contrast, three of the five well-being behaviors were significantly related to emotional recovery. Well-being behaviors associated with higher mean emotional recovery scores were exercise (p < .0001), meditation (p = .0015), and spending time with a close friend (p = .0008). Engaging in more well-being behaviors was also significantly related to better emotional thriving and emotional recovery (p < .0001). Well-being Behaviors and Resilience: Multivariable Models The final parsimonious models are presented in Tables 4 and 5. These final models that included all well-being behaviors controlling for significant covariates indicated that each type of well-being behavior was significantly related to greater emotional thriving (all p .0273). Only two of the five behaviors (exercise and spent time with a close friend) were significantly associated with greater emotional recovery (both p .0034). Additionally, reported engagement in more well-being behaviors continued to be associated with better emotional thriving and emotional recovery (p < .0001). For the statistically significant results, the partial eta squared values addressing clinical relevance indicated small effect sizes ( 2 of 0.0018 to 0.0262). The following sociodemographic and professional characteristics were significant covariates at the 0.05 level in one or more final models. Sex was a significant covari-ate in all final models, with females having significantly lower mean emotional thriving and emotional recovery scores than males. On average, White HCWs had both a significantly lower mean emotional recovery score than Black/African Americans and significantly lower mean emotional thriving and emotional recovery scores than other minorities (Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, American Indian, and Alaska Native). Black/African Americans and other minorities did not differ on the resilience measures. HCW role was significantly asso-ciated with emotional recovery where physicians had lower mean emotional recovery scores than nurses and those in the other category that comprised students, other managers, environmental support, administrative support, and other. HCWs with more years of professional experience tended to have significantly higher mean emotional thriv-ing and emotional recovery scores compared to those with less experience. Specifically, those with 11-20 and 21 or more years of professional experience had significantly higher emotional thriving scores than those with 5-10 years' experience. HCWs with 21 or more years of experi-ence had significantly greater emotional recovery scores than those with less experience. Those with 5-10 and 11-20 years' experience had significantly greater emotional recovery scores than those with four or fewer years' experi-ence. Results for years in current position differed from overall experience in that those with less than one year in their current position had significantly higher mean emo-tional thriving and emotional recovery scores than those with increasingly more years in current position. One exception was noted where those with the most time in their current position (21 or more years) did not differ signifi-cantly in emotional thriving levels from those with less than one year in their current position. Those with most time in their current position (21 or more years) also had significantly higher emotional thriving score than those with 5-10 years of experience. Finally, the covariate results showed that inpatient respondents did not differ signifi-cantly from those working in an outpatient setting for emo-tional thriving and emotional recovery.Table 2.

All well-being behaviors were significantly asso-ciated with emotional thriving, whereas only exercise and time with a close friend were related to emotional recovery. HCW role was significantly associated with emotional recovery where physicians had lower mean emotional recov-ery scores than nurses. In addition, HCW sex, race, and expe-rience were associated with resilience. Our findings were similar to other studies that assessed well-being behaviors. For instance, Shanafelt et al. (2012), reported that exercise, time with friends or family, and vaca-tions were related with either lower burnout or higher quality of life among U.S. surgeons. Other studies have similarly reported on the benefits of exercise (Guo et al., 2018) and close relationships (Rippstein-Leuenberger et al., 2017) among HCWs as it relates to improving resilience or burn-out. As exercise and time with a close friend are well-being behaviors that usually occur at an individual's own volition, these findings suggest that there might be particular strate-gies HCWs can engage in to promote their own emotional recovery. Alternatively, focusing on any of the five well-being behaviors investigated in this study, and optimally more than one, could also be a way to enhance emotional thriving. In contrast to other literature that suggests medita-tion was not beneficial as a well-being behavior (Lebensohn et al., 2013; Shanafelt et al., 2012), this study found that those who reported engaging in meditation over the last month were significantly related to higher emotional thriv-ing. The difference in findings is possibly due to measuring the use of meditation among one type of HCW rather than across a variety of HCW disciplines (Lebensohn et al., 2013; Shanafelt et al., 2012). Additionally, and similar to our study, the frequency and duration of a meditation practice was not measured (Lebensohn et al., 2013). Additional research is needed to determine how the frequency and duration of med-itation practice relate to emotional thriving and emotional recovery. We recognize that burnout and resilience are not simply opposites of one another given previous findings that those with burnout can also exhibit high resilience (West et al., 2020). However, the research on burnout and associated characteristics among HCWs is robust and worth examining as we assess our findings related to resilience. Similar to the burnout literature that shows HCW sex is related to burnout, with women reporting higher burnout (Shanafelt et al., 2016, 2019), the present study showed HCW sex is related to resil-ience. We found that women reported significantly lower emotional thriving and emotional recovery scores than men. Our findings also contribute to the literature by showing HCW race is related to resilience with Black HCWs report-ing higher emotional thriving and emotional recovery scores compared to White HCWs. These findings are similar to the burnout literature that shows Black HCWs have lower burn-out (Dyrbye et al., 2007; Maslach, 1982/2003). Cohesion among family and friends in the black community and the adversities and challenges minorities experience compared to their White counterparts may partially explain this finding (Dyrbye et al., 2007). However, the relationship between the quality and quantity of time spent with friends or family and their relationship with resilience are unclear. Research demonstrates that a higher percentage of physi- cians report burnout (44%) (Shanafelt et al., 2019) than do nurses (35%) (Dyrbye et al., 2019). When comparing physi-cians and nurses in the same sample, the present study showed physicians reported significantly lower emotional Table 5.

This finding warrants further investigation to ascertain what factors are driving physicians' lower reported emotional recovery scores in comparison to nursing colleagues. Future research should also assess the implications for nurses who work with physicians who have lower emotional recovery. Evidence has shown that HCWs reporting personal burnout is related to also reporting their colleagues as burned out (Schwartz et al., 2019; Sexton et al., 2018) thus calling to question the level of contagion that exists with burnout among HCWs working in an interprofes-sional environment. (Schwartz et al., 2019). Understanding how lower and alternatively high levels of resilience may similarly translate across nurses and other members of the interprofessional team in the HCW environment is needed. Similar to the burnout literature where physicians had higher burnout scores in their middle career years (Dyrbye et al., 2013), HCWs in our sample reported higher emotional thriving scores later in their career (11-20 years and 21 or more years of professional experience) compared to the 5-10-year range. However, having <1 year in current posi- tion was associated with higher emotional thriving scores than all other years with exception to those with 21 or more years and higher emotional recovery scores than all other years. This unique finding suggests that HCWs enter their position with a full tank of emotional thriving and emotional recovery and within one-year scores begin to significantly drop. Thus, it is not surprising that a report on nurse reten-tion and staffing found nearly half of nurses who left their position in 2019 had less than two years of experience (Nursing Solutions, Inc., 2020). Similarly, a little more than half of all health care employees with less than two years' experience reported leaving their position (Nursing Solutions, Inc., 2020). Our effect sizes ranging from 2 of 0.0018 to 0.0262 can be referenced with Cohen's standard of small (0.01), medium (0.06), and large (0.14) effect sizes (Cohen, 1969, as cited in Richardson, 2011). Although statistically signifi-cant relationships between well-being behaviors and resil-ience were demonstrated, small effects were found. These small effect sizes were viewed as clinically meaningful, particularly as we consider individual level strategies to be only one part of enhancing resilience (e.g., system level strategies being another important component to supporting resilience). While many recent studies report on particular HCW well-being behaviors in relation to resilience or burnout (Adair et al., 2020a; Alexander et al., 2015; Gauthier et al., 2015; Goodman & Schorling, 2005, 2012; Thompson et al., 2016; van der Riet et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; West et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018), limited research has been con-ducted on the association between the total number of well-being behaviors and resilience among HCWs. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence that engaging in more well-being behaviors is associated with increased emotional thriving and emotional recovery, which are domains of resilience. Given that resilience is consid-ered to be something that all have access to and can be enhanced (APA, 2020), this new knowledge could be used to inform development of interventions designed to increase HCW resilience as a strategy to alleviate burnout. Future research could assess the effectiveness of HCWs enhancing their current well-being practices, rather than adding new unfamiliar practices (Rehder et al., in press). For instance, in HCWs who already engage in exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends, studies could assess the effects on increasing time or intensity spent on existing well-being practices as it relates to resilience. Given the concept of job demands, including high workloads among HCWs (NASEM, 2019), it may be more prudent to strengthen existing prac-tices rather than adding new practices to an already demand-ing workload, work hours, particularly for nurses working 12-hour shifts, and in the setting of already strained health care organization budgets. Interventions of this nature are especially needed nationwide due to reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and distress among HCWs during the COVID-19 response (Lai et al., 2020). The NAM, leading organization for the Action Collaborative on Clinician Well-being and Resilience, describes HCWs current experience with already high rates of burnout rate as \"a surge of physical and emotional harm that amounts to a parallel pandemic\" (Dzau et al., 2020, p. 1). Importantly, leaders of the NAM collaborative recommend that health care organizations infuse resources into existing well-being programs as an immediate top priority (Dzau et al., 2020). Existing pro-grams that focus on these well-being behaviors could get more value through increased emotional thriving and emo-tional recovery. Given these findings, health care organizations may wish to consider implementing strategies to promote particular types of well-being behaviors in the work environment with the goal of improving resilience. More specifically, organi-zations could integrate \"bite-sized\" well-being practices, ideally more than one, into existing work tasks to encourage HCWs to engage in well-being behaviors in a way that feasi-bly fits with their busy work life (Adair et al., 2020a). For instance, writing a gratitude letter (Adair et al., 2020b), teaching HCWs to engage in moments of mindfulness before the start of a meeting or huddle, walking meetings, and com-petitions designed to increase physical activity at work are a few ways to encourage well-being activities while acknowl-edging that busy HCWs do not need \"one more thing\" added on top of their busy work lives. Additionally, national orga-nizations such as the American Nurses Association have new well-being initiatives with online tools supporting social connection and goal setting for well-being activities such as exercise and mindfulness (American Nurses Association Rink et al. 9 Enterprise, 2020). Similarly, the NAM provides practical strategies to support well-being behaviors that relate to our findings such as taking breaks, when feasible, to exercise and engage in breathing practices that are akin to meditation and connecting with others for social support (NAM, 2020). Some units have established a social committee, driven by the HCWs themselves, to plan social events both inside and outside of the workplace. As findings showed resilience var - ied by HCW sex, race, role, and experience, interventions may need to be tailored to address the unique characteristics of participants. Finally, educators could incorporate informa-tion on engaging in well-being behaviors in prelicensure HCW curriculums and in continuing education in clinical settings (Chappel et al., 2018). Integrating ways to promote resilience is important as HCWs navigate the stress of caring for patients, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Strengths of this study include a large sample size, robust set of covariates, use of a multivariable approach in assess-ing resilience, and a brief resilience metric that is responsive to interventions. Another strength of this study was the inclu-sion of different shift lengths; however, most of our sample reported working 8 hours followed by 12 hours. While lon-ger shifts (12 hours or greater) have been linked to burnout in hospital nurses (Dall'Ora et al., 2015), less is known about various shift lengths and work settings with resilience. Relatedly, the sample included all HCWs with resilience data who completed the baseline survey which allowed us to look broadly across HCWs, including those who reported work-ing in the inpatient setting, outpatient setting, and those that selected not-applicable. We felt that broadly looking across all HCWs, inclusive of various work hours and work settings was an important first step in assessing well-being behaviors and resilience. However, this study is not without limitations. First, the correlational design limits our ability to make causal inferences between well-being behaviors and resil-ience. Nevertheless, our findings provide foundational knowledge on the relationship between well-being behaviors and resilience. We also assessed well-being behaviors based on reports of whether the HCW had engaged in them over the last month. We have no way of knowing the frequency and duration of engaging in these behaviors, as research has demonstrated a dosing effect in terms of outcomes being enhanced with more meditation practice as an example (Goleman & Davidson, 2017). Understanding the amount of time engaged in well-being behaviors may also elucidate the small effect sizes in our sample. Despite this limitation, understanding the well-being behaviors that HCWs have reported in the last month was sufficient in providing foun-dational knowledge, conveying a significant relationship with well-being behaviors and emotional thriving and emo-tional recovery. Future research should focus on refining and validating brief well-being interventions for HCWs with an assessment on effects of the intervention on resilience levels and patient outcomes. Research should explore optimal dosing of well-being behaviors, and also assess why different groups of HCWs are experiencing varying levels of resilience. This knowledge can inform institutions in modifying work envi-ronments and policies to prevent and reduce burnout in HCWs, including in vulnerable groups. Additionally, while research has demonstrated that those with high resilience have lower levels of burnout (Adair et al., 2020a; Guo et al., 2018); recent evidence has also found that physicians with top resilience scores also report burnout (West et al., 2020). It is unknown whether this relationship also occurs in nurses. Future research should assess the various ways in which resilience and burnout occur with one another for nurses. This information will inform possible interventions designed to prevent burnout or enhance resilience. Engaging in particular well-being behaviors and increas- ing the total number of behaviors is a promising strategy for increasing resilience. Given the high levels of HCW burnout (Dyrbye et al., 2019; Shanafelt et al., 2019) and current pan-demic, well-being strategies to enhance resilience are impor - tant for further exploration.
