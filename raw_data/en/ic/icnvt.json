There are many people and organizations in the Global South, Canada and elsewhere that are working to improve the health of women and children. This summer, while working in central Kenya, in Nyeri county, I was privileged to work with many heros and sheros who bring hope and care to communities in rural and underserved areas. It was incredibly inspiring to witness the work of volunteer community members who brought compassion and caring to children and families living with HIV. Many mothers around me had adopted children whose mothers had died in childbirth or from HIV. Local, neighborhood solutions are so powerful. The organization with which I did some work, Vision Gardens, is entirely run by volunteers, except for their one paid staff. They work tirelessly to show kindness, lend an ear and make real and significant changes in peoples' lives. I was told about a young man, who had lost his parents and only lived with his sister, was ready to commit suicide because his uncle had denied him the right to perform a traditional ceremony. Volunteers spoke to the uncle and convinced him to agree to the ceremony. Then when they learned more about the lives of the children, one of the volunteers adopted both siblings. I met one of the siblings, who many years later, has a full life. I had the opportunity to do some training with Vision Gardens and found the volunteers to be full of laughter and humility. I am filled with hope when I meet people who are so highly motivated to bring about a better world. We hope you enjoy this time of harvest and thanksgiving. -Dr. Farah Shroff (MIH Can founder) | | | | Maternal and Infant Health Canada is very appreciative of the kind act bestowed upon us by [ ReThink Canada](http://rethinkcanada.com/us/) , the amazing Vancouver based creative agency that gave us our new logo. Mitch McKarney and Hans Theissen were the two gracious talents behind the design. We'd like to thank them and the others at ReThink! for this lovely flower image. They thought carefully about the work that we do, to improve the lives of women, children and communities here and abroad. The inner flower is the child and the middle flower is the mother with the larger flower representing the community. For us, the logo really speaks to the beauty of all flowers blossoming, like we hope that all people have the opportunity to shine and be truly well. | | | | Our webinar educational session are now well on their way! Dr. Emilie Salomons provided a well received lecture via webinar on May 23, 2018. The topic, 'An Introduction to Acupuncture and Acupressure for Pregnancy and Childbirth', explored the history and modern research on Chinese medicine and it's role in supporting pregnancy and childbirth. Dr. Brenda Leung will be presenting a webinar on Applied Research Methods for Naturopathic Medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine, and other Traditional Holistic Practices, December 15th, 2018.

We look forward to many more. February: MIH Can co sponsored an event during which Drs Shroff and Ansari spoke about women's health in Canada and the Global South. March: Drs Ansari and Ezegbeh, represented MIH Can at the South Asia Conference of the Pacific Northwest (SACPAN), during which they presented a talk on maternal and child health. November: Drs Hamideh Bayrampour and Duncan Etches gave an innovative lecture, Getting to health: Here and Abroad at UBC on November 5th, 2018. Dr. Bayrampour discussed her novel research on maternal mental health, exposing barriers that preclude better screening and ultimately better well-being for pregnant women; while Dr. Etches spoke about the health impacts of climate change and environmental degradation and urged us all to take political action to spurn better health. | | | | In March, Dr. Shroff went to India and was able to meet with many of the MIH Can partners, including, MASUM, Pune University, and CHETNA. She was also able to visit areas where these amazing organizations were working, and connected with the women and children supported by the groups. Representing MIH Can, Dr. Shroff provided several lectures and workshops for CHETNA and the public health institute, including a maternal health workshop for some of the most effected women and children, in what CHETNA described as a 'rural slum' in Ahmedabad. Dr. Farah Shroff during a CHETNA organized maternal health workshop | | | |[Women Deliver Update ](https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=3588f30a976094e085bd89202&id=df1f552ac1#Women%20Deliver%20Update) Did you know that Women Deliver, the global conference, is coming to Vancouver in 2019 - June 3-6th? Its purpose is not simply a conference but also to leave a legacy in the country selected for the conference. The conference was launched by the Honourable Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister, in October 2017 at the Vancouver Convention Centre where the Women Deliver conference will take place. There is a Canadian mobilization across all sectors and as a representative of the CanWACH Board, I was honoured to attend a round table with Minster Bibeau on August 21st 2018 where several key BC stakeholders in the cross-sector mobilization were present to share their planned activities, including two Olympic champions and the president of our BC Women's Foundation, Genesa Greening, who is chairing the mobilization group. CanWACH is the umbrella for the Canadian mobilization for Women Deliver. Dr. Jan Christilaw, known to many of you, has been the initiator of a pre-Women Deliver conference on global Indigenous Women's Health a with our own indigenous leaders taking on the role of sharing this conference to create a legacy for Canada's indigenous women. Dr. Lori Brotto, the Executive Director of the Women's Health Research Institute was also present at the round table and the annual WHRI symposium has been scheduled the Friday before the main Women Deliver conference and will include global women's health researchers. In terms of MIHCan, I encourage you to explore the website and consider attending because the networking opportunities in terms of the global community is wonderful and MIHCan will fit right in. We are still in time to submit an abstract about MIHCan's work. [https://wd2019.org](https://wd2019.org/) Also, UBC has a Women Deliver website and a very excited community and there are opportunities for some small grant funding for events leading up to Women Deliver. [https://events.ubc.ca/women-deliver-2019/](https://events.ubc.ca/women-deliver-2019/) Lots of opportunity and I will keep you posted as things evolve.Regards, Dr. Dorothy Shaw | | | | CHETNA's approach to health embraces the life cycle of gender equity and human rights within the wide cultural, economic and political environment. It recognises the needs of children, youth and women at the critical stages of life viz. Children (0-10 years), Adolescents and Youth (11-24 years) and Women (25+) Over the years, women's health needs have been addressed through maternal and child health programmes, focusing primarily on narrow aspect of their lives. With new knowledge and changing perspectives, women's health is now being viewed holistically - as a continuum of care that starts before birth and progresses cumulatively through childhood and adolescence to adulthood and old age. This lifecycle approach extends beyond women's reproductive role to encompass women's health at every stage and in every aspect of their lives. Through this approach, other health issues affecting women that were previously overlooked, or thought not to exist, have become more apparent. Henceforth, the determinants and responses to women's health profile must consider all factors -and not only biological ones- such as the economic, social and cultural factors that affect their status, as well as gender relations between women and men. There is therefore a need for a new paradigm shift. This shift in perspectives will bring into focus the gender dimension in women's health. | | | |[A Word From MIH Can's Ambassador of Advancement](https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=3588f30a976094e085bd89202&id=df1f552ac1#A%20Word%20from%20MIH%20Can's%20Ambassador%20of%20Advancement) I learnt about MIH Can last year and its vision touched me deeply. I had been to India as few years before and saw firsthand how poverty effects the masses; especially women and children. I kept thinking how blessed my life has been and wondered what I could do to help, especially with fundraising. MIH Can resonated with me because they go into rural areas and work together with the local people to support, educate and ultimately empower them. In my opinion, MIH Can brings people together and addresses the health and cultural needs of the community. When my father was Chancellor of UBC, he encouraged projects like this\u2014reaching out across borders to share knowledge for wellbeing. Robyn Wyman | | | | We are a group of students mainly in the faculty of arts at UBC who are volunteering for MIH Can because we would like to do our part to alleviate some of the disparities that exist in global health. We chose MIH Can to volunteer with because many of us come from the Global South and have seen the tragic lost of life that is largely related to poverty. We want to be part of the solution in our discipline we study the larger causes that lead to the suffering and death of women and children. MIH Can has given us a tangible vehicle that helps us articulate the issues. In this photo, we are missing Tanaz, who is a political science graduate from UBC who has been working with MIH Can for over a year. Like us, she is also passionate about the global work that MIH Can facilitates and loves meeting with potential partners in the health-care field. We'd like to thank MIH Can's Director of Philanthropy, Shirley Ross, for all her guidance.
