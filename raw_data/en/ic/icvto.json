But a meme is spreading the falsehood that those who eat meat from vaccinated animals will get \"VAXXED\" by consuming the meat. That simply isn't possible, according to immunologists. Full Story We've already explained why some [earlier](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-covid-19-vaccines-spike-protein-only-get-into-those-who-receive-it-no-shedding/) [claims](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/post-misleads-on-japans-policy-for-donating-blood-after-covid-19-vaccination/) about COVID-19 vaccine transfer were false. But a new claim has emerged on The meme was first shared by an account that is selling a [book](https://web.archive.org/web/20210713150317if_/https://www.aboriginalmedicalassociation.com/store/p131/The_Rona_Shot-_A_Scientific_Discussion.html#/) titled \"Detoxing The Rona Shot,\" which is based on the false [claim](https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/DetoxingTheRonaShot.jpg) that the COVID-19 vaccines \"put nano magnetic gene computers in everyone.\" We've already [addressed](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/conspiracy-theory-misinterprets-goals-of-gates-foundation/) [several](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/covid-19-vaccines-dont-have-patient-tracking-devices/) [other](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-magnet-videos-refuel-bogus-claim-of-vaccine-microchips/) [claims](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-spoof-video-furthers-microchip-conspiracy-theory/) about microchips in the vaccines. The recent meme claims, \"IF YOU ARE EATING FARM RAISED MEAT THE ANIMALS ARE BEING VAXXED SO U R VAXXED.\" The account that posted it [wrote](https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/MeatMeme.jpg) in the comments, \"In their mind they are protecting animals from a deadly disease. Animals get the alleged covid too. Vaccinating them is just protection.\" First of all, livestock isn't being vaccinated against COVID-19. \"It's simply not happening,\" [Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi](https://vbs.psu.edu/directory/svk11), a clinical professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences, said in a phone interview. He knew of no countries that were vaccinating livestock for COVID-19. In the U.S., there are no COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in livestock and there are no federal recommendations that livestock should be vaccinated against COVID-19, Lyndsay Cole, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, told us in an email. APHIS [regulates](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/veterinary-biologics/!ut/p/z1/rVLLboMwEPyaHtHaQHgcSYpC2jSV8sYXy2AIrggm4JD272tyTJWX1L1Ya82sZncGCGyBVKwTO6aErFip-5g4dIZHY-TZeDoOXzEKIn_yHrkOGvs2bM6A6ac9wsMF0m84REE4dz_CcGIibAF5jr-OHM1frpYzDw8nvvkYH12pAD3GvwEgt8evgQBJK1WrAmJWF6KlqaxUVilaiqRhzc8LahmVx4bmMj22545VYs9KWmSsVMX5p8sUTYQs5U6kbT-yTgWHmPt84HDLM5zE5IaNEtdILM4NL7eSzLHz1MUmvN3bUZsovg4HEmilvbZvBdv_krrpxd5IwNy8A-gjcgH4m4F7LsTaRff6CVzYdCI7waqSjd4GFk9eOEJQ71e69p41KLs6nHunZb77Bc1OEPE!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/?urile=wcm%3Apath%3A%2Faphis_content_library%2Fsa_our_focus%2Fsa_animal_health%2Fsa_vet_biologics) veterinary vaccines in the U.S., and it [put out a call](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_biologics/publications/notice20-12.pdf) in November for COVID-19 vaccines that could be used in mink. Outbreaks of the disease on mink farms had been reported in [multiple countries](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html) last year, [including the U.S.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/thousands-minks-die-covid-19-utah-farms-n1242754), which caused concern since mink could act as a [reservoir](https://www.oie.int/en/oie-statement-on-covid-19-and-mink/) for the virus to [mutate](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03218-z) and then be [passed back to humans](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/early/2020/11/09/science.abe5901.full.pdf) as a new variant. In contrast to mink, which the [World Organisation for Animal Health](https://www.oie.int/en/who-we-are/mission/) [lists](https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/05/en-factsheet-sars-cov-2.pdf) as highly susceptible to the virus that causes COVID-19, two of the major types of livestock in the U.S. \u2014 cattle and hogs \u2014 are listed as having \"extremely low\" susceptibility. Poultry is listed as having no susceptibility. The virus' effect on animals [continues to be studied](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html), but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently [says](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html#anchor_1616624711473) that the risk of spread from most animals is low. Following APHIS' request in November, at least two U.S. companies \u2014 [Zoetis](https://www.zoetis.com/about-us/index.aspx) and [Medgene Labs ](https://www.medgenelabs.com/)\u2014 began developing vaccines that could be used in mink. Zoetis [announced](https://news.zoetis.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Zoetis-Donates-COVID-19-Vaccines-to-Help-Support-the-Health-of-Zoo-Animals/default.aspx) on July 2 that its vaccine had been authorized for experimental use on a case-by-case basis for various animals in some zoos and sanctuaries. The vaccine has not been fully licensed and is not commercially available, company spokeswoman Christina Lood told us in a phone interview. Medgene is still in the development phase of its vaccine, company spokesman Jason Melby told us in a phone interview. Both companies are pursuing a subunit [type of vaccine](https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html), Lood and Melby said. That [means](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/what-are-protein-subunit-vaccines-and-how-could-they-be-used-against-covid-19) that the vaccines are introducing a small, [inactive](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained) piece of the virus that causes COVID-19 in order to trigger an immune response in the recipient. Russia also has [reportedly](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/russia-produces-first-batch-covid-19-vaccine-animals-regulator-2021-04-30/) developed a COVID-19 vaccine for animals, which was tested on dogs, cats, foxes and mink. It's also worth noting that, according to a list of COVID-19 policies on the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](http://fapda.apps.fao.org/fapda/#main.html) website, no countries have implemented programs to vaccinate livestock against COVID-19. Vaccines Aren't Transferred Through Meat Beyond the fact that livestock and poultry aren't getting the COVID-19 vaccine, experts we spoke to said that it wouldn't be possible for the vaccine to be transmitted through consumption of meat, anyway. \"These animals have always been given a lot of vaccines,\" Kuchipudi said, and none of them pass on to those who eat the resulting meat. \"That's not how they transfer,\" he said. That would be true for subunit vaccines, like the ones Zoetis and Medgene are developing, and for the mRNA vaccines that account for the [majority of shots administered](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) to people in the U.S., he said. The meme doesn't specify which type of vaccine is supposedly being administered to livestock. \"It just simply can't happen,\" [John Wherry](https://www.med.upenn.edu/wherrylab/), chair of the department of systems pharmacology and translational therapeutics and director of the University of Pennsylvania's Institute for Immunology at the Perelman School of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. \"It doesn't work that way.\" Referring to the messenger RNA vaccines from [Moderna](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/a-guide-to-modernas-covid-19-vaccine/) and [Pfizer](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/a-guide-to-pfizer-biontechs-covid-19-vaccine/), Wherry explained that once the mRNA gets into a cell, it doesn't propagate any further \u2014 meaning it doesn't spread from one cell to another. And as we've [explained before](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-idaho-doctor-makes-baseless-claims-about-safety-of-covid-19-vaccines/), the mRNA passes on instructions to make antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19, then is quickly broken down and leaves the body. \"Even if you ate\" the vaccine, Wherry said, it wouldn't work. It would be doubly impossible to get the vaccine from meat, he said, since cooking it would inactivate the RNA. [Gary Whittaker](https://www.vet.cornell.edu/research/faculty/gary-whittaker-phd), professor of virology at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, agreed. He told us in an email that, in his view, it would be impossible for an mRNA vaccine to be transmitted through meat consumption. \"The RNA is just too unstable to survive - hence the need for all the freezers for the vaccine,\" he wrote. Addressing how other [types of vaccines](https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html) may behave if they were given to livestock, Whittaker wrote, \"An adenovirus-vaccine (J+J/AstraZeneca) would be more stable, but still extremely unlikely to survive processing. A live attenuated-vaccine (not currently used) could theoretically survive, at least until the meat is cooked - but in this case there are way bigger risks associated with eating raw meat!\" Although COVID-19 vaccines aren't being given to livestock, as Penn State's Kuchipudi said, a number of vaccines are commonly given to poultry and livestock for other viruses. And there are already [rules](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergency_management/downloads/ed_materials/vac_overview_handout.pdf) in place for how much time must pass between when a vaccine is given and when an animal is slaughtered, often [referred](https://www.bqa.org/Media/BQA/Docs/bqa_field-_guide.pdf) to as the withdrawal time. This withdrawal period \"ensures the end product is safe for consumption and no medication would be present in the beef,\" the National Cattlemen's Beef Association [explained](https://www.ncba.org/CMDocs/BeefUSA/Publications/COVID-19%20Talking%20Points_032720-07.pdf) in a Q&A at the beginning of the pandemic. Simply put, the claim that vaccines can be transferred by eating meat \"doesn't make any scientific sense,\" Wherry said.
