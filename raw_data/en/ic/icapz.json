Risk registers are however a live document and will be regularly discussed at D irectorate Management Teams. 2.0 Strategic Risk Register - Monitoring Summary 2.1 Attac hed to this report at Appendix B is the updated strategic risk r egister. The register offers additional information including detail on Key Controls and Sources of Assurance and how progress against mitigation will be measured. 3.0 Strategic Risk Register 3.1 During this review of the strategic risk register there have been three risks removed and one new risk added, bringi ng the to tal strategic risks managed to 20 . The new risk relate s to the viability of commercial bus operators with patronage not yet back to pre -Covid levels and the ending of Government Bus Recovery Grant in October (number 15 in table two). This amber risk has been scored as 'almost certain' to happen and a 'moderate risk' to the operation of the council. The three risks removed from the strategic register were: The Council is unable to fulfil its legal obligations regarding the safety of its citizens and service recipients . Staff resilience to causative factors of stress variable resulting in the primary reason for short and long term absences being due to stress / psychological factors; reduced morale, loss of prod uctivity with impact on delivery. (Moved to operational risk) Departure from EU single market with The Trade and Cooperation Agreement could further decreases city economic output . In total there are five red risks . These are shown below; Risk Number one in table one relates to the Council's expenditure exceeds the resources available to meet that expenditure within the medium term financial plan period . Risk number two in table one relates to possible f ailure to meet statutory duties due to growing volume and complexity of demand for children's social care services. Risk number three in table one relates to the potential for a cyber -attack to render all of the Council's IT inaccessible for an extended period of time therefore impacting on the Councils ability to deliver services. Risk number four in table one relates to IT supply chain constraints results in increased costs and extended lead times for equipment. This will lead to budget pressures for the Council plus Service delivery pressu res as new and replacement IT equipment experiences considerable delays. Risk number five in table two relates to workforce concerns and the growing fragility of the Adult Social Care Market that might lead to the inability of the Local Authority to meet statutory duties and meet eligible need. Risk number six in table two relating to insufficient economic performance to sustain the City's economy and growth plans.PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL 3.2 Strategic Risk updat e table one Table one p rovides an update on strategic risks with mitigation that is fully influenced by Plymouth City Council, this is 11 of the 20 risks on the strategic risk register Table one - Strategic Risks fully mitigated by Plymouth City Council Risk Register No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Previous risk rating Current risk rating Risk Owner 1 The Council's expenditure exceeds the resources available to meet that expenditure within the medium term financial plan period (2022/23 -2025/26) The Council has also taken the following steps (1) to adopt a 5 year MTFP moving forward rather than a 1 year or 3 year model (2) to adopt a system of monthly financial reporting to Directorate Management Teams, Corporate Management Team, and Cabinet and Quarterly to Full Council, with monthly consideration of directorate level financial issues at each Scrutiny Committee In add ition the Council has introduced a system of detailed monitoring of the delivery of savings targets so that a view is published monthly in Cabinet reports. This will also include any significant issues which emerge from the cost of living crisis. The Coun cil also holds an annual review of fees and charges and has annual and ongoing programmes of work to identify and understand potential savings opportunities. The governance system of the Council - as unpacked in the Annual Governance Statement comprise a rigorous system of financial control. It is of critical importance to the Council and City that CMT and Cabinet select means of reducing the costs of the Council to fully mitigate the forecast budget shortfalls in future years. 25 Red Red since May 2022 Red David Northey PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL Risk Register No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Previous risk rating Current risk rating Risk Owner At the Cabinet meeting of the 10 November 2022 , councillors received an update on progress on the development of the 2023/24 budget, and to seek support of Cabinet for the savings propo sals developed to date.

The risk to economic performance is a combination of the ongoing impacts of the long term impacts of Covid 19, inflation (including materials), the war in Ukraine, cost of living crisis on b oth individuals and businesses and general uncertainty in many sectors. Some of the long -term effects (especially without effective policy instruments) are likely to carry on later in to 2022 and beyond. The impact of COVID -19 on the economy has been sharp and has affected different sectors of the economy in different ways. Our strong emergency action plan response \"Resurgam\" has now transitioned to Business As Usual (BAU) activity. Alongside this we are seeking to maximise all o pportunities to secure additional funding for economic initiatives including focussing on creating new jobs in the Blue and green economy. The initiatives include: The Plymouth and South Devon Freeport, National Marine Park, Levelling up bids and City Cent re Investment Zones. We will continue to maximise all funding opportunities for our city region. 20 Amber Red Anthony Payne 7 Ongoing COVID -19 rates (with potential for further peaks) affect city's recovery / reset plans. The key mitigation of vaccination has now reached around 85% (one or more doses) of those eligible. There have been reductions in the mitigations (reduced testing, support payments and legal need for self -isolation) and this has created uncertainty around case rates and the risk of delayed detection of new variants. The longstanding advice to the general public remains in place and is re -emphasised at regular intervals. 16 Amber Amber Ruth Harrell PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Previous risk rating Current risk rating Risk Owner 8 Failure to reduce Health Inequalities will mean our poorest residents continue to live shorter lives as well as more years in ill health. Mounting evidence that COVID -19 is having differential health impacts across communities, adding to existing health inequalities. This is through either the dise ase itself or the mitigations put in place. There is an ongoing impact of this due to the economic downturn. The primary role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to try to manage COVID - 19 in the city, therefore protecting most depri ved communities from further negative impacts. Persistent action across the Council is required at many levels to tackle inequalities by addressing the wider detriments of health. The Public Health Team and partners continue to work with employers (year o ne focus) and schools (year two focus) to influence healthier lifestyles. The team continues to embed and promote the national One You campaign across the city. The 'five ways to wellbeing' has been adopted across the City as the single approach to improvi ng mental wellbeing. The work that started in year five on 'people connecting through food' is ongoing with a number of new initiatives developed. The intention was that the year six focus would be arts, culture, heritage and health (using the Mayflower 4 00 commemorations as the vehicle for delivery). However, this year was curtailed as a result of the pandemic and a two year pause was put on the programme. Subsequently, Thrive Plymouth Year seven was launched in May 2022 with a focus on Listening and Rec onnecting. There is a need to reflect on our experiences and acknowledge what we have been through. Though there has been much trauma, we believe that there have also been some positives which we want to help the city to build on and apply to the wider ch allenges of inequality. Evidence has been provided to the Health and Wellbeing Board on the risk of widening health inequalities which partners are working together to try to mitigate. The Local Care Partnership priorities are being refreshed and includes tackling inequalities. Both of these routes bring partners together to understand the issues and the steps needed to tackle health inequalities in the City. In addition to this, to support the work of the Council's cross -party Child Poverty Action Plan Working Group, a high level review of the evidence of the impacts of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of children and young people has been carried out. As already stated, the primary role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to 16 Amber Amber Ruth Harrell PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Previous risk rating Current risk rating Risk Owner minimise the impact of COVID -19 in the city therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts. 10 Adult Social Care (ASC) Reforms - There are a number of reforms to ASC that will create financial uncertainty in terms of being able to accurately understand the cost and resources impact once reforms have been implemented. It is not clear whether any additional monies will be made available for local authorities and there is currently no rel iable way of forecasting impact. Examples of reforms include; Fair cost of care Charging reforms Local Protection Safeguards Care Quality Commission Assurance programme This risk will continue to be monitored closely as the reform programme progresses. We will assess the impact of charging reforms on 'trailblazer' local authorities who are early adopters of these reforms. We will continue cost of care exercises locally, including working with our local care market to better understand impact on finance and resources. We will continue engagement with Local Government Agency and regional and national groups (such as ADASS) to determine approach to managing all reforms. We will continue to seek to understand impacts of all reforms through our established reform programmes, and will consider potential use of Offers and Asks due to cost of new burdens on the service. 16 Amber New risk Amber Anna Coles 13 Insufficient pupil attainment to achieve economic / quality of life outcomes across the secondary cohort - Plymouth Education Board (PEB) (and sub groups) has been reviewed with the new Board started, strengthening education partnership. - School 'Causing Concern' procedure has bee n reviewed and strengthened.

This affects future economic and quality of life outcomes. Despite the 'provisional' indication of improvement in educational outcomes this year (2021/22), improved outcomes needs to be embedded, consistent and sustainable over forthcoming years. - Cause for concern meetings, Early Years Board, Primary and Special School Partnership, Inclusion Strategy Board have added strength to the work governed by PEB. - Proposed Inclusion Mark for the City to celebrate inclusion. - The Plymouth Standards Partnership Recovery & Improvement Plan: A key priority is work to support disadvantaged pupils. - The work of the Plymouth Commission has been extended to focus on attainment for secondary aged pupils and school improvement. Schools have been offered a catch up premium of \u00a380 per pupils for most schools, to assist with programmes of learning to support pupils who require additional suppo rt following Covid. Schools have been sent a survey to confirm how this has been spent and the effectiveness of any programmes introduced. - Summer 2021 GCSE, AS and A level were teacher assessed with the reintroduction of exams in 2022. Initial provisional indications are that 2022 examination outcomes are positive and show an improving Plymouth picture against national benchmarks. 15 Risk of failing to meet carbon reduction targets to reach net zero by 2030. - Year 1, 2 and 3 CCRPs and CEAPs have been prepared to date, covering the period 2020 -2022. - The focus of the CCRP is on the things in the direct control of the City Council; the focus of the CEAP is on the wider things the Council is able to influence as well as some of the climate actions of City partners. - The Climate Emergency strategy and action plan process is currently under review, with a view to making revisions from 2023, providing a more strategic approach. - Growth and Infrastructure Overview a nd Scrutiny Committee receive 6 monthly performance updates 12 Amber Amber Anthony Payne PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Previous risk rating Current risk rating Risk Owner 17 Risk of failing to deliver the range of housing to meet Plymouth's need.

Continuing to bring long term empty ho mes back into use. 19 Viability of commercial bus operators with patronage not yet back to pre -Covid levels, the ending of Government Bus Recovery Grant in October, failure to secure any funding through our Bus Service Improvement Plan and increasing operating costs means that a number of unviable bus services are being reduced in frequency, re - routed or cut altogether from 4th September 2022. Monitor patronage levels locally both fare paying and concession pass holders. Frequent liaison meetings with bus operators. The Council continues to pay concession fare reimbursement above actual level of travel, although this is reducing in line with Government guidance by 5% every 2 months until such time it is less than reimbursement based on actual trips. To address loss of comm ercial services from 4th September, virements from concession fares reimbursement budget to non -commercial services budget of \u00a3557K in 23/24 to pay for non -commercial services secured through competitive tender and enable all areas of Plymouth to continue to have a bus service, at least on Mondays to Fridays. To make the budget go as far as possible, routes have been redesigned where possible to be able to use developer contributions to part or wholly fund some non -commercial routes. Enhanced cleaning re gime of buses to continue. Ensure clear messaging by transport providers about maximising messages about maintaining safe travel. In March 2021, the Government announced its new National Bus Strategy \"Bus Back Better\" making a further \u00a33bn of funding av ailable for the 3 years from April 2022 to significantly improve bus services across the country. In the end only \u00a31bn was available and although PCC has not received any N/A Amber New Risk Anthony Payne PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL No. Description Mitigation Risk Score Previous risk rating Current risk rating Risk Owner additional BSIP funding from the \u00a31bn released, PCC has confirmed that it will intro duce an Enhanced Partnership from the 31st October 2022. At the moment it is not possible to deliver Plymotion to encourage the take up of bus services. Schemes continue to delivered through the Transport Capital Programme to encourage patronage returnin g to pre -Pandemic levels as soon as possible. Increased commitment to non -commercial services is up until March 2024. Tenders will be sought late in 2023 when it is envisaged that commercial viability on a number of routes will have improved. 4.0 Operational Risk Register 4.1 There are now 139 risks (increased from 126 in February) on the operational risk register.
