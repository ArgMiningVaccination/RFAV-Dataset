As you likely know, rheumatoid arthritis is a very serious illness, and it can often be debilitating. So the concept of achieving remission can feel like a beacon of hope. Today more than 1.3 million Americans are living with rheumatoid arthritis, and about 75 percent of them are women, according to the [American College of Rheumatology](https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Rheumatoid-Arthritis). Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common form of autoimmune arthritis and causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints of the hands, feet, and wrists. As a quick refresher: [Autoimmune diseases](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/autoimmune-diseases) like rheumatoid arthritis arise when the body's [immune system](https://www.self.com/story/can-you-boost-immune-system)\u2014which typically keeps you healthy and defends against disease\u2014stops working properly and mistakenly attacks healthy cells in your body, according to the [U.S. National Library of Medicine](https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html). But with new advances in treatment options, it is possible to stop or slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis with the right treatment. In some cases, people are even able to achieve a state of remission where the joints aren't seeing further damage and the disease doesn't interfere with day-to-day living. Here's what you need to know about achieving rheumatoid arthritis remission. What does it mean to be in remission from rheumatoid arthritis? \"Rheumatoid arthritis remission is defined as very, very low disease activity, or no disease activity for a particular individual,\" [Dana DiRenzo, M.D.](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/10004782/dana-direnzo), rheumatologist and instructor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, tells SELF. You don't need to be completely free of symptoms to be in a state of remission, Dr. DiRenzo explains, but you would rate how your joints are feeling somewhere around a 0 or 1 out of 10, where 10 indicates the most pain or discomfort and 0 is the least. There is no definitive answer to how many people achieve remission from rheumatoid arthritis, but it may fall somewhere between [5% and 45%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5613855/), according to a 2017 analysis of studies. Diagnosis and aggressive treatment early on in the course of the illness seems to be an important factor in achieving remission, according to the [Arthritis Foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/treatment-plan/disease-management/your-ra-is-in-remission!-now-what#:~:text=The%20Odds%20of%20Remission&text=For%20people%20who%20don't,as%20reported%20in%20various%20studies.). Remission can be achieved at any point, Dr. DiRenzo says, but it's more likely with earlier treatment, especially within the first six to 12 months or so after diagnosis. While there isn't one specific test that can show when someone is in remission, a rheumatologist can determine if you're in remission by evaluating your reported symptoms along with a number of clinical signs and symptoms. In the process, they'll often use a scoring guide such as the [Clinical Disease Activity Index](https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/CDAI%20Form.pdf) (CDAI) or the [Disease Activity Score](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27762189/) (DAS / DAS28). These scoring guides bring together different criteria and test results to measure disease activity for each patient in order to indicate how active the disease is at a specific point in time. \"So this way we have an idea of who's doing really well and who's having a lot of disease activity,\" [Fotios Koumpouras, M.D.](https://www.yalemedicine.org/doctors/fotios_koumpouras/), rheumatologist, assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, and director of the Yale Lupus Program, tells SELF. Being in remission doesn't look exactly the same for everyone, but if you're in remission you'll experience very minimal joint symptoms or none at all, and your joint symptoms won't interfere with your day-to-day life in any way. What does it take to achieve remission for rheumatoid arthritis? Typically, a combination of medication and lifestyle changes are needed in order to achieve remission, but the exact requirements for achieving remission won't be the same from person to person. \"Some people may have one medication and they're in remission, some people may need three medications and they're in remission,\" Dr. Koumpouras says, adding that when people are able to achieve remission, it typically takes at least six months of treatment. Medications for rheumatoid arthritis come in many forms and typically work by lowering levels of inflammation in your body, Dr. DiRenzo explains. One type of medication that's frequently used is a class of drugs called [disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507863/) (DMARDs), which slow the progression of the disease. If conventional DMARDs aren't working well enough, your doctor may prescribe a type of drug called [biologics](https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/biologics/biologics) or biologic DMARDs. These are injected and designed to target specific parts of the immune system that contribute to inflammation. Keep in mind that your treatment options may change over time based on new research and newly available therapies. Make sure you have ongoing conversations with your doctor about which treatment options may be best for you. Lifestyle modifications are also important in managing rheumatoid arthritis and working toward remission. Physicians recommend eating a healthy diet, getting an adequate amount of rest each night, exercising regularly, and keeping stress at a minimum. There is also [research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/acr.23457) to suggest that people with higher BMIs are less likely to achieve remission, so it's possible that maintaining a certain weight could be one aspect of your treatment. Can you stop taking your medication when in rheumatoid arthritis remission? According to the [American College of Rheumatology](https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Rheumatoid-Arthritis), \"the goal of treatment is to improve your [joint pain](https://www.self.com/story/joint-pain) and swelling and to improve your ability to perform day-to-day activities.\" Most people still take rheumatoid arthritis medication even when they're in remission. But if your body is responding well to the DMARDs you've been prescribed, a physician may decide to [taper your medication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5613855/), since the goal is typically to treat the condition with the least amount of medication as possible. [Research](https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-015-0707-1) from several different settings shows that drug-free remission can be achieved in certain cases, so your rheumatologist may eventually try to stop your medication depending on how your body responds to the taper. Results from [one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19644846/) found that drug-free remission could be achieved in somewhere between 9% and 15% of patients who were treated with DMARDs early in the course of their illness. Drug-free remission appears to be most successful among patients who have been treated with medication [early](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/art.21405) in the course of their illness, though it's [unclear](https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-015-0707-1) whether successes in drug-free remission are due to early medication intervention or have something to do with the natural course of the illness. Keep in mind that stopping or tapering medication isn't something you would want to consider on your own without the guidance of your doctor. \"It is important for the individual to discuss this process in depth with his or her rheumatologist,\" Dr. DiRenzo says, adding that maintenance doses of rheumatoid arthritis medications are often necessary to keep people in remission or in a place where disease activity is at a minimum. Often, people with rheumatoid arthritis need to see their rheumatologist multiple times each year to monitor the disease and any medication side effects, the American College of Rheumatology says. Remission isn't the same as a cure. Being in remission from rheumatoid arthritis doesn't mean you no longer have the illness, which means that relapse is a possibility. \"Unfortunately, with all autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, flares and high disease activity can occur throughout one's lifetime,\" Dr. DiRenzo says. Many times this is brought about by a medication change, such as if the patient stops taking their medication or if the rheumatologist reduces the amount of medication the patient is taking. \"There are also some conditions where people experience what they call a flare or an exacerbation,\" Dr. Koumpouras says, explaining that an injury, infection, or some other form of trauma or event can heighten the amount of inflammation in someone's body. Rheumatoid arthritis is a complicated disease and isn't the type of illness you can try to tackle on your own. The best way to work toward remission and stay in remission is to find a doctor you trust and check in with them regularly for guidance and help in managing your "}
