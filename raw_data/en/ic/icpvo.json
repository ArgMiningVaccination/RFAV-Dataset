I haven't had homemade ice cream in decades. I think you get ice crystals. The fiber is suppose to make the commercial product more uniform. My recollection is for the homemade stuff you add antifreeze of the drinkable kind, i.e. booze, to stop the crystals. You can prevent the development of large ice crystals by freezing very, very fast - hence the popularity of liquid nitrogen-frozen ice cream. Unfortunately, freezing that fast doesn't let you whip enough air into your mixture, and so (in my experience) LN-frozen ice cream tends to have the texture of a well-aged convenience store popsicle - way too hard and with most of its flavor potential wasted. Instead, using regular ice but adding a small amount of vodka (for a neutral flavor) or appropriately-flavored booze lowers the freezing point enough to let you whip in a good volume of air, giving you a smooth soft texture and flavor you can actually taste without having to let it melt first. I make a coffee frozen custard using a couple of teaspoons of Kahlua (and a hell of a lot of espresso), and... pardon me, I seem to be drooling on my keyboard. That would have to be related to trehalose metabolites, not trehalose itself. Personally, I have no idea what kind of residue cleaving a ,-1,1-glucoside bond tends to leave but there are a couple of thousand papers on the issue. Could we address these metabolites in order to make the symptoms less serious? Or is it too specific? It's pointless to blame food scientists. They are, literally, \"following orders\". Industrialized food production means store-bought ice cream does not, as a rule, contain anything resembling the ingredients we might expect. Not fresh milk, certainly not cream, not even what we think of as \"normal\" sugar. I've seen ice cream with cream as the main ingredient, and only some stabilizers were in any way potentially questionable. Maybe people just don't care about the ingredients.

I thought the traditional method for keeping the ice crystals small was to churn continuously during freezing? I'll point out that trehalose has many health benefits as well so shouldn't be demonized out of hand. It doesn't spike blood sugar like many other sugars so is safe for diabetics, it induces autophagy which helps ameliorate a plethora of diseases including NASH, atherosclerosis, and possibly the majority of neurodegenerative diseases including huntingtons, Parkinsons, and ALS, and inhibits infections from multiple viruses including CMV and zika. It can also help the immune response against tuberculosis and other mycobacteria. It's a stress response pathway in many bacteria and yeast though, so not so surprising a pathogenic strain may take advantage. Interesting. I hear patients with c. diff also have extraordinarily, uniquely, almost cripplingly stinky bowel movements thanks to the toxins the bacteria exude. ....why is everybody looking at me like that Mysterious explosion of a deadly plague may come down to a sugar in ice cream Is trehalose listed on the ingredient labels of prepared food? Is it just called trehalose, or are there other names it might be listed under? Yeah..... what do we look for on an ingredient label to avoid this? I hear patients with c. diff also have extraordinarily, uniquely, almost cripplingly stinky bowel movements thanks to the toxins the bacteria exude. ....why is everybody looking at me like that Try taking Cipro for a week and then seeing how your bowels smell its no fun This particular sugar is incredibly safe - it's just two glucose molecules stuck together with a simple bond I hear patients with c. diff also have extraordinarily, uniquely, almost cripplingly stinky bowel movements thanks to the toxins the bacteria exude. ....why is everybody looking at me like that C diff was definitely a concern prior to the production of cheap trehalose, though. I recall learning the\"Black Box Warnings\" for certain antibiotics that could increase the risk of this, possibly fatal as a secondary infection, while in pharmacy school in 1982. Incidence rates though.... Clindamycin is the one they specifically warned us about in medical school. IIRC the odds ratio of a C. Diff infection after clindamycin usage was roughly 15-20x versus no antibiotics, and far higher than the next closest class of antibiotics. I make my own ice cream. I use regular table sugar. Something about the way that milk, cream, and sugar come together during freezing makes it special. I don't eat a lot of it because well its unhealthy. There seems to be a lot of demand in commercial ice cream for different properties than I get at home, like stability over a larger temp range and reduced costs. Its hard to replicate real ice cream when you start changing the ingredients. I can see how the properties of trehalose might be interesting. I don't think we can blame food scientists here, they could not have known. It's pointless to blame food scientists. They are, literally, \"following orders\". Industrialized food production means store-bought ice cream does not, as a rule, contain anything resembling the ingredients we might expect. Not fresh milk, certainly not cream, not even what we think of as \"normal\" sugar. How long before we find out that other additives in the foods we eat affect other pathogens negatively? So basically in effort to find a cheap alternative to sugar we increased the effectiveness of a pathogen. I just wonder if other pathogens also react to this new additive and I wonder about the flu and certain cancers. I'm betting some years from now we will find that we were our own worst enemy and we hastened our own demise with food products we made. We weren't looking for a \"cheap alternative to sugar.\" Sugar is already incredibly cheap. We were looking for a sugar that had properties that other sugars didn't - like those described in detail in the article. How do you propose preventing such secondary effects as these? This particular sugar is incredibly safe - it's just two glucose molecules stuck together with a simple bond, and it poses no danger to humans at all. There's no amount of testing that can possibly make sure that a given substance's interactions with the entire universe of other stuff in the world won't find some combination that produces danger. Go wring your hands over something worthwhile, like electing non-idiots to government. As if you needed any more reason to not enjoy cricket muffins.Immediately jumping to conclusions, I think I will avoid eating mushrooms during and after any course of antibiotics. And I will stay away from the insect-based food... C diff was definitely a concern prior to the production of cheap trehalose, though.

I've taken Clindamycin twice, each time as a \"premed\" before a dental cleaning. Each time resulted in the shits, not for just a few days but for over a month. No other antibiotic has had such an effect on me. Should they ban that sugar? Manufacturers started pouring trehalose into a variety of foods, from pasta to ground beef to ice creams. And people wonder why we are screwed... look no further. You know what I want in my ground beef? Ground-fucking-beef.

It's not just a case of not spiking blood sugar. Small scale clinical trials as well as animal studies show trehalose can moderately improve diabetes indicators such as hba1c levels, area under the curve of glucose tolerance tests, etc.I'll point out that trehalose has many health benefits as well so shouldn't be demonized out of hand.

It can also help the immune response against tuberculosis and other mycobacteria. It's a stress response pathway in many bacteria and yeast though, so not so surprising a pathogenic strain may take advantage. Interesting. \"Safe for diabetics\" is a strange way to characterise something that breaks down into 2 glucose molecules.. (For an example - bees use it a lot since the breakdown gives two glucose molecules therefore giving the energy boost needed for flight). It's not just the blood spikes that matter, it's the overall blood glucose levels too. So GI matters as well as the activation curve. So even though the only rice I eat is basmati (it has a different starch to other rices types and breaks down much more slowly), I still only eat small portions because the rule of \"carbs in == blood glucose\" still applies. (Yes - I'm a non-obese T2 diabetic. I made the mistake of picking a matrilineal line that has a very high incidence of early-onset diabetes. Mine came on in my late 30's when I was in a very stressful job). Have the researchers been able to identify any other factors at play? Trehalose by itself, I think, can't be the entire explanation - from the article, it sounds like this additive is so common, that most people eat foods every day containing this, and yet most of them don't get c. diff. infections. So, what's different about the people who *do* get sick with c. diff. after eating it? Perhaps it might be simpler to control the complicating factors than to ban Trehalose outright?
