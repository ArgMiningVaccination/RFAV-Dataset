[ EPA-EFE/HENDRIK SCHMIDT / POOL] EURACTIV is part of the Trust | DeutschPrint Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram A coalition of 10 EU countries has asked for an amendment to the advance purchase agreements (APA) made with COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers, as vaccine quantities exceed countries' needs. As supplies of COVID-19 vaccines overtake demand in EU member states, 10 countries - Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia - have called on the Commission to increase flexibility in their contracts. \"This situation requires action to minimise losses and in particular urgent amendments of the agreements concluded by the European Commission on behalf of the member states in order to safeguard the public interest by providing flexibility,\" the letter, addressed to EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides and seen by EURACTIV, said. \"In our opinion, we need to make the concluded contracts more flexible,\" the letter summarises. The Commission presented its EU Vaccines Strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of vaccines against COVID-19 back in June 2020. Through APAs with individual vaccine producers, the Commission secured the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe and at a given price. Now countries want amendments as there is a \"significant surplus of COVID-19 vaccines.\" \"We must remember that the conditions in the agreements negotiated by the Commission were based on the impossibility of predicting how the pandemic would develop at that point in time,\" the letter reads. For the signatories, the agreements now cause an \"excessive burden on state budgets, combined with the delivery of unnecessary amounts of vaccines and short remaining shelf life of the vaccines.\" \"Revision of the provisions of the contracts for the purchase of vaccines is essential - the absence of action will result in Europe's financial mismanagement and EU citizens' mistrust,\" the letter reads. EU countries are throwing away expired vaccine doses Europe is letting thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses expire while only 1% of people in low-income countries and 28% of the world population has received at least a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Proposals To address the issue, member states have proposed several points to be addressed in the amendments to the agreements. Firstly, the countries called for a reduction in the quantities of vaccines sold, to better address the needs and demands of member states. Secondly, the letter argued that it should be possible to terminate APAs if the epidemiological situation means there is no longer any need for the doses. Contracts should also be able to be renegotiated, not only in commercial terms but also in biomedical terms \"since the virus is constantly mutating and vaccines must be adapted to new virus strains.\" The signatories also called for the introduction of requirements for a minimum remaining shelf life at the time of delivery, as well as a \"mechanism where HERA Authority [the EU's health emergency preparedness body] repurchases member states' vaccines to cover unmet global needs in a more coordinated manner and to create a joint stockpile that Europe might need for the emergency crisis.\" WTO official: IP waiver on COVID vaccines would not facilitate access immediately The negotiations for a waiver on intellectual property (IP) rights in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) are still ongoing, but a final agreement would not immediately loosen up access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, according to a WTO official. Commission already in talks The 10 member states expect the Commission to present a formal position on the matter during the EU Health Council later in the month, on 16 June. Meanwhile, the EU executive has already started negotiations with vaccine manufacturers. But the EU countries that signed the letter are not satisfied with the solutions proposed by the contractors, saying that they \"do not solve our problems in a long term, in a sustainable, and legally and financially sound manner.\" \"The proposed amendments to the Purchase Agreement with Pfizer are an insufficient solution and only delay the problem of vaccine utilisation in time,\" the letter read, adding that their chief concerns on the executive's suggested amendments are the lack of guarantees concerning the development of an adapted vaccine and the lack of a minimum remaining shelf life at the time of vaccine delivery.
