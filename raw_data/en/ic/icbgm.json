Studies show a possible link between PFAS exposure and certain health effects, such as higher cholesterol. There are simple steps to reduce your exposure to PFAS. Learn More About How to Limit Your Exposure to PFAS: Simple Steps to Reduce Your Exposure to PFAS: Environmental Working Group (EWG) has a [guide](https://www.ewg.org/avoidpfas) on how to reduce exposure to PFAS chemicals in everyday life by reducing the use of certain consumer products such as microwave popcorn bags, food take-out containers, non-stick pots and pans. Blood Tests for PFAS: For communities impacted by PFAS, there may be research studies that involve PFAS blood testing for local residents - contact your Department of Health for more information. Aside from these studies, we do not recommend routine testing of children for PFAS. Although PFAS can be measured in blood, the results do not help doctors make medical decisions or predict future health effects. If you do want to have your child tested for PFAS, testing is usually not available at commercial or clinical laboratories. At [labs that offer PFAS testing](https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/hazardous/docs/pfas/indbltest.pdf), insurance usually does not cover the expense of testing, which can range from $500-$800.
