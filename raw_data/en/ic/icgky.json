Learn more about the many individuals from different disciplines who work together to create an environment for optimal healing. And remember that any caregiver who enters your room should be properly identified with a hospital or Advocate Health Care name badge. Physicians The physician who admits you is responsible for directing your care while you are in the hospital. This is also the person you should consult if you have questions about your illness. Your physician may choose to entrust your care while in the hospital to our hospitalists. Hospitalists are fully trained and certified physicians who specialize exclusively in the care of patients who are in the hospital. Hospitalists will work closely with your primary care physician or specialist to ensure that you receive the best possible care. A number of our physicians are HeartCaring \u00ae designated, which means they have had special training in caring for women with heart disease. Because we are a teaching facility, you may encounter medical residents during your stay. These physicians are completing their medical training and are supervised by more experienced physicians who closely monitor clinical outcomes. If you have any questions about the residency program, please contact the Charge Nurse. Nurses Nursing care is provided 24 hours a day by a team of professional registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nurse assistants/technicians. Staff are identified by role on a purple placard behind their name badges. All will identify themselves on the white board in your room. An area manager, director and a Charge Nurse are responsible for coordination of care on a daily basis. Case managers are assigned to each area to assist with discharge planning. Please feel free to contact any of your caregivers if you have questions or concerns. If you have questions or concerns not addressed by your immediate caregivers, please call Patient Relations at extension 49.5053. You may also encounter nursing students who are completing their medical training and are supervised by more experienced nurses who closely monitor clinical outcomes. If you have any questions regarding student nurses, please contact the Charge Nurse. Dietitians The hospital has a staff of registered dietitians to meet your nutrition needs during your stay. Registered dietitians are available for consultation if you are not eating well and need additional support, or if you have questions regarding your special diet. If you have questions about your meals or diet, call extension 49.3000 and ask to speak to a dietitian. Environmental Services Our patient care team works to keep your room and bathroom clean and sanitized. Housekeepers are trained in methods to prevent the spread of infection and clean your room every day. If you have any specific housekeeping needs, you may call extension 49.3333 for immediate assistance. As part of our \"green\" energy use efforts, bed linens are changed as needed, but not necessarily every day. If you would like your bed linens changed during your stay, please let your nurse know. The linen is professionally laundered and meets strict health care regulatory standards. Chaplains BroMenn Medical Center is committed to ensuring that your spiritual needs are met while you are in the hospital. Chaplains are available to you regardless of your denomination or faith tradition. If you would like to have your own congregation's clergy or spiritual support person called, chaplains can assist you. If you desire prayer, scripture reading, information on chapel services or other spiritual care, please ask your nurse to contact a chaplain. Advocate Health Care is committed to creating the best place for patients to heal by providing extraordinary care.5 Let us know if there has been a change in how you are feeling. If you or your family members are concerned, we are too!Social Workers Our social work staff offers a variety of services that focus on the problems caused by, or contributing to, the patient's medical condition. Social Workers are assigned to each patient care area and are trained to assist patients and family members with financial, social, and emotional issues related to illness, hospitalization and discharge plans. To contact the Social Work department, call extension 49.5438. Patient Billing Representative You may receive a visit from a representative from the Patient Billing department. This person can answer questions about your hospital bill, accept co-payments, and help you interpret financial policies and billing procedures at the hospital. He or she can also help you apply for financial assistance or Medicaid, if necessary. Patient Billing can be reached by calling 309.268.5717 Monday through Friday from 8 am to 4:30 pm. Other Personnel During your stay you will be visited by health care professionals other than doctors and nurses. Individuals from the lab will be drawing blood as necessary. Food and Nutritional Services staff will bring your meals. Other personnel may include respiratory therapists, physical or occupational therapists, transporters and administrators. Volunteers Volunteers contribute many hours of service and financial assistance to the hospital. They supplement the services of the hospital staff in many ways and can be identified by their name badges. If you would like to become a volunteer yourself after your recovery, contact Volunteer Services at 309.268.5397.Partnering For Your Safety Ensuring your safety sets the stage for healing. By partnering with you to create a safe environment, our staff and physicians can better serve your physical, emotional and spiritual needs. Keep Us Informed Our partnership starts with communication. Be sure to tell your doctor and nurse about: Past illnesses and surgeries Long-term health problems All the medicines you take, including over -the- counter medicines, such as Tylenol\u00ae, ibuprofen, vitamins or herbal supplements Any allergies Advance directives, such as a power of attorney for health care or a living will Participate in Your Health Care We want you and your family members to understand all aspects of your health care. If you do not understand something that your doctor, nurse or other health care professional tells you, ask questions until you do understand. While we are providing education about a diagnosis or medical tests, ask us for written information, including pamphlets and brochures. You may even want to ask a trusted family member or friend to be present to write down and remember the questions you ask and answers we provide, especially if you are under stress. 6Know Your Medications While in the hospital, you will not be allowed to take your medications from home because of the potential interaction with newly prescribed medication. If you have brought medication with you to the hospital, we ask that you send it home with a family member or lock it up in the hospital safe. We will talk to you about all medications prescribed for you, how often you should take them and what side effects you could experience. Let us know if and when you experience side effects from any medication you are receiving from us. If you do not recognize a medication you are about to receive, do not hesitate to question us before you take it. Latex Allergy If you have an allergy to latex, please inform your caregivers immediately. We have procedures to protect you. Latex balloons are not allowed on any Advocate campus to protect our latex allergic patients. Mylar balloons are allowed, as they do not present a risk to patients. Preventing Falls Falls account for many of the injuries that patients suffer while hospitalized. Unfamiliar surroundings, changes in activity levels, and medications that cause dizziness or more frequent trips to the bathroom are just a few of the factors that can contribute to a fall. Because we want to 'see' you safe, we ask that you follow the instructions of your care provider regarding summoning assistance to move about. Our staff is specially trained in preventing falls and will use proven strategies to keep you safe during your stay in the hospital. These measures may include the use of alarm devices to warn us of potentially dangerous situations, gait belts for stable mobility, and extra precautionary measures during toileting. Never hesitate to call us for help! We take your safety very seriously and hope to partner with you and your family to keep you safe. At BroMenn Medical Center, we designate patients who are at a greater risk of falling with yellow socks. This helps our nurses and other caregivers recognize those patients who may need additional assistance moving about.Understanding Deep-Vein Thrombosis (DVT) DVT occurs when blood clots form in the legs. These clots can travel to the brain, heart or lungs, blocking circulation and causing damage or even death. While you are off your feet in the hospital, your risk for DVT increases. Make sure to ask your doctor or nurse when you can get out of bed. Find out if your doctor plans to give you compression boots, stockings and/or blood thinners to prevent DVT during your stay. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any of the following DVT warning signs: A worsening leg cramp or charley horse Swelling and discoloration in your leg, upper arm or neck Unexplained shortness of breath Chest discomfort that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough Light-headedness or blacking out Preventing Pressure Ulcers Pressure ulcers (commonly known as bed sores) are injuries caused by unrelieved pressure, friction or skin that remains wet. Bedridden or wheelchair-bound patients are at risk for these sores, which affect the skin and the tissue beneath it. Pressure ulcers are a serious problem and can lead to a slower recovery and potential complications, such as infections. To prevent pressure ulcers when confined to bed: Change your position at least every two hours. Raise the head of your bed as little and for as short a time as possible. Reduce friction by lifting rather than dragging your body when changing positions. A void lying directly on your hip bone when lying on your side. Use pillows to keep your knees or ankles from touching or to help you stay on your side. Never place pillows behind your knees, though. A special mattress that contains air , gel or water can help prevent or treat pressure ulcers. 7 When in a wheelchair: Shift your position every 15 - 30 minutes. Use a foam, gel or air cushion to redistribute pressure while in the chair . A void donut-shaped cushions\u2014they can actually cause pressure ulcers. General preventatives: Eat a balanced diet. Check your skin daily and notify your health care provider if any abnormalities are seen. Use a good lotion to prevent/treat dry skin. Use warm (not hot) water and a mild soap to bathe. Don' t massage your skin over bony parts of your body. Clean your skin as soon as possible if you soil it. Protect your skin by using a barrier cream in your private area after cleaning. Using Personal Electrical Items Personal electrical items (electric shavers, hair care appliances, radios, cell phone or tablet chargers, etc.) are not allowed on some units, as they may interfere with hospital equipment. Please consult your nurse before using any of these items. Smoking In keeping with Advocate's mission to promote health and wellness, smoking is not allowed anywhere on any hospital campuses, courtyards, parking towers or parking lots. This includes all forms of tobacco use as well as electronic \"e-cigarettes.\" This policy pertains to patients and visitors, as well as physicians, employees and volunteers. Fire Safety Fire drills are conducted periodically to ensure your safety. If you hear an alarm, please stay where you are. In the event of an actual emergency, hospital staff will notify and assist you. Infection Control For your protection and the protection of all patients, employees of BroMenn Medical Center consistently take precautions to prevent the spread of infection. Your health care providers may wear masks, gloves or other protective clothing when caring for you and other patients. In certain situations, they may also ask you or your family, friends and visitors to wear protective clothing. Specific types of precautions include: Contact isolation - is used for germs that can be spread by hands, clothes, or touching. Droplet isolation - is used for germs that can be spread through the air (influenza). Airborne isolation - is used for patients that may have germs or suspected to have germs like TB. Ask your nurse about any of these precautions and why they are being taken, if you are unclear. Preventing Post-Surgical Infections A surgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place. Symptoms may include redness, pain or drainage at the surgical site. Notify your health care provider immediately if you notice these symptoms. To avoid infections after surgery: Make sure that your health care providers clean their hands, either with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub, before they examine you. 8If you do not see your providers clean their hands, please ask them to do so. Family and friends who visit you should not touch the surgical wound or dressings. Family and friends should clean their hands before and after visiting you. V isitors should not enter your room if they have a cold or infection. After you go home, be sure to clean your own hands before and after tending to your wound. Hand Hygiene The single best way to prevent infections is washing hands. Always remember to wash your hands with soap and water after using the restroom. Additional tips in hand hygiene include: When washing your hands, say your \"ABC' s\" or sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice. That is approximately the amount of time required to properly wash hands. W ash your hands with soap and water when they are visibly dirty. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used when hands are not visibly dirty. All visitors should wash their hands when they come and go from your room. All doctors and nurses will wash their hands when they come and go from your room. Do not hesitate to remind them! Videotaping, Audio Recording and Photography Check with your doctor or nurse before taking any pictures or making any recordings in your room. Absolutely no pictures or recording are allowed in the hospital, aside from your room.Your Money and Valuables We know your valuables are precious to you and strongly recommend that you leave them at home or send them home with family members. You may want to keep a small amount of money for incidental purchases such as magazines or personal items. If you do have valuable items with you, please tell your nurse, who will ask a member of the Public Safety Department to put your items in the hospital safe until you can make other arrangements. If you are being discharged and have valuables in the hospital safe, call the Public Safety Department at extension 49.5050. BroMenn Medical Center is not responsible for personal property kept in patients' rooms. Patient Relations As much as we would like to think that we always achieve our goal providing superior care, sometimes we miss the mark. It is exactly those times when we want to hear from you.

Admission Whether your hospital stay was planned or the result of an emergency, you should have signed a number of forms during the admission process that help us provide the best care and service. These forms include waivers for the release of information and a form that clears BroMenn Medical Center of all responsibility for your valuables. Preparing for Your Stay During your hospital stay, you will only need a few personal items, such as toiletries, bathrobe, slippers and a nightgown or pajamas. We do provide hospital attire which is often more practical during your first few days. After that, you may prefer to wear your own clothing. Health Care Consent Part of the admission process included signing a Health Care Consent Form that covered important information regarding your stay. If you did not read this form in its entirety, we recommend you do so. In particular, it addresses: Consent to treat Responsibility for payment Assignment of benefits Medicare payment and assignment of benefits Release of medical information Responsibility for personal belongings Independent physician servicesAsk your nurse to provide a copy of the Health Care Consent Form if you do not have one.

Help Us Care For You During your stay at the hospital, discuss your medical treatment plan with your physician. If you have more than one physician, make sure you understand what role each physician plays in your care. If you are having surgery, talk to your physician and surgeon to make sure that everyone agrees on what will be done during the operation and make sure you know who will take care of you after surgery. Important questions to ask include: What tests or procedures are ordered for me? What will happen when I have these tests or procedures? When will I get the results of the tests or procedures? What are the results of the tests or procedures and what do the results mean? What is the correct amount of medicine? How should this medicine be taken? How often should I take the medicine at home?

Advance Directives Advance Directives are instructions you provide ahead of time concerning the medical treatment you wish to receive, should you lose the ability to make your own decisions. At BroMenn Medical Center, we can provide you with written forms that meet the requirements of the State of Illinois, which will assist you in documenting your wishes. Assessing Your Values Before you can communicate with anyone else about your wishes for health care, you must first clarify what you value and want for yourself. After you reflect upon what you consider priorities for life, you can more effectively make decisions about what type of medical interventions you would or would not want if you become unable to speak for yourself. Some considerations might include whether you wish to be placed on a breathing machine, whether you wish to be fed through a tube, or whether you would want resuscitation attempted if your heart stopped.Who Decides? No one likes to think about a time when they may not be able to make health care decisions. On the other hand, no one wants those decisions made without their wishes being considered. Completing an Advance Directive ensures that your health care wishes are clearly documented in the event that you are unable to make those decisions yourself. This is Your Health Care Health care is changing each day. There are many new procedures, machines and medications that offer new treatment options. These medical advances help people live longer and healthier lives. Medical advances also present us with more medical decisions to make. Whenever possible, it is you, the patient, who decides what choices are best for you. The law gives you the right to be informed about your medical condition and the treatment that the physician would recommend. You also have the right to be informed about other health care options. Then, when a medical decision needs to be made, you can do so with informed consent. 14Speaking for Yourself There are four kinds of written Advance Directives recognized in Illinois. They are: Power of Attorney for Health Care This document allows you to name someone to act as your agent for health care choices in the event you are unable to speak for yourself. This person is normally a relative or close friend whom you trust to carry out your choices in conjunction with the medical staff. You decide how much decision power this person has. The Power of Attorney for Health Care document also allows you to state your wishes with regard to organ and tissue donation. While this may not be an easy conversation to have, you may want to discuss this issue with your family so that you can communicate clearly about your values. Your spiritual leader may also be helpful in this discussion and decision-making process. Living Will (Illinois Declaration) This document becomes effective only after your attending physician has determined that you have a terminal condition or are in an irreversible state of decline. Typically this document states that you do not want measures taken that prolong the dying process, and you wish to be given comfort care. Mental Health Treatment Declaration This document is effective for only three years and is used to appoint another person to act as your agent to make mental health treatment decisions. Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR)/Practitioner Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) This document can be used to create a physician order that reflects your wishes about receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and other life-sustaining treatments. For example, the form allows you, in consultation with your physician, to make advance decisions about whether CPR should be administered if your heartbeat and breathing stop, or to limit treatment according to your wishes during other emergencies. CPR, when successful, restores heartbeat and breathing. The completed POLST form is intended to be honored across various settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, and by emergency medical services personnel in your residence or en route to a health care facility. Other Steps You Should Take Communication is the key. Take your time as you share your feelings and wishes with those people who are significant to you. Talk to Family and Other Important People It may be helpful to speak with your spiritual leader for guidance and support. As you talk with family and friends, remember that they may need time to understand your wishes. Communicate Your Wishes to Your Primary Care Physician It is essential that you also communicate your specific wishes to your primary care physician. It is a good idea to give your physician an updated copy of your Advance Directive whenever you make a change to your document. Have Copies of Your Advance Directive Document Available We often place important papers in lock boxes or a home safe. This is not the case with an Advance Directive. Hospitals and physicians can act on your wishes only when they have a copy of your signed document on your patient chart. Make extra copies for family or friends who can access them for you. Organ and Tissue Donation Another decision that you may want to discuss with your family is your wishes regarding organ and tissue donation. Again, this may not be an easy conversation, but is another way to communicate clearly what you value. Your spiritual leader may also be helpful in this discussion and decision making process. 15For More Information If you need further assistance or if you have a question regarding an ethical concern, please ask your nurse to contact a chaplain. Commonly Asked Questions Do I need more than one Advance Directive? A Living Will and a Power of Attorney for Health Care serve different, though related purposes. The first expresses your wishes and instructions concerning care near the end of life; the second empowers someone else to act for you on a broader range of health care matters, if the need should arise. The POLST form is meant to be discussed with those patients with advanced, serious illness and the frail elderly. We recommend that a patient complete at least the Power of Attorney for Health Care advance directive. How will decisions be made for me if I haven't completed a Living Will or appointed a health care representative? If you become incapacitated and do not have a Living Will or a Power of Attorney for Health Care, your doctor and other health care providers will ask a family member, friend, or guardian to make decisions for you. In Illinois a law directs which of these people will be consulted. In that law each of these people is called a \"surrogate.\" Without an Advance Directive, you face two risks; first, the person/people listed by this law may not be who you would want to make decisions for you; and second, a course of treatment may be selected that you would not personally have approved. If I sign an Advance Directive and later change my mind, can I revoke it? You may revoke an Advance Directive at any time by destroying the document; dating and signing a statement of revocation, or verbally expressing your intent to cancel.What are \"life sustaining measures?\" In your Living Will and/or Power of Attorney for Health Care, you may state whether you wish certain forms of medical intervention to be used to keep you alive. These measures include cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a ventilator (breathing machine), kidney dialysis, intravenous and tube feeding, and medications. Do I need to see a lawyer to complete an Advance Directive? No. You may be more comfortable consulting a lawyer, or you may have special needs or wishes that can best be handled with the assistance of a lawyer. However, these documents are readily available as pre-printed forms. Will my health care provider honor my preferences as expressed in my Living Will? Generally, the answer is yes. Occasionally, however, a health care provider may be reluctant to comply on moral or ethical grounds. In that case, it is the provider's responsibility to arrange for another provider who is comfortable with your wishes. Does my religious tradition say anything about Living Wills or the kinds of medical treatment I should request? Most religious traditions approve of individual choice in health care decision making, especially in the context of artificially prolonging life. If you have religious questions about making an Advance Directive, consult with your spiritual leader. 16For Visitors Just as important as peaceful rest is the uplifting feeling you get from family and friend visits.

To obtain copies of your health information for insurance reimbursement or other purposes, the hospital requires written authorization from the patient or legal representative. Authorization forms are available at the Medical Records Release window in the hospital Atrium, which is open 8 am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday, except holidays. Copies of your health information can be picked up at this location or will be mailed to the patient.Billing and Insurance To help patients meet their financial obligations, BroMenn Medical Center will file an insurance claim with your primary carrier (as well as most secondary insurances) as a courtesy to you. To do this efficiently, you must present accurate and complete insurance information at the time of registration. We will need a copy of your insurance identification card(s). At registration, you will be asked to assign benefits from the insurance company directly to the hospital. All patients should familiarize themselves with the terms of their insurance coverage, as your plan may have special requirements. It is your responsibility to make sure the requirements of your plan have been met. If your plan's requirements are not followed, you may be financially responsible for all or part of the services rendered in the hospital. Some physician specialists may not participate in your health care plan and their services may not be covered. If You Are Covered by Medicare We will need a copy of your Medicare card to verify eligibility and process your Medicare claim. The Medicare program specifically excludes payment for certain items and services, such as cosmetic surgery, some oral surgery procedures, personal comfort items, hearing evaluations and others.

We have payment options available to assist you in paying your bill. Your bill reflects all of the services you receive during your stay. Charges fall into two categories: a basic daily rate, which includes your room, meals, nursing care, housekeeping, telephone and television; and charges for special services which include items your physician orders for you, such as x-rays or laboratory tests. For your convenience, you can choose to pay the hospital portion of your bill online, through our secure system, using VISA, MasterCard or Discover. Simply go to advocatehealth.com/bromenn/billpay and follow the instructions. If you have certain tests or treatments in the hospital, you may receive bills from physicians you did not see in person. These bills are for professional services rendered by these doctors in diagnosing and interpreting test results while you were a patient. Pathologists, radiologists, cardiologists, anesthesiologists and other specialists perform these services and are required to submit separate bills. If you have questions about these bills, please call the number printed on the statement you receive from them.If you receive notice that we need additional billing information, a response is requested within two weeks to avoid further collection efforts.

At such moments, making a charitable gift to BroMenn Medical Center can be a rewarding way to both honor and benefit those who changed your life. As a not-for-profit organization, the hospital relies on philanthropy to enhance our patients' experience. Patient fees cover basic services, but donations help us do so much more. There is no more rewarding way to express gratitude for exceptional care than to help provide caregivers with the resources they need to do their very best work. And 100 percent of your gift goes directly to the area of care you specify. In recent years, generosity from patients and families has enabled our hospital to build a new, state-of-the-art bed tower featuring a new obstetrics unit and critical care/progressive care unit, as well as acquire a da Vinci Surgical System \u00ae, bringing access to minimally invasive surgical procedures to the community, among other achievements. If you or a family member would like to honor a caregiver, please ask your nurse for a \"Beyond Thank You\" brochure, or pick one up at various locations around the hospital.
