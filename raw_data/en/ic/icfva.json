To help you prepare for your arrival, I want to share with you public health information and expectations that will enable the university to offer a fully in-person education and reinstitute many policies that preceded the COVID-19 pandemic. If you are a returning student, you will notice some refinements that will simplify and ease everyday life; if you are a new student, please pay particular attention to expectations that you will need to fulfill before you arrive. Vaccinations Documented COVID-19 vaccinations or approved exemptions are required as a condition of enrollment. Whether you are a returning or new student, you should by now have submitted documentation that you are up to date on your vaccinations (i.e., have received a COVID-19 primary vaccine series and at least one booster if you are eligible). If you have not submitted documentation, please submit it now, through the [Yale Vaccine Portal](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=288ffb0f2c641f4e4ff317575f281f0a2a5ead63e6f3ecf8bd1125a2df269574576a9e5b6f959beefcf70407ecf9f774cfa3399f3548fcea), which also includes instructions for requesting a religious or medical exemption. You can [learn more about Yale's COVID-19 vaccination policy](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=288ffb0f2c641f4ee129e25d71a44d1e064c67eddc28b648abf2f22be98fbf57053df80cf79ab09f26640bc26c15dff6864738f3e7ef79be). Now is also the time to address any overdue non-COVID vaccine requirements that could delay registration. Please review your status in the [Yale Vaccine Portal](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=288ffb0f2c641f4e4ff317575f281f0a2a5ead63e6f3ecf8bd1125a2df269574576a9e5b6f959beefcf70407ecf9f774cfa3399f3548fcea), and monitor your yale.edu email for reminders. If you feel you have entered all requirements but are still receiving noncompliance notices, please write to complianceservices@medicat.com. If you are experiencing issues with completing requirements, please write to Yale Health at [immunization@yale.edu](mailto:immunization@yale.edu). Testing Before you come to campus, take a COVID-19 test, preferably a rapid antigen test the day you travel or a PCR test 48 hours before you travel. If your result is negative, you do not need to report it; if it is positive, [report it](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=288ffb0f2c641f4eb46c865c5350f717949d3c079262ec896c6c095ec687dc143658a4fc8c6ade7f9a6aa48a2da6ebc927937fde8892a5d0) before traveling and follow the instructions you receive. You may not come to campus until you are cleared to travel. [Create an account with Color Health](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=288ffb0f2c641f4e1572886e47816a9844b3ad961e8bb38253887e992558999ab89d3d02c83e2619e808621cdd8d1d39d4c4d3dbe49b1a73), for the COVID-19 test you will take when you arrive (see below), and for subsequent asymptomatic and symptomatic testing. You can [learn more about on-campus testing](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=288ffb0f2c641f4eb09bf0ac45dc3fedb1ec2dc11b741825356efc0862a4eadba7dd700fa5691fbc12d0c3f330fd7b1cc8cfeff4a76545a4) that will be available to you. When you arrive, you will need to take a PCR test through the Yale COVID-19 Testing Program 's Color process as outlined in the linked message above. Also be sure to pick up your welcome kit that will include five Color PCR test kits, two rapid antigen test kits, masks, and testing guidance. First-year students will receive welcome kits from first-year counselors, and all other students, whether living on campus or off, will be able to collect them from their residential college offices. During the semester, regular asymptomatic testing through Color will be available but not required, as testing was previously. You should test any time you think you have been exposed or when you are experiencing symptoms. Additional testing may be required to participate in certain music and drama events. Isolating If you test positive for COVID-19, you will receive instructions for isolating for five to seven days, either in isolation housing, in your room, or in your off-campus housing, depending on your housing configuration. Masks Masks are currently required in all classes, in health facilities, and on Yale transit, and they are welcomed anywhere on campus. Certain high-density events or performances may also require masking. Visitors Visitors are allowed on campus if they are up to date on their vaccines. Beginning in the fall, undergraduate students will be able to serve as hosts. You can [find more information about Yale's visitors policy](https://click.message.yale.edu/?qs=288ffb0f2c641f4eac54b4df0921c67cfc4037a75a6ad621c78626bc8742bd45c48292a012a8fedb3aa920148daf7ef7e6c46e2ea433d0a3).
