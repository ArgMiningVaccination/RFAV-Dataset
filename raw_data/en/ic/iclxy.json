You've probably heard the term \"holistic medicine\" before, but what does it actually mean? To better understand holistic medicine, it's helpful to take a look at what it isn't. There is a myriad of unwanted conditions that can afflict the body \u2014 many of which are currently treated by the traditional medical community with varied success. Think about it: how many times have you heard that a given sickness or chronic condition currently has no cure? In many of these cases, traditional medical journals are omitting or glossing over marked results shown in the field of holistic medicine. A Guide by Our New York Holistic Medical Professionals Conventional medicine focuses on suppressing the symptoms of a health problem to improve a patient's comfort. On the other hand, [holistic medicine practices](/about/) focus on eliminating symptoms by treating the underlying causes of diseases and disorders. Holistic medicine is a branch of medicine that abides by the core principle that the body works as a whole: thus, by improving imbalances in certain areas of the body, holistic medical practitioners seek to cure or mediate conditions that may have arisen due to these imbalances. In the United States, holistic medicine also endorses new and experimental treatments that have often not yet been approved by administrations including the FDA. Holistic Medicine Approach You can hear more about this approach by watching this quick video. You'll hear a holistic medicine doctor explain that when obstructions to wellness are removed, the body has a natural ability to heal itself. Holistic medicine emphasizes the proactive correction of these issues to prevent diseases from developing.

The 3-Steps: The Fast-Track Intensive to Better Health - Diagnostic Evaluation: Gap Analysis - Treatment: Cleansing and Detoxing - Momentum: Rebuilding Why Choose a Holistic Health Practitioner Over a Regular Doctor? \"A real doctor can write a prescription but a really good holistic doctor doesn't need to.\" - Dr. Dean Mitchell We've all been to the doctor, and we've all likely had experiences where the doctor's medical advice and treatments do little to help a given condition. (In some cases, they can make matters worse). In these instances, it's often necessary to seek other treatment avenues. Holistic medicine is one such avenue. If you have a condition that has failed to improve after traditional medical treatments \u2014 or if you have elected not to pursue traditional medical treatment due to unwanted potential side effects \u2014 holistic medicine offers an excellent alternative that can lead to marked improvement. Since holistic medicine focuses on healing the whole body, you can be sure that the treatment you are getting from a trusted medical practitioner like Dr. Mitchell will do nothing but benefit your body, even if it does not totally cure your condition. Why Traditional Doctors Are Failing Their Patients How many times have you or someone you know gone to the doctor only to have them want to prescribe you medication which will only relieve or mask the symptoms? For example, when most people are diagnosed with irritable bowel or leaky gut their doctor simply prescribes something to alleviate their symptoms but doesn't take any action to try to correct the actual underlying issue. Or have you ever had a doctor tell you there is a prescription they'd like to recommend but can't recommend it first due to insurance restraints? I had a patient recently who had to have adverse reactions to three different cholesterol medications before her doctor could recommend the medication he originally wanted to. Why couldn't the doctor recommend the best medication for the patient the first time - insurance restraints? How Holistic Doctors Treat Patients In holistic medicine, your doctor's main goal is to figure out the underlying cause of your health issue and work on curing it. And we focus on curing it with the best treatment protocol for each patient and their unique needs. A holistic doctor doesn't just focus on one organ in the body. We look at the complete picture and we try to figure out what is wrong with you and fix that. If you have a condition that has failed to improve after traditional medical treatments \u2014 or if you have elected not to pursue traditional medical treatment due to unwanted potential side effects \u2014 holistic medicine offers an excellent alternative that can lead to marked improvement. Why Choose Mitchell Medical Group? Though holistic medicine is an excellent alternative to traditional medicine for patients suffering from a myriad of conditions, the unfortunate fact remains that not all holistic medical practitioners are created equal. Many \"professionals\" claiming to practice holistic medicine simply offer unregulated treatments that are at best ineffective and at worst harmful. If you are seriously considering holistic medicine, it's important to work with a medical team you can trust to administer safe and effective treatments.
