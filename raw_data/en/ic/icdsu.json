My scientific mind does wonder how you \"nog\" an \"egg.\" After extensive research (a.k.a., Google) I deter- mined it is some com- bination of grog (rum), nog (strong ale), noggins (wooden mugs), and eggs (oval-shaped things that come from chickens). All joking aside, I know that most would agree that 2021 has been a difficult year. The first global pandemic of our generation marched on with increased cases and deaths, often af - fecting the most vulnerable among us. Many families lost loved ones without the opportunity to comfort them in person and say goodbye. Just as the virus seemed to ebb, another wave developed, driven by the Delta variant. The year started with much hope as the sci- entific miracle of rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccines became a reality and doses were put into arms. I think many of us in the medi- cal community were taken by surprise by the degree of vaccine hesitancy and resistance en- countered as the months rolled on. Conspiracy theorists were having a heyday, often spread- ing misinformation through social media to all who would listen. Primary care became an often-confrontational place as we did our best to educate our patients on the safety and effi- cacy of the vaccines. Despite this, I am proud to say that British Columbia has done better than many jurisdictions, with approximately 80% of the province's population being vaccinated up to this point. In 2021 we also experienced continued worsening of the opioid crisis. In the first 9 months of this year, over 1500 individuals died of opioid poisoning in our province. Sadly, this eclipses last year's record-setting pace. Solu- tions for this crisis remain elusive and difficult to come by. Despite its human devastation, it currently receives less focus in the news, in part due to the presence of the global pandemic. It's been a difficult year on a personal level, too, as my wife became ill and continues to bravely battle what is at best an uphill struggle. Not by choice, I have sampled the health care system from the other side, initially during hos- pital COVID-19 restrictions, and can attest to how trying it's been for those who are ill as well as for their concerned loved ones. So, not the best year on paper, but the opti- mist in me remains undaunted. The kindness I have experienced on a personal level has been overwhelming and has reinforced my belief in the underlying goodness of people. On a broader level, I have been so impressed with the way in which our profession has handled this difficult pandemic. We have been on the front lines since the beginning and can be proud of Holiday message [15 November 2020] our dedication, selflessness, and resilience. As I look ahead to 2022, I am confident that the doctors of BC will face whatever challenges arise with the same compassion and skill. Happy holidays to you all. \u2014David R.

No one knew how conta- gious the virus was, whether it affected children and adults equally, or how long the pandemic would last. My daughter was born during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. The transition of bringing a new life into this world alongside the constant worry of how to best take care of a newborn during a pandemic was definitely overwhelming in those first few months. What we didn't know at the time, but do now, is that SARS-CoV -2 will be with us for a long time. The worry of how the pandemic will impact babies and children in the long term, especially in terms of development and mental health, is very real and probably resonates with many other parents.Growing up in a pandemic Due to a lack of social interactions, and with public health measures such as social distancing and masking in place, children are missing out on crucial ways to hone social skills and develop language. A retrospective study from China looking at the SARS pandemic of 2003 suggested that experiencing SARS in childhood was associated with delayed milestones, including walking, saying a sentence, and dressing independently.1 That is worrisome, as this pan - demic is even more extensive and on a much larger global scale. The first few years are a crucial time in a child's development. As we try to carry on with the pandemic being our new normal, I now find it challenging to weigh the risks and benefits of trying to establish social interactions while also staying safe. I want my daughter to experience as much of a normal childhood as possible, while doing it within our family's comfort zone. The COVID-19 pandemic is undoubtedly also contributing to significant mental health concerns. A study in China investigating symp- toms of depression and anxiety among close to 2000 students in Hubei Province, the epicentre of the outbreak, showed 22.6% reported depres- sive symptoms while 18.9% reported anxiety symptoms in the last year.2 In the US, there has been a significant increase in emergency department visits related to mental health for children younger than 18 years. Compared with 2019, there was an increase of 24% in children aged 5 to 11 and an increase of 31% in those aged 12 to 17.3 This is concerning given the potential long-term impacts of this pandemic on youth for years to come. There will likely be many downstream effects, which I think all health care providers will come to deal with. Caring for a young, evolving mind can be a challenge on its own, but the pandemic adds an even more complex layer.

For some children; unfortunately, the pandemic is all they have known. My daughter thinks it is normal for peo- ple to wear masks and that we rarely have play dates indoors. Being a parent is hard enough, and the pandemic has not made it easier. If this is our new normal, then we need to find new ways to live our lives and teach our children the same. How we as adults perceive and deal with the pandemic can have an enormous impact on children's psy- chology and well-being. Constantly comparing things to the past might be a reason for disap-pointment, and constantly thinking about the past might be a reason for anxiety. Although this pandemic has taken a toll on everyone's lives, I hope that in the end it builds resilience in our future generations and we are able to one day look back and learn from it. n \u2014Yvonne Sin, MD references 1.

We have been through a lot together this past year: multiple waves of COVID-19, the most important vaccination program in BC's history, catastrophic wildfires, widespread an- tivaccination protests, and now record levels of burnout in the medical community. It is hard to see the people I care about suffer and toil as you have. And yet, the optimism I shared with you at the beginning of my term has not wa-vered. I continue to know in my heart that, no matter what happens, we will prevail. I know this because you have shown me. I have walked among heroes in the true sense of the word. Whether you fought your battles in public, in private, on the provincial stage, or one-on-one, each of you has shown courage and strength. It is inescapable. To sim- ply put one foot in front of the other as a health care worker during these times is a heroic act. And yet, some acts have been so conspicu- ously magnanimous that I will never forget them. I remember the colleagues who wrote to me in the earliest days of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign selflessly putting others first: \"Give our vaccine doses to people more vulnerable, we'll wait our turn.\" I remember the retired members who kept begging me to be given the opportu-nity to help the profession: \"Get us back on the front lines so that we can contribute once more.\" I remember the doctors who faced public attacks, yet who refused to retaliate: \"Let's seek to under - stand and educate rather than judge and belittle.\" I have lost count of the moments of sacri- fice, triumphant successes, and heartbreaking tragedies. Through it all you have demonstrated professionalism, compassion, and most impor- tantly, humanity.My fondest memories will be of the meet- ings with you, my cherished colleagues. We shared ideas, hard realities, tears, and laughter. I also treasure the exchange of thousands of emails, text messages, and social media posts. Though COVID-19 pushed us apart physically, it drew us closer together virtually. I hope I was able to bring my best self to every encounter, just as you brought your best selves to me. I will admit that there have been low points too. Our profession is hurting in a way that it has never hurt before. We have been attacked, ridiculed, assaulted, threatened, and just plain worn down. Record numbers of our colleagues are needing and seeking help. We are paying the price for years of chronic underfunding and misallocation of resources in our health care system. In a cruel twist, we are relied upon more than ever before. In times like this, I recall the words of Mar- tin Luther King Jr.: \"...the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" We are part of that arc because medicine re- mains a just and noble profession. We cham-pion science, speak out about inequities, stand up for the vulnerable, and push back against misinformation. We are an integral part of our communities, leaders in our own right, and we are entrusted with people's very lives. Take heart that even when we are tired, even when we feel defeated, even when the loud voices of division and hate temporarily prevail, we are still part of the bending of society toward justice. Remember, too, that we continue to have much to be grateful for. We live in a free and democratic society, one in which most people respect science and in which we have main- tained a standard of living envied by many around the globe. Our society's important institutions remain strong and resilient even in the face of many challenges. And most of all, we have each other. We have been bent, but remain unbowed. We have been tested, but maintained our integrity. We are tired, but our spirit remains strong. To each and every one of you, thank you for the opportunity you gave me to serve. I wish for you continued wisdom, continued strength, and continued courage. We will prevail. n \u2014Matthew C.

The phenomenon was first described by Francis Galton in 1880 and remained relatively unknown until publication of a study conducted by a team led by Professor Adam Zeman of the University of Exeter. Hyperphantasia, the con- dition of having extremely vivid mental imagery, is the opposite of aphantasia. In a research re- port by Professor Zeman published in 2020, he describes hyper vivid visual imagery as allowing one to inspect absent items in the mind's eye, somewhat as if one was seeing them.2 My experience with aphantasia began with a report by the BBC of the condition described above. I was a practising anesthesiologist who retired in 2018 and realized that the descrip- tion of aphantasia applied to me. I subsequently took a number of tests online under the heading of Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), which confirmed my poor visual imagination. During my career in anesthesia, I made extensive use of atlases to aid me in the per- formance of regional anesthesia such as spinal and epidural anesthetics. Although moderately proficient in such techniques, I would often call on colleagues when I had an especially chal- lenging patient with obesity. In particular, one colleague who would reliably be successful in cases where I struggled had what I thought of as X-ray vision. I write this short report to bring awareness of this condition to the general medical com-munity, especially in areas where visualization may play an important role. Diagnosis of this condition is initially established by the VVIQ, which I mention above. Establishing this con- dition in medical students may help learning in areas where visualization is important and also in specialty selection. Finally, there are many resources on the Internet to explore this condition. \u2014Thomas M. D'Arcy, LRCP&SI, FRCPC Vancouver references 1. University of Exeter. Can't count sheep?

In fact, she says, \"Physicians can play a crucial role in promoting a societal return to physical activity.\" But by recommending that family physicians take on this task, and giving time-consuming examples of how they might do that, I am won- dering if Dr Pousette is aware of what province she practises in. BC MSP does not allow family physicians, or any physicians, to bill MSP for such counsel- ing or for any lifestyle or preventive counseling. This is clearly outlined in the Doctors of BC revised fees for uninsured services document (www.doctorsofbc.ca/sites/default/files/unin- sured_services1apr2021_421287.pdf ). Patients are to be billed under code A00054, which states: \"Preventative medicine counselling all forms, e.g.: health maintenance, assessment and counselling to include physical examination, smoking withdrawal and other harmful habits, weight and/or diet control, exercise programs (planning and management), stress manage- ment techniques, social support systems, estab- lishing normal sleep patterns and other forms of lifestyle counselling - per half hour $158.00.\" Dr Pousette's recommendations clearly fall under the above uninsured fee code, meaning MSP cannot be billed for such a visit. That means family doctors are left with the impos-sible choice of either doing the work and not being paid, which is clearly untenable, or saying sorry to patients who want advice for weight loss, smoking cessation, or exercise guidelines. Please, Doctors of BC, consider requesting cov- erage of such services in your next round of fee negotiations. Our patients, our families, our communities deserve it. \u2014Lesley Horton, MD, CCFP Vancouver Author replies I will leave responding to the issue of billing in relation to \"lifestyle or preventive counseling\" to those engaged in prioritizing health system spending. However, I would like to acknowl- edge that those are important conversations, particularly given the inequity of health and outcomes that have been exemplified through- out the pandemic and reported extensively else- where. Thank you, Dr Horton, for placing the topic back on the table for discussion. When this article was written and the core messages conceived, we anticipated that by No- vember 2021 much of COVID-19 would be in the rearview mirror.

Sadly, we are still facing the strain of a fourth wave. The capacity of family physicians to engage in these conversations is recognizably depen- dent on their practice contexts, their commu- nity resources, and their own comfort with and knowledge of the topic. The suggestions offered in the article were provided in response to re- quests from physicians for specific information that would assist them in promoting physical activity to whatever extent is feasible in their roles as physicians. There was no intent to add burden to physicians who already have a full plate, but rather to enhance opportunities for physicians to be part of a large cross-sectoral strategy to enable British Columbians from all walks of life, across the life course, to benefit from health-enhancing physical activity. The province of BC's comprehensive physi- cal activity strategy, Active People, Active Plac- es,1 and the 2020 update2 documents provide a framework for collective action by multiple stakeholders. Physicians belong at the imple- mentation table and have much to offer at mul- tiple levels\u2014from what happens in our offices to advocating for policy and spending priorities. Collectively, we can make a difference, just as we have in the areas of seatbelts, helmets, and smoking cessation. \u2014Anne Pousette, MD, MPH Council on Health Promotion references 1.

BC Family Doctors replies BC Family Doctors was asked to provide a response to Dr Horton's letter regarding the article \"Re-embracing physical activity after COVID-19: What is the physician's role?\" The article highlighted the critical role that fam- ily physicians play in promoting a return to physical activity and other health promotion activities. Dr Horton correctly pointed out, however, that this care, as with many health promotion activities, is currently not payable by MSP as an insured service. This discussion highlights a disconnect be- tween the practice of medicine and the current fee-for-service system in BC. Under the Gen- eral Preamble of the MSC Payment Schedule,1 the fees are for \"services which are medically required for the diagnosis and/or treatment of a patient.\" The Preamble further states that, \"when services are provided for simple educa- tion alone. . . such services are not appropriately claimed under fee-for-service listings.\" As a result, the uninsured fee A00054 exists in the Doctors of BC Fee Guide for Uninsured Ser- vices2 to enable private billing for preventive medicine counseling of all forms. Community-based longitudinal family phy- sicians can bill chronic disease management3 fees for providing guideline-informed care, including encouragement of physical activ- ity, for patients with specific health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and congestive heart failure). Similarly, this small cohort of physicians can also provide personal health risk assessment4 visits with at-risk patients, includ - ing patients with physical inactivity. However, this fee is limited to 100 patients per calendar year per physician. These fee code limitations make it almost impossible to provide primary care that is in- clusive of health promotion activities recom- mended by Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion. The current Payment Schedule is a complex, antiquated document that does not reflect modern medical practice or sup - port patient-centred appropriate care. Despite the agreed-upon direction for primary care transformation,5 family physicians have lim- ited ability to provide comprehensive, equi- table, high-quality care due to current fee-code constraints. BC Family Doctors believes that we need to modernize and create equity in physician compensation.6 This requires a comprehensive review of the MSC Payment Schedule, includ- ing updating the General Preamble. Together with the introduction of alternate payment models, fee-for-service modernization will align current medical practice with the values and goals of our health care system. As we emerge from the pandemic, we need to con- sider how we build a stronger, more equitable health care system that meets the needs of all British Columbians. \u2014Renee Fernandez, MD, CCFP Executive Director, BC Family Doctors references 1.

The re-activation was made to address the increased costs of providing immunizations during COVID-19. In addition, pertussis immunization in pregnancy has been added to the list of im- munizations for which these fee codes can be billed. This has been a publicly funded vaccina- tion in BC since November 2020. Both temporary respiratory immunization fee codes are effective for dates of service on or after 1 October 2021, with an end date of 30 April 2022. Details of the fee T10040 Respiratory immunization for pa- tients 19 years of age or older (with visit): Payable for influenza (using ICD-9 code V048) and pneumococcal (using ICD-9 code V05) and pertussis during pregnancy (using ICD-9 code V036) immunizations. Payable in full with an office visit. If the primary purpose of the service is for immunization, bill fee item 10041 using ICD-9 code V048 for influenza, and/or V05 for pneumococcal and/or V036 for pertussis during pregnancy.

Not payable with an office visit.#BePelvic healthAware: Starting conversations about pelvic health One of every two women will experience one or more pelvic floor symptoms dur- ing her lifetime. Led by Dr Roxana Geof - frion, urogynecologist and UBC researcher, a Vancouver-based team launched www.bepelvic healthaware.ca and an accompanying social media campaign to promote pelvic floor health by sharing best practices. The website is home to four whiteboard animation videos, with more to come. Through simple images and plain language, the videos aim to illustrate best practice clinical guidelines on pelvic health and prevention of disease from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada. So far, the videos cover pelvic health and pregnancy, obstetrical anal sphincter injuries, pessaries, and urinary incontinence. The web - site also offers information on pelvic health after childbirth, menopause-related issues, pel - vic floor disorders such as prolapse or inconti- nence, and the importance of exercise to keep healthy. Website viewers are also encouraged to submit their own questions. The goal is to provide access to medical information on these sensitive topics and empower people to speak to their providers about childbirth trauma, healing, and prevention of further disease. The website and its resources are also aimed at women's health care providers looking to direct their patients to simple evidence-based information on pelvic floor health during preg- nancy and beyond.

Our article clearly shows a low rate of unplanned admissions and readmissions in patients who receive their surgery at the Jim Pattison Outpatient Clinic and Surgery Cen- tre ( JPOCSC). As mentioned in the article, our criteria for eligibility for surgery at this centre are clearly defined (ASA 1 or 2 and no history of significant sleep apnea or ad- verse reactions to general anesthetic). When all variables are controlled, the admission rate at a hospital is significantly higher than at an outpatient centre. In a previous article looking at the un- planned admission rate in breast recon - struction patients at JPOCSC and Surrey Memorial Hospital, a significant difference in admission rates was observed when all other patient variables were controlled for.1 The sur - geons and anesthetists are the same individu- als at both sites; therefore, the only remaining explanation is an institutional bias to admit. As the OR theatre staff is the same, this bias lies in the postanesthetic care units and day surgery units present in full-service hospitals. It is this inherent bias that our article hopes to change, showing that discharge rates for planned day-care surgeries can be very high, and that planned outpatient surgery centres cannot have a bias to admit. \u2014Paul Oxley, MD, FRCSC Surrey reference 1.

BC-based accredited PPE testing lab Western Canada's first accredited personal protective equipment (PPE) lab, specializing in testing and validating PPE, is a pandemic-driven innovation from Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), with support from the Ministry of Health and the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA). VCH recognized the need for a local lab that could quickly test and validate the effectiveness of PPE to provide assurance to health care workers and patients in the province. Located on the Vancouver General Hospital campus, the lab was completed in June 2020 and accredited in October 2020. The lab's initial mandate was to ensure the safety of health care workers and patients by providing testing for priority pieces of PPE, such as N95 respirators. The scope of the lab has since expanded, and the lab now offers seven tests, including tests for gowns (such as fluid resistance and hydrostatic pressure) and surgical masks (such as flammability and synthetic blood resistance) and is now available to any Canadian organization. The lab team continues to work closely with the PHSA supply chain to ensure the sup- ply of PPE obtained from new local, national, and international suppliers meets all Health Canada and WorkSafeBC regulatory requirements as well as certification requirements for the Canadian Standards Association and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. The lab is supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada, National Research Council Canada, Standards Council of Canada, BC's Ministry of Health, the University of British Columbia, the PHSA, and Providence Health Care.

Research1 by the Public Health Agency of Canada has shown that new parents in Canada often struggle to find the information they need. Additionally, access to postnatal care and re - sources is complicated by many other factors, including education level, stigma and discrimi- nation, language, income, whether parents live in rural or remote areas, and isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has made things even more difficult for new parents because they haven't been able to attend parent- ing classes or visit parenting drop-in centres. Many of the resources they would normally depend on are limited or closed due to safety protocols. SmartParent will help fill these gaps and eliminate barriers. Founded be Dr Patricia Janssen, profes - sor at UBC Faculty of Medicine's School of Population and Public Health, SmartParent was developed by researchers from UBC in collaboration with Optimal Birth BC, the BC Ministry of Health, and BC health authorities, and in consultation with pregnant and new parents, practising nurses, doctors, midwives, and experts in maternal and child health. SmartParent is modelled after the Smart- Mom program, a prenatal text messaging program that has been successfully supporting healthier pregnancies. The two programs are designed to work in tandem. SmartMom sup- ports mothers with information during each week of their pregnancy, while SmartParent continues that support for parents from the birth of their child through the first year of life. During the pilot phase, SmartMom us- ers showed lower rates of gestational diabetes and healthier pregnancy weights, and were less likely to smoke during their pregnan- cies than non-users. Their newborns were also healthier. How SmartParent works Parents receive three messages every week, each with a link to further information online. The messages are tailored to the infant's age and stage of development to help guide parents through each week of their baby's first year. The information is provided in an engaging, accessible format, intended to complement the information and support provided by parents' health care providers. Information parents will receive Comprehensive, evidence-based information covers everything from growth and develop- mental milestones, infant safety, feeding and sleeping, follow-up and screening procedures, and vaccinations. SmartParent also provides information for parents about mental health and self-care.

Together, they used the \"breathing and weav - ing\" approach, an adaptation of the appreciative inquiry method, to discuss health care priorities. The outcomes of the workshop included the devel- opment of relationships among participants that were built on trust, mutual understanding, and respect; an increased appreciation of participa- tory, decolonized workshop design that included traditional healing; and a commitment to ongoing collaboration and health care system transforma- tion to improve health and wellness service access and outcomes. Health care system partners in BC are shifting away from siloed approach- es to the planning and delivering of primary care and toward approaches that are socially accountable1 and reflect the needs and strengths of all health partners: citizens, clini- cians, policymakers, educators, and linked sec- tor and health administrators, with a particular focus on First Nations priorities2 (we use BC to refer to a geography, and acknowledge that most of what is referred to as BC is unceded First Nations territories). With this shift comes a strong step by health care partners toward one another, which is resulting in exciting and challenging collaboration opportunities. Northern BC has long been a leader in health care system collaboration and providing team-based care. The emergence of team-based primary care networks3 across the province pro- vides a framework and set of aspirations that are facilitating important further partnership work in the North, evidenced by periodic en- gagement, planning summits, and multipartner workshops. At the same time, the emergence of primary care networks also creates challenges and new collaborative opportunities in the ef- fort to reconcile a provincial effort with local realities and priorities. One such collaboration activity took place at a northern rural health summit in 2018. We describe this multipartner workshop, with a fo- cus on the design process and methodology, and the qualities of the gathering. We also provide a summary of results and reflect on the journey ahead to developing a holistic care system that is socially accountable,1 culturally safe,4 and relationship based. By sharing the process and outcomes of this workshop, health care system partners across BC will be better equipped to engage in health care system transformation that is centred on diverse perspectives on pri-mary care design; is grounded in appreciation 417 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 10 | december 2021417Markham R, Hunt M, Huebert S, Graham S clinical and respect for Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing; and provides a First Nations leadership role in health care system transfor- mation going forward. Background To address health inequities, health care sys- tem partners from the North have consistently worked together to create an integrated, ho- listic, primary care system.5 These partners are generally aligned with the view that primary care in the North needs to move toward a ho- listic care system that is not only team based but also socially accountable,1 culturally safe,4 and relationship based. To achieve health care system transformation and shift power from the existing colonized system of care toward a holistic system of care, a series of partnership development and strategies workshops were designed with key leadership from the First Nations Health Authority, northern divisions of family practice, Doctors of BC, Northern Health, and the Rural Coordination Centre of BC. The first of these workshops was held in Smithers on the unceded Gidimt'en territory of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation from 19 to 20 July 2018. The purpose of this workshop was to: Engage in dialogue and deliberation re- garding health care system improvements to allow for the best holistic patient care across the North. Build relationships between and among First Nations and health care system part - ners to enhance health services across the North. Advance priority areas regarding health care system transformation and commit to short-term action steps. Workshop design When the decision to pursue health care sys- tem transformation was established and the call for a partnership development and strate- gies workshop was made, organizers declared a desire to work in a participatory, relationship- based, equity-focused way. The Partnership Pentagram+ model2,6 [Figure 1] was used to inform meaningful collaboration, with a focus on creating an experience that amplified social accountability and First Nations values and perspectives. The model, \"embraces all partners simultaneously with an appreciative inquiry ap- proach to build upon existing strengths [as] an UBC H ealth Faculty of Medicine ch Institut eRural Scholars UBC M for Rur al Health Resear ch BC A cademi c Health S cienc e Network Health S cienc es and Social S cienc e Faculties at univ ersities and colleges acr oss BC Faculties of Nursing a t univ ersities c olleges ) Rural Coordina tion Centre of BC (RCCbc) Rural tch BC WorkSa Insur ance Corpor Rural Coordina tion Centre of BC (RC Cbc) Rural Education Action Plan (REAP )(Gener al Practice Services Committ ee (GPSC ), Shared C are, Specialist S ervices C ommitt ee (SSC ), Joint Standing F amily P ractice Im m unitiesCOMMUNITIES M AKERSMinistr y of H ealth Ministr y of Men tal H ealth and Addic tions College of M idwiv es BC M idwif ery Associa tion BC Nursing Union Nurses and Nurse P ractitioners of BC BC E mer genc y Health S ervicesCollege of F amily Physicians of Canada Health Emplo yersAssocia tion ofBC BC C ollege of Nursing Professionals of Ph ysicians and S urgeons Canadi an H ealth are Professionals Nurses/Nurse P ractitioners Physicians BC A mbulanc e Shar ed C are Industries with v ested in terest in hea lth (e.g., forestr y, oil a nd g as, mining) Non-pr o/f_its (e.g., hospital auxilia ries) BC Rur al Centre e of H S ystem Transf orma tion an C ouncil BC Rur al Health N etwork BC P atien t Safety and Qualit y CouncilFirst Na tions H ealth A uthorit y Provincial H ealth S ervices A uthorit y Island H ealth Vancouver Coastal H ealth Fraser H ealth Northern H ealth Interior H ealth Providenc e Health BC Women' s Hospital Specialists of BC Societ y of Gener al Practice Nursing P olicy Secretaria t (MoH)Join t Collabor ative Committ ees f FIgUrE 1.

Two-eyed seeing8 was also used to guide the workshop design, meaning that the meth- odology strongly focused on centring activities on traditional wellness practice and access to care provided by Indigenous traditional well- ness practitioners while still valuing Western perspectives. The Partnership Pentagram+ model was one important facet to participatory planning; using an equity-focused, intersectional approach was also imperative. Historically, people who iden- tify as men have dominated the health leader- ship space;9,10 however, women represent 80% of health service sector workers.11 Additionally, First Nations people experience disproportion- ally negative health outcomes due to systemic barriers, such as racism, in health care, 12,13 and First Nations health leaders are frequently not included in the planning processes, or are in-cluded in a tokenistic way. 14 To address these inequities, Indigenous fe- male health leaders were intentionally at the forefront of all workshop planning processes to ensure that gender and racial power imbal- ances were addressed and the planning work was grounded in appreciation and respect for Indigenous ways of knowing and being. A working group was formed, which facilitated preworkshop engagement activities, including interviews, First Nations community engage-ment, and an environmental scan. Based on the information obtained from the preworkshop engagement process, a pre- liminary agenda was formed, and five priority areas were established: Catchment and patient flow: understanding the pattern of patient-doctor usage, the level of engagement with doctors across different geographical locations in Northern BC, and whether services provided across the region are equitable. First Nations engagement: including First Nations as part of the integrated health care system team, and ensuring that health care is culturally safe and integrates traditional healers and engages Elders. Health and human resource needs and de- velopment directions: including a focus on the potential for collaboration among partners to address ongoing human resource shortages in the North. Team-based care: moving away from the conventional health care system to a new in- tegrated, team-based system of care. Stakeholder engagement: understanding the different roles in team-based care and the most appropriate level of involvement to avoid burnout. The agenda was sent to all workshop invi- tees, and an opportunity to share feedback was provided to allow for the maintenance of trans- parency and to guarantee that all participants had the same information prior to the work- shop. To further enable meaningful collabora-tion, a range of supports, such as honorariums and travel assistance, were offered to reduce participation barriers and facilitate inclusion at the workshop. Workshop event By engaging in an intentional workshop de - velopment process that centred on diverse per- spectives, social accountability, cultural safety, and relationship building, the stage was set for collaborative work and systems change. More than 70 participants attended the gathering throughout the 2-day event, including part- ners from Northern Health, the First Nations Health Authority, northern divisions of family practice, medical staff associations, the Ministry of Health, academia, First Nations communi-ties, and the community at large. The first day of the event was led and facili- tated entirely by female leaders from the First Nations Health Authority. As a result, a strong presence of traditional medicine and ways of healing were incorporated into the workshop to exemplify a way to shift from the existing colonized health care system toward a more culturally safe system of care. For instance, at the workshop entrance, there was a table with a thoughtful curation of medicines of the region, such as cedar and sage, and an ethnography\u2014 Our Box Was Full\u2014which explores the struggle of the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en peoples to \"prove they existed.\" By sharing Our Box Was Full with participants, workshop organizers were respectfully honoring the land on which the workshop was being held, and were invit-ing the participants to recognize the pathways to wellness and health that the Wet'suwet'en First Nation and Gitxsan Nation have been practising since time immemorial on their ter- ritories. Participants were also invited to partake in traditional wellness sessions with traditional healers from the Adah' Dene Cultural Healing Camp Society. Workshop participants expressed gratitude for this opportunity to experience tra- ditional healing and be shown how traditional medicine can be a part of a holistic health care system. In the words of one participant, \"It was an honor to be able to directly access traditional wellness care in the context of our workshop. It helped me better understand how this care can be offered alongside traditional primary care. It also helped me relax and get grounded in positive ways.\" During the opening remarks, the First Na- tions Health Authority ensured that the event would be framed with an Indigenous worldview and perspective by inviting an ongoing dialogue about cultural safety and humility.4 Everyone was encouraged to partake in a cultural safety and humility pledge in order to meaningfully participate in the work [Figure 2]. First Nations people experience disproportionally negative health outcomes due to systemic barriers, such as racism, in health care, and First Nations health leaders are frequently not included in the planning processes, or are included in a tokenistic way.419 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 10 | december 2021419Markham R, Hunt M, Huebert S, Graham S clinical A series of presentations followed, which were equally connected to Indigenous ways of being, knowing, and doing. Information was shared about First Nations Health Author- ity operations, traditional wellness practices in health care, and cultural safety, humility, and trauma-informed care. The second day focused on partnership-based dialogue using the Breathing and Weaving model [Figure 3], an adaptation of the ap - preciative inquiry method, to discuss the five key priority areas that were identified before the workshop (catchment and patient flow, First Nations engagement, health and human resources, team-based care, and stakeholder engagement). Four dialogue rounds were held: 1. Discover (partners): What does success look like now in regard to the given priority area? What does success look like for patients and community care? How do we build on this success? 2. Dream (peers): What are the implications of dialogue round 1 for your work moving forward? 3. Design (partners): What short-term prac - tical actions can we perform to help us make progress toward our destination in 1 to 2 years? FIgUrE 2. Cultural safety and humility pledge.

Deliver (peers): What can we commit to doing that will contribute to implementing the actions identified in dialogue round 3? Each round was supplemented with episodic whole group discussions. The conversations al- ternated between discussing priority areas for partnership group and peer group commit- ments/priority action items. Partnership groups consisted of people from different organizations or groups coming together to discuss one of the five priority areas. Peer groups involved only people from the same organization or group to narrate and theorize about each priority area. The four rounds of dialogue started and ended with plenary sessions, and were completed in 1 day. Each of the six peer groups assigned peer members to attend one of the five priority part- nership discussions to ensure that peers from across the six groups participated in each prior - ity area [Figure 3]. Peers then reported on the discussions of each priority area partnership group and had a specific peer-based discussion about possible action items and commitments. From these conversations, goals were de- veloped, and short-term practical actions were created by both partnership groups and peer groups. By mixing the groups for generative dialogue and then coming back together for organizational, specific, peer-based discussions, the commitments made included the diverse perspectives across stakeholder groups. Outcomes Relationship development The primary focus and outcome of the event was relationship development. Workshop par- ticipants shared that by coming together in a socially accountable way, relationships were built on trust, mutual understanding, and re- spect. This resulted in partners feeling excited to continue the collaboration process, and led to the creation of additional workshops focused on establishing a holistic system of care. Upon workshop completion, participants (n = 41) were asked to rate their partnership development experience before and after the workshop on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very good and 5 being very poor. There was a marked increase in average scores for both questions, which indicated an increase in knowledge of the work other partners were engaged in and an increased interest in working with other partners [Table 1]. The workshop also supported positive developments in several health care system partner relationships, especially between the First Nations Health Authority and the Ru-ral Coordination Centre of BC. The gather- ing helped set the groundwork for a signed Memorandum of Understanding, which has facilitated a deepening of service collabora- tion, especially in virtual services across the province. Moreover, the First Nations Health Authority also invited the Rural Coordination Centre of BC to its Northern Regional Caucus meetings as an expression of inclusion and new collaboration. Because of the workshop, these relationships have established a foundation based on reciprocity and respect that contin- ues to support innovation for enhanced social accountability to First Nations rural patients and providers.Increased valuing of participatory, decolonized workshop design Prior to the workshop, participants across stake- holder groups in Northern BC had not come together in a participatory and decolonized way. The event helped establish increased valuing and appreciation of participatory workshop design that includes traditional healing. Sys- tem partners had the opportunity to experience traditional wellness approaches, and developed a new appreciation for the power of traditional medicine, ceremony, and healing practices. This outcome would not have been possible without intentionally developing a cross-sectoral work - ing group to design the event. In order to measure the value of coming together collaboratively, participants (n = 41) were asked to rate their experiences on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very good and 5 being very poor [Table 2]. Each category was rated very good or good.

Commitments to ongoing collaboration and health care system transformationEach peer group made a commitment to con-tinue engaging in health care system transfor- mation. While the capacity to work toward health care system transformation varied, each commitment was rooted in developing a holistic care system that is socially accountable, cultur- ally safe, and relationship based. Because each peer group committed to con- tinuing the work in a good way, the foundation was set for future gatherings to flourish. Since the first event in 2018, two other system-wide workshops have taken place: one in Vancou- ver (2019), and one virtually (2020). The re - sults of these collaborative efforts included the following: Establishment of the First Nations Primary Care Initiative, which was created by the First Nations Health Authority and Min - istry of Health, and involves setting up 15 First Nations-led primary care centres. Establishment of the Real Time Virtual Services, including the full suite of virtual provider support services, the First Na - tions Virtual Doctor of the Day, and the First Nations Virtual Substance Use and Psychiatry Services. Commitment to conduct ongoing collab - orative planning sessions among regional health authorities, Divisions of Family Practice, the Ministry of Health, the Rural Coordination Centre of BC, academic part - ners, the First Nations Health Authority, and First Nations representatives. Conclusions The workshop provided an opportunity for key stakeholders to work toward developing part- nerships and strategies to transform health care systems in Northern BC. There was momentum to transform the relationship between the colo- nized health care system and First Nations; however, the organizers are not blind to the fact that there is still long way to go. Because this work is a lifelong commitment, there will always be more work to be done. By illuminating to others the process being undertaken in the North, there is hope that health care system partners across BC will be better equipped to engage in health care sys- tem transformation that is based on diverse perspectives and is grounded in appreciation and respect for Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

One form of the disease, squamous chronic otitis media, features an accumulation of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear, known as a cholesteatoma, which can result in erosion of the ear's bony structures. Labyrinthine erosion leads to vertigo and perma- nent sensorineural hearing loss. In this study, two patients in their mid-80s presented with hearing loss and vertigo. In the first case, the patient was treated for osteomyelitis but later reported addi- tional symptoms. An urgent tympanomastoidec - tomy improved his vertigo symptoms, but mastoid cavity related otorrhea requires repeated treat - ment with topical antibiotic ear drops and clean-Mohammed Abdelmalek, BSc, Desmond A. Nunez, media and labyrinthine fistula: The importance of vertigo symptoms Two clinical cases demonstrate the need for physicians to maintain their vigilance for chronic otitis media and its complications, which can be life threatening, even in patients who do not have poor determinants of health, and to provide early intervention. Mr Abdelmalek is a medical student undertaking research in the Division of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia. Dr Nunez is an associate professor in the Division of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, and an attending surgeon in the Division of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Vancouver General Hospital.

An urgent tympanomastoidectomy relieved her vertigo, but her hearing was unchanged. Given that a chronic otitis media diagnosis is seldom considered by many clinicians in more economically developed countries, despite the disease's potential to cause life-changing complications or death, physicians are encouraged to consider it as a diagnosis in patients presenting with hearing loss, vertigo, and other features of ear disease. Otitis media, inflammation of the middle ear, comprises a spectrum of diseases, the most common of which affects children within their first 5 years of life.1 Otitis media can be broadly categorized as acute or chronic, or otitis media with effusion.2 Chronic otitis media is differentiated from the others by the presence of long-term tympanic membrane changes, such as a perforation or retraction pocket.3 Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other anaerobes are the common bacteriologi - cal isolates in chronic otitis media. Risk factors for its development include low socioeconomic status, tobacco smoke exposure, malnutrition, and family history.4 Chronic otitis media is significantly less prevalent in non-Indigenous populations in more economically developed countries such as Canada relative to less eco- nomically developed countries.1 The prevalence varies tions to 43% populations.2,5,6 The common presenting features of chronic otitis media are hearing loss and otorrhea.1 The World Health Organization Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Develop- ment and Team for Prevention of Blindness and Deafness recommends that patients with chronic otitis media who present with a newly discharging untreated ear or persistently dis- charging ear despite initial treatment can be managed in primary care with topical antibiot- ics for 2 to 4 weeks. They also recommend that the diagnosis be confirmed by a trained otosco- pist.6 Topical quinolones like ciprofloxacin are the preferred first-line antibiotics.4 Antibiotic treatment should be initiated at the first con- sultation, providing that patients clean their ears prior to applying the medication. In cases of persistent or recurrent otorrhea, antibiotic resistance should be considered, and a bacterial culture should be obtained if available.6 Patients who present with a discharging ear accompanied by symptoms of headache, fever, and dizziness or other danger signs require urgent otolaryngology referral for consideration of mas- toidectomy because of the possibility of intra- or extracranial disease extension.6 Untreated chronic 423 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 10 | december 2021423Abdelmalek M, Nunez DA clinical otitis media can lead to several complications, in- cluding life-threatening intracranial abscesses and meningitis, as well as life-changing facial paralysis and labyrinthitis due to permanent sensorineural hearing loss.7-9 The keratinized squamous epithelium in the middle ear or mastoid.10,11 The pathogenesis of cholesteatomas is uncertain; however, one ex- planation suggests that they form from retraction pockets of the pars flaccida that by pressure necrosis, among other mecha- nisms, thereby leading to labyrinthine facial nerve bony canal and skull base erosions.13-15 Progressive labyrinthine bone erosion can ultimately result in a labyrinthine fistula that presents classically with symptoms of hearing loss, vertigo, and dis- equilibrium. Nystagmus elicited by the fistula test, which stimulates vestibular receptors by applying intermittent positive pressure to the outer ear canal, is one sign of a labyrinthine fistula.3 Facial nerve bony canal erosion by cholesteatoma can present with facial weakness, and some authors recommend limited surgical decompression of the canal in addition to cholesteatoma removal.9 Severe otalgia or headache in a patient with otor- rhea is particularly ominous because it is sug - gestive of skull base erosion with intracranial complications.16 Initially, squamous chronic otitis media can be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, result- ing in missed early diagnoses. It is diagnosed by the typical appearance of a keratin collection in the pars flaccida on otoscopy and supported by CT temporal bone imaging. It can be easy for the clinician who is unfamiliar with the otoscopic appearance of an attic cholesteatoma to miss the diagnosis either through failing to visualize the entire pars flaccida of the tympanic membrane and adjacent deep ear canal bone or to underestimate the importance of crusting in this region. The cholesteatoma can be obscured by a superficial layer of what looks like simple ear wax [Figure 1]. The presence of opacifica-tion in the middle ear and mastoid with focal areas of bony erosion such as the scutum on CT scan is diagnostic of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. 6,11 Surgery is the mainstay of treatment of squamous chronic otitis media. Traditional- ly, mastoidectomy has been the procedure of choice and can be categorized into canal wall up (also known as intact canal wall) surgery, which preserves the posterior bony wall of the external ear canal, or canal wall down mastoidectomy surgery, which partially or completely sacri- fices the posterior bony wall of the external ear canal.10 Expanded endoscopic tympanoplasty is increasingly advocated for cholesteatomas with limited attic extension.17,18 The surgical procedure selected depends on patient, disease, and surgical factors, including expertise in the range of available procedures. We report two cases of a labyrinthine fistula complicating squamous chronic otitis media in patients who were not considered to be at risk of suffering from the disease. In both cases, the correct diagnosis was not made until diz- ziness or vertigo had developed secondary to semicircular canal erosion. We highlight the need for physicians to make a timely diagnosis of chronic otitis media and initiate treatment early to prevent the development of complica- tions of the disease. Case data Case 1 An 82-year-old male presented to the emergen- cy department with right-sided hearing loss and rhythmic oscillation of objects to the right in his visual field, accompanied by a \"side-to-side rocking sensation.\" His medical history includ- ed a similar episode 2 years earlier of visual symptoms and right-sided hearing loss, though with right otorrhea, tinnitus, fever, lassitude, and decreased appetite. A course of antibiotics at that time resolved his symptoms except for the right-sided hearing loss and intermittent tinnitus. A head CT scan with contrast dem- onstrated opacification of the right mastoid air cells, and a diagnosis of osteomyelitis was made by an infectious diseases specialist. The patient was prescribed a 6-week course of clindamycin and ciprofloxacin and was referred to an oto-laryngology clinic following its completion. When seen in the otolaryngology clinic, he reported gradual resolution of the initial symptoms but new onset mild morning head- aches, momentary dizziness on turning his head to the right, and unsteadiness when standing solely on his right leg. On otoscopy, the right ear demonstrated a cholesteatoma filling the attic, while the rest of the tympanic membrane appeared intact. Halmagyi-Curthoys head im- pulse and fistula tests were negative. Tuning fork testing at 512 Hz showed a positive bilateral Rinne response and Weber lateralization to the right. A temporal bone CT scan was ordered and demonstrated opacification of the right at- tic and mastoid air cell system, and erosion of the scutum, ossicular chain, lateral semicircular canal, and bone over the tympanic segment of FIgUrE 1.

The patient was scheduled for an urgent tympano- mastoidectomy. At surgery, a canal wall down mastoidectomy exposed a cholesteatoma. The head of the malleus and body of the incus bones were removed. Cholesteatoma was cleared from the mastoid air cells along with the cholestea- toma sac, including that covering the lateral semicircular bony canal dehiscence. The canal dehiscence was repaired with perichondrium. Harvested temporalis fascia, cartilage, and peri- chondrium were used to line the mastoid cavity and reconstruct the tympanic membrane. The patient was discharged the same day with no complications. Seven months following the surgery, the patient reported slight improvement in his bal- ance, no change in the hearing in his right ear, and only occasional right-sided tinnitus. He still experienced right otorrhea, which required topi- cal antibiotic ear drops and repeat attendance for cleaning of the mastoid cavity. Case 2 An 83-year-old female presented to a general otolaryngologist head and neck surgeon with a 5-year history of bilateral hearing loss and 1-month history of intermittent left-sided tin- nitus. Additionally, she reported two episodes of vertigo in the previous month, described as a sudden tilt of the environment triggered by having the left ear syringed or by undergoing a hearing test. The patient had presented 2 years previously to the same otolaryngologist, who identified a moderate to severe left conduc- tive hearing loss and mild to moderate right sensorineural hearing loss with a normal left pars flaccida. A left myringotomy and tympa- nostomy tube placement were undertaken at that time when polypoid tissue was found to be filling the middle ear space. On follow-up, the middle ear had returned to normal, though a residual tympanic membrane perforation persisted. A hearing aid was prescribed. Otoscopy on the patient's current presenta- tion demonstrated an attic retraction pocket of the left tympanic membrane with granulation tissue. A temporal bone CT scan was done, which identified soft tissue in the epitympanum, erosion of the left lateral semicircular canal, and possible erosion of the bone overlying the horizontal segment of the facial nerve canal and the mastoid bone adjacent to the middle and posterior fossa dura. The left mastoid air cells were opacified [Figure 3]. The patient was urgently referred to an otologist/neurotologist for consideration of surgery. Otomicroscopy in the otology clinic dem- onstrated a left attic retraction pocket with granulation tissue, cholesteatoma, and dis- charge, along with a less than 5% perforation of the posterior inferior quadrant of the left tympanic membrane. The patient was scheduled for an urgent tympanomastoidectomy. Pre - operative masked bone conduction pure tone audiometry demonstrated a mild to moderate downward sloping sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. The hearing loss was mixed and moderate to severe in the left ear, with bone conduction thresholds identical to those in the right ear, but there was an added air-bone gap. Tympanometry recorded a Jerger type A tympanogram in the right ear and type B in the left ear, with ear canal volumes within the normal range bilaterally. At surgery, an extensive cholesteatoma was removed via an intact canal wall tympanomas- toidectomy. The skull base was eroded, which exposed dura in the tegmen of the middle ear and mastoid. The lateral and superior semi- circular canals were partly eroded. Harvested temporalis fascia and bone chips were used to repair the canal dehiscences. The patient was observed as an inpatient for 24 hours, then was discharged home without complication. Six months following the surgery, the pa- tient had no otorrhea or vertigo. An audiogram confirmed that her hearing was unchanged. Her left tympanic membrane was intact. Follow-up imaging, including a temporal bone CT scan, at 1 year demonstrated a resolution of the middle ear and mastoid opacification [Figure 4].

In particular, the patient reported hearing loss and otorrhea, the primary diag- nostic symptoms of chronic otitis media, and symptoms suggestive of nystagmus, which he reported as a perception of jerking motions when he looked at objects. The new onset of symptoms of nystagmus, coupled with a back-ground of long-standing hearing loss and in-termittent otorrhea, was indicative of a lateral semicircular canal fistula complication of squa- mous chronic otitis media. The patient was ul- timately referred to an otolaryngology clinic, where microotoscopic examination confirmed a diagnosis of chronic squamous otitis media, and high-resolution temporal bone CT scan images better delineated the lateral semicircu-lar canal fistula that was evident on the initial head CT scan. The lateral semicircular canal fistula was previously interpreted to be due to skull base osteomyelitis. This case highlights the importance of thorough otoscopic evalua- tion, including microotoscopy, in the workup of patients with features of ear discharge and hearing loss. Early identification of the charac- teristic otoscopic findings of squamous chronic otitis media would have expedited appropriate treatment. In Case 2, the new onset of vertigo triggered by pressure change in the outer ear was highly suggestive of a labyrinthine fistula, as confirmed by the temporal bone CT scan. Canal wall down mastoidectomy with cholesteatoma removal but preservation of the cholesteatoma matrix over the area of eroded lateral semicircular canal bone is the traditional surgical management of a middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma compli- cated by a lateral canal fistula.19 Advancements in MRI techniques and the established safety of controlled removal of the cholesteatoma matrix with preservation of inner ear function makes it unnecessary to undertake canal wall down mastoidectomy routinely in lateral canal fistula cases.20,21 Follow-up imaging at 1 year in Case 2 demonstrated the safety of an intact canal wall mastoidectomy approach. The literature shows that chronic otitis media is more prevalent in less economically developed countries and among more mar- ginalized segments of the population in more economically developed countries. These two cases illustrate the need for physicians to watch for this disease and its complications, even in patients who do not have poor determinants of health. The complications of chronic otitis media are still life threatening or life changing, and require early intervention. Summary Chronic otitis media can occur in economically developed countries in patients who have no significant comorbidities or poor determinants of health. Given the disease's ability to cause se- vere complications, including death, competent otoscopic evaluation, including microotoscopy, should be undertaken or arranged urgently in patients with the characteristic symptoms of otorrhea and hearing loss who present with features of complications such as nystagmus and vertigo. Maintaining a high degree of vigi- lance will help ensure that patients with com- plications are identified early, and the required surgical interventions are expedited to achieve satisfactory patient outcomes. n Competing interests Dr Nunez receives remuneration for providing in- dependent medical expert neurotological opin- ions.

Within this population, cardiac implantable electronic devices are common. Thus, In June 2016, the Parliament of Canada passed federal legislation that allows eli- gible Canadian adults to request medi- cal assistance in dying (MAID). In Canada, two methods of assisted dying are available: self-administration and ingestion of oral medi- cations that cause death, or more commonly, cli- nician administration of prescribed intravenous medications that cause death. At least 13 946 Canadians have received MAID since Quebec law and the federal legislation was introduced.1 The number of reported cases increased 26.1% between 2018 and 2019, and all provinces have experienced a steady year-over-year increase in numbers since the law was introduced in 2016.1 Cardiovascular conditions are present in 10.1% of individuals in Canada who are eli- gible for medical assistance in dying. Within this population, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such as permanent pacemak- ers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are common: more than 200 000 of these patients are currently living with such a device.2 Every year, approximately 30 000 Canadi- ans receive a new pacemaker or ICD, resulting in a significant cumulative number of indi- viduals living with CIEDs, especially in the 55 to 80 year age group, which also constitutes the largest proportion of medically assisted deaths. Thus, there is a need to understand the physiological effects of these devices in there is a need to understand the physiological effects of these devices in patients who choose medical assistance in dying, and the role and scope of reprogramming, deactivation, and other man- agement strategies for the devices. The drugs used in medical assistance in dying result in a cascade of physiological effects that result in loss of myo - cardial contractility. The cardiac implantable elec - tronic device may continue to electrically activate the heart, but a contraction will not result, and the heart will not effectively pump blood. These devices have adjustable parameters to optimize performance, which may be changed with special computers or can be reprogrammed with unique magnets. At the time of medical assistance in dying, a permanent pacemaker will electrically stimu- late the heart, but eventually, the myocardium will no longer contract. Placing a magnet over an implantable cardioverter defibrillator disables the device's ability to detect ventricular arrhythmia and helps avoid any defibrillation during dying. Under - standing the consequences of deactivating the defibrillating function of the device is important. If it is deactivated prematurely, the patient may die prior to their planned time and location. The process and options regarding cardiac implantable electronic devices deactivation or reprogramming, and potential manifestations at the time of medical assistance in dying should be discussed with the recipient, with the advice and support from the medical assistance in dying provider and cardiac implantable electronic devices clinic team member.427 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 10 | december 2021427Chakrabarti S, Gibson JA, Bennett MT, Toma M, Verma AT, Chow R, Plewes L, Redpath CJ, Mond\u00e9sert B, Sterns L, Krahn AD clinical patients who choose medical assistance in dying. There is also a need to understand the role and scope of reprogramming, deactiva- tion, and other management strategies for pacemakers and defibrillators in this group of patients. Throughout Canada, provincial laws out- line individuals' rights in relation to health care decision making and consent, including the right to accept or refuse health care treat- ments. Individuals who are capable of making decisions have a legal right to refuse health care treatments. This includes the discontinu- ation or withdrawal of medical treatments or interventions, even if it results in natural death. A CIED constitutes medical treatment, and thus can be discontinued, regardless of the nature of illness and whether the device prevents natural death from the underlying pathology. Pacemaker deactivation is a withdrawal of therapy, not a mechanism of assisted dying. If a person who has requested medical assistance in dying also specifically asks to have their per- manent pacemaker deactivated, this decision/ conversation should be explored as a parallel process, which is typically defined by a region or pacemaker clinic. The Heart Rhythm Society outlined the process of deactivating ICDs and pacemakers,3 and the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society recently embarked on a process to define pacemaker deactivation, which is expected to be completed in the near future. We review CIEDs for primary care pro- viders and any other provider who is involved in the care planning and management of pa - tients who are seeking an assisted death. An explanation of the physiological implications of pacemakers and ICDs in the context of as- sisted dying is reviewed. Device deactivation, reprogramming, and other management is- sues for these devices are also explicated. Our goals are to: 1. Focus on the patient-centred management of patients with pacemakers and ICDs who are seeking medical assistance in dying. 2. Define the scope and role of the cardiology and device care teams in providing support to the MAID recipient, primary care pro - viders, and MAID provider(s). 3. Provide a management scheme to guide the primary care and MAID provider team in caring for a patient who is pursing medical assistance in dying and who has a pace - maker or ICD. Overview of cardiac implantable electronic devices Cardiac implantable electronic devices are a group of regulatory therapies that support cardiac function by restoring the body's ho- meostatic equilibrium. They include implant- able cardioverter defibrillators, which correct life-threatening arrhythmias. Other devices provide constitutive therapies that help restore lost function but do not replace the original organ or body part. They include permanent pacemakers, which restore or back up a patient's heart rate to normal range. CIEDs, which are surgically implanted and managed by specialized cardiology teams, are used to improve and extend the patient's quality and duration of life by preventing or treating arrhythmia-related sudden death. Conversely, medical assistance in dying is a life-ending pro - cedure. Therefore, it is vital to have a collabora- tive approach between the patient, primary care, cardiology, and MAID program team members. Pacemakers Permanent pacemakers are cardiac implant - able electronic devices that correct pathological bradycardia. A pacemaker works primarily by increasing the heart rate by delivering a small electric energy pulse of typically short duration (0.4 to 1.0 millisecond) to activate the myocar - dium to contract. Of the various types of pacemakers, implantable ones are the most commonly used to correct symptomatic bradycardia. Other pacemakers function as cardiac resynchroni- zation therapy pacemakers, which can improve heart failure in select patients in the presence or absence of a symptomatic bradycardia. Most patients who receive pacemakers have an intrinsic underlying heart rhythm. In one study, 59% of patients who were deemed to be pacemaker \"dependent\" during follow-up had some form of an underlying electrical cardiac rhythm.4 When the pacemaker was temporar- ily deactivated, only 13% of patients had a true dependency on the device. Those patients had no intrinsic heart rate at all, and the pacemaker provided complete circulatory support; that is, constitutive replacement therapy. that de- liver a defibrillation shock to the heart during a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrilla- tion. The defibrillators are implanted in patients who have a high risk of cardiac arrest, or after resuscitation from life-threatening ventricu- lar arrhythmias. Most ICDs also have cardiac pacing capability; therefore, they can provide simultaneous treatment of bradycardia. How- ever, the uncommon subcutaneous ICD does not have traditional pacing capability. Some ICD recipients also have bradycardia or heart failure and use the ICD pacemaker or resyn-chronization function. Physiological response to pharmaceuticals used in medically assisted deaths A medically assisted death involves admin- istration or ingestion of medications that in- duce several physiological effects that result in sedation and amnesia, then complete loss of consciousness and deep coma, followed by paralysis, subsequent cardiorespiratory arrest, and ultimately, death. In clinician-administered medical assis- tance in dying, a provider administers various medications intravenously. The goal of these medications is to induce coma, neuromuscular muscle paralysis, and cardiac arrest while also We review cardiac implantable electronic devices for primary care providers and any other provider who is involved in the care planning and management of patients who are seeking an assisted death. 428 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 10 | december 2021428clinical Pacemaker and defibrillator management in medical assistance in dying providing the recipient complete loss of con- sciousness. Medications include a sedative and amnesic (e.g., midazolam), (e.g., rocuronium or cisatracurium). Self-administered medical assistance in dying involves the ingestion of oral medications that result in a deep coma and eventually cardio- pulmonary arrest. The pharmacological impacts of the drugs used in medical assistance in dying result in a cascade of physiological effects that occur in a very predictable order. Following the on-set of deep coma, subsequent respiratory de-pression and ultimately apnea produce severe acidosis and hypoxemia with resultant loss of myocardial contractility. With the loss of the physiological ability to achieve myocardial con- traction, any electrical pacing impulse delivered via pacemaker or ICD will fail to achieve myo- cardial contraction with cardiac output, with or without pulseless electrical activity or cardiac electromechanical dissociation.5 That is, the CIED may continue to electrically activate the heart, but a contraction will not result, and the heart will not effectively pump blood. Propofol can cause hypotension, which does not affect CIED function. Ingested barbiturates reduce mean arterial pressures, venous tone, and cardiac output but usually do not have di- rect myocardial effects. However, in the dose administered, they result in respiratory depres- sion with severe hypoxemia and acidosis, with the consequent effect on the myocardium. In certain instances, bupivacaine has been used to induce asystole in medical assistance in dying. In general, neuromuscular blocking agents have no discernible cardiovascular effects in the dosages used. Deactivating and reprogramming cardiac devices All cardiac implantable electronic devices have adjustable parameters to optimize performance, which may be changed with special comput- ers (programmers) [Figure 1]. These are usu- ally available in pacemaker clinics, emergency rooms, or inpatient settings in specialized hos- pitals that offer the CIED clinic services. Pacemakers and ICDs can also be temporarily reprogrammed with unique CIED magnets [Figure 2], which are available in emergency departments, pacemaker clinics, and resuscitation crash carts. The magnets influence the electronic circuits of the CIED when held close to the device. They are usually applied di- rectly on the skin that overlies the CIED, which is typically implanted in the infra-clavicular area but may be implanted in the axillary or subcostal region in some individuals [Figure 3].Pacemakers Placing a device magnet over a pacemaker does not deactivate the device but makes it deliver pac - ing at a fast rate of 80 to100 beats per minute due to temporary reprogramming. Pacemakers do not give any alerts when a magnet is applied to them. At the time of medical assistance in dy- ing, the permanent pacemaker will electrically stimulate the heart with or without tempo- rary reprogramming by a magnet, but eventu- ally, the myocardium will no longer contract.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators Placing a magnet over an thus inacti- vating the function while keeping the pacing programming active. On establishing contact with the magnet, the ICD responds with an alert (auditory beep or vibration). Thus, a key implication for supporting dying patients who have these defibrillators is to ensure that all persons involved are aware that a beep may be audible, which will stop after several seconds. The defibrillation function stays off as long as the magnet remains on the defibrillator. At the moment the magnet is removed, the defibrilla- tion function will resume. Taping the magnet will ensure it remains in place and will help avoid any defibrillation during dying. Several mechanisms may cause cardiac ar- rest during medical assistance in dying: severe bradycardia/asystole, loss of myocardial con- tractility with intact electrical activation (pulse- less electrical activation), or rapid ventricular arrhythmia. If ICD shock therapy is not de- activated, the device will deliver multiple de- fibrillation shocks to the heart when there is a ventricular arrhythmia-related cardiac arrest, which may be disturbing to all who are present. After ICD shock therapy has been deactivated, the pacemaker function of the defibrillator may try to pace the heart but eventually will not be able to activate the heart muscle as medical as- sistance in dying is being completed. Understanding the consequences of deacti- vating the defibrillating function of the ICD is important. Should the defibrillator be deacti- vated prematurely, the patient who has requested medical assistance in dying may experience a ventricular arrhythmia (for which the ICD was originally placed) and suffer death prior to their planned time and location. Consequently, a bal- ance must be achieved between deactivating the defibrillator too early and too late. One option is to wait until the patient experiences uncon- sciousness but prior to the establishment of deep coma during the medical assistance in dying procedure, at which time the magnet would be applied. Once the defibrillator is deactivat-ed (audile beep), the remainder of the MAID medications may be administered to complete the medical assistance in dying procedure. FIgUrE 2.

Patient experience during medical assistance in dying Most patients do not experience or sense any pacemaker activity during dying. The MAID provider may note a steady pulse initially, but the loss of myocardial perfusion and contraction will result in pulselessness. Others present at the time of death will also not experience or sense any activity from a permanent pacemaker. At the time of cardiac arrest, the pacemaker may attempt to pace the myocardium if bradycardia/ asystole is part of the mechanism, but it will not create a cardiac contraction. Depending on the heart rhythm, the permanent pacemaker may also enter into standby mode during a cardiac arrest. In an active implantable cardioverter de- fibrillator, multiple defibrillation shocks are delivered after detection of ventricular arrhyth - mias. In a dying person who is awake or semi- conscious, these shocks would be distressing. A patient who is semiconscious or in a deep coma is not likely to experience physical sen- sations. However, shocks are visible to others because defibrillation causes multiple chest wall movements, which may be disturbing. Anyone touching a patient's skin during an ICD shock might also receive a small shock. After ICD 430 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 10 | december 2021430clinical Pacemaker and defibrillator management in medical assistance in dying shock therapy has been deactivated, as long as the magnet is in place, the device will not de- liver shocks, and neither the patient nor anyone present will feel any discomfort. Care after death Funeral homes follow protocols for all patients who die with a pacemaker or ICD in situ. If the patient's plan is to be cremated, it is important to inform the funeral home about the existence of the device. If a pacemaker or ICD is not removed prior to cremation, it could explode. Regulatory bodies such as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario have iden- tified effective referral requirements for pro- viders who may wish to opt out of providing care to individuals who are planning to receive medical assistance in dying. Cardiologists and pacemaker clinics should understand existing professional and legal obligations and their duty to refer if the provider has a conscientious or religious objection to providing any health care service. Practice points Every person deemed eligible for medical assistance in dying who has a pacemaker or ICD should be provided with a review process, and their management plan should be coordinated in advance with the primary care provider and the designated CIED treating team. All CIED clinics should develop local standard operating procedures to support patients who are capable of requesting de - vice deactivation. Effective communication and collaboration is necessary for effective planning among involved stakeholders (e.g., patients, palliative care teams, CIED clini - cians, MAID providers, and/or MAID care coordination service). The timing of deactivation of an implant - able cardioverter defibrillator should be discussed with the patient and caregivers to determine whether the device will be deactivated in a clinic before MAID or at the time of MAID with a CIED magnet. Deactivation in a clinic may expose the patient to risk of fatal arrhythmia before their desired time and location of death. Pacemaker function may be reprogrammed to deliver essential treatment for bradycardia, but this is typically unnecessary and places the patient at risk of non-life-threatening bradycardic symptoms. The process and options regarding CIED deactivation or reprogramming, and poten - tial manifestations at the time of medical assistance in dying, should be discussed with the recipient with the advice and sup - port from the MAID provider and CIED clinic team member. Summary Medical assistance in dying is an emerging and evolving area in health care that affects virtually every Canadian health care sector, including primary care. An interdisciplinary, collaborative, patient-focused care plan is vital for success- ful medical assistance in dying, especially for patients with pacemakers or implantable car- dioverter defibrillators. Locally adaptable device management protocols should be implemented for seamless and timely care of patients who request medical assistance in dying. n Competing interests None declared.

Medical assistance in dying is an emerging and evolving area in health care that affects virtually every Canadian health care sector, including primary care.431 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 10 | december 2021431Like type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes has long been considered a progressive, in- curable condition in which the optimal goal after diagnosis is tight glycemic control and risk factor management to prevent vascular disease and neuropathy.1 The assumption that type 2 diabetes is irreversible is supported by the strong association with genetics, the high preva- lence of microvascular complications, and the loss of beta cell mass and function frequently present at diagnosis. The typical impact on morbidity and mor- tality for those with type 2 diabetes is rather grim and in excess of many cancers. The aver- age 10-year survival rates for breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma are 84% and 55%, respectively; the average 10-year lifespan for type 2 diabetes is 50%.2 While the goal for most patients with cancer is remission, the patient with type 2 diabetes is taught that they need to live with this incurable disease. This need not be the case. Increasing evidence points to the ability of patients to not only halt the onset of type 2 diabetes, but also to enter remission after a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Bariatric surgery (RYGB, BPD) has been shown to result in durable re- mission in the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes,3 and research has demonstrated that counseling patients to engage in modest caloric reduction using portion control and limited use of meal replacements resulted in roughly 10% of patients experiencing remission after 2 years.4 The Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (Di- RECT) in particular provides compelling evi- dence for the efficacy of structured, diet-induced This article is the opinion of the Nutrition Committee, a subcommittee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC.

At 24 months, 36% of intervention group participants had remis- sion of diabetes, lower weight (average 8 kg), lower blood pressure, a 50% reduction in car- diovascular disease risk, lower health care costs, and better quality of life. Post-hoc analysis of patients experiencing remission found a return to normal pancreas volume, morphology, and beta cell capacity.6 Importantly, the trial was conducted entirely in primary care practices, assisted by nurses and dietitians. The evidence shows us that we can do better than simply managing type 2 diabetes. With sustained, diet-induced weight loss programs in patients who are willing to engage in sub- stantial lifestyle modifications, remission of type 2 diabetes is possible. While such an outcome requires significant commitment from both patients and health care providers, the benefits of increasing type 2 diabetes remission rates to patients, the health care system, and society as a whole are impossible to ignore. n \u2014Michael Lyon, MD, ABOMreferences 1.

In March and April 2020, BC health authorities observed that while immunization services were being offered, parents were canceling appointments for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2. As many routine services were canceled or deferred and physicians moved to providing virtual care, op- portunities for in-person visits were further curtailed. Other jurisdictions have seen declines in childhood immunization, and international health agencies have issued a call for efforts to ensure continuity of immunization against childhood vaccine-preventable diseases.1-4 What has been observed in BC? On-time immunization (defined as receipt of the recommended dose within 30 days of the milestone) of infants and toddlers was imme- diately affected in BC, with the greatest im- pact on receipt of the 12- and 18-month doses, and less effect on the infant series beginning at 2 months of age. Regions most affected by COVID-19, including the Lower Mainland, saw the greatest declines in on-time receipt of childhood vaccines, with reductions as great as 40% for the 12-month dose compared to the prior year. Also impacted were school-based immunization programs for children and youth in grades 6 and 9 in the first and second school year of the COVID-19 response, with only 27.5% of grade 6 girls and boys completing Impact of COVID-19 response on childhood immunization: What can we do to catch up? This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.the HPV two-dose series by 30 June 2020, a decline from 67% in recent prior years. Why is this a problem? Priority during the COVID-19 response has been on the continued delivery of the primary DPT-containing series and other vaccines in infancy.5 Doses given beginning at 18 months and at school entry are booster doses, and de- ferral is not expected to result in short-term resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. In adolescence, the critical new vaccines are HPV, scheduled in grade 6, and meningococcal quad- rivalent conjugate vaccine, given in grade 9 prior to entry into a higher-risk age group for invasive meningococcal disease. While BC experienced declines in vaccine- preventable diseases with the onset of travel restrictions and other COVID-19 prevention measures in place, now that these are lifting, unvaccinated and undervaccinated children will be at risk for infections. Diseases like measles, which are associated with importation, will be on the rise because of global immunization be- ing interrupted. As we enter the third school year with COVID-19 among us, with several cohorts of children needing to catch up, it will be important to track vaccination completion by June 2022. Children who were in grade 9 in the 2019/20 school year will be starting grade 12 in September 2022. Once youth graduate from high school, opportunities to track whether they completed their vaccines are often lost. What can physicians do to catch up children who are behind on vaccinations? Use every opportunity to review and update child and adolescent vaccinations as these pa- tients present for services. If you are the im- munization service provider for infants and young children for your patient population, issue reminders to those who are delayed to get them caught up. Immunization records of children and youth under 19 are viewable in CareConnect as recorded in the provincial immunization registry (PIR), including the recommended forecast for that child based on their PIR record and the BC immunization schedule. A project to interface electronic medi- cal records with the PIR is underway, but for now physicians should continue to report all doses administered to those under 19 years to their local health unit so that the PIR record can be updated. n \u2014Monika Naus, MD, MHSc, FRCPC, FACPM Medical Director, Communicable Diseases & Immunization ServiceBC Centre for Disease Control Professor, University of British Columbia School of Population and Public HealthWhile BC experienced declines in vaccine- preventable diseases with the onset of travel restrictions and other COVID-19 prevention measures in place, now that these are lifting, unvaccinated and undervaccinated children will be at risk for infections.

The com- mittees\u2014General Practice Services Committee, Specialist Services Committee, Shared Care Committee, and the Joint Standing Commit- tee on Rural Issues\u2014are unique partnerships in Canada. Physicians partner with govern- ment and work closely with health authorities to make system change while strengthening the role of physicians as leaders in innovation at provincial, regional, and community levels. Physician health and wellness is paramount, and every day the JCCs work toward reducing the burdens that contribute to physician burn- out and stress, but there is much more work to do. The strong relationships developed at these committees, and through divisions of family practice and medical staff associations (MSAs), have helped to realize significant changes that have improved doctors' lives by tackling some long-standing organizational-level issues. Rates of physician burnout and moral distress were rising before the COVID-19 pandemic, and they continue to rise due to increasing demands on physician time and resources in a complex and, at times, constrained health care system that involves heavy workloads and clinical prac- tice requirements, inefficient system processes, and evolving technology. However, this burden is not experienced equally by all. Sponsored by a JCC initiative, a 2020 physician-led study found that emotional exhaustion and feelings of low personal accomplishment were higher in physicians who identify as a woman or a per-son of color. 1 Physicians in rural communities have also felt a higher level of professional and personal isolation during this challenging time.Physician wellness: Doctors taking care of doctors This article is the opinion of the Joint Collaborative Committees (JCCs) and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.During the pandemic, the JCCs supported BC's quick pivot to ensure equitable access to health care for all patients by initiating virtual care fees, funding and deploying Zoom licences, and ensuring access to free personal protective equipment for community physicians. In 2021, the JCCs partnered with the Physician Health Program of BC to start developing and sup- porting provincial resources, including: Networks of trained physicians offering their colleagues one-to-one peer support. Services to match physicians with their own family physician to support their primary care needs. Core cognitive behavioral skills training for physicians to support their health and wellness. Through the JCCs, physicians continue to lead a spectrum of quality improvement initia- tives to energize and stimulate better practice environments for other physicians. Breaking down systemic and organizational barriers and burdens Vancouver Coastal Health and the Vancouver Physician Staff Association have joined forces to address physician wellness and are encouraging department-level solutions. They polled members to assess the complexity of factors contributing to physician burnout. Guided by these insights and supported by JCC engagement funding, depart- ment and division heads are further discovering specific impediments, developing interventions, and identifying trusted and respected wellness champions from within the profession. For example, at the Vancouver General Hos- pital Emergency Department, four physicians are now part of an interdisciplinary wellness team and have identified improvements such as new radiology processes, outpatient clinics, and shift scheduling. They are also exploring space optimization and deeper systemic issues such as clinical and administrative workloads. Managing immediate impacts to support resilience and balance Through the Rural Coordination Centre of BC (RCCbc)-led Real-Time Virtual Support (RTVS) pathways, 150 physician colleagues (referred to as virtual physicians) now provide rural health care providers with on-demand, 24/7 clinical support via video or telephone. RTVS offers three patient-facing pathways and four peer-to-peer pathways that enhance health equity in rural, remote, and First Nations com- munities across BC. The program has facilitated more than 40 000 encounters/calls since April 2020. The peer-to-peer pathways in particular have seen significant, steady use by clinically courageous physicians2 in low-resource settings across 91 communities. Participants report that this helps build communities of practice and stronger interprofessional and collegial rela- tionships, and promotes and enhances practi- tioner recruitment and retention. In addition to improving access to patient-centred care and reduced out-of-pocket costs for patients, participating end users have also expressed that the RTVS strengthens core competencies, clini- cal skills, and confidence; reduces feelings of isolation, loneliness, and stress; and improves psychological well-being. Many practical, meaningful efforts have been organized to foster a culture of collegial appreciation and respect to help maintain and restore physician health and wellness, such as the following examples: The Campbell River Spirit Awards hon- oring local physician peers and community heroes who keep the community healthy. Physicians continue to lead a spectrum of quality improvement initiatives to stimulate better practice environments.

Nevertheless, as the life- time prevalence of posttraumatic stress disor- der (PTSD) is reported to be 9.2% in Canada, the majority of persons exposed to trauma do not develop PTSD but rather have a normal response to an abnormal situation.1-3 Yet the significant impact of repetitive trauma exposure on Canada's workforce clearly takes a toll. Rates of PTSD are greater in specific populations, such as first responders, than in the general population,1 and compensable mental health injuries in BC are common. In 2019 and 2020, 641 and 555 injured workers, respectively, had claims accepted for PTSD by WorkSafeBC. Implications for treating physicians First-line treatment for PTSD is trauma-focused psychotherapy, which includes exposure-based and/or cognitive restructuring interventions such as prolonged exposure, cog- nitive processing therapy, eye movement desen- sitization and reprocessing, and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).3-6 Al- though these therapies differ in their methods and protocols, each uses a cognitive or behav- ioral technique to assist the affected individual in processing the index trauma and to mitigate its illness-inducing appraisal. These interven- tions are available through WorkSafeBC and are provided by contracted mental health care providers (psychologists, clinical counselors, and/or occupational therapists). These pro- viders are located throughout the province to assist injured workers as close to their home community as possible. Services are current - ly provided in person or virtually, and online CBT educational programs are also available. Supporting injured workers with PTSD This article is the opinion of WorkSafeBC and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.Referrals can be made to comprehensive outpa- tient and residential interdisciplinary programs when indicated. Expedited referrals to specific WorkSafeBC-contracted psychiatrists are also available. Pharmacotherapy can also be helpful, par- ticularly in injured workers who do not wish to engage in psychotherapy, in those with more severe presentations, or to target specific symp- toms. To date, selective serotonin reuptake in- hibitors (fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine have evidence) and venlafaxine are the recommended first-line interventions.4,6 A host of other agents have been used as mono- or augmentation therapy when first-line pharma- cotherapy is ineffective. The use of benzodi- azepines merits particular comment. These are frequently prescribed for injured workers exposed to trauma, although most treatment guidelines either question their usefulness or recommend avoiding them altogether.7 In ad- dition to general concerns about dependency and adverse side effects, more specific concerns revolve around their potential role in reducing the efficacy of exposure interventions (although a 2017 review7 has questioned the evidence for this finding) and increasing the severity of symptoms that can be present in patients with PTSD.4,8 As long-term use raises increasing concerns of dependency and loss of efficacy, WorkSafeBC normally limits financial cover- age of benzodiazepines to a maximum of 2 weeks postinjury. Other selective comments regarding phar- macotherapy for PTSD are as follows: Prazosin is frequently prescribed for PTSD-related nightmares with reported good effect, although one commonly used guideline suggests there is still insufficient evidence regarding its efficacy.4 Cannabis or cannabis derivatives are not currently recommended due to the lack of evidence-established efficacy as well as po - tential adverse effects.4 Treating physicians are encouraged to consult recent clinical practice guidelines4-6 for further details and to follow the emerging literature related to cannabis and psychedelics for PTSD.4,9,10 Ultimately, treatment decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis. Finally, treating physicians may also wish to discuss posttraumatic growth\u2014positive per- sonal growth and resiliency after exposure to adversity\u2014to normalize the experience and prevent pathology.11,12 This is not to minimize the significant impact of trauma exposure on workers who continue to provide invaluable service to our communities, particularly during recent global challenges.

BURNOUT AND COVID-19 Warning signs and when to act with guests Dr Jennifer Russel and Dr Lawrence Yang Available for streaming on all podcast platforms A Doctors of BC Podcast 436 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 10 | december 2021436 Dr David Paul Wiseman 1946-2021 Kind, caring, funny, compassionate, empathetic, warm, gentle, giving, considerate of others, un- concerned about status, huge heart for all, smiling, humanitarian, genius, enthusiastic adventurer, explorer, searcher open to new ideas, great ability to argue the contrary position, an exceptional human being, a special doctor. David made a difference. These are just some of the words of re- membrance used by David's classmates from the UBC MD Class of '69 after learning of David's unexpected death. David was born in Vernon and, from age 12, was raised and educated in North Vancouver be- fore attending UBC, where he excelled and was admitted to the Faculty of Medicine at age 19. He interned in Montreal, began a pediatrics res- idency, then transferred to the London School of Tropical Medicine to complete a diploma in tropical medicine. David then spent 3 years in Kenya, initially in a Canadian-sponsored program, and 1\u00bd years in Nepal establishing and providing maternal and child health care programs. He later also achieved a diploma in traditional Chinese medicine. David met Joan while in Kenya and they returned from Nepal to BC when expecting their first child. They settled and remained on Hornby Island, where they raised their sons, El- liot and Colin. David provided medical care to his beloved community until 20 years ago when he retired, unwillingly, from his home-based (and subsequently government clinic) practice. David had little choice as new government poli- cies put him in an untenable position with no regard to his personal well-being. That time was very difficult for David as he tried, unsuccess- fully, along with other rural physicians, to come to a workable agreement with the government. David then provided locum care throughout BC, particularly in Clearwater and numerous other remote communities, including several in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Joan and he together worked 3-month contracts in the Arctic during the winter, experiences they found intense and fascinating. With his knowledge of family and emergency medicine, David also served as a ship's physician and was again able to travel afar including two ecologi- cal journeys to Antarctica. He also volunteered in Guatemala. David was part of the Hornby Island com- munity in many respects. He was an avid tennis player and loved working in theatre, organizing the Fall Fair parades, coaching student sports, and singing with the men's a capella group. David had a vast musical knowledge and was a deejay for many years on two local radio pro- grams\u2014one classical and the other a weekly themed show, aptly named Slipped Disks. He was also chair of emergency preparedness for the island and worked diligently in conservancy. David was just beginning a new path in his life. Tragically, he was to be remarried only days after his sudden death, and family thus gathered to grieve, not celebrate. His fianc\u00e9e, Deb; siblings, Marjorie and Bruce; sons, El- liot and Colin; Joan; the people of Hornby Island; as well as his many friends, will miss him terribly.David exemplified what it is to be a physi- cian. He was described as a missionary with- out a religion, and the people of many BC and Northern communities benefited from his care. \u2014Vera Frinton, MD Vancouver \u2014Joan Harris, RN, MACP Hornby Swenerton, MD Vancouver Dr Kathleen Vaughan Perry 1939-2021 Dr Kathleen V. Perry (n\u00e9e Evans), a 1963 grad- uate of the Welsh National School of Medi- cine, died recently in West Vancouver. Dr Perry emigrated to Canada with her husband, Dr John W. Perry, a fellow graduate, in December 1965, and entered general practice in Innisfail, Alberta, until relocating to West Vancouver in 1974. There, her interest in maternity and child care developed and sustained her for the rest of her life. Over the last 2 years Kathleen suffered with the many side effects of myelofibrosis and passed away peacefully in the presence of her family on 27 July 2021. \u2014John W.

Several times a year, the BCMJ presents a theme issue devoted to a particular discipline or disease entity. We welcome letters, blog posts, articles, and scien- tific manuscripts from physicians in British Colum- bia and elsewhere. Manuscripts should not have been submitted to any other publication. Articles are subject to copyediting and editorial revisions, but authors remain responsible for statements in the work, including editorial changes; for accuracy of references; and for obtaining permissions. The cor- responding author of scientific articles will be asked to check page proofs for accuracy. The BCMJ endorses the \"Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals\" by the Inter- national Committee of Medical Journal Editors (updated December 2019), and encourages authors to review the complete text of that document at www.icmje.org. All materials must be submitted electronically, preferably in Word, to: The Editor BC Medical JournalEmail: journal@doctorsofbc.ca Tel: 604 638-2815 Web: www.bcmj.org Editorial process Letters to the editor, articles, and scientific manu- scripts must be reviewed and accepted by the BCMJ's eight-member Editorial Board prior to publication. The Board normally meets on the last Friday of most months, at which time submissions are distributed for review the following month. We do not acknowl- edge receipt of submissions; the editor will contact authors of articles by email once the submission has been reviewed by the Board (usually within 8 to 10 weeks of submission). The general criteria for acceptance include accuracy, relevance to practising BC physicians, validity, originality, and clarity. The editor contacts authors to inform them whether the manuscript has been rejected, conditionally accepted (that is, accepted with revisions), or accepted as sub- mitted. Authors of letters are contacted only if the letter is accepted and editorial staff need further information. Scientific manuscripts and other articles typically take 5 to 10 months from the date of receipt to publication, depending on how quickly authors BCMJ Guidelines Guidelines for authors provide revisions and on the backlog of manuscripts scheduled for publication. Access to the BCMJ is available for free on our website. For all submissions Avoid unnecessary formatting, as we strip all for-matting from manuscripts. Double-space all parts of all submissions. Include your name, relevant degrees, email ad dress, and phone number. Number all pages consecutively. Opinions BCMD2B (medical student page). An article on any medicine-related topic by a BC physician-in- training. Less than 2000 words. The BCMJ also wel- comes student submissions of letters and scientific/ clinical articles.

Less than 500 words. Clinical articles/case reports/ survey studies Manuscripts of scientific/clinical articles and case reports should be 2000 to 4000 words in length, including tables and references. The first page of the manuscript should carry the following: Title, and subtitle, if any. Preferred given name or initials and last name for each author, with relevant academic degrees. All authors' professional/institutional affiliations, sufficient to provide the basis for an author note such as: \"Dr Sang is an associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of British Columbia and a staff gynecologist at Vancouver Hospital.\" A structured or unstructured abstract of no more than 150 words. If structured, the preferred head-ings are \"Background,\" \"Methods,\" \"Results,\" and \"Conclusions.\" Three key words or short phrases to assist in indexing. Competing interests, if any. Name, address, telephone number, and email address of corresponding author. Survey studies must have a response rate of at least 50% in order for the manuscript to be reviewed for publication consideration. Manuscripts with less than this response rate will not be reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board. We recognize that it is not always possible to achieve this rate, so you may ask the Editor in advance to waive this rule, and if the circumstances warrant it, the Editor may agree to have the manuscript reviewed. Authorship, copyright, and disclosure form When submitting a clinical/scientific/review manu- script, all authors must complete the BCMJ's three- part \"Authorship, copyright, and disclosure\" form, available at www.bcmj.org/authorship-copyright -disclosure-form. 1.

In the context of re- questing medical assistance in dying (MAID), a primary requirement is that the applicant fully understands what is going to happen. I was mulling over this requirement when I celebrated my 66th wedding anniversary on my own. My lifelong partner was biologically alive, bedridden in the full grip of amnesia, agnosia, aphasia, and apraxia at the time, until she recently passed away. It was about 8 years ago when she began her slide into one of the dementias\u2014it's still not clear which one. She slept, or as we interpreted it, she was \"totally out of it,\" much of the day. We didn't know if she could see, and if so, what she saw. She may or may not have heard, but she did not respond. She could not turn or adjust her position in bed. She was incontinent of bladder and bowel. Her skin was fragile and broke down easily. She had The informed consent paradox The complexities presented when an essential feature of ethical medical practice is confronted by those with cognitive decline. George Szasz, CM, MD Dr Szasz is a member of the Order of Canada and professor emeritus at the UBC Faculty of Medicine. Throughout his career he practised on the North Shore and worked for the UBC Faculty of Medicine in numerous positions. After retiring from UBC, he was a member and chair of the Medical Advisory Committee of the Library of the BC College of Physicians and Surgeons. Now in his 93rd year, he continues rowing at the Vancouver Rowing Club and writing for the BCMJ blog. This article has been peer reviewed.skin problems in her sacral area, which were difficult to manage. She sometimes screamed or yelled in a defensive manner even when she was just being gently attended by her kind caregivers. During the night, even with some sedatives, she tended to scratch her eyes or face vehemently while emitting to us meaningless sounds. She chewed and chewed her pureed, pasty food, offered to her by the half teaspoon. Eventually, she would swallow. We cared for my very much loved wife at home until recently, when she was moved to a long-term care facility, essentially in a vegeta-tive state. Knowing her, I believed that, if she could consider it, she would have preferred to be on a rocket to another planet. But because she existed only on a basic biological level, it was impossible for her to ask for or give con- sent to a medically assisted exit from Earth. And therein lies the paradox of the informed consent requirement when applied to those with cognitive decline. On one hand, the present rules are that nei- ther representation agreements nor power of at- torney arrangements could speak on her behalf in her situation. On the other hand, her care, or more precisely, the care of her body, had been taken over by caregivers and medical specialists without her consent. In her predementia life, she was a very private person and would never give consent to some of the well-meaning but intimate, invasive care. Ironically, that humani- tarian, loving care likely prolonged her vegeta- tive state and even robbed her of a chance for an earlier, natural death. Oddly enough there is a widely accepted provision in certain medical situations that potentially provides exit from life without informed consent. For the last number of years, ambulance crews entering a house first look for a document that is supposed to be displayed on household refrigerators. If signed, the document certifies that the person named declines to give permission for resuscitation procedures, even if they might prolong life. The signature implies that, if it comes to it, death would be accepted as preferable to a postresuscitation-related chron- ic physical or cognitive decline. This scenario resembles the concerns of many well persons anxious about their future in case of the onset of a cognitive decline. Following the principle of the no-resuscitation instruction on a piece of signed paper attached to the refrigerator, it would be logical to accept the formal, registered, bona fide request of a still well-functioning person in the presence of a physician: \"I wish to re- ceive medical assistance in dying if or when I reach a such and such stage of dementia.\" The statement should be formally supported by significant family members. This prestated re- quest could then be called upon by the family at the agreed-upon exit point, and when the time came, it could be accepted as informed consent and honored with understanding and love. As things are today, Canada's MAID law is under revision to include people with mental illness in the future. That will be an important step forward, but dementia is a brain disorder with devastating physical consequences, and persons with severely declining cognitive func- tion need to be given special consideration. n446 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 10 | december 2021446What profession might you have pursued if not medicine?
