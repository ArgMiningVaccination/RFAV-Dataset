Recently the CDC has identified clot risks associate with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Due to the nature of chiropractic care, we are asking all patients that have received ANY COVID vaccination in the last 7 days to please reschedule their appointment. We apologize for any inconvenience, however patient health and safety is our number one priority. Thank you for your cooperation! Experience care that goes beyond treating the symptoms... Natural Health Improvement Center ensures you get healthy and stay healthy by treating the underlying cause of your pain. I have been a client for several years for adjustments, Reiki, acupuncture, massages and purchasing supplements. All are wonderful professionals and are passionate about caring for their client's health. Wouldn't go anywhere else. My fear of chiros went out the door after my first visit with Dr. Joe! He is very knowledgeable, makes you feel relaxed and works on any pain you have! I highly recommend him to anyone. :) Love love love my Chiropractor! I see Dr. Larkin as needed and she does wonders for my back and jaw. The office is so comfortable and up-to-date. I would highly recommend it for my QC friends.
