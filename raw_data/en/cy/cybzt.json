DACIANA IANCU, MD (sponsored by Anthroposophia Foundation and The Foundation for Health Creation) Good sleep and rest help us enjoy life better. Yet a large majority of the population does not get adequate rest and sleep for variety of reasons. Poor cardiovascular and chronic inflammatory disease, mental disorders, even weight gain, and long covid. How can we slow down enough to rest and achieve the nourishing sleep we deserve? What interferes with our ability to sleep well? In this webinar, you will learn about the natural rhythms of our body and how we can use these rhythms to become more efficient in our daily tasks and rest better at night. You will gain tools and a list of supplements to help you navigate the challenges of the modern world in order to achieve the rest and sleep your body craves.
