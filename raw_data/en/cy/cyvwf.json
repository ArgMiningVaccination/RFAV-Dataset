aspects of The Fletcher School is the diversity of identities, cultures, values, beliefs, and aspirations represented by our students, faculty, and staff. We deeply value the diversity of our community and look to you to help sustain the Fletcher culture that cherishes inclusion. The perspective and background of every member contributes to the strength of this community and indeed defines it as we come to know each other in our vibrant social and intellectual environment. We encourag e you to share your views, listen carefully, and be respectful in your words and actions. Academically, we are trained to analyze and make sense of the complex issues that abound in this world. Many of those issues, including events that may occur during the school year, can provoke intense feelings. In our academic pursuits, in class or out of class, in our debates electronically or in person, it is easy to forget that some members of the comm unity may be impacted on a very personal level and we can inadvertently be insensitive to their realities. In our discussions and debates \u2014electronically or in person \u2014courtesy, respect, and collegiality should be foremost in our minds. Mastering civility and mutual respect, finding common values and building comm unity cannot be taught in a classroom or acquired by reading a textbook. These traits are the very core of diplomacy and require experience to manage situations well. This uniquely diverse community provides the opportunity to develop and hone characterist ics that will serve your academic, professional, and personal life regardless of where your ultimate career path leads you. Above all, we expect that your time at Fletcher will help you to develop the skills, expertise, and relationships that prepare you for a fulfilling career and enable you to contribute to the betterment of the world. We look forward to seeing what you make of your Fletcher education \u2014both during your time as a student and after commencement. We expect every student to read this handboo k in its entirety prior to the start of each semester. In the event of any questions, students are invited to contact the relevant offices (Registrar's Office, Office of Equal Opportunity, etc.). The content of this handbook is designed to provide every st udent with a clear understanding of what is expected during their time at Fletcher, and of the processes in place to help navigate a variety of circumstances. Best wishes for enjoyable and productive Fletcher experience! Sincerely, Laurie Hurley , Associate Dean of Admissions and Student Affairs STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 2 Student Code of Conduct A. Preamble The Fletcher School at Tufts University is a broad community of students, faculty, administrators, and many visitors. The long -standing mission of the School is: to edu cate professionals from around the world and to prepare them for positions of leadership and influence in the national and international arenas; to increase understanding of international problems and concerns through teaching, research, and publications; to serve local, national, and international communities in their search to develop relationships of mutual benefit, security, and justice in an increasingly interdependent world . Fletcher students are expected to be responsible citizens of the School and should exercise good judgment and ethical behavior in their academic, professional, and personal lives. A professional, ethical environment requires a common set of behavioral expectations, the participation of all students, and adherence to Tufts University and Fletcher School policies. The Fletcher Code of Conduct encompasses School and University policies that are designed to ensure that all students share a collective responsibility for maintaining the highest ethical standards and profess ional conduct. The Code of Conduct sets forth a process to ensure accountability, in order to reinforce the need for all students to comply with University policies and federal, state, and local laws of the surrounding cities in which they live, study, work, and visit. The Code is supplemented by the Guiding Principles of The Fletcher School, which are set forth immediately below. B. Guiding Principles of the Fletcher Community The Guiding Principles of the Fletcher Community are values that students are ex pected to honor in their time at the School. These Principles are not formally part of the Code of Conduct but rather complement it by providing guidance on matters of broader concern that may arise within our community. Some actions that community members might find uncivil, rude, or disrespectful cannot be dealt with under the Code of Conduct Procedures set forth in Section E below. However, such concerns may be addressed in other ways, such as through counseling, mediation, and/or school- wide conversatio ns to raise awareness of the perceived problems. Accordingly, Fletcher students are expected to uphold the following Guiding Principles: STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 3 Community \u2014Build and enhance the community by fostering inclusiveness and collaboration. Treat all members of the community fairly. Compassion \u2014Show kindness and compassion to others. Seek to interact with and understand people who are different from yourself. Understand and appreciate how your decisions and actions impact others. Integrity \u2014Maintain the highest stand ards of academic and professional integrity, as set forth in the Code of Academic Integrity. Respect \u2014 Respect yourself, others, property, and the community, which includes respecting others' safety, privacy, and personal autonomy. In both the intellectual and social community, respect transcends disagreement and facilitates learning and understanding. Responsibility \u2014Be accountable for your decisions and actions, and do not abuse any position of authority or responsibility. Refrain from decisions and/or actions that would interfere with University activities or would expose the University to legal risk. Do not engage in any activity that would damage the health, safety, or welfare of anyone. C. Scope (Jurisdiction) of the Code of Conduct Fletcher's Code of Conduct applies to all students, degree and non -degree, at The Fletcher School. Alleged violations of the Code of Conduct will be considered under the Procedure Regarding Violations of the Fletcher Code of Conduct set forth in Section E below. The Code of Conduct applies during regular academic terms; during academic breaks, such as the summer or winter breaks; during internships; and while students are on personal, medical, or other leave. The Code of Conduct applies to behavior that occurs on any of Tufts' campuses, off campus, and online; it applies to students who are cross -registered at other universities or who are studying abroad. The Code of Conduct applies to all Fletcher student organizations. In the event of serious misconduct committed while enrolled but reported only after the accused student has graduated, the University may invoke and utilize the Procedure Regarding Violations of the Fletcher Code of Conduct detailed in section E. Should th e former student be found responsible for misconduct, the University may impose penalties up to and including revocation of that student's degree. In some instances, an action that violates Fletcher and/or Tufts policy may also violate the laws of Massach usetts or of federal or local governments. Any such violation of law may be pursued in civil or criminal court simultaneously with and separate from the resolution of a complaint through the Procedure Regarding Violations of the Fletcher STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 4 Code of Conduct. A pending legal action shall not delay University action, nor shall the outcome of a civil or criminal case determine the outcome of a University proceeding. D. School and University Policies Included W ithin the Code of Conduct Students are expected to abi de by all published University policies, including the following Fletcher and Tufts University policies, which taken together make up the Fletcher Code of Conduct. All of the policies below are set forth or summarized in the Fletcher Student Handbook. D1.

Allegations of failure to confo rm to the Guiding Principles (Section B above) are not subject to these Procedures. F1. Code of Conduct Committee At the beginning of each academic year, the Dean of The Fletcher School shall appoint a Code of Conduct Committee composed of five people drawn from the School. Three members of the committee shall be members of the faculty; one member shall be a second -year Fletcher student, elected by the student body of the School; and one member shall be the Fletcher Director of Student Affairs or her/his designated representative. When a matter is referred to the Code of Conduct Committee, the Committee shall evaluate the information presented and determine an appropriate outcome or sanction, if any, pursuant to the following procedures. Decisions regarding a violation of the Code of Conduct are based upon the preponderance of the evidence (whether it was more likely th an not that policy was violated by the conduct alleged). F2. Disciplinary Action and Fair Process The procedures described in this section and the following sections ensure that a fair review has taken place and that the information presented by the complainant, respondent, and any witnesses has received full consideration. The University makes every effort to protect the privacy of each individual. The Committee shall give due consideration to such privacy interests and will conduct its work accordi ngly. Official records of disciplinary investigation and action are maintained in the Office of the Registrar. These records are generally considered private and internal. They may be released to third parties pursuant to University policies and federal law, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. These policies currently provide that information may be released \"[w]hen the information is a record of a campus disciplinary proceeding.\" F3. Reporting Violations of the C ode of Conduct An allegation is a written assertion that a violation of the Code of Conduct may have occurred. Any employee, student, faculty member, or visitor of the University may present an allegation to the Director of Student Affairs. Each allegatio n should describe, with as much specificity as possible (e.g., dates, names, locations, occurrences), the particular factual events STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 7 that constitute the alleged violation. If such specificity is missing, the person making the allegation will be asked to sup plement as appropriate. Should community members wish to report violations of the Code of Conduct anonymously, they may do so through EthicsPoint, by calling EthicsPoint toll- free at 866 -384-4277 or visiting http://tufts -oeo.ethicspoint.com . F4. Anonymity Students or others who submit only information that is of a general or descriptive nature and that does not arise from their personal observation or knowledge may request to remain anonymous. They should indicate this desire when they deliver the information to the Director of Student Affairs, and the remainder of the process will use reasonable efforts to maintain the anonymity of these students or others. However, anonymity cannot be guaranteed. In most circumstances, students or others who provide information regarding alleged Code of Conduct violations in the form of their own observations cannot remain anonymous. F5. Initial Review of an Allegation The respondent must not contact the complainant with respect to the alleged violation. Any attempt to influence the complainant or to retaliate is itself a violation of the Code of Conduct and is subject to being considered under these Procedures. Dishonesty in any stage of the Committee process could lead to further sanctions. Upon receiving an allegation or complaint, the Director of Student Affairs will consider the information received. After reviewing the allegation or complaint and any other documentation s/he deems appropriate, the Director of Student Affairs will determine whether the grievance is within the jurisdiction of the Code of Conduct. If the Director determines that the allegation may allege conduct that, if confirmed, might violate the Code of Conduct, the respondent will be immediately notified of the substance of the allegation, either orally or in writing. If the alleged policy violation is a minor infraction, the Director of Student Affairs, in consultation with the Associate Dean of Admissions and Student Affairs, may: 1. dismiss th e case based on a lack of evidence; 2. meet with the complainant and respondent and come to an informal resolution based on the requests of the complainant and the nature of the complaint; or 3. advise and/or provide a verbal or written reprimand in cases when the facts are not disputed. For all other allegations, the Director of Student Affairs will consider the complaint with the Code of Conduct Committee Chairperson. Code of Conduct Committee members also may be consulted to assess the allegation and assist in the decision to either: STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 8 1. dismiss the case based on a lack of evidence; 2. meet with the complainant and respondent and come to an informal resolution based on the requests of the complainan t and the nature of the complaint; 3. advise and/or provide a verbal or written reprimand in cases when the facts are not disputed; 4. forward the case to the appropriate department at Tufts for further review and handling; 5. forward the case to the Code of Cond uct Committee and, if necessary, further investigate the allegation; or 6. determine any outcomes or impose sanctions identified in sections E10(a) through E10(d). An additional investigation pursuant to subparagraph 5 may include interviewing the respondent , the complainant, and witnesses, as well as gathering and reviewing pertinent documents and any other information. The Chairperson and/or individuals selected by the Chairperson (including but not limited to the Tufts University Police Department) will investigate the allegations. The Committee Chairperson, after consulting with Committee members, will decide to proceed with or without a hearing, depending on the severity of the allegation and/or possible sanctions. In all cases, a Report shall be prepared that summarizes the allegations, the information obtained from the investigation, and the decision to dismiss or proceed with the case. F6. Interim Actions Complaints of student misconduct occasionally require the School to take immediate action in or der to protect the health, safety, or wellbeing of individuals or the community; to uphold University values; to end ongoing or prevent further misconduct; to separate individuals involved in a case; or for other similar reasons. To that end, the Director of Student Affairs, the Code of Conduct chairperson, and their respective designees, are each authorized to impose immediate interim measures when, in their judgment, such measures are necessary and appropriate under the particular circumstances. Possible interim measures include without limitation interim suspension of a student from the University, interim suspension from a student organization, no -contact orders, restricting a student's access to certain campus locations, or changes to academic or work schedules. Interim measures will usually remain in place pending the resolution of the complaint. Interim suspension of an individual student may only be imposed if, in the judgment of the Director of Student Affairs the Code of Conduct chairperson, or the ir respective designees, there is evidence or information which appears reliable suggesting that the respondent violated a policy and that interim action is necessary: (1) to ensure the safety and well -being of STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 9 members of the University community or preser vation of University property; or (2) to ensure the student's own physical or emotional safety and well -being; or (3) if the student poses an ongoing threat of disruption of, or interference with, the normal operation of the university. While a student is on interim suspension, the student is not permitted to access any building, facility, or activity of the University, including classes, residence halls, and extracurricular activities. F7. Stay Away Requests The Director of Student Affairs or designee may issue Stay Away Requests (SARs) on behalf of students who would like to provide formal notice to another student that they do not wish to have further direct or indirect communication or contact with them. An SAR can be initiated by contacting the Office of Student Affairs. 1. An SAR prohibits direct or indirect communication or contact between the parties, including in person, mail, email, telephone, messaging, social media, or contact through friends, and is designed to secure the integrity of t he adjudication process. 2. SARs stay in effect until further notice is given to the involved parties. 3. An SAR is a directive, not a disciplinary action, and it has no disciplinary consequences. It is not in itself a finding of responsibility for any disciplin ary action, nor does it preclude future disciplinary action. 4. However, failure to abide by the terms of an SAR will likely result in serious disciplinary action, including a strong consideration of loss of privileges, probation, and suspension. Disregard of an SAR can also be used as evidence in a claim of harassment. Any party responsible for retaliation or threats of retaliation will also be subject to disciplinary action by the School. 5. An SAR does not necessarily restrict a student from being on campus or place restrictions on any academic or co -curricular activities of either party. i. There is no minimum distance that must be maintained between the two. ii. However, provisions regarding certain spaces on campus may be added to an SAR at the discretion of staff members in the Office of Student Affairs, and should the parties unexpectedly encounter one another, they are both expected to maintain the maximum distance possible and must not initiate direct or indirect communication with one another. iii. The person who ar rives second to a closed space is expected to leave that space. F8. Cases Presented to the Code of Conduct Committee without a Hearing The Code of Conduct Committee will meet, and the Chairperson will present the Report to Committee members. The respondent will be provided a copy of the Report and will be invited to submit a written explanation of the situation to the Committee. The discussion will be followed by a vote in which a majority of the Committee will decide to either dismiss the case, h old a hearing as described in sections E7 through E9, or find that a STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 10 violation has occurred. If the Committee finds that a violation has occurred, it may, but need not, impose a sanction (see section E10 below). However, the sanction(s) imposed may not include suspension or expulsion. If the Committee decides to consider a sanction that includes suspension or expulsion, the Committee must hold a hearing. Whatever the outcome, the Committee Chairperson will notify the respondent and the complainant in writing of the Committee's decision and any next steps. F9. Cases Presented to the Code of Conduct Committee with a Hearing Prior to the hearing, the Chairperson will provide the respondent with a written letter of notification which shall include the following : 1. the time of the hearing (no sooner than ten business days from the date of notification); 2. the location of the hearing; 3. the allegation(s) to be considered; 4. the range of disciplinary sanctions that could result; 5. the names of the witness(es) and/or complainant(s) expected to meet the Committee; and 6. a copy of the Report prepared at the end of the Initial Review of an Allegation (see section F5 above) and any other written or documentary information that the Committee will consider. The complainant and respondent will be invited to appear at the hearing either in person or via video/phone and be given the opportunity to: 1. present information personally or through the testimony of witnesses, provided that written notice of the identities of these witnesses is provided to the Chairperson of the Committee five business days before the scheduled hearing; 2. submit further written or documentary information for the consideration of the Committee, provided that s/he does so at least two business day s before the scheduled hearing; 3. question any person who presents information, except in cases when a person not physically present at Fletcher provides only a written statement rather than appearing in person; 4. make an oral or written statement presenting h is or her position(s) to the Committee; and 5. be accompanied by a support person who is a current member of the faculty or administration. Written notice of such accompaniment must be given to the Committee at least two business days before the hearing and m ust include the name of the support person. The support person will be present only to advise the respondent and will not be allowed to address the Committee. The support person cannot be a member of the Committee and must sign a confidentiality agreement that prevents disclosure of any information from the hearing. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 11 F10. The Code of Conduct Hearing The Chairperson of the Committee or some other Committee member appointed by the Chairperson will conduct the hearing. The hearing will proceed as set forth in the Committee Chairperson's letter of notification (described in section E7), beginning with a presentation of the Report. After all information is presented, the respondent will be invited to make a statement to the Committee and respond to its questions. Upon request, the complainant also may address the Committee and answer questions. Upon request, the complainant may participate in the hearing outside the presence of the respondent, subject to the approval of the Committee. In such circumstances, the respondent shall be provided as soon as is practicable with a written transcript of any statement(s) made by the complainant and may respond thereto. Code of Conduct hearing procedures are intended to be as flexible and informal as practicable. There are no formal rules of evidence. The Committee may consider any information that it deems relevant and may attach whatever weight, if any, it deems appropriate to such information. Any such information submitted to or considered by the Committee shall be transmi tted to the complaint and respondent, who may comment thereon. When s/he deems it appropriate, the Chairperson of the Committee will conclude the end of the hearing. No audio or visual recording of any kind is allowed during the hearing; no transcript of the hearing should be made, unless otherwise provided herein. A documentary record of the proceedings will be kept in the files of the Office of the Registrar. This record should include: (1) the complaint and the respondent's response, (2) all documents s ubmitted at the hearing, and (3) the decision letter. This record does not summarize or otherwise attempt to preserve the hearing or deliberative discussions. F11. Committee Deliberation and Decision After the hearing, the Committee will deliberate in p rivate and make a decision by majority vote. Any Committee decision that finds a violation or imposes a sanction must be accompanied by a short summary of the case and a reasoned explanation for the decision. This summary and explanation will be provided t o the complainant (if any) and respondent. F12. Outcomes and Sanctions Any or all of the sanctions below may be applied by the Committee. (a) Counseling: The student will be counseled by members of the Committee or by a person or persons appointed or aut horized by the Committee. Counseling is not considered a punishment or penalty; it is designed to help the student understand how his/her actions violated the Code of Conduct and how to avoid further violations. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 12 (b) Verbal Reprimand: The student will rece ive a verbal reprimand from the Chairperson, a written record of which shall be documented but not noted on the student's transcript. (c) Written Reprimand: The student will receive a written reprimand from the Committee and signed by the Chairperson. The reprimand will not be noted on the student's transcript, but the student will not be eligible for graduation honors or awards. (d) Restitution : Where the s tudent has damaged, converted, or otherwise impaired the value of the property of The Fletcher School, Tufts University, a Fletcher/Tufts University affiliate, or individual, the student may be required to make adequate restitution any injured party. Resti tution may be by monetary compensation or by the student taking appropriate action, as specified by the Director of Student Affairs or Chairperson of the Committee, to redress the situation. The fact that restitution was ordered shall not be noted on the s tudent's transcript. (e) Loss of Privileges: A student or student organization may lose privileges for a specified period of time. Such privileges include but are not limited to access to campus, the ability to have a car on campus, parking privileges, par ticipation in certain events, access to electronic resources, or use of Tufts -owned equipment. Loss of privileges also may entail the loss of membership or leadership positions in academic committees or student organizations. (f) Probation : The student will be placed on probation for a specified period of time. The Committee may take appropriate steps, including requiring the student to appear regularly before the Committee or designated member(s), to ensure that the student is acting in accordan ce with the applicable Code policies. Probation will be noted on the student's transcript. (g) Limited Suspension : The student will not be permitted to continue as a registered student for a specified period. At the expiration of this period, the student s hall be re- enrolled upon his/her request. The student will receive credit only for those courses that were completed and passed prior to the suspension. At the discretion of the Committee, the student may be permitted to complete courses in progress, the current semester, or the current academic year before beginning the term of suspension. Suspension will be noted on the student's transcript. (h) Indefinite Suspension: Indefinite suspension is a sanction just below dismissal and is given to a student who must demonstrate to the Committee that s/he merits re - entry to Fletcher. Students who are suspended indefinitely must be given specific assignments, benchmarks, requirements (for example, a verification from a healthcare professional), and/or tasks that th ey must accomplish, and a time frame, not to exceed two years, within which they must meet them. The Committee must decide by STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 13 majority whether to allow the student's re -entry, continue the suspension, or dismiss the student. If the student does not fulfill all of the conditions for re -entry set by the Committee, the indefinite suspension converts to permanent dismissal without the right to re -apply, at the expiration of the time set for fulfilling the conditions. This action will be noted on the student's t ranscript. (i) Dismissal with the Possibility of Re -Application: The student will be dismissed from the program but will be permitted to re -apply for admission to Fletcher, subject to all the conditions of the regular admissions process. This action will b e noted on the student's transcript. (j) Permanent Dismissal : The student will be permanently dismissed from the program and not permitted to re -apply or re -enroll. This action will be noted on the student's transcript and shall be reported to the Studen t Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), as needed. (k) Suspension of Student Organization Status: Suspension of student organization status is the temporary termination of the School's recognition of a student organization. While a student organiz ation is suspended, it may not exercise any of the benefits of recognition, including the use of University facilities, the use of the University or School's name or logo, the use of the University's electronic resources (including web hosting), access to University funds or banking, room reservations, etc. (l) Additional Sanctions : Such additional sanctions may be imposed as the Code of Conduct Committee deems appropriate. F13. Appeal Process Either a complainant or a respondent may appeal a decision made by the Code of Conduct Committee to the Dean of The Fletcher School. The appeal must be made within one month of being notified of the decision. The appeal must state the specific grounds for the appeal and present any relevant information or evidence in support of the appeal. The appeal process is designed to ensure that decisions reached by the Code of Conduct Committee are fair and consistent with Code of Conduct procedures. The appeal is not a re-hearing or reconsideration, but rather a review of the r ecord. There are only three grounds on which a decision may be appealed. They are: 1. Newly Available Information. There exists substantive and relevant information that was not available to the complainant or respondent at the time of the resolution of the complaint or that could not have been discovered through due diligence at the time of the resolution. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 14 2. Denial of Fair Process . There was a substantial departure from the procedures outlined in the Procedures Regarding Violations of the Fletcher Code of Condu ct that significantly affected the fairness of the process. 3. Disproportionate Consequences. The sanction(s) imposed vary significantly from the range of sanctions appropriate in the situation and have disproportionate consequences on the student concerned. The Dean can review the appeal and make a final decision or may appoint an ad -hoc appellate committee for a second review. The Dean or appellate committee may: 1. deny the appeal and uphold the original decision; 2. accept the appeal and return the case to the Code of Conduct Committee (in situations where new information has become available); or 3. accept the appeal and revise the original decision and/or accompanying sanctions, with a reasoned explanation for the decision and revision(s). The appellate decision is final and cannot be appealed further. Nothing in this Code of Conduct is to be construed as contradictory to present or future University policies and procedures. In the event of any conflict, University policies and procedures will prevail . Approval of this Code of Conduct does not constitute approval or disapproval of the underlying Fletcher or University policies. Any amendment to this Code must be approved by the Fletcher faculty. Requirements for the Degrees Definitions Residential Programs For the purposes of this handbook, \"residential\" refers to students enrolled in the following programs whose primary mode of instruction is in -person : Master in Global Affairs (MGA) Master of Arts (MA) Master of Arts in Humanitarian Assistance (MAHA) Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy (MALD) Master of Arts in Transatlantic Affairs (MATA) Master of International Business (MIB) Master of Laws in International Law (LLM) Master of Science in Cybersecurity and Public Policy (CSPP) PhD in Economics and Pu blic Policy PhD in International Relations STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 15 Online Programs For the purposes of this handbook, \"online\" refers to students enrolled in the following programs whose primary mode of instruction is online: Master of Arts (GMAP) Master of Global Business Administration (GBA) Fields of Study Fields of study are areas of specialization or concentration and are the basic building blocks of the Fletcher curriculum . Fields of study enable students to develop a specific set of skills related to a functional topic or geographic area. MALD and MIB students are required to graduate with two fields of study. MGA students are required to graduate with one field of study. Beginning with s tudents admitted in fall 2021, fields of study appear on the official transcript in the semester in which they are declared to the Registrar's Office. In cases where only one of two fields is declared in a semester, or a student changes their field or fiel ds of study, those changes will be reflected on the transcript in the semester in which the student submits the Update Field of Study form to the Registrar's Office. Global Affairs Fields of Study Students starting at Fletcher in September 2021 will choo se from the following eleven fields of study. These enhanced interdisciplinary fields will enable students to specialize in the substantive knowledge and skills required for particular careers. MGA students will be required to take 5 -6 courses in their one field of study, including a practicum in their final semester. MALD and MIB students will complete two fields of study with 3 -4 courses per field.

In such cases, the courses taken toward each track may not double- count. Students in the MA LD and MIB programs may request to change their field of study until the first day of instruction of their last semester using the form provided by the Registrar's Office. The request to change the field of study will be denied if, upon reviewing the student's academic record, there is no realistic means for the student to satisfy the new field of study. In general, MGA students may not change their field of study once admitted to the program, and exceptions will only be granted under exceptional circumstances. Students who started at Fletcher prior to September 2021 and completed at least one semester of coursework are ineligible to complete the fields of study from this list and should consult with the Fletcher Registr ar on the list of fields available at their time of entry to Fletcher . International Business Fields of Study for MIB Students Students in the MIB program must complete one of these four I nternational Business fields of study along with one of the Global Affairs fields of study listed above. MGA and MALD students may not complete an International Business Field of Study and should satisfy the International Business field instead .

The option to obtain equivalency for a required course exists for the purposes of demonstrating proficiency in the course content . Students may not seek equivalency for required courses through cross -registration in similar courses at Harvard or at other institutions during the academic year. EIB E213 Econometrics may be used to meet either the Economics or the Quantitative Reasoning requirement, but not both.

The student requests transfer credit for a maximum of four courses from the partner institution for the degree before their gradu ating semester. 4. The student completes the Capstone. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 28 Joint degree requirements vary by degree. Requirements for the Joint PhD in Economics and Public Policy First Year Coursework: The first year of coursework is completed in the Economics department. All students are required to take a two semester sequence in micro theory, a two semester sequence in macro theory, statistics and econometrics. In addition, students are required to enroll in a yearlong research seminar class which includes mandatory seminar attendance and written assignments. Second Year Coursework: In the second year of the program, students declare a field among the following: development, environmental or political economy. Students are required to take two advanced courses in their chos en field. These courses must be approved by the students' advisor. Students are also required to enroll in the yearlong second year paper course designed to give students a head start on the research process. The fourth course is an elective chosen by the student in consultation with the students' advisor. Field Exams: At the end of the second year, students are required to pass a field exam. The timing of this exam is jointly determined between the professor(s) administering the exam and the students takin g the exam. It may be taken as early as June or as late as September of the students' third academic year. Doctoral Candidacy: Students may apply for admission to doctoral candidacy upon successful completion of the following: 1. Coursework as described above; 2. A major research paper in the second year; 3. Defense of a dissertation prospectus, and; 4. Commitment by one faculty member from Economics and one faculty member from Fletcher to serve as primary dissertation advisors. Graduation from the program requires that students successfully defend their thesis in a public forum and before their full thesis committee. Students who do not proceed to doctoral candidacy will receive a joint terminal master's degree in Economics and Public Policy to be granted by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 29 Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy PhD Coursework Phase for MALD/MIB Graduates MALD/MIB graduates who are admitted to the PhD Program are required to spend one year in residence following their admission and enroll in at least four courses (12 .0 credits). During their first year they enroll in the required methodology courses, which are in addition to other courses they need to meet program requirements, including: Two fields of study (four courses per field) DHP P201 Comparative Politics DHP P200 or H204 I nternational Relations Theory EIB E213 Econometrics PhD Coursework Phase for Direct -Admit Students Applicants who are directly admitted to the PhD program without pursuing the MALD or MIB first are generally able to complete all pre- dissertation coursework requirements in three semesters. The following six steps apply to Direct Admit PhD students. They must: 1. Complete a minimum of eight and, normally, a maximum of 12 courses (24.0 -36.0 credit s). Ni ne of the 12 courses must be Fletcher courses; only three of the 12 may be cross -registered courses. Direct Admit students can petition for equivalency credit for up to four PhD course requirements (1 2.0 credits). See the note below on equivalency. 2. Meet division requirements applicable to MALD and PhD students, which are to take two courses in each of two divisions and one course in the third division. 3. Complete two Fletcher fields of study , with four courses per field, of which only one course per field can be an \"exception\" (non -Fletcher course, independent study, equivalency credit, etc.). 4. Submit a thesis for evaluation by a Fletcher faculty member. A master's thesis written prior to enrollment at Fletcher may be submitted in lieu of a MALD thesis. In eit her case, the evaluating faculty member must assign a grade that will form part of the basis for continuation of PhD student status. The grade should be reported to the Fletcher Registrar and the PhD Program Director. 5. Pass the School's reading and oral for eign language examinations as well as the statistics exam . 6. Achieve a cumulative GPA of at least 3.6 in the courses taken as an enrolled Fletcher student. Students with a GPA of less than 3.60 at the end of the coursework phase will be withdrawn from the P hD Program. 7. Upon completion of the requirements listed above, the student would proceed to Comprehensive Examinations . Direct -admit students are not eligible to receive a MALD or MA degree. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 30 Petitioning for Equivalency PhD students who did not previously c omplete the MALD/MIB can petition for equivalency for up to four classes (12 .0 credits) taken in a previous master's degree program, potentially reducing their coursework requirement to only eight classes (24 .0 credits) toward the Fletcher PhD. There are five opportunities to gain equivalency toward the 1 2 required courses in the program, which are: 1. First field of study - Students can petition for equivalency for one course of the four required. The field supe rvisor would make the decision on the petition. 2. Second field of study - Students can petition for equivalency for one course of the four required. The field supervisor would make the decision on the petition. 3. International Relations Theory - Students can petition for equivalency from Prof. Drezner. 4. Comparative Politics ( DHP P201) - Students can petition for equivalency from Prof. Katrina Burgess, field supervisor. 5. Econometrics ( DHP E213) - Students can petition for equivalency from Prof. Aker or Prof. Sc haffner. All other courses must be taken while the student is in the Fletcher PhD program. Equivalency courses are treated the same as cross -registration courses; that is, students who receive equivalency for three or more PhD courses would not be able to receive any further cross -registration privileges. If they receive equivalency for only one course, they could cross - register for up to two courses, and if they received equivalency for two courses, they could cross -register for one course. PhD Pl an of Study and PhD Coursework for All Students Before beginning the PhD coursework phase, all PhD students in International Relations must submit to the PhD p rogram office a PhD Plan of Study indicating their two fields of study and the other courses to be taken during the coursework phase. By the completion of the coursework phase, all PhD students are required to have completed: Two fields of study with at least four courses per field with only one \"exception\" per field. The four courses should include the core course for each field. Four half-course methodology modules, generally the first three in the sequence offered by Professors Wilson, Mazurana, and Jacobsen. DHP P201 Comparative Politics EIB E213 Econometrics An international relations theory cour se, generally either DHP P200 or H204. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 31 All PhD students who have not taken and passed statistics at Fletcher ( EIB B205 or B206) must take and pass the B205 Equivalency Exam, offered during Orientation before the fall and spring semesters. Both the PhD Program Director and the student's PhD Advisor must endorse the Plan of Study. All course requirements, the thesis, and the language examination must be complete before a student can take comprehensive exams. Post- Coursework PhD Requirements After completing coursework, PhD students must complete comprehensive examinations, composed of two written exams and an oral exam. After they have successfully completed their comprehensive exams, students are granted PhD candidacy and have five years to research, write, and defend their dissertation. PhD Information Information for students applying to or enrolled in the PhD program is available on the doctoral program website, https://sites.tufts.edu/fletcherdoctoral/ (Tufts login required). Language Study During the academic year, Fletcher students in residential degree programs who wish to pursue foreign language learning may enroll in language courses at Tufts University through cross -registration. Students may enroll in up to one foreign language course for credit towards their degree requirements. Permission to cross -register is at the discretion of the course instructor and the registration deadlines for both schools must be met. Enrollment for credit in a language learning course counts towards the student's semester course load and is subject to all course load and cross -registration policies. Students in two -year programs may petition the Committee on Student Academic Programs (CSAP) for a second foreign language course for credit if they believe that they may benefit from a second course for academic and/ or professional reasons. In order to be eligible to receive credit for language study, the following criteria must be met: a) Foreign language instruction should be appropriate for both the student's Fletcher academic experience and their professional career objectives. b) Foreign language credit will be given for a maximum of two courses. c) Language study encourages a multi -cultural approach to language learning. d) The enrollment in a foreign language course does not hinder the student's progress towards other degree requirements. Additionally, students in residential degree programs are eligible to audit one Tufts language course per term in addition to their normal course load. Audited language courses do not STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 32 appear on the student's transcript. Enrolling in a language course either for credit or audit requires instructor permission.

Student Status Full-time Enrollment In most cases, full time students enroll in a minimum of 12.0 credit to meet rate of work and make satisfactory academic progress. Students in the residential master's degree programs can be considered full -time enrolled when taking 9.0 credits or greater in a semester . For visa purposes, international students must be enrolled in a minimum of 9.0 credits. The definition of full -time for the purposes of financial aid eligibility may differ. Students who are enrolled in 10.5 credits or great er pay the published tuition rates for a full semester of coursework . STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 41 Students enrolled over 12.0 credits may be subject to additional tuition charges depending on their degree program. Students who plan to enroll in fewer than 10.5 credits in a semester should consult with the Fletcher Registrar prior to the start of the s emester. Part-time Enrollment Students in residential master's degree programs are considered part -time enrolled when approved for an enrollment of 6.0 credits per semester . Reduced Course Load Reduced course load may be requested for one semester by comp leting a reduced course load petition. A new petition must be submitted each semester in which the student is requesting reduced course load. Students taking 9.0 or 6.0 credits in a semester will be billed on a per - course basis. In exceptional circumstances, students may be approved to enroll in 3.0 credits in a semester and be billed on a per -course basis. Financial aid will be prorated to the number of enrolled credits. Students approved for reduced course load are expected to extend their degree program by no more than one semester. Module overload enrollment (7.5 and 10.5 credits) is not permitted for students on approved reduced course load. Auditing while on reduced course load is not permitted. All academic regulations apply, and students are encourag ed to review the Student Handbook before requesting reduced course load. The deadline to return the Reduced Course Load Petition to the Fletcher Registrar is 10 days priors to the start of the term in which reduced course load is requested. Students must c omply with all tuition deadlines regardless of the timing of the submission or approval of their petition. Students considering reduced course load should consult with the financial aid office and the International Center (if applicable) before submitting a petition. Continuation Continuation status allows for the completion of degree requirements in the fall or spring semester after student's expected graduation term. Continuation status is available for students in all programs except the PhD and GBA. Students in the GMAP program may continue on continuation status for one calendar year or three consecutive terms . There is no charge for the continuation semester provided the student is not enrolled in credit -earning courses. Students enrolled in credit -earning courses or cross -registration will be charged at the current per-course rate. Students who have not completed their degree requirements after the end of the continuation semester will have their stud ent record discontinued and must petition for reinstatement in order to graduate. Audits are not permitted on continuation. Students in residential degree programs on continuation status will have a hold placed on their record at the start of the semester and must contact the Fletcher Registrar for all enrollment transactions. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 42 Students who are approved for continuation are considered active students. Under extenuating circumstances, PhD and GBA students may request a semester of continuation status. Summer Extension Residential students may request a summer extension for the completion of degree requirements in the summer following their final spring semester. There is no charge for the extension and the student may not enroll in credit -earning or audi t courses at Fletcher or elsewhere in the summer term . Students who have not completed their degree requirements by the deadline set in the Academic Calendar for the summer in which extension is granted may be placed in continuation status in the fall . If students are ineligible for continuation for any reason , they will have their records discontinued and must petition for reinstatement in order to graduate. Students who are approved for a summer extension are considered active students. Reinstatemen t Students whose records have been discontinued may petition for reinstatement for the purposes of graduation or to continue their academic career at Fletcher. It is expected that all students (except for doctoral candidates) will complete their degree wit hin seven years of their initial matriculation date, which is the first day of instruction in the semester the student began taking classes. Students may only reinstate for the spring or fall terms . Students may not reinstate for the summer term , except fo r the GBA program as noted below . Petitions for reinstatement for the purposes of graduation must be received by the Fletcher Registrar by the last day of instruction for the semester in which they plan to graduate. If approved, reinstated candidates will be charged a reinstatement fee during the semester that their candidacy is extended. This fee must be paid before the diploma will be issued to the student. Students who reinstate for the purposes of graduation are not considered enrolled and are not elig ible for loan deferral. Petitions for reinstatement for the purposes of students continuing their academic career at Fletcher must be received by the Fletcher Registrar no later than the first day of instruction in the semester in which they plan to enro ll. A reinstatement fee may be waived during the semester that they enroll in courses as a student at Fletcher. Reinstated students who enroll in coursework may be eligible for loan deferral depending on registration status (part -time, half - time, or full- time). Petitions for reinstatement within seven years of initial matriculation are reviewed and approved by the Fletcher Registrar. Students who petition to reinstate after seven years must have their petition reviewed and approved by the Committee on St udent Academic Programs STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 43 (CSAP). If the student's petition is received after the last CSAP meeting for the semester, the student may be required to reinstate in the following term. Students reinstated after seven years may be required to take additional courses to meet current degree requirements. In all cases, students who intend to reinstate are encouraged to contact the Fletcher Registrar as early as possible in the semester in wh ich a petition will be submitted. Reinstated students in residential degree programs will have a hold placed on their record at the start of the semester and must contact the Fletcher Registrar for all enrollment transactions. Students who do not return by the date listed on their leave of absence petition will have their records discontinued and will need to apply for reinstatement. Doctoral candidates who do not maintain active student status either through payment of the PhD course tuition fee or payment of the PhD enrollment fee will be eligible to petition the PhD Committee for rein statement of degree candidacy based on their stage in the program and the time lapse since their separation. If reinstatement is approved, PhD candidates will be charged the reinstatement fee in addition to their PhD tuition or enrollment fee charges. Students who were placed on academic probation in their last semester before discontinuation must petition CSAP for reinstatement. GBA students who do not resume studies after an approved leave of absence may petition to reinstate their degree candidacy within seven years of the program withdrawal date. Students must submit the GBA Reinstatement Form at least one month prior to the start of the intended term of return. If the reinstatement is approved, students will be a charged a reinstatement fee in addition to tuition. Once reinstated, GBA students will be considered enrolled at The Fletcher School and may be eligible for loan deferral depending on registration status (part -time, half -time, or full - time). Reinstated students are not eligible for a leave of absence unless the leave is due to medical or compassionate reasons. Joint Degree A joint degree student is enrolled in one degree program that is co -sponsored by Fletcher and another school. Only one diploma is issued for joint degrees. Each joint degree program has its own degree requirements. Students may fulfill their Fletcher requirements by direct enrollment at Fletcher, through cross -registration or enrollment in cross -listed courses. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 44 Dual Degree A dual degree student is enrolled in two degree programs concurrently. The student is responsible for admission to both degree programs and satisfying the requirements for each degree program. Dual degree requirements may vary depending on the program. Students should submit the dual degree notification form to the Fletcher Registrar as soon as they are admitted to the second degree program. Dual degree student s are awarded both degrees in the same semester , one from Fletcher and one from the second institution. There are established dual degree programs for students in the MALD, MIB, and LLM degree programs. MGA students are not eligible for dual degree because of the intensive nature of the degree. Students in the MALD and MIB programs may design an ad hoc dual degree. To accept an ad hoc dual degree, Fletcher requires that the following four criteria be met: 1. The student is admitted separately to each school. 2. The student spen ds three semesters and takes a minimum of 36.0 credits at Fletcher for the MALD and spends three semesters and takes a minimum of 42.0 credits at Fletcher for the MIB . 3. The student requests transfer credit for a maximum of four courses from the second institution for the MALD or MIB degree by submitting an official transcript prior to graduation . All transfer credit policies apply. 4. The student completes the Capstone requirement prior to graduation . All students interested in dual degree programs must apply to Fletcher and the partner institution separately. Each school will admit students according to their own policies and qualifications. Each school will approve the student's graduation based on the degree requirements and academic regulations of their institution. Tuition will be charged by and scholarships will be awarded by the school in which the student is registered in courses . Students in dual degree programs may not attend both schools in the same semester, except for dual degree programs with Harvard graduate schools where cross -registration is approved. Exchange Fletcher offers a number of exchange programs with partner instit utions around the world. MALD and MIB students have the option of studying at one of our exchange partner institutions in their third or fourth semester. In addition to submitting an application for exchange to Fletcher by the published deadlines, s tudents are responsible for meeting all application deadlines set by the host school. As part of the exchange application, the student's academic record will be considered . Students need to be in good academic standing in the semester prior to participating in exchange. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 45 During the exchange semester, Fletcher students pay full tuition to Fletcher and financial aid is granted by Fletcher. Students are assessed the health insurance and health services fee through Tufts. Participants are expected to cover all travel and living expenses during their exchange semester. The exchange institution may change activity or other fees. During the exchange semester, students are expected to take a full course load equivalent to 12.0 Fletcher credits at the host institution and will earn 12.0 credits towards the degree. Students submit an official transcript to Fletcher after the end of their exchange term. Courses taken on exchange will appear on the Fletcher transcript without grades, and are not factored into the students GPA . Students are not eligible for exchange in a semester after a leave of absence. Cross -Registration The Fletcher School only accepts cross -registra nts from Tufts University and Harvard University. All students who take courses are Fletcher through a cross -registration agreement are subject to all the policies outlined in this Student Handbook. Employee Registration Employees must be officially enrolled to take courses at Fletcher, either in a degree -seeking or non-degree status. Non-Degree Students may enroll at Fletcher through non -degree student status. All students who take courses are Fletcher are subject to all the policies outlined in this Student Handbook. Non - degree students are responsible for all applicable tuition and fees. Academic Standing and Satisfactory Academic Progress All policies are implemented, enforced, and may be amended by Fletcher's Academ ic Council. Good Academic Standing Tufts University defines a student as being in \"good standing\" as long as they remain actively enrolled and not on academic alert, academic probation and/or disciplinary probation . In general, students remain in good standing when they are mak ing satisfactory academic progress towards their degree program, meet ing rate of work and earn ing satisfactory grades in all courses . Students must be in good academic and disciplinary standing to be eligible for cross -regist ration , study abroad on exchange, or to audit a course . Transfer credit toward the Fletcher degree will be accepted only from students who are in good academic and disciplinary standing at the time of credit transfer, and in accordance with all transfer cr edit policies. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 46 Academic Alert A full-time residential student may be placed on an academic alert at the end of any semester in which the student does not meet one criteria of satisfactory academic progress : failing to meet rate of work for their degree p rogram or earning one failing grade (including modules). Students may be placed on academic alert if they receive incomplete grades \" I\" in more than half their courses in one semester. If student is on a Registrar -approved reduced course load, an academic alert will be issued if the student earns 3.0 credits fewer than total number of attempted credits. A GBA student will be sent an academic alert at the end of any semester in which tha t student has failed one course. Incompletes are not earned credits. A permanent notation of academic alert will be recorded on the student's unofficial transcript only for the semester they are on academic alert . Students may not be on academic alert for two conse cutive semesters. At the conclusion of a semester of academic alert, the student academic record is reviewed and students either return to good standing or are placed on probation in the semester after they are on academic alert. Students on acad emic alert may be subject to academic leave or dismissal in certain cases where continuous academic concerns impede progress towards the degree. At the discretion of the Fletcher Registrar, students in residential degree programs on academic alert will h ave a hold placed on their record at the start of the semester and must contact the Fletcher Registrar for all enrollment transactions. A hold preventing the student from ordering transcripts may be placed in lieu of or in addition to any other penalties outlined in this section. Students in dual degree programs may be placed on academic alert for academic reasons in either degree program. Students who are on academic alert are not eligible for cross registration or to study abroad on exchange or to audit a course. Academic Probation A full-time residential student will be placed on academic probation at the end of any semester in which that student earned 6.0 credits or fewer or failed to make satisfactory academic progress. If student is on a Registrar -approved reduced course load, the student will be placed on academic probation at the end of any semester in which the student earns 6 .0 credits fewer than total number of attempted credits . To return to good academic standing, in the following semest er the student must complete 12.0 credits and earn satisfactory grades in all courses attempted . If student is on a Registrar -approved reduced course load, good academic standing is achieved by completing all credits attempted in the following semester and earning satisfactory grades in all courses attempted . Additionally, the student must submit a n academic plan to the Fletcher Registrar to outline how the student will make up missing credits from prior semesters. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 47 At the discretion of the Fletcher Registrar, students in residential degree programs on academic probation will have a hold placed on their record at the start of the semester and must contact the Fletcher Registrar for all enrollment transactions. A hold preventing the student from ordering transcripts may be placed in lieu of or in addition to any other penalties outlined in this section. After a semester on academic alert, a GBA student may be placed on academic probation at the en d of a second semester in which th e student has failed more than one course or earned fewer than 3.0 credits or failed to make satisfactory academic progress. To return to good academic standing, in the following semester the student must satisfactorily co mplete all credits attempted in the following semester. Additionally, the student must submit a plan to the GBA program to make up any missing credits from previous semesters. Academic probation can affect financial aid, eligibility for cross -registrati on for residential students , and other privileges on a case- by-case basis. A permanent notation of academic probation will be recorded on the student's official transcript for the semester they are on academic probation . Students who remain on academic pro bation for two or more consecutive semesters are subject to review by the Committee on Student Academic Programs (CSAP) and may be subject to academic leave or dismissal. If a student returns from a required withdrawal and is placed on academic probation i n any semester after the return, the student will be subject to a permanent academic withdrawal, determined by the CSAP . Students who are on academic probation are not eligible for cross -registration or to study abroad on exchange, or to audit a course. Satisfactory Academic Progress Satisfactory academic progress is met when the student meets rate of work in a semester and earns satisfactory grades (B - or higher) in all courses. All grades lower than B - are considered failing grades. Students who are no t taking courses towards their degree requirements may also be considered not making satisfactory progress. Normal rate of work for full-time students in residential programs is 12.0 credit hours. MGA students have a summer course requirement. MIB students have additional credit requirements in their first and second year . Most courses at Fletcher are 3.0 credit hours. Module courses are 1.5 credit hours. For residential and GMAP students, c apstone courses are non -credit, graded courses. Courses taken at Fl etcher prior to June 2018 will be converted to the current credit system in effect since fall 2018 for the purpose of meeting satisfactory academic progress and degree requirements. GBA and GMAP have their own rate of work as outlined below. If student is on a Registrar - approved reduced course load, they meet rate of work by completing all attempted credits in a semester.

A student will have the opportunity to submit a petition explaining their academic plan for completing the degree requirements and submit to CSAP any supporting documentation from Fletcher faculty or staff or other relevant documentation. CSAP will review the student's academic record and petition and may, at its discretion, recommend that the student is placed on academic alert or that the student is additionally reviewed by Academic Council for academic leave or dismissal. At the discretion of the Fletcher Registrar, students in residential degree programs who are not making satisfacto ry academic progress will have a hold placed on their record at the start of the semester and must contact the Fletcher Registrar for all enrollment transactions. Financial Aid Implications According to federal regulations and Tufts policy, the student mu st be making satisfactory academic progress towards their degree in order to be eligible for federal and state financial aid. They must accumulate at least the number of credits in the table above by the end of each semester and maintain a 2.7 cumulative G PA. Transfer credits and summer credits may be used to satisfy these requirements. Repeated courses can only be used to satisfy these STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 49 requirements in cases where the student receives course credit for the repeated course. Progress will be reviewed at the end of each term in which the student is enrolled. If the student does not meet the satisfactory academic progress guidelines, they will be given one semester on Financial Aid Warning. If they do not meet the guidelines by the beginning of the following s emester, they will be ineligible to receive any federal or state financial aid, including Federal Direct Loans. They may regain eligibility if they meet the guidelines in subsequent semesters. If the student returns from a leave of absence after making u nsatisfactory progress, they will be placed on Financial Aid Probation and must agree to an academic plan that requires completing at least 12.0 credits in each subsequent semester. GBA students would need to complete at least 3.0 credits in each subsequen t semester. Student Visa Implications According to the U.S. Federal immigration regulations, F -1 or J -1 visa bearing students must be making normal academic progress during the academic duration and are expected to meet the graduation requirements by thei r visa document (I -20 or DS- 2019) end date. It is not authorized for an international student to request an extension of the visa document end date due to failing or incomplete courses. If such condition occurs and the international student is not able t o graduate before the visa document end date, they need to request a leave of absence and depart the United States as soon as possible. If school policy allows, they may be able to request a new visa document in order to apply for a new visa and return to The Fletcher School to resume the incomplete courses or academic requirements. An international student with a F -1 or J -1 visa will lose their visa status when the school permanently dismisses the student effective immediately on the dismissal date. There is no \"grace period\" given for such a situation, and the student's visa status will be terminated immediately. Once the student's visa status is terminated, they must leave the United States as soon as possible regardless of the visa documents validity (e.g., F -1/J-1 visa or I -20/DS- 2019 validity). The visa status termination record will be registered with the U.S. Immigration database, such as SEVIS (maintained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and could affect the student's future U.S. visa applications. Committee on Student Academic Programs (CSAP) The Committee on Student Academic Programs reviews all student requests for exceptions to academic requirements excluding those petitions related to PhD requirements, which are handled by the PhD Com mittee. CSAP normally meets once each month during the fall and spring semesters between September and April. CSAP does not meet during the summer. Student inquiries about CSAP petitions should be directed to the Fletcher Registrar. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 50 Petitions include a written statement from the student. In general, this statement should address: What degree requirements the student must still fulfill in order to graduate How the student will fulfill the degree requirements (including faculty endorsem ent) How the student's petition helps the student advance their academic and professional goals Additional information needed for the petition statement may vary depending on the petition. Students submitting a petition to CSAP are encouraged to contact the Fletcher Registrar at least two weeks prior to submitting their petition.

The student's petition statement should include a list of at least three courses and 9.0 credits being offered in the field and detail how each of the courses support s the design of the field and how the courses in the field work together to create a cohesive field of study . Self- designed fields for PhD students have additional requirements. The student should outline what knowledge base will be gained through the self -designed field and address why their goals cannot be achieved through F letcher's existing fields of study. Additionally, students should indicate in their petition the closest established field of study to their self -designed field and detail how the two fields are distinguished. Petitions for s elf-designed fields must be presented to CSAP prior to the first day of instruction in student's final semester at Fletcher. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 54 To be approved, a s elf-designed field must satisfy the following requirements: A member of the Fletcher faculty must assume responsibility for advising the student on the s elf-designed field and must support the request in writing. The self-designed field must con sist of at least three courses and 9.0 credits for the MALD and MIB and at least four courses and 12.0 credits for the PhD. The self-designed field mu st include at least one (3.0 credits) Fletcher course as the required course for the field. For PhD candidates, at least three courses and 9.0 credits in the field must be Fletcher courses. The s elf-designed field should consist of a group of courses with a clear methodology, a respect able volume of theoretical and applied literature, and boundaries that enable a clear distinction to be made between the subject of the self-designed field and related subjects outside the field. The field shoul d have an international component and fit within the Fletcher curriculum. Transfer Credit and Exam Credit Transfer Credit Transfer credit is only accepted for students in the MALD and GBA degree program. Transfer credit is not an option for all other degree programs: MGA, MIB, MA, LLM, MATA, GMAP, and PhD candidates. Transfer credit for MIB candidates is only accepted for stu dents enrolled in dual or joint degree programs , or on approved exchange programs . GBA students may petition for to transfer in up to nine credits from outside of Fletcher, which may be applied to elective courses only. It is expected that students will petition for transfer credit at least three months prior to the semester when they plan to reduce their enrollment. Transfer credit approved from joint or dual degrees or exchange programs will be updated in the student's record at the time an official transcript is received by the Fletcher Registrar showing final grades in all courses being transferred. In other cases, transfer credit may not be updated in the student's record until 50% of the Fletcher program has been completed and an official transcript is received. Students will earn a maximum of 12.0 credits towards the degree from transfer. Course accepted for transfer will appear on the Fletcher transcript without grades and are not factored into the student's GPA. Students who apply to transfer cred it to their Fletcher record are not eligible to cross -register while at Fletcher. Petitions for transfer credit will be re viewed providing: The Fletcher Registrar reviews all petitions for transfer credit for courses completed in all formal and ad hoc dual and joint degree programs as well as petitions to transfer graduate- level STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 55 courses that were taken within the previous five years and not offered toward a prior degree. The GBA program administrator reviews transfer credit for GBA students. A course syllabus is required for review of transfer credit. In general, the criteria for courses accepted as transfer credit: 1. The course was taken at an accredited graduate school and is comparable to course offerings at Fletcher in rigor and contact hours consistent with a 3.0 credit Fletcher course for a full -semester course or 1.5 credit Fletcher course for a half -semester cou rse 2. The student was registered as a graduate student at the time the coursework was completed 3. The grade received is a B - or better and an official transcript is submitted 4. A course description, reading list, or bibliography are submitted 5. The course is evalu ated and approved by a Fletcher faculty member who offers coursework in this area 6. The student presents a strong justification as to the relevance of the proposed transfer credit to their academic program at Fletcher 7. The courses were not offered toward a pr ior degree 8. Whether offered in -person or online, course has synchronous class meetings 9. Course content fits within the Fletcher curriculum A maximum of twenty -five percent of the required course credits for a student's program may be fulfilled with non -Fletcher courses. The maximum applies to courses taken through cross - registration and courses accepted as transfer credit for degree programs that allow transfer credit. Courses taken at Fletcher prior to admission to a degree program may count towards a Fletcher degree provided the courses were not used towards a prior degree, up to the maximum of twenty -five percent of their course requirement. This policy applies to Fletcher courses taken as a non -degree student. With the endorsement of a Fletcher faculty field advisor. c ourses taken at other institutions accepted as transfer credit towards the Fletcher degree may count as one course towards a student's field of study. Students requesting to use a non -Fletcher course towards the breadth and other co urse requirements for the residential degree programs must receive endorsement of the appropriate Fletcher faculty for the area of study and petition CSAP for the substitution of a course requirement . Petitions for substitutions to core courses for the deg ree and substitutions to the quantitative reasoning requirement, with appropriate faculty endorsement, may be received by the Fletcher Registrar. Students who have taken courses at other institutions through dual degree programs must receive the endorsement of an appropriate Fletcher faculty for the area of study to count transfer credit towards their breadth and division requirements , and towards their field of study if applicable. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 56 Dual -degree candidates Students may transfer no more than the equivalen t of four full -semester courses or 12.0 credits (including cross -registration courses taken while enrolled at Fletcher). The only exception to the four -course limit applies to students in Fletcher's degree programs with the Diplomatic Academy in Vienna and the University of St. Gallen ; students in these programs may cross - register for one course (3.0 credits) per semester . Dual degree candidates are cautioned that courses they plan to offer for transfer credit should not be taken during the same semester that they intend to graduate from Fletcher. Due to differences in academic calen dars, the final grades and official transcripts for these courses may not reach the Registrar's Office in time for degree conferral in that semester. Course Equivale ncy Exams Students in residential programs may take the following equivalency exams: EIB E201 Introduction to Economic Theory EIB B205 Data Analysis and Statistical Methods EIB B206 Data Analysis and Statistical Methods for Business EIB E210M Quantitative Methods EIB E212 Macroeconomics EIB E217M Managerial Economics Passing the equivalency exam exempts students from taking the course at Fletcher. In cases when an equivalency exam is offered by Fletcher, the only means of gaining equivalency i s by passing the equivalency exam. Registration for the equivalency exam is required in advance of the exam of the date. Students may only receive credit for the course or the equivalency exam, but not both. When an equivalency exam for a course is not o ffered , students who have previously completed graduate level work equivalent to the Fletcher course may apply for an equivalency for the course. Such equivalency requires the written endorsement of the Fletcher faculty who teaches the course for which equ ivalency is desired. Equivalency does not entitle the student to count that course for credit. MALD students may attempt the equivalency exam for the economics breadth requirement and the quantitative reasoning breadth requirement. MALD students who pass the economics equivalency exam are required to fulfill an upper -level economics course to satisfy the breadth requirement. For MIB students wishing to take equivalency exams in managerial economics, data analysis and statistics, and macroeconomics, the exam must be taken and passed in the first year of study. If they are not taken in the first year, the associated course must be taken in the first year instead. All MIB students must take the EIB B206 Data Analysis and Statistical Methods for Business cour se or pass the B206 E quivalency Exam by the end of their first year of study. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 57 Courses and Grading Course Enrollment Regardless of credit or audit status, all students attending a class must be enrolled and appear on the class roster. Apart from the shopping period, Fletcher students may not sit in on a course informally. Non -Fletcher students may not sit in on a course under any circumstances. Attendance Policy Students enrolled in Fletcher courses for credit or audit are expected to attend class and participate regularly. Individual instructors may have an attendance and participation requirement that is used in the grade calculation and students should consult the instructor or review the course syllabus. Course Examinations Students must take course examinations at the regularly scheduled time with exceptions granted only in extraordinary circumstances such as for medical reasons. This policy also applies to final exams which take place after the last day of instruction. In cases where the student is requesting an exception to this policy , the student must notify the Fletcher Registrar a nd obtain approval from the course instructor at least five business days prior to the exam date. For medical reasons, a note from a phys ician or the University Health Services may be requested . Non -native English speakers may be allowed an additional 30 minutes to complete exams with prior approval from the course instructor. Students with three final exams scheduled in a 24 -hour period during final exam week will be eligible to request to move one exam to another date, subject to the approval of the instructor. This policy only applies to exams scheduled through the Fletcher Registrar and may not apply to other academic activities during f inal exam week. The ability to make up an exam after the exam date is at the sole discretion of the instructor. The Registrar 's Office does not proctor exams and arrangements for a proctor are the responsibility of the student and the instructor. All rescheduled exams must take place after the original exam date. Students who are absent from exams without prior approval for a new exam date may receive a failing grade for the exam. The Student Accessibility and Academic Resource (StAAR ) Center provides reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. Any student requesting exam accommodations should connect with the StAAR Center to complete the registration process at lease a week prior to any assessments . Any student who is ap proved through StAAR for accommodations is responsible for sharing their accommodation letter with their faculty member if they intend to use accommodations in a course. StAAR recommends notifying faculty one week prior to a scheduled exam in order to coor dinate accommodations as needed. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 58 Grades Passing grades at Fletcher have the following range: A, A -, B+, B and B- . Numerical equivalents for letter grades are as follows: A = 4.0, A - = 3.67, B+ = 3.33, B = 3.0, B - = 2.67. Grade point averages are not recor ded on transcripts. For courses taken outside of Fletcher, through Cross -Registration, non-letter grades will be accepted only if: 1) Letter grades are not an option or 2) Non -letter grading (e.g. Pass/Fail or Credit/ No Credit ) is specifically recommended by the program. For courses taken outside of Fletcher on dual degree, exchange, or other transfer credit, the grade does not appear on the Fletcher transcript. Repeating Courses Students may not repeat a course in which they have already earned credit. S tudents may repeat a course if they did not earn credit on the first attempt because of a failing grade or withdrawal from the course. Independent study courses are exempted under this policy. The original enrollment and any assigned grade from the first attempt remain on the student's record. Student who repeats a course to earn credit, either under the Failing Grades policy or after a withdrawal, must formally enroll in the course on SIS. Failing Grades Any grade less than B - is a failing grade. A failing grade must be offset by additional course work taken for credit. This policy also applies to cross -registered courses even though grades under B - are considered passing at other graduate schools. Students participating in any of our formal exchange programs are sub ject to the passing standard applied at the host institution. If a residential student fails a course taken at Fletcher , they may take a fifth course overload one time without additional cost in the following semester at Fletcher in order to make up the missing credit . Students on reduced course load are charged per course and are not eligible for the fifth course exception. Online students may be eligible to retake a single failed course at no charge, at the program's discretion. Students in the GMAP program may only repeat the same course to waive the tuition charge. Any additional failed courses , whether in the same or in a subsequent semester , are subject to standard tuition charges. Students whose failing grade is the result of academic or professional integrity violations are not eligible to take a fifth course without cost . For students in programs where the Professional Development Program (PDP) is a degree requirement, students who do not complete PDP with tw o semesters may be assigned a permanent unsatisfactory grade \" U\" on their transcript. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 59 Incomplete Grades A student who, due to unusual circumstances, is unable to complete the work of a course by the end of the semester, may request permission from the instructor to take a grade of incomplete \"I\". The decision to allow a grade of incomplete is at the discreti on of the instructor. The instructor has the authority to not to grant an extension, assign an incomplete \"I\" grade, or accept work after the due dates indicated on the syllabus. It is the responsibility of the student to request the incomplete from the in structor using the Incomplete Grade Request Form provided by the registrar's office. Once granted by the instructor, the form should be signed and submitted to the registrar's office. GBA students are required to submit an Incomplete Grade Request Form for approval to the GBA program office. Incompletes are generally granted when the student has been active in the class in a substantial way including attendance; typically, that means only one assignment, a final project, or final exam remains to be submit ted. The instructor has the sole discretion to determine what qualifies as substantial. The deadline to petition for an incomplete is the last day of instruction in the term the student is enrolled in the course for which an incomplete is being requested. If the student has not petitioned for an incomplete by the last day of the term, a final letter grade, which may be a failing grade, will be assigned. If an incomplete is granted, all work in the course must be completed and graded within one year from t he start of the semester in which the course was taken. If the student is unable to complete the work by the stated deadline or after one year, then the grade for this course will become a permanent incomplete \"PI\" grade. Course work submitted for an incom plete must be reviewed and graded by the faculty member with whom the course was taken. If students receive a grade of incomplete for a cross -registered course, they must adhere to the policy of the host school. Incompletes will not be granted solely to avoid a failing grade and will be granted based on the student's ability to reasonably make up missing coursework. Students who have attempted no work in a course may not request an incomplete \"I\" grade and should either drop the course with a withdrawn \"W \" grade before the drop deadline or receive a failing grade. If the student does not make a request for an incomplete, a final grade will be assigned by the instructor based on the work the student has done during the semester, including any participatio n requirement. Both the student and instructor are encouraged to reach out to the Registrar and Office of Academic Advising if any questions arise about an incomplete grade and the student's academic standing. At the end of each semester, the Fletcher Regi strar will review the academic records of all students. If, at that time, a residential student has two or more incompletes in a semester, they will not be permitted to cross -register at Harvard or Tufts until all coursework has received letter grades. In cases where a student fails a course after receiving an incomplete grade, the student must submit an academic plan to the Fletcher Registrar to outline how the student will complete their degree requirements. Students with failing grades will not be permit ted to cross -register until they have consulted with the STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 60 Fletcher Registrar and are subject to all policies on satisfactory academic progress, academic alert, and academic probation. Students on academic alert or academic probation or with incomplete grades may not audit courses. If an incomplete is received for the GBA core courses B200 Corporate Finance and Global Capital Markets or B236 International Strategy and Innovation, the GBA student may take elective courses in the following term, but must receive a final course grade before the beginning of course registration for the next term (i.e. if the incomplete is received for B200 in the spring, the student may take elective courses in the summer, but must receive a final course grade for B200 before th e start of course registration for the fall term). If a final grade is not received for the core course before the registration deadline, the faculty member must enter the course grade as the student currently stands. If the student does not pass the cours e, the failure policy is implemented, and the student must take the core course again in the following semester, in some cases at no additional charge. Course Withdrawal Course withdrawa ls are allowed during the late add period without penalty. See the Academic Calendar for registration dates . After the end of the late add /drop period, students who drop a course will be assigned a withdrawn \"W\" grade. Withdrawal from a course is not equivalent to a course failure. Residential master's students who drop a course after the last day of the late add period and receive a withdrawn \"W\" grade may be eligible to take a fifth course overload one time without additional cost in the following semester at Fletcher in order to m ake up the missing credit . Students on reduced course load are charged per course and are not eligible for the fifth course exception. Any additional courses withdrawn and assigned a \"W\" grade, whether in the same or in a subsequent semester, are subject t o standard tuition charges. Students whose withdrawn grade is the result of academic or professional integrity violations are not eligible to take a fifth course without cost. Students may withdraw from a course until the last day of instruction. Request s for drops submitted after the last day of instruction must be endorsed by the instructor or the Academic Dean and may require the student to submit supporting materials or petition CSAP for a retroactive withdrawal. Students in full -time status who drop from one or more courses after the first day of instruction are not eligible for a tuition refund. The Tufts University refund policy only applies to students who withdraw, are required to withdraw, or take a leave of absence f rom Fletcher for the term . Students on reduced course load are charged per course and should consult with the Fletcher Registrar before dropping a course after the first day of instruction. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 61 Registration Policy on Overlapping Courses The Fletcher School does not allow students to be enrolled in courses that overlap in time. This policy applies to courses being taken for credit as well as to those being taken for audit , and courses taken through cross -registration . Enrollment transactions that create a time conflict on a student's class schedule will not be processed. Policy on Concurrent Enrollment Fletcher students may not enroll at another institution in the same semester they are enrolled and paying tuition at Fletcher. Courses taken at Harvard and Tuft s through cross- registration are excluded from this policy. Students in dual degree and exchange programs are expected to enroll at each institution in different semesters and should submit their academic plan to the Fletcher Registrar. Registration Hold s Prior to registration, students are urged to check whether they have a hold on their account. Students may not participate in the registration until all registration holds are resolved. There are several reasons why an account might have a hold. These include: Outstanding financial obligations Health Service issues, including proof of health insurance or immunizations Student needs to update emergency contact or local address information in SIS Hold placed by the Fletcher Registrar Students can review their holds by logging into SIS and reviewing their holds. Students must then contact the office that placed the hold. Once the situation has been resolved, the hold will be removed from the student's account electronically. Fifth Course Enrollment Policy MALD and PhD candidates are per mitted in two semesters to take five courses in a semester. MGA, MA, MATA, and LLM candidates are permitted to do so once. Pursuing five courses in a semester is optional and additional to normal course requirements. Optional means that students are not required to take a fifth course. To enroll in the fifth course overload, students complete the registration form and return it to the Fletcher Registrar. MIB students are required to take a fifth course in two of their four semesters . MIB students may enroll above 15.0 credits in a semester in accordance with the fifth or module overload policy. Students optionally take a fifth course solely for academic enrichment. The fifth course does not allow a student to decrease their required course load in a future semester. Students are STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 62 expected to enroll in full -time credits for their degree program unless on a Registrar -approved reduced course load or approved part -time status . Grading and transcript policies are the same for all courses. Fifth courses appear on students' transcripts and are considered in student's satisfactory academic progress. If a student withdraws from an optional fifth course after the drop deadline, a grade of \"W\" is recorded on the transcript. Students are charged the cost of one course, in addition to the published tuition rates for a full- time student. Additional financial aid may not be available for students taking an optional fifth course. Waitlist Registration Instructors are individually responsible for waitlist management in cases where a waitlist is being used for the course. Students will be enrolled automatically in a course with a waitlist in the order they are placed on the waitlist, provided the enrollment does not create a conflict or overload on the student's schedule. If the student is unable to be enrolled from the automatic waitlist in SIS for any reason, then, the student may seek permission from the instructor for permission to enroll when the enrollment limit is met or exceeded. Class listings will indicate alternativ e procedures to instructor permission, including permission to enroll . Independent Study Courses 300-399 Residential students may enroll in no more than 6.0 credits of independent study cour ses, numbered 300 -399, provided they continue to make satisfactory academic progress. One independent study course may be offered in fulfillment of a field of study requirement with endorsement of the faculty field ad visor. A field exception form must be submitted to the Fletcher Registrar. MGA students may complete one independent study course. Independent study courses may earn 3.0 credits or 1.5 credits depending on the assignments and final deliverable. Students should expect to spend between 8 -12 hours per week for a 3.0 credit independent study course, roughly 180 hours total during the semester. Students should expect to spend between 4 -6 hours per week for a 1.5 credit independent study course, roughly 90 hours total during the semester. Assignments, readings, and submi tted work are determined by the instructor. The deadline to submit all work for the semester is published on the Academic Calendar. Independent study courses always earn a letter grade. A 300- level course may not be substituted for a core course in the fi eld of study and may not be offered in satisfaction of breadth requirements. Students are not permitted to enroll in a Fletcher independent study course based on coursework done at another institution. Students may enroll, with faculty endorsement, in an independent study course in the same semester as the capstone. While the capstone and independent study are graded separately, the work for each may overlap. The same grade may be assigned to both the capstone and the independent study at the faculty's discretion. Independent study courses may not be taken for audit. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 63 Independent Study Courses for Online Programs GBA students who are interested in pursuing an independent study course or independent capstone project must submit the appropriate petition form accompanied by a written proposal to the GBA Program Office. The petition must be received at least 4 weeks before the start of the term. If approved, independent study courses cannot be completed pass/fail and the student must receive a letter grade from the instructor at the end of the term to receive credit for the course. GMAP students may not enroll in independent study courses. Capstone Students in the MALD, MIB, MA, LL M, and GMAP programs require a capstone project and will be enrolled in a non -credit, grade Capstone course. For MALD and MIB, students enroll in their third semester. For MA and LLM, students enroll in their second semester. GMAP students should contact the GMAP program office to discuss the timing of capstone enrollment. Completion of this course with a letter grade is required to graduate. Capstone may not be taken pass/fail or for audit. Extensions for capstones are entirely at the discretion of the capstone supervisor. If the capstone grade will not be submitted to the Registrar's Office by the grading deadline listed in the Academic Calendar , the student may receive an i ncomplete \"I\" grade. All students may extend one semester past their expected graduation date to complete their capstone and other degree requirements. Tuition is not charged for the continuation semester provided the studen t is not enrolled in courses. If the capstone is not completed by the end of the continuation semester, the student will be discontinued and will need to petition for reinstatement, pay the reinstatement fee, and submit any remaining work. Reinstatement beyond the continuation semester is required for the student to be eligible to graduate. Regardless of the semester in which the student finalizes the capstone project, students are responsible for the original agreed upon capstone work and final assignment and must make a new agreemen t with the instructor on any extension of deadlines for submission. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 64 PhD Reading and Research Courses Students who are engaged in researching and writing their PhD dissertation will be enrolled in IR 400, a 12.0 credit non-graded course that grants the s tudent full -time status , each term including in the summer . Half Courses (Modules) The Fletcher School has a limited number of half courses worth 1.5 credits offered every year and designated by the letter \"M\" in the course number . Additionally, half cou rses are offered at other institutions where Fletcher has cross -registration agreements. In an at tempt to encourage and allow students to take these half courses, residential students who are enrolled full-time in 12.0 credits may take a 1.5 credit overload for a total of 13.5 credits once in their Fletcher career with no additional tuition charge. MIB students may enroll in 13.5 credits in each semester of full -time study, and may enroll to 15.0 credits in two semesters for a total of 54.0 credits. MIB students are also eligible for a module overload in one semester and fifth course in up to two semesters . Cross -Registration for Residential Programs The Fletcher School only has cross -registration agreements with Tufts University and Harvard Univer sity. As such, Fletcher students are not permitted to cross -register at any other institutions. Cross- registration is open to residential master's students and external admit PhD degree candidates . Up to a maximum of twenty -five percent of the required course credits for a student's program may be fulfilled with non -Fletcher courses. For students in two -year programs, students may cross -register to a maximum of four full -semester courses or the equivalent ( 12.0 credits) . For students in one -year programs, students may cross- register to a maximum of two full -semester courses or the equivalent (6.0 credits) . MGA students may cross -register to a maximum of two full -semester courses or the equivalent (6.0 credits) . The maximum applies to courses taken through cross -registration and courses accepted as transfer credit for degree programs that allow transfer credit. Full -semester cross -registration courses taken at a higher credit value will earn 3.0 credits for the purposes of meeting rate of work and degree requirements . Half-semester cross -registration courses taken at another credit value will earn 1.5 credits for the purposes of meeting rate of work and degree requirements. Students in the MATA degree program w ho start at Fletcher may cross -register for up to two full-semester courses or the equivalent (6.0 credits) while enrolled at Fletcher. Students in the MATA degree program who start the College of Europe may cross -register for one full - semester course or the equivalent (3.0 credits) while enrolled at Fletcher. Cross- registration courses may not be offered to fulfill breadth requirements or other course requirements. A maximum of one full -semester course or the equivalent (3.0 credits) taken through cross -registration may apply towards a field of study with faculty field advisor endorsement for MGA, MALD, and MIB students. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 65 A maximum of two full -semester courses (6.0 credits) may be taken through cross -registration in one semester for students enrolled in full -time credits (12.0 credits or greater) at Fletcher . Students on approved reduced course load of at least 6.0 credits may enroll in one full- semester cross -registration course (3.0 credits) in the term they are part -time at Fletcher. Courses offered during the January term at Harvard are considered spring term courses and without exception must be credited toward a student 's spring term enrollment. Additional cross -registration restrictions : LLM only - One of the two full -semester courses or the equivalent (3.0 credits) may be taken at Harvard Law School (HLS) . In such cases, the H LS course may count towards the total number of law courses the LLM candidate is required to take. Courses taken at HLS or other graduate programs at Harvard cannot be offered to fulfill the DHP or EIB distribution requirements. MIB only - Two of the four full -semester courses or the equivalent (6.0 credits) may be taken at Harvard Business School (HBS) . Internal admi t PhD students - Two full-semester courses or the equivalent (6.0 credits) may be taken during their PhD coursework phase, regardless of the number of non-Fletcher credits that were taken to meet MALD or MIB requirements. External admit PhD students - A maximum of three cross -registered full -semester courses or the equivalent (9.0 credits) may be used to fulfill requirements. Any accepted petitions for equivalence will reduce the number of cross -registered courses permitted (e.g. equivalence granted for one course reduces the number of cross - registered courses allowed to two). MATA ( third or fourth semester at Fletcher) and Exchange students - Students may cross -register at Harvard or Tufts for a maximum of one full -semester course or the equivalent (3.0 credits) . Online students are not permitted to cross -register for classes. Students may n ot audit a Harvard or Tufts graduate- level course. Audits Full-time (enrolled in 12.0 credits) residential students may, with the permission of the instructor, register to audit one Fletcher course per semester. This is in addition to the normal full course load. Upon satisfaction of requirements specified by the instructor, the audit will be recorded on the student 's transcript as a Certified Audit \" CA\". In all other cases, including language courses for audit taken at Tufts, courses will be graded wi th Audit \" AU\" in SIS and do not appear on the student's Fletcher transcript. Audits may not satisfy degree require- ments. There is no additional tuition charge for auditing a class. Audit registration forms will not be accepted after the audit registration deadline indicated in the A cademic Calendar. Students who are reinstated for the purposes of graduation may not enroll in a course for audit. Students who are reinstated for the purposes of continuing their academic career may enroll in one course for audit in any semester where they are enrolling full time in coursework for credit. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 66 Certified Audit \"CA\" grading basis is not available for independent study courses. Students on part -time status , approved reduced course load or continuation may not take courses for audit. Students on academic alert or academic probation may not take courses for audit. A student may switch a course from a credit to an audit until the last day of instruction with the approval of the course instru ctor. The student should submit a n audit registration form signed by the course instructor to the Fletcher Registrar. At the end of the semester, the student must receive a \" CA\" from the course instructor. Otherwise, the course will be considered a withdra wal and result in a \" W\" grade assigned as the switch from credit to audit was made after the drop deadline. No refund of tuition is permitted after the last day of registration according to the Academic Calendar for students switching from credit to audit. Students switching a course to audit after the late add period may not meet rate of work and should discuss their academic plan with the Fletcher Registrar prior to submitting the audit registration form. Switching a course from audit to credit is not permitted after the late registration deadline. Language Instruction Courses All residential students may enroll in one language course (other than English) for credit through cross -registration. Additionally, all students may audit up to one language instruction course (other than English) at Tufts per semester during each semester enrolled at Fletcher over and above all other enrolled courses . Consent to en roll in a language instruction course for audit through cross -registration requires instructor permission. Auditing a course through cross -registration at Harvard is not permitted under any circumstances. Pre-Session Courses Pre-session courses for resid ential students begin prior to the academic semester. In the fall, this is typically in August and in the spring, this is typically in January. August courses count as part of the fall semester course load and January courses count as part of the spring semester course load. Given the condensed duration of these courses, the following polici es apply: All course sessions are mandatory. Students are not permitted to miss any class meetings except for extenuating circumstances pre- approved by the course instructor and the Fletcher Registrar. Registration must be finalized by the 1 st day of the month in which the course is offered. No late enrollments will be permitted after this date. The drop deadline for pre -session courses is 11:59 PM on the first day of instruction . Any drops made after this deadline will result in a withdrawal code of a \"W .\" Thereafter, all course withdrawal policies apply. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 67 Summer Courses The Fletcher School offers a limited number of course offerings in the summer term. Course offerings will vary each summer and the class schedule will be released prior to the end of the spring term. See the Academic Calendar for summer term dates and deadlines. The number of seats available in summer courses is limited. MGA students have priority for enrollment in the summer. Enrollment in the summer term for MALD and MIB students is by petition only and will be approved on a seat available basis . MALD and MIB students approved to enroll in summer will be billed in the fall term, and may be eligible to reduce the number of credits taken in the subsequent fall term and should consult with the Registrar's Office before submitting their petition. Early Registration Fletcher offers an early registration period for all continuing students , including students in joint and dual degree programs , to enroll in a preliminary class schedule . Continuing student status is defined as students who will be in their second or later semester for the semester in which they wish to enroll and are currently active in a Fletcher degree program at the time of early registration.

Withdrawals, Leave of Absence, Parental Accommodation and Leave, Medical Emergencies, and Hospitalizations Withdrawals Students who wish to withdraw from The Fletcher School should notify the Fletcher Registrar. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 77 Leave of Absence A student may apply to take a leave of absence (LOA) for medical, academic, personal or parental reasons . Because students' circumstances differ, Fletcher handles each LOA on an individualized, case -by-case basis. The Director of Student Affairs, or the applicable Program Director for GBA or GMAP students, should be contacted to initiate the medical or parental LOA process. The Registrar, or the applicable Program Director for GBA or GMAP students, should be contac ted to initiate academic or personal LOA process. Each request for leave will be evaluated by the Office of Student Affairs or Registrar's Office in consultation with the appropriate academic and administrative staff to determine the conditions of the leav e, including duration of time, effective date and return date. Students granted a LOA are expected to use that time to address the life events and circumstances which precipitated the need for time away from the curriculum. Generally, a leave of absence is granted for up to one year except for medical leaves of absence, which may last longer. Students on leave of absence are not considered to be actively enrolled. As a result, students on leave do not regularly attend co -curricular student activities, reside in university residence halls, or use university facilities or resources such as the library and fitness center. Students who wish to use university facilities or attend university sponsored activities while on leave should speak with the Office of St udent Affairs about whether or not such requests can be accommodated. Students who do not return by the date listed on their leave of absence form will have their records discontinued and will need to apply for reinstatement. In extraordinary circumstances, requests for extensions will be considered by the Office of Student Affairs. Tuition and Financial Aid Students who leave the University during the first six weeks of classes are eligible for a refund of a percentage of tuition in accordance with the schedule set by the Bursar. Students with questions should contact the Bursar's Office in the Studen t Services Center in Dowling Hall. Students on financial aid should discuss the effect of a leave on their financial aid award or loans prior to going on leave. Students should contact Tufts Student Financial Services for questions about loans and Fletcher's Office of Admissions and Financial Aid for questions about scholarships. Students on leave are neither eligible for loans nor loan d eferral. International Students All leaves of absence must also be coordinated with the International Center , as a reduced course load may impact your visa status . On Campus Housing STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 78 Students going on a LOA must move out of any on -campus residence (if applicable) within five business days of requesting the leave. Please return keys to Residential Life. Tufts does not provide on -site storage. While on medical leave, students are not eligible to participate in the housing lottery and cannot select a proxy. Personal Leave of Absence A student who has experienced a family emergency, illness, death, or who encounters other unforeseen circumstances that require the student to take time off from school, may request a personal leave of absence. Leaves may be granted for temporary jobs or internship opportunities as well . The term of the personal leave may be for a period of up to one year. Students who wish to take a Personal Leave should submit a leave of absence petition to the Registrar's Office or the applicable Program Office for GBA or PhD students, stating their reason for the request, the departure date, and anticipated date of return. The Registrar's Office or the applicable Program Office for GBA or PhD students, in turn, will consult with the appropriate academic and administrative staf f in consideration of the request. Students on a personal leave of absence are automatically returned from the leave prior to the return date the student indicates on the leave of absence petition . Changes to their plans for leave of absence should be co mmunicated to both the Fletcher Registrar and the director of the degree program. Students who do not return from leave in the semester specified on their petition will have their records discontinued and will need to apply for reinstatement. Medical Leav e of Absence A medical leave of absence is available for students who find it difficult to productively or safely manage the demands of their academics, research, and campus life due to physical or mental health concerns. The Office of Student Affairs faci litates the medical leave process and approves medical leaves with input from the student's treatment provider, who may be a University clinician or an outside clinician engaged in the care of the student. The term of the Medical Leave may be for a period of up to one year. The medical leave may be extended for up to a second and final year, based upon the recommendation of the student's treatment provider in consultation with the Office of Student Affairs. How to Request a Medical Leave of Absence Althou gh medical leaves may be initiated by the student, in certain cases, medical health practitioners or physicians may recommend that it is not in the student's or the community's best interest for the student to continue at the university. The Office of Stu dent Affairs will accept such documentation on the student's behalf on a case- by-case basis. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 79 Student- Initiated Medical Leave The student submits a note to the Director of Student Affairs requesting a medical leave of absence. This note should indicate the reason for the leave (i.e. the medical condition that the student is hoping to address on leave), how the student intends to spend their time while on leave, and the expected duration. The Director of Student Affairs will review the request and determine whether leave is to be granted. Before approval is granted the Office of Student Affairs may consult with University and/or outside experts, as they deem necessary. Students may be required to give permission for their care providers to speak to the appropriate clinicians in Health or Counseling and Mental Health Services to apprise them of the student's treatment plan. School- Initiated Medical Leave The Director of Student Affairs or Executive Associate Dean may place a student on a medical leave of absence if the student cannot safely or productively continue in the program. School - initiated leaves may be for a period of up to one year. Students on a school -initiated medical leave should use this time to address the life events and circumstances precipitating their leave and to develop their independence and stability. How to Return from a Medical Leave of Absence A student on a medical leave of absence should notify the Director of Student Affairs of intent to return by the date indicated in the chart below. The following steps must be taken for a student to return from a medical leave of absence: 1. Letter Regarding Your Time Away . Submit a letter addressed to the Director of Student Affairs summarizing the student's time away from Tuf ts, the treatment and care received (if any), and plans for returning to academic and co -curricular life. The student may want to discuss the reasons for taking a medical leave, what has changed in the intervening time, why they feel ready to come back, and any other relevant information about how they have remained engaged and productive during their time away. The student should specify in which semester they are requesting to return. 2. S upporting Documentation. Submit to Health Service or Counseling and Mental Health Service the Clinical Progress Report Form from the primary treatment provider summarizing the student's treatment course during the leave, the current treatment plan, an assessment of the student's progress while away from Tufts, and any reco mmendation for support structures that could be useful upon return (if any). Students are required to provide the appropriate release forms to their treatment providers for this form. 3. M eetings with Appropriate Staff Upon submitting materials, students returning from Medical Leave will be required to speak with the appropriate Tufts administrators attending to health and academics. This may include: Your contact in the Office of Student Affairs. Counseling and Mental Health Service clinician fo r re-entry evaluation, if applicable. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 80 Medical Director of Health Services or clinical designee for re- entry evaluation, if applicable. Your program Director. Final decisions about the student's return are made by The Fletcher School's Office of Student A ffairs and if applicable, a designee determined by the Director of Student Affairs in consultation with the Director of Tufts Health Service or Counseling and Mental Health Service. Approval to return from Medical Leave will be based on the student's abili ty to demonstrate that they are ready to return to The Fletcher School. Semester of desired return Last day to notify Director of Student Affairs of intent to return Last day to receive all documentation and complete evaluative interviews Fall June 1 July 1 Spring October 1 November 1 Summer February 1 March 1 Considerations for Medical Leave Academics A medical leave of absence provides time for students to focus on receiving treatment and assistance for a health concern. Thus, students on medical leave may not be on the Tufts campus without approval, which means that they are typically unable to complete in -person coursework. Additionally, students may not attend co -curricular activities at the University while on medical leave without approval. This practice is intended to help students fully invest in addressing the health concern precipitating the leave. A student taking a medical leave may choose to have all classes removed from their transcript for the semester in which they seek to take the leave. Alternatively, if a student chooses to complete one or more classes, all the classes for the semester will remain on the transcript and the usual grading scale will be applied. Please note that a student's medical leave status will not appear on the student's transcript. Health Insurance Students who have purchased the insurance plan offered through UnitedHealthCare Student Resources for Tufts University and have met eligibility first will be able to continue on the plan while on medical leave for up to one year from the start of their medical leave. Please note that while on medical leave, a student will not be able to receive on -campus services, including Health Services and Counseling and Mental Health Services. Please check with the Health Insurance coordinator at Health Service or your private insurance carrier if you have questions regarding your student insurance coverage. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 81 Parental Accommodation and Leave Fletcher students are eligible for Parental Accommodation or Parental Leave following the birth, adoption, guardianship, or fostering of a child. Parental Accommodation is for semester -long relief from academic requirements, while maintaining active student enrollment. Parental Leave is for up to a year -long leave, during which the parent is not considered an active Fletcher student. Parental Accommodation Students in good standing may request one semester of parental accommodation. This policy makes it possible for a student to focus on the responsibilities of new parenthood while maintaining active registration status. Active status allows the student to keep benefits associated with this status that are also part of their degree program benefits, such as loan repayment schedules, housing eligibility, and health insurance. Eligibility To be eligibl e for a parental accommodation under this policy students must: Be in good standing at The Fletcher School and have completed at least one semester. Apply through the Office of Student Affairs (procedure below) and provide all required documentation at least two months before the expected accommodation is proposed to start. (Exceptions to the notice time frame are permitted in extenuating circumstances.) Take the Parental Accommodation within six weeks of the birth, adoption, or placement of the child. Take the accommodation during one full semester. (The accommodation period may not span multiple semesters.) Preparing for the Accommodation Period Students should provide the Office of Student Affairs a brief letter documenting the anticipated birth or placement at least two months in advance of the expected accommodation period. Examples of documentation that would satisfy this requirement include a letter from a doctor, social worker, or adoption agency, or a documentation from a court of law. Students should then meet with the Director of Student Affairs or applicable Program Director for GBA or GMAP students to discuss the upcoming accommodation. International students must consult with the International Center in advance of a Parental Accommodation for information regarding their compliance with applicable immigration laws. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 82 Students should consult with the Tufts Student Financial Services and Fletcher's Office of Admissions and Financial Aid r egarding their loan eligibility prior to the accommodation and should understand that if they do not return following the expiration of an accommodation period, that this may impact their loan repayment terms, including the expiration of any grace period associated with applicable loans. Students who require disability related accommodation s under the University's accommodations policies should contact StAAR. During the Accommodation Period A qualified and eligible student already enrolled may continue health insurance coverage during the parental accommodation period subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans in place. Students may opt to take courses during their accommodation period. Any requests for changes to coursework deadlines during this period must be arranged with individual faculty members and will be at the faculty's discretion. Students may continue to have access to on -campus facilities. Ph.D. students who receive stipends will be eligible to keep their stipends when using parental accommodation, but those stipends might not be extended or increased as a result. For students with questions about parental benefits for on campus jobs, please speak with Tufts Support Services. Parental Accommodation does not count toward your time to degree. Taking a Parental Accommodation does not affect a student's ability to later take a leave of absence. Retaliation and Discrimination Prohibited It is prohibited to retaliate or discriminate against any student for having exercised their rights under this policy. Parental Leave Alternatively, a student may wish to take a Parental Leave for up to one year. Parental Leave must be taken within one year of the child's birth or within one year of the child entering the home. Students who wish to take a Parental Leave must first speak with the Director of Studen t Affairs, or the applicable Program Director for GBA or GMAP students, and then complete the Leave of Absence Form with the Registrar's Office or the program office for online progra ms. To request access to University services while on leave, please contact the Director of Student Affairs. Students will be expected to return from leave by the date determined at the time their leave of absence is approved. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 83 Considerations for Parental Leave Tuition and Financial Aid Students who take a Parental Leave may be eligible for a refund of a percentage of tuition in accordance with the schedule for their degree program. Students with questions should contact the Bursar's Office in the Student Services Center in Dowling Hall. Students on financial aid should discus s the effect that taking a leave will have on their financial aid award or loans prior to going on Parental Leave. Students should contact Tufts Student Financial Services for questions about lo ans and Fletcher's Office of Admissions and Financial Aid f or questions about scholarships. Students on leave are eligible for neither loans nor loan deferral. International Students International students should contact the International Center to discuss any visa implications for a Parental Leave. Health Insurance The student health insurance provided by Tufts University is in effect for 12 months beginning in August.

Please note that while on Parental Leave, a student will not be able to receive on - campus services, including Health Services and Counseling and Mental Health Services. Please check with the Health Insurance coordinator at Health Service or your private insurance carrier if you have questions regarding your student insurance coverage. Academics A student taking a Parental Leave may choose to have all classes removed from their transcript for the semester in which they seek to take the leave.

Campus Access Students on a leave of absence continue to have access to Tufts systems that require a username and password such as Box, Canvas, Fletcher CORE, and Library systems. Per University policy, students on a leave of absence, however, are not enrolled and do not have access to services for enrolled students, including opportunities to work for Fletcher or Tuf ts departments, take or audit classes, access Ginn Library, access the Office of Career Services, or serve in leadership positions in student organizations. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 84 Lactation Rooms Tufts University is committed to supporting and meeting the needs of nursing indiv iduals returning to work, school, or visiting the campus. Any nursing individual who is a member of the Tufts community (faculty, staff, students, patients, visitors, third parties or community members) can use the lactation rooms. The Fletcher School has one lactation room, which is open during building hours. For access, please contact the front desk receptionist. For further information on lactation rooms, please see the University's Lactation Policy . Medical Emergencies and Hospitalizations The following steps will be taken to assess a student's readiness to return to Tufts after a hospitalization or a stay in a treatment facility, an intensive outpatient hospital , or a rehabilitation center. A student must be discharged to a parent, family member, sibling over 21, or a family friend chosen by the student's family. A student cannot be discharged di rectly to Tufts University. The post -hospitalization discharge summary from the admitting hospital must be provided to Counseling and Mental Health Services (CMHS) at Tufts University or Health Services (HS). The student will need to sign an Authorization to Release Medical Records in the Student Health Portal wit h their provider and with CMHS or HS should additional information be needed. It may be necessary for a Tufts University clinician to sp eak with the student's own health care provider(s). A meeting must be arranged with the Director of Student Affairs . The Director of Student Affairs will make arrangements for additional interviews as necessary including a Tufts University clinician or a clinical provider, etc. Following the meetings and the review of the clinical discharge summary, the Tufts University Clinical Team or the Clinical Director of Health Services will make a recommendation to the Director of Student Affairs as to whether the condition necessitating the hospitalization has been resolved sufficiently that it seems prudent for the student to return. The Director of Student Affairs will review the recommendation and will make a determination as to the student's readiness to re- engage in the rigors of university life. The outcome will be promptly communicated to the student in writing. Until this decision is communicated, the student may not be on campus, attend classes, or participate in any school -related activities. Student Safe ty Policies Weapons and Violence- free University Policy Statement s Weapons No individual other than a Tufts University police officer or other law enforcement official may manufacture, transfer, sell, possess, carry, store, use, or have in his or her custody and/or under his or her control, a firearm or other weapon defined withi n this policy anywhere on STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 85 any Tufts University campus, grounds, in any university facility, or at any university sponsored event. This prohibition exists whether or not a federal or state license to possess the weapon has been issued to the possessor. The full University Weapons Policy , including a list of prohibited weapons, is available on the Department of Public Safety website. Exceptions to this policy will be rare, and granted only unde r extraordinary or unusual circumstances. Exception requests must be made in writing to the Director of Public and Environmental Safety or his/her designee. University Police will confiscate weapons and violators may be subject to criminal prosecution an d/or referral for university disciplinary action, up to and including suspension, termination, or expulsion. Violence -Free University Policy Statement Tufts is committed to maintaining an environment in which individuals are safe to learn, work, and live. In support of this commitment, we affirm that Tufts will not tolerate violence or threats of violence anywhere on its campuses or in connection with university -sponsored programs. Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy Tufts students are responsible for conductin g themselves safely, responsibly, and legally regarding the use, possession, sale, or distribution of alcohol and other drugs. Tufts requires students to follow state and federal laws related to alcohol and drug use; failure to follow the law is a violatio n of this policy. See Section VIII: Appendix to learn more about the health impacts of alcohol and drugs and federal and state law regarding alcohol and drugs. This policy is designed to promote student safety and create useful social guidance for a campus environment where most students are under the legal age for alcohol and adult marijuana use, and where the use of marijuana remains prohibited under federal law. Alcohol Policy Students under the age of 21 are prohibited from possessing or consuming alcohol. Students are prohibited from using false identification or making false statements in order to obtain alcohol. All students are prohibited from engaging in dangerous, illegal, and inappropriate behaviors that result from the use of alcohol, including but not limited to driving while under the influence of alcohol; public intoxication; vandalism; behaviors that require an intervention by University officials or cause a disturbance; and behaviors that pose a risk to safety of self or others or endanger property. No student or student organization may provide alcohol to individuals under the legal drinking age. No student , regardless of age, may possess or carry open containers of alcohol in public or in open campus areas. Open areas of campus are any areas accessible to more than ten people or that a reasonable objective person would judge to be open spaces; open areas include residential hall lounges and hallways, outdoor space, classrooms, and other non - STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 86 residential campus buildings. Residence hall assigned suites or living rooms are private spaces for the students who live there and their invited guests, thus they are no t considered open campus areas. Drinking games or other activities involving rapid and/or excessive consumption of alcohol on campus or in University -approved housing are prohibited. Bulk alcohol dispensing sources (e.g., kegs, punch bowls, coolers, or ga rbage cans) are prohibited . Adult -Use and Medical Marijuana Adult -Use Marijuana Although the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has legalized adult use of marijuana by people at or over the age of 21 with certain restrictions, Tufts must follow federal law, w hich prohibits the possession and use of marijuana. In order to remain eligible for federal funding, including student financial aid, Tufts must comply with the Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act. Tufts prohibits the use, sale, growing, manufacturing, distribution, possession, or facilitation of the use of marijuana, products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the primary active ingredient of marijuana), and products that contain other substances designed to create a similar effect as marijuana or T HC upon the user. This prohibition applies on campus, in fraternities or sororities, and as part of any Tufts -sponsored activities off campus. Tufts prohibits the selling and distribution of marijuana, regardless of location or age. Tufts prohibits drivin g while under the influence of marijuana, regardless of location or age. Medical Marijuana Because the federal Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act applies to the use of medical marijuana, Tufts prohibits the use, possession, or distribution of marijuana , including for medicinal purposes, on campus, in all fraternities and sororities, and as part of any Tufts - sponsored activities. This prohibition applies even if the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) has issued a Medical Marijuana Registry i dentification card to an individual, authorizing that individual to possess and use marijuana for medicinal purposes. Students who obtain a registration card from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health may submit a letter to the Dean of Student Affa irs Office requesting to be released from their University housing and dining contract. In such situations, students will be released from their contracts with no financial penalty. Any payments made to the University for dining services or housing facilit ies will be returned to the student in proportion to the remainder of their time on a University meal plan or in University residence halls. Prohibited Substances Students and student organizations, regardless of age or location, are prohibited from possessing, using, selling, growing, manufacturing, and facilitating the use of illegal drugs, STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 87 controlled substances, and other illegal substances, as well as substances that are used to impair, even though they may not be illegal. Tufts prohibits the unlawful distribution, possession, social sharing, non -prescribed use, or abuse of prescription drugs. Altering, tampering, or forging a prescription is prohibited. Tufts prohibits driving while under the influence of prohibited substances, regardless of location or age. Tufts also prohibits the possession of drug parapherna lia. Amnesty Through Responsible Action As members of the Tufts community, students are expected to treat one another with respect and care. In a situation where students seek medical attention for an alcohol or drug- related medical emergency, Tufts will treat the intoxicated students' use of alcohol or prohibited substances as a health and safety matter, not as a disciplinary incident. This policy, which is intended to reduce barriers to getting help, extends not only to the student receiving medical attention, but also to the student(s) who call for help. Students are expected to actively seek help, stay with the intoxicated student until help arrives, cooperate with the emergency personnel and/or responding staff, and cooperate with any follow -up from th e Dean of Student Affairs Office. Students who report that they witnessed or are the victim of a crime or a significant violation of Tufts policy (e.g., sexual misconduct, hazing), even though they may have been under the influence of alcohol or prohibited substances at the time of the incident, will also be covered under Amnesty Through Responsible Action. Students who are alleged to have violated other Tufts policies are not entitled to amnesty for their non- alcohol or drug- related misconduct. When a student has violated the alcohol and other drugs policy but is excused from disciplinary action by the Amnesty Through Responsible Action provision, the student will be required to complete follow -up substance abuse screening, assessment, or treatment as appropriate and educational requirements. However, no disciplinary findings or records will be created and no disciplinary action will be taken. When a student organization has violated the alcohol and other drugs policy but is excused from disciplinary action by the Amnesty Through Responsible Action provision, the organization may be required to notify its advisor, provide a substance abuse screening or assessment or educational program for its members, and/or change its processes for hosting events. However, no disciplinary findings or records will be created and no disciplinary action will be taken. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 88 There are limitations to this policy and requests for amnesty are not guaranteed. Amnesty Through Responsible Action only applies to violations of policies relat ing to the use of alcohol and prohibited substances, and therefore does not preclude Tufts from taking disciplinary actions to address other serious or flagrant violations of Tufts policy including, but not limited to, violence, sexual assault, harassment, serious property damage, hazing, or the manufacture, sale, or distribution of prohibited substances. It also cannot preclude or prevent action by police or other legal authorities. Required Ac tion in Alcohol- or Other Drug -Related Medical Emergencies Memb ers of the Tufts community are responsible for summoning emergency medical services (by contacting 911, the Tufts University Police, or the appropriate official) to obtain assistance and evaluation for any person who is in their room or immediate presence and is, or is suspected to be, under the influence of alcohol or other prohibited substances, when that person's well -being and safety is known to be or reasonably should be known to be in jeopardy. When an individual knows, or reasonably should know, that another person is in jeopardy, failing to summon emergency medical services when it was reasonably safe to do so or actively preventing the aid of emergency medical services shall be considered a serious violation of this policy. Smoking Students are pro hibited from smoking any substance in all University indoor spaces, all University facilities, University residences, fraternities, or sororities, and all other areas designated as smoke- free. Smoking includes but is not limited to use of cigarettes, cigar s, pipes, e -cigarettes, and personal vaporizers or other devices associated with vaping. In addition, smoking is prohibited within 25 feet of any building. Disorderly Conduct Tufts prohibits disorderly conduct. Disorderly conduct is defined as any unrea sonable or reckless conduct by an individual or group that is inherently or potentially unsafe to other persons or property and/or conduct that interferes with the University 's normal business operations. Physical Abuse and Reckless Endangerment Physical abuse of others and physical abuse of oneself that negatively affects others are prohibited. Reckless endangerment of oneself or others is prohibited. Physical abuse is violence of any nature against any person; fighting; assault; battery; the use or brandishing of a knife, gun, or other weapon with the intent, effect, or reasonable possibility of injuring any person; restraining or transporting someone against their will; or any action that threatens or endangers the physical health or safety of any person or causes reasonable apprehension of such harm. Reckless endangerment is conduct that could reasonably and foreseeably result in physical injury even if no injury actually occurs.

Unauthorized Access Tufts students are expected to exercise respect for the property of others, including the University. Tufts prohibits students from unauthorized entry into or use of any buildings, roofs, property, or housing, including University property and private property belonging to others. Unauthorized access is being present in any area that is posted to prohibit unauthorized access, that is locked to prohibit unauthorized access, or that a reasonable individual knows or should know is considered a private and/or unauthorized area. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 90 Unauthorized entry includes breaking and entering or entering an access -restricted area by circumventing established security procedures (e.g., using another person's credentials, tailgating authorized individuals into a restricted area). Tufts prohibits unauthorized possession or duplication of means of access to any University building, including keys or ID cards. All University roofs are prohibited areas unless a person has obtained specific written authorization from the Facilities Services Department and follows the specifications of the Fall Prevention Program .

Community Health Preamble The COVID -19 pandemic has challenged us to reimagine every aspect of the Fletcher experience \u2014 academic, social, and personal. Taking steps to minimize the risk of COVID -19 infections, while preserving our sense of community and connection at Fletcher, is a shared responsibility: our community is only as strong as its most vulnerable member, and we commit to keeping ourselves and others safe. As members of our community, we (students, faculty, and staff) commit to the proactive behaviors described in this guide to protect ourselves and one another, as well as the broader Tufts and local communities. Students living off campus have a heightened responsibility to STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 91 adhere to current health guidelines, in order to protect the campus community and to protect those individuals and families living in their neighborhoods. Behaviors that violate these expectations jeopardize health and safety, increase the likelihood of a viral outbreak on our campus and in the local community, and may result in actual harm to one or more community members. We therefore encourage a commitment to shared accountability - reminding others who might forget or ignore safe practices and doing so with compassion and understanding. Our mission at The Fletcher School is to educate professionals committed to maintaining the stability and prosperity of a complex, challenging, and increasingly global society; and to pursue just and mutually beneficial solutions to some of the world's most intractable challenges. At this crucial moment, let us recommit to this mission as we confront one of the most significant public health crises of our lifetimes. It is up to each of us to do our part in meeting this challenge.

Complainants/victims/ survivors can use any or all of these options simultaneously to address sexual misconduct. The University affirms the right of complainants/victims/survivors to decide whether they wish to be involved in any process to address sexual misconduct - or not. However, should the conduct at issue pose a threat to campus safety (which includes but is not limited to th reats of further violence, the use of weapons and/or repeat offenders), the University must take action regardless of whether the complainant/victim/survivor wishes to proceed with their individual employee or student complaint. More information about Reporting Options can be found in the full text of the Sexual Misconduct Policy https://oeo.tufts.edu/policies -procedures/sexual -misconduct/ or at https://oeo.tufts.edu/reporting/sexual -misconduct/ The University will provide interim measures in response to sexual misconduct in order to stop prohibited conduct, prevent the recurrence of any conduct of concern, prevent and/or eliminate any hostile environment, and, where appropriate, address any effects on campus from such prohibited conduct. Interim measures and other support options are available regardless of whether disciplinary or criminal claims are pursued. In some instances, interim measures may lead to a person 's immediate removal from campus. Various available and appropriate interim measures and support options include, but are not limited to: health and counseling services, stay away orders, no -contact orders, no trespass orders, schedule and housing changes, academic supports or adjustments, and information about financial aid and visa/immigration related issues.

Prohibition Against Retaliation Retaliation against anyone who makes a good -faith report or complaint of an incident of sexual misconduct, or in any way participates in an inquiry or investigation of sex ual misconduct under this policy is strictly prohibited. The prohibition against retaliation applies to a reasonable objection to conduct an individual believes, in good faith, to be a violation of law or policy. A person engaged in retaliatory conduct wil l be subject to disciplinary action by the University. Depending on the nature of the retaliation found, discipline may include STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 96 denial of privileges, disciplinary probation, suspension and expulsion, for students, and may include warnings (verbal or writte n), demotions, suspensions, and termination for employees. The University will also provide interim measures in response to retaliation -related concerns in order to stop prohibited conduct, prevent its recurrence, prevent and/or eliminate any hostile envir onment, and, where appropriate, address any effects on campus from such conduct. In some instances, these measures may lead to an accused person 's immediate removal from campus or other various available and appropriate interim measures.

To advance that mission, it is essential that those in positions of authority do not abuse or appear to abuse the power with which they are entrusted. Faculty members, academic administrators, and other staff members exercise power over students in many ways: through their teaching, grading, evaluating, mentoring, coaching, advising and recommending of students for further studies or future employment opportunities. Accordi ngly, no employee of the university shall enter into a romantic or sexual relationship with any undergraduate or with a graduate, professional or non -matriculated student over whom that employee has academic or professional responsibility. Given the power asymmetry of the parties, the university regards such relationships as inherently coercive, constituting a conflict of interest and an abuse of authority under this policy. This policy applies even when the relationship is considered consensual by the parties involved and may, notwithstanding the consensual nature of the relationship, also result in violations under the sexual harassment and sexual misconduct policies. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 99 To learn more about the Relationships with Students Policy and about reporting procedure s, visit: https://oeo.tufts.edu/policies -procedures/other/ . Harassment Under Massachusetts law, stalking and cyber -stalking are prohibited felonious acts. Stalking includes a willful, malic ious, and knowing pattern of conduct or acts over a period of time directed at a specific person that seriously alarms or annoys the person and that causes a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress and makes a threat with the intent to place the person in imminent fear of death or bodily injury. Stalking can be accomplished by mail, telephone, electronic mail, Internet communications, and facsimile. Conduct that does not include a threat of death or bodily injury is also illegal and consi dered criminal harassment. The Tufts University Sexual Misconduct Policy has a higher standard which governs our community related to physical stalking and cyberstalking. The Office of Equal Opportunity's Sexual Misconduct policy defines stalking as persistent, unwanted or unwelcome and repeated course of conduct that would cause a reasonable person to become fearful for the person's safety or the safety of another, or suffer substantial emotional distress. There does not need to be a threat or intent to harm another person according to the definition of stalking as defined in the Sexual Misconduct policy. For more information about this and for examples of stalking conduct, please see Section E of the sexual misconduct policy, which is available online . Tufts University Police, the Office of Equal Opportunity, and the Director of Fletcher's Office of Student Affairs can explain the options for pursuing court proceedings or internal disciplinary action for stalking and other forms of sexual misconduct. Hazing Tufts prohibits hazing. Hazing is any activity that humiliates, degrades, or endangers the mental or physical health of someone because that person is joining or con tinuing membership in a group, team, or organization. Hazing is prohibited regardless of the person's willingness to participate in the activity. Hazing includes all behaviors that violate Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 269, Sections 17-19 (reproduced in their entirety below). Endangering mental health is defined as sleep deprivation, extended isolation, public degradation, intimidation, creation of artificial and excessive stress, public nudity, and other comparable behaviors that are reasonably likely to or do cause a significant STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 100 degree of distress, humiliation, anguish, or interference with academic, professional, or personal pursuits. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of hazing are not neutral acts and constitute hazing as prohibited by this policy. Students and other members of the University community are required to report incidents of hazing that they witness or for which they were present. Incidents of hazing shall be reported to Tufts University Police and the Dean of Student Affairs Office. Failure to report incidents of hazing is a violation of this policy and, in some cases, is a violation of Massachusetts law (M.G.L. c. 269 Section 18). Any retaliation or threats to retaliate against any person who reports, is a witness to, is involved with, or cooperates with the investigation of hazing is strictly prohibited. All groups, teams, and organizations are required to provide annual notice to all members about the University 's hazing policy and state hazing law, and to certify that they have done so to the Office of Student Affairs. Research on hazing suggests the behavior exists on a spectrum ranging from intimidation to harassment to violent hazing. Prohibited forms of hazing include but are not limited to: 1. Intimidation Hazing : Beh aviors that emphasize a power imbalance between new members and other members of the group or community. This is termed \"intimidation hazing\" because these types of hazing are often taken for granted or accepted as \"harmless\" or meaningless. Intimidation hazing typically involves activities or attitudes that breach reasonable standards of mutual respect and place new members on the receiving end of ridicule, embarrassment, and/or humiliation tactics. Members often feel the need to endure intimidation hazing to feel like part of the group or community. Examples of intimidation hazing include but are not limited to: Deception Silence periods Deprivation of privileges Social isolation Name calling Assignment of duties not assigned to other members 2. Harassment Hazing: Behaviors that cause emotional anguish or physical discomfort in order to feel like part of the group. Harassment hazing often confuses, frustrates, and causes undue stress. Examples of harassment hazing include but are not limited to: STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 101 Verbal abus e Threats or implied threats Sexual simulations Requiring situationally inappropriate attire Sleep deprivation 3. Violent Hazing: Behaviors that do or could cause physical or psychological harm. Examples of violent hazing include but are not limited to: Placing students in the shower against their will Forced or coerced alcohol or other drug consumption Forced or coerced sexual acts Beating Paddling, or other forms of assault Forced or coerced ingestion of vile substances Bondage Kidnapping Expected parti cipation in illegal activity. The sanction of disciplinary suspension or disciplinary expulsion will be strongly considered for students and student organization found responsible for harassment and violent hazing and for situations where respondents use deception or collude with others to obstruct a hazing investigation. Massachusetts General Law 269 Section 17 Whoever is a principal organizer or participant in the crime of hazing, as defined herein, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment in a house of correction for not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment. The term \"hazing\" as used in this section and in sections eighteen and nineteen, shall mean any conduct or method of initiation int o any student organization, whether on public or private property, which willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person. Such conduct shall include whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics, exposure t o the weather, forced consumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug or other substance, or any other brutal treatment or forced physical activity which is likely to adversely affect the physical health or safety of any such student or other person, or wh ich subjects such student or other person to extreme mental stress, including extended deprivation of sleep or rest or extended isolation. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 102 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the contrary, consent shall not be available as a defense to any prosecution under this action. Section 18 Whoever knows that another person is the victim of hazing as defined in section seventeen and is at the scene of such crime shall, to the extent that such person can do so without danger or peril to himself or others, report such crime to an appropriate law enforcement official as soon as reasonably practicable. Whoever fails to report such crime shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars. Section 19 Each institution of secondary education and each public and private institution of post secondary education shall issue to every student group, student team or student organization which is part of such institution or is recognized by the institution or permitted by the institution to use its n ame or facilities or is known by the institution to exist as an unaffiliated student group, student team or student organization, a copy of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen; provided, however, that an institution's compliance with this sect ion's requirements that an institution issue copies of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen to unaffiliated student groups, teams or organizations shall not constitute evidence of the institution's recognition or endorsement of said unaffiliated student groups, teams or organizations. Each such group, team or organization shall distribute a copy of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen to each of its members, plebes, pledges or applicants for membership. It shall be the duty of each s uch group, team or organization, acting through its designated officer, to deliver annually, to the institution an attested acknowledgement stating that such group, team or organization has received a copy of this section and said sections seventeen and ei ghteen, that each of its members, plebes, pledges, or applicants has received a copy of sections seventeen and eighteen, and that such group, team or organization understands and agrees to comply with the provisions of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen. Each institution of secondary education and each public or private institution of post secondary education shall, at least annually, before or at the start of enrollment, deliver to each person who enrolls as a full time student in such instit ution a copy of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen. Each institution of secondary education and each public or private institution of post secondary education shall file, at least annually, a report with the board of higher education and in t he case of secondary institutions, the board of education, certifying STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 103 that such institution has complied with its responsibility to inform student groups, teams or organizations and to notify each full time student enrolled by it of the provisions of this section and sections seventeen and eighteen and also certifying that said institution has adopted a disciplinary policy with regard to the organizers and participants of hazing, and that such policy has been set forth with appropriate emphasis in the student handbook or similar means of communicating the institution's policies to its students. The board of higher education and, in the case of secondary institutions, the board of education shall promulgate regulations governing the content and frequency of s uch reports, and shall forthwith report to the attorney general any such institution which fails to make such report. Retaliation Retaliation by individual students, groups of students, or stude nt organizations is prohibited. Retaliation is a serious adver se action taken against an individual for reporting behavior that may be prohibited by law or policy or participating in an investigation or resolution process related to an allegation of misconduct. Retaliation is sufficiently severe or pervasive to creat e a work or academic environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive and that adversely affects the victim 's educational, work, or living environment. Working with One Another Policy Tufts University reaffirms its commitment to the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment in education and employment regardless of a person 's race; color; religion; sex; sexual orientation; gender; gender transgender identity ; age; genetics; disability; veteran status; ethnicity or national origin. In accepting either a faculty or staff position at Tufts, an individual agrees to share this commitment in the performance of his or her assigned responsibilities and in interaction with faculty and staff colleagues, students and community members. Similarly, students, by way of admittance into the Tufts community, also agree to share this commitment in their educational programs with other students, faculty, staff members and commun ity members. Tufts University strives to provide all staff and faculty with a work environment that is free of harassment or other unreasonable interference with the performance of their University duties. Tufts also strives to provide students and commun ity members with an educational environment that is free of harassment or other unreasonable interference with the performance of their chosen academic responsibilities. We aspire to be a community in which mutual respect guides our day -to-day interactions . While the University respects an individual 's right to self -expression, it expects that the rights and concerns of others who work and study at Tufts are respected as well. At Tufts, there is no place in the work or educational environment for conduct th at demeans or belittles another person. For these reasons, harassment of any kind, including retaliation, is unacceptable. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 104 Student Grievance Procedure This procedure applies to grievances that are not covered by the sexual misconduct policy, the nondiscri mination policy, or the capricious grading policy. A student with a grievance should contact the individual faculty or administration member with whom they have a grievance, or they may contact a designated grievance procedure focal point: Katie Mulroy (D irector of Student Affairs), Laurie Hurley (Associate Dean of Admissions and Student Affairs), Andrew Marx (Registrar and Manager of Student Academic Programs) , or Adrian Thomas ( Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion) . If the grievance cannot be resolved, the student should next contact: The Executive Associate Dean (Maribel Blanco) for any non -academic grievance; The Academic Dean (Kelly Sims Gallagher) for any academic grievance; or Other individual designated by the foregoing. At this stage, a grievance must be submitted in written form. The Academic or Executive Associate Dean will acknowledge the grievance within five business days, and the student will be updated within 30 days regarding steps taken to resolve the complaint. If the respective Dean is unable to resolve the grievance, he or she will refer the problem to the appropriate standing faculty committee or to the Dean of The Fletcher School. If neither the standing faculty committee nor the Dean is able to resolve the grievance, t he Dean may appoint an ad hoc committee to review the grievance and report back with specific recommendations. In the course of resolving a complaint, the administration may need to consult with other members of the community, while striving to protect the student's privacy to the extent practicable. Note that it may be necessary to share the student's name with others in order to resolve the complaint. Community Living Policies Disruption of Community Well -Being Tufts expects that members of its community will not engage in behavior that compromises or has serious negative effects on their physical and mental health, safety, academic progress, or professional responsibilities, or that of others. In situations where a student's physical illness or emotional difficulties effect not only the student but others in the community, the University will consider the well- being of the community as well as the well -being of the student when making decisions. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 105 Disruption or Obstruction of a Community Activity Disrupting or obstructing normal University or University- sponsored or University -hosted activities, including, but not limited to: studying, teaching, research, University administration and operations; or disrupting fire, police, or emergency services is prohibited. Disruption or obstruction can include disrupting a lawful meeting; blocking access or egress to facilities; obstructing pedestrian or vehicle traffic; creating a hazardous situation; or engaging in behavior that a reasonable person would view as substantially or repeatedly interfering with the instructor's ability to teach the class or the ability of other students to benefit from the instruction. Gatherings, Protests, and Demonstrations Active citizenship, including exercising free speech and engaging in protests, gatherings, and demonstrations, is a vital part of the Tufts community. See Freedom of Expression policy in Appendix. Students engaging in protests, gatherings, or demonstrations are expected to conduct themselves responsibly and in accordance with Tufts ' standards of behavior. These standards include compliance with all University policies, adherence to all safety requirements (e.g., safe occupancy limit of a building, room, or facility), and following relevant laws. University poli cies which may be of particular relevance to students considering participating in protests, gatherings, or demonstrations include: Disruption or obstruction of community activity Unauthorized access Disorderly conduct Property damage and vandalism Room r eservation Students are encouraged to contact Fletcher's Office of Student Affairs with questions about how these policies apply to a particular activity they are planning. All events on campus \u2014including protests, gatherings, and demonstrations -- are sub ject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. For example, events that use amplified sound or cause loud noise are prohibited within hearing distance of residential facilities between midnight and 8 a.m. throughout the year and for longer times during Reading Days and fi nal exam s each term. Certain large campus events have additional restrictions to ensure safety for participants and others in the community. For any campus event with over 25 attendees, the following additional restrictions apply: 1. Open flames (e.g., torches, fire pits, etc.) are prohibited from all indoor and outdoor spaces, unless the student or student organization has approval from the Department of Public and Environmental Safety. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 106 2. Wearing masks, bandanas, or other material to cover a person 's face in order to conceal their identity are prohibited, with the following exceptions: o there is a declared public health emergency which requires the wearing of masks to prevent the spread of disease; o the stu dent or student organization has approval from the Department of Public and Environmental Safety ; o the item is allowed under the Office of Equal Opportunity 's Religious Accommodation Policy. 3. Possession of sticks, clubs, bats, and other objects that may be u sed as a weapon are prohibited, unless the student or student organization has approval from the Department of Public and Environmental Safety. Students who require a religious exemption to the any of these three restrictions should refer to the Religious Accommodation Policy . Tufts University Declaration on Freedom of Expression Policy Statement as Approved by the Tufts Board of Trustees, November 7, 2009 Tufts University is an educational community that has as its paramount mission the discovery and dis semination of knowledge and the pursuit of the arts through study, teaching, and research. For this community to achieve its mission, all members must have full and equal opportunity to pursue personal and intellectual growth. Freedom of expression and inq uiry are fundamental to the academic enterprise. Without freedom of expression, community members cannot fully share their knowledge or test ideas on the anvil of open debate and criticism. Without freedom of inquiry, community members cannot search for new knowledge or challenge conventional wisdom. Freedom of expression and inquiry are not absolute. The law, for example, provides that freedom of expression does not include the right to slander the reputation of another, to engage in specified forms of har assment, to threaten or obstruct a speaker who advances unwelcome ideas, or to incite another person to violence. Scholarly inquiry also is limited by federal and state regulation, ethical tenets, and professional standards designed to protect human and an imal subjects. In addition, the University seeks to ensure the orderly function of the educational enterprise and to ensure that all members of the community have the opportunity to participate in and benefit from the discovery and dissemination of knowled ge. Members of the Tufts community owe one another the basic respect and ethical obligations of human beings engaged in a common endeavor. While not enjoying the force of law, these obligations reflect three basic community values: 1. respect for the freedom of other community members to inquire and express themselves fully; 2. the need to exercise freedom of expression and inquiry in ways that respect the human dignity of others; and STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 107 3. the importance of a climate at Tufts that is conducive to learning and in which all community members, regardless of background, are free from behavior that interferes with their ability to study, grow, and attain their full potential. Members of the university community, including academic and administrative leaders, must hold ac countable those who do not respect these values. When community values are not respected, every member of the Tufts community has an obligation to respond. Those who are the target of such speech should not and must not bear the burden of responding alone. An affront against any member of our community is an affront to all of us. It is only by affirming our collective values that we can build a stronger, more cohesive, and more vibrant community where differences are respected and all are made to feel welco me. It is incumbent upon all members of the Tufts community, and especially the University leadership, to educate the community about the diverse world in which we live and to support and empower members whose rights are violated. In the end, freedom of ex pression and inquiry is necessary but not sufficient on its own for learning to take place. Achieving our educational mission requires an environment of respect, tolerance, and civil dialogue. For more on this policy and the Tufts Board of Trustees, see here. Off-Campus Disturbances Students are expected to be good neighbors when living off campus in our local communities. Behavior that causes a neighborhood disturbance or violates local ordinances is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to creating excessive sound and vibration, hosting a number of people in excess of the capacity of your building, improper care for pets that causes a disturbance, or failing to maintain your residence in a habitable condition. Such disturbances are prohibited by University policy and local laws. Property Damage and Vandalism Unauthorized conduct that is reasonably likely to or actually does cause damage, destruction, or vandalism of Tufts property or the property of another individual is prohibited. Unauthorized Recording Making or attempting to make audio, video, or photographic recordings of a person who has a reasonable expectation of privacy without (1) that person 's consent, or (2) authorizat ion under the Tufts video security policy is prohibited. Disseminating such recordings is also prohibited. People have an expectation of privacy in private areas such as locker rooms, residence hall rooms, and restrooms; and a person has an expectation of privacy if they ask not to be recorded even if they are in a public area. Tufts prohibits unauthorized recording of administrative or faculty meetings; to record a meeting, a student must obtain consent of all recorded parties. Malicious or negligent disclosure of private personal information also is prohibited. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 108 Tufts University Policy on Political Activities The University is committed to free and open discussion of ideas and opinions. As part of its dedication to active citizenship, Tufts encourages students, faculty, and staff to exercise their civic rights to participate as individuals in the political process. At the same time, no member of the University community should feel any institutional pressure to support a particular candidate or position. As a tax -exempt entity, Tufts is prohibited by federal law from participating in or attempting to influence campaigns for any elective public office or any political initiative (such as a public referendum). The University may not endorse a candidate o r ballot proposal, provide or solicit financial or other support for candi dates or political organizations, or establish political action committees. This policy is adopted by the University in an attempt to balance these competing considerations, based on advice of counsel and prevailing practices in the academic community. Should you have any questions relating to this policy, please contact the Senior Vice President for University Relations at 617- 627-4220 or the Office of Government & Community Relations at 617 -627-3583 or communityrelations@tufts.edu . This policy only provides basic information regarding political activities. It is strongly advised that you seek guidance before you sponsor a political event. For additional guidance on political activities, please see the American Council on Education (ACE) Memo on Political Campaign -Related Activities of and at Colleges and Universities . Student Publications Student publications may run editorials expressing the editors ' views on candidates for public office, pro vided that the publication 's editorial policy is free of editorial control by University administrators or faculty advisors. A statement on the editorial page must indicate that the views expressed are those of t he student editors and not those of the University. Individual Involvement in Political Campaigns Members of the University community who participate in political campaigns must do so in their individual capacity. No member of the community should feel pr essured to contribute money or time to any political campaign, and no University function or publication may support or endorse any political party or candidate (including members of the University community running for political office). At all events, in dividuals ' political activities must not create the appearance or fact of a University endorsement of a political party or candidate. STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 109 Use of Facilities and Resources Use of University facilities and resources in support of a political candidate, party, referendum, or political action committee (PAC) that could give the appearance that the University is supporting one candidate or position over another is prohibited. The following activities are specifically prohibited (note that this list is merely illustra tive): Using official University stationery, word mark, seal, email, telephones, computers, printers, and copiers. Providing mailing lists, office space, telephones, photocopying, computers or other institutional resources. Posting a hyperlink on a University -administered website to a candidate or campaign site. If the University believes that one or more postings on a University -administered website (i.e., a website with a tufts.edu extension) create the impression that the University has endorsed a particular candidate or a particular side of a public referendum, it may request, as a condition of hosting the site, that a disclaimer be posted on the site stating that the opinions expressed are attributed to the author and do not represent the views of the University. The following activities may be permitted: Subject to University policies on permission and scheduling, recognized student groups may use Uni versity facilities for partisan political purposes so long as they reimburse any costs the University may incur in providing such space, in accordance with the policies established by Office of Student Life. If an appearance by a declared candidate for public office or a group supporting a public referen dum is broadly publ icized to nonmembers of the Tufts community or is co-sponsored or paid for by outside organizations, the sponsors must rent the space from the University on the same terms that are available to any group wishing to use such space as established by the Tufts Conference and Event Services . If space is rented to a candidate in an election, any competing candidate would be able to rent space on the same terms. Candidates may be invited to appear on campus in a non -candidate capacity, e.g., to participate in a class, provided that no campaigning or fundraising is done at the event and a non -partisan atmosphere is maintained. Candidate forums or debates may be held on campus as part of the University 's educational mission, as long as all qualified candidates are invited to participate. Administration and faculty should take special care in relation to any above-described activities, to avoid the appearance of institutional endorsement. Any student, faculty or staff int erested in inviting an elected official or political candidate onto campus should notify the Office of Government & Communit y Relations at 617 -627- 3780 or communityrelations@tufts.edu . STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 110 Fundraising Funds or contributions for political candidates or campaigns may not, under any circumstances, be solicited in the name of Tufts University or on any University campus, and University resources may not be used in soliciting such funds. If Tufts students, f aculty, or staff make political contributions, they must do so as individuals. Voter Registration Voter registration and \" get out the vote \" drives by University -sponsored organizations must be done on a non -partisan basis (i.e., they may not focus on a pa rticular party). Gifts and Lobbying Federal and Massachusetts laws prohibit gifts and honoraria for public officials, including meals and tickets to sporting events. Any lobbying on behalf of the University must be approved by the Vice President for University Relations. Controversial Speakers and Programs Tufts is an open campus committed to the free exchange of ideas - even those that may be considered offensive to some members of the community. In general, some community members ' finding a speaker or program offensive will not be considered cause to prevent the program from running; the University will strive to uphold the right of campus organizations to host controversial programs and to hold them without interruption. It is incumbent on event organizers to consider during their planning whether the nature of an event suggests that disruption is likely, and, if so, should discuss the likelihood of disruption with the Executive Associate Dean. A decision about whether special security measures are necessary will be made by the Executive Associate Dean and the University 's Director of Public Safety. Other necessary arrangements, such as where the event should be held or how widely it should be advertised, will depend on the nature of the program and be determined in consultation with the Executive Associate Dean. Failure to Comply with a University Official Students are required to comply with the directives of University officials and emergency responders during the performance of their duties. Gaming and Gambling Tufts prohibits illegal gambling. Students are expected to follow Massachusetts laws, which prohibit some forms of gambling. Information about Massachusetts gambling laws can be found at https://www.mass.gov/info -details/massachusetts -law-about -gambling -and-casinos . STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 111 Public Nudity Students are generally prohibited from engaging in acts of public nudity and public urination. Public nudity is nakedness or exposure of one's intimate parts, such as genitalia, groin, breast and/or buttocks in an open area of campus or public area or exposure that is visible from an open area of campus or public area. Public nudity includes acts such as streaking, public urination, and nude sunbathing. Open areas of campus are any areas accessible to more than ten people or that a reasonable objective person would judge to be open spaces, such as residential hall lounges and hallways, outdoor space, classrooms, and other non- residential campus buildings. There are some circumstances in which exposure of one's intimate parts may be permissible and appropriate, such as nude modeling for a fine arts class, certain art or drama performances, or nursing mothers who are breastfeeding. Such activities do not constitute public nudity under this policy. For more information on the University's resources for nursing mothers, please review the University's Lactation Policy . Conversely, there are some circumstances in which exposing one's intimate parts may constitute more than mere public nudity and will, instead, become a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy . When the exposure is sexual in nature (i.e., flashing, masturbating) and/or is targeted at a specific individual or group of individuals without their consent, then the act of pu blic nudity will be considered Indecent Exposure, which is a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy. Indecent Exposure may, but does not necessarily have to, include a sexual act. Library and IT Policies The Edwin Ginn Library (Ginn) is one of s even libraries at Tufts. The libraries all work collaboratively to provide students with access to the print and digital resources. Our partnership with the other libraries enables us to provide even more access to databases, journals, books, and skill building opportunities. Our resources can be used in person at one of the Tufts libraries or from off campus. For information on Ginn and Tufts -wide library collections, policies, and services, visit http://ginnlibrary. tufts.edu/ .

For questions about the library or to schedule an appointment with a library staff member, visit our Ask a Librarian portal on the Ginn Library website. In addition to managing and sourcing library materials, Ginn Library is responsible for School -wide technology and audio -visual (A/V ) equipment and services. We collaborate with colleagues from Tufts Technology Services (TTS) to ensure the Fletcher community has tools STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 112 and access to technology systems. For more information about Tufts Technology Services, visit https://it.tufts.edu/ . Responsible Use of Information Technology As members of a University community, all Fletcher students are responsible for keeping their School -related Internet and IT activities consistent with applicable laws, academ ic standards, and Tufts ' policies on rights and responsibilities online. This responsibility covers any activity conducted using University IT services (including hardware, software, applications, networks, databases, websites, and social media), as well as any activity conducted under the auspices of or pursuant to one 's education. Tufts ' Information Stewardship Policy outlines policies that apply to all members of the Tufts community who use, create, and/or manage information at Tufts. Compliance with the policies is mandatory, and violations can result in severe consequences up to and including loss of network access and civil or criminal prosecution. In addition, students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with Tufts ' Overview of Your Rights and Responsibilities Online and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act & FAQ and to understand their legal and policy obligations on issues including copyright law; libel; invasion of privacy; obscenity, child pornography, and indecency; and hacking, cracking, and spamming. Students located in one of the countries that is a member of the European Economic Area should review the EEA Privacy Statement and EEA Privacy Statement for Students .

University Guidelines Concerning Religious Observances Tufts University is committed to providing an academic and work environment that is respectful of the religious beliefs of its students, employees, patient s, visitors and community members. As part of this commitment, Tufts will make good faith efforts to provide reasonable religious accommodations to those in our community whose sincerely held religious beliefs conflict with a university policy, procedure, or other academic or employment requirement unless such an accommodation would create an undue hardship or would fundamentally alter our work, program and/or mission. Religion or Creed Includes traditional, organized religions but also sincerely held religious beliefs, including those that are new, uncommon, not part of a formal church or sect. All aspects of religious belief and observance that are sincerely held will be considered as part of this policy. Undue Hardship Significant difficulty or expen se based on the university's resources and circumstances in relationship to the cost or difficulty of providing a specific accommodation. Undue hardship may refer to financial difficulty in providing an accommodation or accommodations that are unduly expen sive, substantial, disruptive, or that would fundamentally alter academic requirements, the nature or operation of the university's business, or the essential functions of a job. Accommodations which interfere with the safe and efficient operation of the workplace or campus or with a bona fide seniority system will often present an undue hardship. Religious Accommodation A reasonable change in the work or academic environment that enables a student or employee to practice or otherwise observe a sincerely held religious practice or belief without undue hardship or fundamentally altering the educational, workplace or mission of the university. A reasonable religious accommodation may include but is not limited to: time for prayer during a work day the ability to attend religious events or observe a religious holiday STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 126 or any necessary modification to university policy, procedure or other requirement for a student's or employee's (or prospective employee's) religious beliefs, observance or practice, provided such accommodation is reasonable and does not cause undue hardship or create a fundamental alteration of the educational, workplace or mission of the university. All students may request a religious accommodation by making a written request for an accommodation to the OEO, an OEO liaison, an appropriate faculty member or other relevant administrator such as an Academic Dean in accordance with their Code of Conduct or Student Handbook. Once the request comes to the Office of Equal Opportunity, emplo yees, students, patients, visitors, community members or third parties will be required to complete a formal accommodation request form and may be required to provide other documentation or information supporting the request. Employees and students who anticipate being absent from work or class because of a religious observance must submit their request for time off in advance and as soon as they become aware of the need or at least ten (10) business days in advance. Accommodation requests will be made on a case bycase basis taking into account factors including but not limited to, the fundamental requirements of the applicable academic program and/or related technical standards, essential functions of an individual 's job, the duties of others in the department or job group, the requirements of the department or major, any impact of the accommodation, the duration of the accommodation request, and the availability of alternative accommodations. The University will endeavor to protect the requesting student or employee's privacy in evaluating and implementing the accommodation requested to the extent possible. However, following receipt of the request, the university official or administrator, supervisor(s) or designee(s) will discuss the accommodation request as necessary with the student or employee, and with select others in order to further evaluate and/or implement the accommodation. Approvals will be provided in writing to the requesting student or employee whenever possible. Individuals with questions a bout this policy and/or its application may contact OEO here .

On October 7th, 2013, Tufts University President Anthony Monaco w rote to the university community about important, proactive efforts to ensure the continued safety and well -being of students, faculty, staff, and visitors. In his message, the President issued the following violence free university policy statement: STUDENT HANDBOOK Updated 8/25/2022 130 Tufts is committed to maintaining an environment in which individuals are safe to learn, work, and live.

In support of the President's policy statement, Tufts has established the Tufts Threat Assessment and Management (TTAM) program t o identify, evaluate and address potentially threatening situations affecting members of the Tufts community. Recognizing and reporting early signs of a potentially dangerous situation are crucial to preventing violence and enhance the university's ability to provide assistance to communi ty members who may be in distress.
