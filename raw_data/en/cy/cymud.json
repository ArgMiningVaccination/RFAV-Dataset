(Head Office: Osaka, Japan; President and CEO: Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D. ; hereafter \"Shionogi\") are pleased to announce the conclusion of a contract for the establishment of a research department with Chiba University Hospital (1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, Hospital Director: of mucosal immunoinducible vaccines; hereafter \"Mucosal vaccines\". Based on this agreement, Shionogi and Chiba University Hospital will establish the Human Mucosal Vaccine Department, a joint research department at Chiba University Hospital to promote the research and development of mucosal vaccines. For respiratory infections such as COVID-19 and influenza, it is necessary not only to ameliorate the onset and exacerbation of the infection, but also to prevent the initialinfection itself. In this department, we will focus on the research and development of mucosal vaccines that can efficiently induce mucosal immunity in the nasal cavity and throat, which play an important role in preventing pathogen infection. Vaccines are generally administered by injection, but it is believed that a nasally administered vaccine may more efficiently induce mucosal immunity, which plays an important role in protection from infection. On the other hand, there are remaining challenges in the pursuit of nasal vaccines, such as correlation between the intranasal dose and the amount absorbed into the body and the effect of the specific method of nasal administration on the induction efficiency of mucosal immunity. A collaborative approach, bridging non-clinical and clinical research and combining industry and academic expertise, will be vital to overcome these challenges. The Corona Vaccine Center at Chiba University Hospital has clinical research capabilities, and Shionogi has strengths in research and development and formulation technology in the field of infectious diseases. Through cooperation between the two organizations, we seek to successfully realize the creation of effective nasal vaccines. Through the establishment of this joint research department, Chiba University Hospital and Shionogi will work together to deepen the understanding of the immune induction mechanism by vaccines, advance clinical study, and develop trained human resources, thereby forming a world-class research and development base for mucosal vaccines. We will contribute to global health by creating and providing mucosal vaccines that are effective in preventing infection. About Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Shionogi is committed to \"protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases\" as our key focus. We are not limiting ourselves to the research and development of therapeutics, but are also pursuing total care for infectious diseases, through pre-symptomatic, awareness building, prevention, diagnosis, and addressing exacerbations, as well as the treating the infection itself. As a leading company to fight infectious diseases, in order to contribute to the recovery of social security and safety through the early termination of COVID 19, we are working on the development of new therapeutic drugs and vaccines and maximizing the value of existing compounds. In addition, we will strengthen our efforts, including collaboration with external partners, to provide healthcare solutions to a larger number of patients. About Chiba University Hospital Chiba University Hospital provides high-quality, advanced medical care to patients based on the following philosophy. \" We are devoted to providing advanced medical treatment and safeguarding the dignity of our patients, while spearheading efforts to develop clinical medicine and foster next-generation medical professionals.\" In March 2021, the Corona Vaccine Center started operation, working to promote COVID-19 vaccination, collaborating with the Institute of Medical Research, researching the efficacy and safety of vaccines, providing highly advanced medical care and contribute to community medical care.
