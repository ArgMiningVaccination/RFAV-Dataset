Mechanisms linking these processes are crucial to normal development, yet remain poorly understood. I worked on one such mechanism regulating the patterning of mesoderm germ layer along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis in mouse embryos. In vertebrates, compartmentalization of mesoderm is morphologically apparent along the AP axis. The posterior mesoderm (below neck) forms segmented structures called somites, while anterior mesoderm remains unsegmented. Anterior mesoderm has recently gained significant attention as it includes a bipotent subset, the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm, which contributes to vertebrate-specific novelties - craniofacial skeletal muscles and chambered heart. Remarkably, a discrete developmental pathway governing anterior mesoderm-derived skeletal muscle formation has further triggered interest in understanding the developmental trajectory of this mesoderm subtype compared to posterior mesoderm. Towards this, my doctoral research has unraveled a novel network of T-box transcription factors; T (Brachyury), Tbx6 and Eomes, that governs the earliest step in mesoderm fate commitment i.e., bifurcation of na\u00c3\u00c2\u00afve mesoderm into anterior and posterior mesoderm lineages. Using mouse genetics, I have shown that differential requirement of T-box factors delineates the specification of anterior mesoderm from that of the posterior. T and Tbx6, critical factors for posterior mesoderm formation, are dispensable for anterior mesoderm development. On the contrary, Eomes drives anterior mesoderm specification. In fact, Eomes and T are convergent upon a molecular module that is known as a decisive step for anterior versus posterior mesoderm fate choice. Using an in vitro directed differentiation assay in combination with T-box gene knock-out mouse embryonic stem cells, I found that Eomes and T- driven genetic programs may regulate the mechanism governing the divergence of anterior and posterior mesoderm lineages. Taken together, the study suggests that Eomes and T / Tbx6 counteract to pattern mesoderm into anterior and posterior subtypes. These T-box factors are known to specify mesoderm fate, and our work points to a novel role for them in the early patterning of mesoderm along AP axis. Thus, our work provides a handle to investigate the mechanistic link between cell fate specification and early patterning processes in vertebrate mesoderm. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Archives at the National Centre for Biological Sciences Public Lecture Series https://www.ncbs.res.in/events/apls 34th edition Monthly talks framed around explorations in and around archives.

Register: https://bit.ly/apls-internet Live Stream: https://youtube.com/BLiSCIndia Abstract: For as long as the Internet has been around for public use, there has been an unmet desire for equitable access. And throughout this time, there has been little talk in India about the infrastructure that makes this interconnected network, this Internet. This is the world of servers, switching and cable networks, transmission towers, protocols, regulatory authorities, and service providers. It is the world behind every WhatsApp forward, online classroom, remote conference, multi-player online game, and Internet shutdown. This is a discussion on the history, politics and legal handshakes of the backbone of the Internet \u00e2\u20ac\" its wiring, so to speak \u00e2\u20ac\" and on how much we might take it for granted without fully understanding its regulation and access. This reliance on \u00e2\u20ac\" and fragility of \u00e2\u20ac\" this thing called the Internet have both come to the fore in the age of the 21st century pandemic. Ashwin Mathew will discuss the social, institutional, and technological points of control in global Internet infrastructure, and how these are articulated in the Indian context. Apar Gupta will talk about contemporary governance and disputes that have led to the control and regulation of the Internet in India.

Pathologically, these diseases are characterized by misfolding and accumulation of proteins and associated damages in various brain cell types. Among PMDs, PrD exhibits an intriguing infectious nature. The unorthodox transmissible agent is solely composed aggregated prion protein. The mechanism of prion infectivity depends on the capability of the aggregated prion protein to act as a seed to recruit and induce the misfolding and polymerization of the normal prion protein, generating more seeds. This seeding-nucleation process of prion replication has a striking resemblance to the mechanism of protein misfolding and aggregation in all NDs, suggesting that misfolded aggregates may have an inherent capacity to follow prion principle. Using in vitro systems, mouse and human brain organoids as models, we sought to understand the role of prion principle in the pathology of NDs. We show that prion principle plays crucial role in the spontaneous generation as well as the progress of protein aggregation pathology associated with NDs and may in turn explain the role of risk factors in these diseases. Consequently, these diseases share overlapping pathological mechanism, that led us to develop a common therapeutic strategy, applicable to multiple NDs associated with protein misfolding. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| During vertebrate embryogenesis distinct developmental programs coordinate the patterning of tissues along the antero-posterior (AP) body axis. The discrete signaling hub called the organizer is central to coordinating the pathways in space and time. The organizer of the trunk region, referred to as the node, orchestrates the generation of left-right (LR) asymmetry as well as the elongation of the body along AP axis. Coordination of these two processes is important to generate the normal body plan. The cells associated with the node act as bipotent axial progenitors, which contribute to the axial elongation of both the spinal cord, a neural tissue, as well as mesoderm that generates musculoskeletal tissues. In a parallel pathway, the node establishes LR asymmetry by triggering the Nodal signaling pathway on the left. Direct role of the node indicate its function in coordinating both these processes. Individually, the gene regulatory network governing these events is well documented. However, little is known about the genetic program that couples them mechanistically. Our rational is that addressing the function of regulatory genes common to both these programs would reveal the mechanism coupling them. In my thesis project, I have investigated the role of Tbx6, a mesoderm T-box factor, in regulating axial elongation and establishment of left-right asymmetry at the node. Using mouse genetics, I show that Tbx6 is expressed in axial progenitors, thereby providing a key evidence to the current model that Tbx6 acts as a mesoderm fate switch in the bipotent progenitors. On the other hand, using guided differentiation of embryonic stem cells and ChIP-sequencing, I find that Tbx6 is a global regulator of several pathways, including Nodal signaling cascade, which are central to establish the LR asymmetry pathway. I have initiated studies with Tbx6 mouse mutants, which indicate that Tbx6 functions at multiple steps in the mechanism generating LR asymmetry. In summary, my work elucidates the function of Tbx6 in cells at the node and the results provide a framework to investigate the mechanism coupling axial elongation and left-right patterning. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Genetically hard-wired innate behaviors are considered to be robust and stereotyped. However, these behaviors also need to be adaptable in response to changes in the internal and external environment of an animal. While the role of synaptic plasticity in the modulation of behavior has been extensively studied, how modifications in the intrinsic properties of a neuron regulate behavior is less understood. Taking advantage of the stereotypical behavioural responses and well-characterised underlying circuitry of innate locomotor behaviours in larval zebrafish, I have examined how neuronal intrinsic properties contribute to the regulation of behaviour. First, my work explores the role of neuromodulatory inputs in the regulation of slow optomotor response (OMR). OMR is a reflexive behavior evoked in response to the whole-field visual motion. Here, I show that dopamine, acting via the D1-like-R pathway, increases swim speeds during OMR. D1-like-R activation increases and excitatory synaptic drive to \"slow\" and \"fast\" motoneurons. These changes result in enhanced activity of \"slow\" motoneurons that are usually active during OMR as well as novel recruitment of \"fast\" motoneurons. These findings show that tremendous flexibility in locomotor speed can be achieved by modulation of intrinsic properties even at the last relay station of the nervous system. Next, I examined the genetic regulation of fast, escape behavior. Mutations in AUTS2, a key regulator of neurodevelopmental genes, result in several nervous system disorders. However, the precise function of the gene is unknown. Here, I investigated the role of auts2a, the zebrafish homolog of AUTS2, in neural circuit structure and function using escape response as the read-out. Zebrafish larvae display escape response on perceiving a threat. auts2a mutants displayed delayed and high trial-to-trial variability in the onset of otherwise robust escape responses. These defects resulted from a decrease in the excitability of Mauther neurons that trigger this behavior. These results indicate a previously uncharacterized role of auts2a in the regulation of intrinsic excitability. Connecting behavioural and cellular changes in the context of two different motor behaviours, this work shows that genetic and non-genetic modifications of intrinsic excitability have profound effects on both flexibility and robustness of behaviour. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The plasma membrane (PM) is a lipid-protein composite that acts as a physical barrier as well as a facilitator of communication between the cell and its surroundings. Diversity of functions performed at this organelle is not only crucial to the integrity of the cell itself, but also in establishing a unique functional identity in its niche. This is achieved by processes such as signaling, adhesion to surrounding matrix or cells, migration etc., all of which are functions involving structural and compositional changes occurring at the cell membrane. The rich diversity of cell membrane constituents can be utilized to locally tune physico-chemical properties across relevant spatial and temporal scales to execute the functions described above. However, the means by which such active control of compositional fluctuations is achieved or the spatial scales across which it propagates, is not yet fully understood. In this thesis, I have attempted to understand the active control of lateral organization of molecules at the cell membrane. To this effect, I have discovered distinct roles for two different non-muscle myosins in the regulation of organization of two classes of membrane molecules. The PM-associated Myosin I appeared to selectively regulate the nano-scale organization of the lipidated outer-leaflet resident GPI anchored proteins (GPI-APs). On the other Myosin II (NMII), to nano-scale clustering of a transmembrane protein actin binding domain of the cytoskeletal adaptor Ezrin (TmABD), which, thus, constitutively associates with actin. I further explored the consequences of such an acto-myosin based control of the nano-scale organization in the case of an endogenous cell adhesion protein, CD44. Being a palmitoylated protein that couples to the actin cytoskeleton via Ezrin, CD44 shares attributes of both GPI-APs and TmABDs and is expected to form nano-scale clusters1. Finally, since CD44 is also a molecule that has been shown to play a role in cells by acting as diffusion barriers, restricting motions of other signaling proteins to facilitate their function2, I explored it\u00e2\u20acs organization at multiple spatial scales to establish a connection between active organization and function3. Taken together, this thesis is an endeavor to initiate further exploration of active regulation of membrane organization and its manifestation across multiple spatial scales. References: 1.

However, whether the manipulations are limited to the pathogen containing vacuole or impact the cellular processes globally is not clear. In this study using in vitro and in vivo Mtb infections, the global effect of Mtb infection on the host endo-lysosomal system was systematically examined. The results revealed two novel facets of the Mtb-macrophage interaction vis-\u00c3 -vis the host endo-lysosomal system. First, our results show substantial heterogeneity in the endo-lysosomal system in macrophages. Interestingly, cells with higher endocytic capacity preferentially undergo phagocytosis, including infection with Mtb. In addition, macrophages with higher endocytic capacity have higher lysosomal content, that further influences the subcellular trafficking of Mtb. Thus, the heterogeneity of endocytic capacity of macrophages is a fundamental driver of Mtb uptake and subcellular trafficking. Second, in infected cells, Mtb surface components, notably the cell wall lipid Sulfolipid-1 (SL-1), promotes lysosomal biogenesis by acting on the mTORC1-TFEB Macrophages infected with the SL-1 deficient pks2 mutant Mtb show partial rescue in mTORC1-TFEB signaling and consequently attenuated lysosomal rewiring compared to Mtb biogenesis in macrophages enhances phagocytic cargo, including Mtb. Correspondingly, pks2 mutant Mtb shows a further reduction in lysosomal delivery compared to the wild type. Reduced trafficking of the mutant Mtb to lysosomes correlates with enhanced intracellular survival of the mutant, showing a protective role of lysosomes against Mtb infection. Collectively, our results reveal a distinct endo-lysosomal state in Mtb infected macrophages mediated by the host endocytic heterogeneity and Mtb SL-1, which together determine the bacterial uptake and intracellular trafficking, and contribute to the containment of the pathogen. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Genetic variation at the 8q24 locus is linked with the greater susceptibility to prostate cancer in men of African ancestry. One such African ancestry specific rare variant, rs72725854 (A>G/T) (~6% allele frequency) has been associated with a ~2-fold increase in prostate cancer risk. However, the functional relevance of this variant is unknown. In this thesis, we uncover the role of this SNP in resulting in the susceptibility to Prostate cancer. We find that the variant rs72725854 is present in a prostate cancer-specific enhancer at 8q24 locus. Chromatin-conformation capture and dCas9 mediated enhancer blocking establish a direct regulatory link between this enhancer and lncRNAs PCAT1, PRNCR1 and PVT1. The risk allele (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbT\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2) of SNP is associated with higher expression of PCAT1, PVT1 and c-myc in prostate cancer patients. Further, enhancer with the risk allele gains response to androgen stimulation by recruiting the transcription factor, SPDEF whereas, non-risk alleles remain non-responsive. Elevated expression of these lncRNAs and c-myc in risk allele carriers may explain their greater susceptibility to prostate cancer. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The repair of damaged or infected skin is a complex physiological process, which is essential to restore its protective barrier function. However, the mechanisms by which epidermal skin cells sense tissue injury and respond to the infectious agents remain poorly understood. My thesis primarily focuses on two questions (1) How do skin keratinocytes regulate the secretion of Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) and (2) How does the convergence of mechanical cues and epigenetic player lead to the cellular sensing of injury. Our epidermal skin cells (keratinocytes) harbour a large and diverse pool of AMPs, which are known as an innate immune defence against a spectrum of pathogens. The prophylactic and therapeutic use of these endogenous peptides is dependent on our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing their unconventional secretion from cells. To understand the regulatory mechanism of AMP secretion, I have chosen the S100A7 (Psoriasin) peptide as a probe. Our work has revealed an unexpected biphasic secretion of S100A7 in response to bacterial exposure. The initial acute phase secretion of S100A7 is mediated through toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling, whereas the chronic response is mediated by Caspase-8 downregulation. Our observations have defined a novel non-canonical role of Caspase-8 in regulating AMP secretion. In the second part of my thesis, I have described how wound-induced changes in mechanical properties of the highly tensile skin epidermis can initiate the cell state transition from homeostasis to repair. Our observations suggests that the changes in the expression of some of the key wound-response genes, including caspase-8, are sensitive to mechanical perturbations. To understand the mechanism of gene regulations and cellular reprogramming, I have probed caspase-8 expression levels as one of the biomarkers of wound-sensing. That led us to discover how DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3a) can be an active epigenetic player, responding to the changes in the mechanical signals, by translocating from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. I have described how DNMT3a increases its occupancy at the caspase-8 promoter post wound and regulates its gene expression through promoter methylation. Overall, these findings illuminate the convergence of mechanical and epigenetic signalling in a physiological process wherein their timely coordination is critical for efficient tissue repair. 10:00
