For A While!](https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/go-carnivore-for-a-while/id797681537?i=1000626619465) Go Carnivore... For A While! Hopefully you've heard by now of the Carnivore Diet! It is very easy to understand; this is part of its charm. You can't go wrong- you only eat meat. For some, like Jordan Peterson and his daugter, you only eat beef, and salt. (If they don't, they suffer debilitating autoimmune conditions, and massive depression). And so, they follow this diet of necessity. It is kind of, in my mind, an extreme paleo diet. Kind of an ice age diet, as if you were living during the last ice age, and only animals were available to eat and so survive. NO plants, or mushrooms... NOTHING. And so, why should you, a fully modern human, with grocery stores and endless foodstuffs available, follow such a restrictive diet?? Well, if you have just about any health condition,, like diabetes, or psoriasis, or obesity- you are SURE to improve! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tAZ238_g4Q Link to Dr. David Unwin on low carb versus diabetes And, just to point out- a Carnivore Diet is a NO CARB diet, by definition!! Not just low, but NO. And so, my little paleo friends: Go Carnivore! (Or at least 'Carnivor-ish), like me! I also include cheese, kefir, cream, butter and full fat yogurt, along with copious amounts of eggs and some cruciferous veggies and low carb fruits. But that is the end result. For now, paleo pilgrim: if you are fat, sick and diabetic to any extent? Go Full Carnivore! It's not even difficult, not really. You will never, ever be hungry, and you will feel satisfied and energized, eating only beef. The only thing hard to deal with is social pressure, but what is that when set against you very health and survival, long term?? I guarantee that all your conditions and the state of your health will improve. Vastly in pretty much every case! Stick with it, until you are feeling and looking amazing! (I'm not kidding, results are that immediate, and inavoidable). Now, you can, one at a time, add in things: try chicken and fish. Still fine? Try eggs, then dairy. Still doing great? Try a bit of fruit or vegetable... All of that is just optional. The true freedom is just knowing that, in the final analysis: You really don't need anything by animal products! You might ENJOY other foods...but you don't NEED THEM to have a 'so called' BALANCED diet. Not at all. It's just gilding the lily, really. So, go carnivore young man! (Or woman). Stick with it as long as you'd like, and as long as you enjoy ever-improving health and wellness! It is a RESET!! Just like restarting your computer brings it back to its virginal state, so too does 'resetting' your primordial self back to the pre-carb, pristine human state! Then, with your new health and knowledge, you can venture back out into the dangerous modern world, full of its perilous food-like substances, and hyper-processed garbage- but now, you know that true health lies in animal protein foods; not in medications and plant concoctions of oxalates and nightshades galore! - [Fit and Healthy at Any Age](https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/fit-and-healthy-at-any-age/id797681537?i=1000623108053) Fit and Healthy at Any Age https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a6nfG69c9g I read and hear all the time about how we all should do certain things when we reach a certain age. If not, we are being irresponsible... It starts really young: get your baby vaccinations- a LOT of vaccinations, all at once! (NOT a good idea. much better to space them out over years, and even better to pick and choose amongst the many pushed.). For instance: flu vaccine and coronavirus for babies?? Terrible idea! As for the dozen or so usually pushed for infants, I would explore which ones are really necessary! (Recommendations change, but the number of vaccinesalways goes- UP!). If you or yours has a new baby, research this. All vaccines are definitely NOT your baby's friend. Now, I am not at the infant care level anymore, although I am soon to become a grandfather yet again. (Hurray!) My daughter knows all about appropriate, and non-appropriate vaccines... But let me say here- if you give your infant the flu vaccine and the coronavirus vaccine , among others at that early age- you are doing the wrong thing! Don't. I am 71 now, and mainly concerned with my own health and fitness. Aside from my overall very healthy, paleo and largely meat and dairy based diet, ample sleep, and daily workout schedule, am sure to NOT take any prescription drugs. I also have a daily smoothie, prepared in my Vitamix, of kefir, tart black cherry juice, citrus, including an organic unpeeled lemon, cruciferous veggies, apple cider vinegar, nutritional yeast of B vitamins, cod liver oil, ginger, turmeric, and current garden veggies I am harvesting in season. My goals have not changed since in my early twenties. I strive to get stronger (not just maintain), and in some ways I still am! Having muscular endurance is crucial as well, but it is the truth that you don't get continually stronger over the decades, no matter what you do! But is you look into Ben Patrick's kneesovertoesguy.com On YouTube. Endless helpful videos and demonstrations of how top cure your knees, along with feet, back, and most of the rest of your physical body! Trust me: you can restore injured and even badly deteriorated joints with determined exercise and stretching, always doing such well within your limits and gradually progressing! Here is how my own journey plays into all of this. I took a bad fall onto concrete pavers a few weeks ago. I broke my fall with my left hand, and my left shoulder was injured pretty badly, along with the tendon on my left knee. Ouch! So, I have been doing daily therapy over my whole body, using virtual resistance by flexing the muscles and tendons just to the point where it does not hurt badly. A little pain, but more therapeutic than anything. The worst thing I could have done? Go to the clinic, take pain pills, and do nothing, except schedule surgeries and more prescriptions. I didn't do that, and now I am definitely on the mend. The pain is manageable, after I do my morning exercises. About an hour's worth, just as I always do, but now gentler, and more focussed on the problem areas... So, the point is this- just keep on striving, to get stronger and more flexible and vital. The rules never change- they just sometimes need alterations given circumstances. Just never give up, and do it all yourself, researching and getting advice where you can. Like from Ben Patrick, who athletes love and medical doctors hate! - [Build Yourself for Strength and Resilience podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/build-yourself-for-strength-and-resilience-podcast/id797681537?i=1000618414071) Build Yourself for Strength and Resilience podcast I just fell down, hard! I went out to the garage, in the rain, and slipped on the mud around our new sidewalk landscaping project. It's been dry here for so long that I think I forgot how to walk on mud, and my legs shot up in the air and I crashed down on my back. I was fine, and so just got what I came out for, and went back in the house. But it got me thinking: I'm 71 years old now. Such a fall might have laid up many folks, and severely shaken many others, so that their back, knees, or other body parts would need medical attention. And that is my point- I am perfectly fine, although a bit dirty. In fact, upon reflection, I realize that physically, I can do anything I could do when I was 35, or 25. In fact, I am actually quite a bit stronger and more flexible than I was at those younger ages, and a m quite resilient overall. Mentally and physically, I can do anything I want to, and never even consider my age in choosing activities to participate in. I say this not to brag, but to point out that any of us- all of us- should be in this condition for our entire lives! Not that I expect my mother, who is 97, to still be so capable as when she was younger; or her brother, Uncle Bob, at age 101 definitely can't do everything he'd like.... But, both of them (and my Aunt Janie, at 99) can all still get around and are largely independent in their homes. I plan to follow in their footsteps, even if I do occasionally fall down, and I suggest that you do likewise. What is it that they do daily, and that I also do, that keeps us all going along with such resilience, both mentally and physically? 1. Eat a diet of real foods: avoid fast foods and processed foods, relying instead on meats, cheeses, small amounts of vegetables and fruits, and nuts. Wild game and seafood, rather than grains, jellies, and cakes. Cook your food yourself, whether on the stove or the grill. Use a good sea salt for flavor, like Redmond's Real Salt from the dead seas of Utah. ( I have no affiliation with that company). 2. Work out every day. Stretch, flex virtually, do calisthenics, get on the floor and stretch some more. Massage your feet, and exercise them, along with self-resisted neck exercises as well. Do it first thing daily. Do it in front of the TV- Every Day! Also, do serious strength training 2 to 3X per week, in the afternoons. Gymnastic rings are a wonderful mainstay for this, as is a Power Rack! 3. Eat a large breakfast. It doesn't need to be right when you get up, after your stretching workout is better. 3 or 4 eggs is ideal! Coffee with cream is a wonderful addition; you can even have some as you work out in front of the television set. 4. Do your own manual labor. Don't hire it out, just because you can- provide for yourself as much as you can! Keep your own house, tend your own garden, yard, and woods. Make your home as meticulously as you make yourself, body and mind and soul. 5. Read daily. Walk and meditate every day, walk in the woods and in nature. Walk backwards. Live as rurally as you can, and relish it. This is the birthright of the European race, and we abandon it at our peril. 6. Go to church, and attend to your immortal soul as you do to your mortal self. They both add up to YOU! Don't emulate someone as shallow as Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says an afterlife is a fantasy. He should know better- and so should you... And there you have it. How to fall down and not get hurt! With some digressions... - [What is Most Important in Your Life NOW?](https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/what-is-most-important-in-your-life-now/id797681537?i=1000613455229) What is Most Important in Your Life NOW? Hello, and welcome to the Smoothie Cafe! We are here traditionally discussing health and fitness from a Paleo Diet point of view. A smoothie, made preferably in a Vitamix, is key to maximizing your nutritional density intake, and that is still my belief. But as in anything looked at honestly for a while, say 10 years or more as it is here, new facts come in, and opinions alter... As it is in life! When you are young, say in your teens and twenties, you are rightly concerned with getting started in life. You want to be strong and healthy, but much of it is to attract and establish a life with a like-minded mate. This is right and natural. Much of your youth is fixated on finding the proper path (job), and the right place to live, and raise a family. Traditionally, this was just on finding a place to live near your job, that was safe and with good schools, etc. But, with the advance of Democratic socialism/liberalism, this has been perverted. Now, you need to find a place that is not contaminated by 'wokeism' and liberalism, which can transform a city or area into a place where: 1. Crime is not punished, and criminals run free. (This includes nowadays all blue, democrat-run liberal cities, which are virtually ALL big cities!) 2. Schools are teaching nonsense and anti-civilization like 'Whites are evil', 'White Privilege', and other aspects of Critical Race Theory, which is total poison and a total lie. 3. 'Trans' and other Woke garbage. LGBTQ and all the rest of anti-civilization garbage. It's hard to believe to me, who grew up in the 1950's, that we are even talking about such disgusting craziness, and that young people have to deal with and process this crap. But it is there today, sadly! I am now officially old- 71. I have grandchildren! While I still am very concerned with health and wellness, and am very much still a 'physical culturist' (NOT a bodybuilder), I realize at this stage that the health of our country, state, and nation is just as important to the future. And, even though myself, wife and family are all fit and healthy, side-stepping most 'big medicine' misdirections, such as in covid vaccines and statin prescriptions, much of our population and so-called leaders are still very misinformed and are 'loose cannons' of bad information and direction! Here are my conclusions: If you are older, like me- work out daily! Do stretching and 'virtual resistance' training, in front of the TV, every morning first thing. 30 minutes to an hour; you will enjoy it! Also, work out with resistance training like pushups, especially on gymnastic rings, and work your whole body. Do rows and pullups, situps and squats and deadlifts. At least two times per week, forever. Don't ever stop. And this, for every age: Work out- same prescription! From 12- 112. Walk in your daily life, best is barefoot in the woods, on the grass. Sleep at least 8 hours per night, in total darkness- banish TV's and other screens from your bedroom. Blackout curtains and white noise can help, if you haven't taken my other advice, and gotten the HELL out of big cities and suburbs with blue light and noise coming from everywhere! If you are younger, with a young family or planning on one- Get out of big cities! Get our of big suburbs, in metropolitan areas (They are all liberal/blue/socialist/communistic). Get Out Now! It may not be possible in future! Make sure you are in a red state, or at least purple one. And go rural; small towns are better than larger, small cities are much better than large, and so it goes. The furth - [Rolll With the Punches!](https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/rolll-with-the-punches/id797681537?i=1000610316174) Rolll With the Punches! I am at an odd place right now. It's now even that crazy, but it does confuse me- I have gotten a new computer! I know, that actually sounds good, not bad... but trust me: I was so used to my old computer that, even though it was slow, and sometimes frustrating- at least I always knew where things were, and how things worked in general. Nowadays, however, although my computer is really, really fast- my prep work on things is really slow. I can't find where my podcasts are, my apps are all updated and different, and so it goes, on and on. And I think that life, in general, is often like this. We work really hard on something, say to change our diet. We switch from the SAD American diet to paleo, and then we replace most carbs with protein from meat and dairy. We become much, much healthier, and hey- what could be wrong with that? Well, our friends might treat us differently. They might denigrate us, saying that our diet is not healthy at all, since it is high in fat, and we don't do enough 'cardio'. We become confused, since old friends treat us differently, and although everything we've done has been really positive for our health, things are just, somehow- different from what we are used to! Just like my new computer: when things are better, even way better- they still are different. Different is inherently uncomfortable! It just is... This is when we need to realize that different may be uncomfortable at first; but if it is better, then we need to just roll with the punches and embrace it. Forge ahead with a big smile! If you can't find your old files, don't worry about it for now. (You can always find them later, they're still there). What is important is to make new files- or go ahead and make more progress on your carnivor-ish kind of a diet, and savor the positive changes to your health! Do your daily workout, and push hard when you know it's right, and taper off if you know you are under too much stress from other things in your life. Each day is actually new, and completely different, if we only realize it. Here is another example: it's Spring here in Wisconsin, and normally that is cause for undiminished rejoicing, after a particularly long and trying Winter. BUT- we had a few days in the high 80's (not normal, not at all), and then had a snowfall of over 1 and 1/2 FEET! The tree branches in our woods and yard broke under the weight, by the hundreds! They are lying, even now, in the yard, which is now wet and semi-flooded. The tractor can't help much, since it would make ruts anywhere it travels, and so instead of avidly planning our garden, and cultivating our plants and yard- we are trapped in a strange different sort of Spring. It's really hard mentally.. But actually, it's no big deal, not really. It's time to reflect, to lay back and wait. Even though I'm dying to get going on all things Spring- I need to change my focus. I can read, and write more. Focus on my gymnastic rings training, trying new angles and exercise ideas. Grill more in bulk, to stock up on meats in the fridge, and smoothies in canning jars ready to drink. And slowly build my trap-bar deadlifts to a new peak! The garden can wait. Tomorrow, even though it will be a high of 40, I can use my newly sharpened chain saw and cut down some broken branches that are hanging over the roadway. I can drag these branches, and others, down the road, even though I can't drag them into the yard itself. I'll just push them off the road, and wait for when I can drag them to where I can either cut them for firewood, of burn them. Nothing is really changed, - [How to Achieve Lifelong Health and Fitness](https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/how-to-achieve-lifelong-health-and-fitness/id797681537?i=1000604218624) How to Achieve Lifelong Health and Fitness It's really not that hard to accomplish. The information is all there, unfortunately, much of it is obscured by people 'selling things', such as offering an easy way. That is indeed the problem: no matter how hard you look, online, on TV or on YouTube commercials- there really is no easy way. But there is a simple and effective way! Eat an ancestral, or paleo type of diet. High animal protein, meat, and dairy. Some vegetables, with cruciferous veggies like broccoli and cauliflower, and small amounts of lettuce with olive oil and avocado and coconut oil types of dressing. Seafood and eggs are wonderful as well; but the bedrock of your diet should be pastured meats and dairy, in particular ruminant meat, such as beef. Like our ancestors ate long ago, and evolved alongside throughout the long ice age- mammoths, aurochs, and cows. Same types exactly, that turned vegetation, however sparse, into protein-dense meat! And now we get to lifestyle, and the huge bugaboo of exercise. For be assured that diet is considered the most contentious component of a healthy and fit lifestyle, it is really very simple. Just do as outlined above. Veganism and vegetarianism are bad jokes- just avoid them, as did our ancestors. (Those who survived that is). And now: exercise. Exercise, real, productive exercise is one thing: Strength Training! I'm not saying you can't run, breaking a sweat as you jog along a forest path, preferably barefoot... of course you can! Or walk or hike long distances, in the sunshine, or swim or paddle board or play tennis or paddle/pickleball with your friends- all of these are great! Great adjuncts, like playing Wordle, or doing crossword puzzles, or any number of sports like hockey, or baseball, basketball or football or soccer. All are fine and wonderful games, along with many others. But- they are not EXERCISE. Exercise is a practice that you need to do for your entire life. It means to do certain necessary things: Strengthen your musculature, from head to toe. Progressively and on a near-daily basis, for your entire life. Slowly, and deliberately, on your own. Without competition. This practice, done regularly, will also strengthen your tendons and ligaments, while also stretching and maintaining your ranges of motion. You just need to figure out the protocol, and then to Do It! First, start with Virtual Resistance. This is flexing as you move your body throughout various positions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI65LRENdKo&t=27s This will give you the idea. Go thou and do likewise! Then, add in straight-legged situps for high reps, and stretch out on a mat in front of the TV. (Do this every morning). Add in pushups, on a perfect pushup device if you can, with your feet elevated on a couch or chair. Do them s-l-o-w-l-y for maximum benefit... Add in Asian squats, where to squat to the floor, with your feet flat on the ground, and hold... this is a very important exercise! A 'rebounder' is an important adjunct here: bounce on it as you do your virtual resistance exercises, and finish by bouncing on your butt, which is an amazing ab exercise! Let's say you do this listed above for about 1/2 hour in the morning, in front of the television. It's a great way to start the day! Reward yourself with 3 or 4 scrambled eggs- your body will thank you.
