It took me a long time and several drugs/dosages/siezures to figure this out on my own. I have catamenial epilepsy, meaning that my menstration triggers my seizures. And for many women with epilepsy this is a trigger, but for me this was possibly the biggest one I could pinpoint. I suggested to my nuero that we approach the problem hormonally ontop of my Topamax, and he agreed. I have started taking the Nuvaring, which being localized doesn't interact with the Topamax very much and hasn't given me very many side effects as of yet, which is basically progesterone and a little estrogen. I am siezure free now for four months. I have had a few small auras, but that is nothing compared to the number of large seizures I would have every month over the last five years. I would encourage women who are in similar circumstances to read up on catamenial epilepsy, track their period, and see if maybe there is an alternative present to all the drugs we have been taking. I would be glad to finally lower my Topamax if this works! Everytime I upped it I saw more side effects and minimal results, and thats considering it's been my best drug so far. EDIT: I decided to edit this with an update since I got so many replies. I was on the Nuvaring (and 250 topamax succesfully) for a year and now moved on to the Mirena IUD which has progesterone in it. I am sz-free since that post, well over a year. For me at least, Mirena has proven a good option so far, although some research around the net makes me think it wont last the 5 years because Topamax metabolizes it faster. Still, it's the best option I have right now. A thing about catamenial E. I've come to understand from reading some of the literature...almost all women with E. will have more sz during certain cycles of her menstruation. Catamenial E. is a type of refractory epilepsy. It describes seizures that are uncontrolled by medication and are triggered by hormonal cycles, even when all other sz a patient can have are being controlled. So, I think making that assessment is a crucial one in whether birth control will be a good option for you. Secondly, most doctors are not aware of this, it involves fighting for it, educating yourself, and being self aware. Know what drugs you can and cannot take, know your birth control plans...its a challenge but very feasible to become sz free! I never thought i would have it with the number of sz and the duration I was having, but the same month I got on bc it just stopped. Comments Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally a solution! kateunc33 on Mon, 2011-05-02 - 21:53 I'm so thankful for reading all of your posts and because of them I too finally found the type of epilepsy that I have and how to go about controlling them. My first seizure started when I was 24 and it was a grand mal, went to the ER and had a CT scan done, everything was normal. I just thought it was a fluke occurrence and probably wouldn't happen again, but following month right around my period it happened again and this time I had an aura...so I followed up with a neurologist. He put me on Keppra 500mg and I went seizure free for 2 years. Started having grand mal seizures again at 26, it was like clock work...happened around my menses, one every month. A week prior to my period I'd feel confused, difficulty with word finding, feel an \"out of body\" experience similar to depersonalization disorder, certain light and particularly fluorescent light was more irritating to me, eyes would twitch, cold sores would come out, etc...I could go on and on. I've had so many different experiences prior to these seizures. I dealt with it for about 2 years now. I'm 27 now, will soon be 28 and haven't been driving for almost 2 years because of my seizures, waiting to be seizure free for 6 months (so far it's been 3 months, crossing my fingers!) I'm taking Lamictal XR, Keppra, and Zonegran. I also was lucky enough to see an excellent neurologist/neurosurgeon that found lesions in my temporal lobe and did several MRIs and EEGs including an invasive one and found that I had temporal lobe epilepsy, was having approximately 45 seizures a day withouth me knowing. They found that brain surgery could benefit me to about 75% chance of no longer having seizures and I went for it. Best decision I ever made. I'm clear-minded, much sharper, don't have that depersonalization feeling anymore, but I've had surgery only 3 months ago. I had a temporal lobectomy and they took a good portion of my lesions out which was just dead tissue that was no good for my mind. I'm now back to work, able to concentrate, have more energy, not so tired and don't feel like a zomby anymore. It's amazing! The only thing I do wish to fix is my hormone levels because this is the first month since my surgery that my auras are coming back and everything I previously explained is back that occurs a week prior to my seizures. It's not as bad, but it's there and it is a week prior to my period. My neurologist increased my zonegran as I am still on all of my meds for 6 months post surgery and then they discuss gradual decrease, but he also recommended I see an OBGYN to get on some deprovera. He didn't mention anything about the \"type\" of epilepsy I may have, however; but I think you've given me the answer! Thanks for all of your posts, they're greatly appreciated!!

Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally wd123 on Sat, 2011-12-03 - 21:59 I have been tracking my periods for a short while after the last couple have oddly turned up on my time of period - though conincidence I dont know. I also know here that mine stopped pretty much for 7 years and then started again and I was on the pill. I have no proof at the moment as I am waiting to see what develops and I have no memory of past 10 years etc when things were happening in relation to my period. Things happened as well around the birth of my children. Yes - the period times were all stressed related, lack of sleep and I have checked my diary and it really did not suggest a pattern of periods ie month apart - though I was not tracking my period at the time. I oddly remember the hospital trips, I was having my period or births etc. Could be major conincidence however, the last hospital trip where I was having period has made me truly suspicious it could be this. I have also read on this post about ovulation time, so there is this to consider. I have too been diagnosed with many things - seen many drs, different meds which have failed and still more meds to go. I came off the pill some time ago and have not really been back on it and I clearly remember only taking 1 type of pill because of mood swings. It was shortly after stopping taking the pill, that I started with seizures. This could all be a major conincidence but has made me suspicious about it because of the comments from many here. For me there is no - oh I am on my first day and having a seizure - its not like that. I also have a brain injury but they consider me stressed (I stopped work, volunteer activities, stressful things) and seeing stress specialist now but I have done this in the past and it has not worked, as I have had seizures during all of these stress freeing activities. I am thinking here, I should just bite the bullet, go back on the pill and give it a shot. I have a new neuro coming up. I cannot handle the seizures and they are getting worse not better, to the point where I can see the differences now in the seizure and not so weirded out by them. They have suggested I \"may have\" or probably complex partial seizures, disassociations, mental health issues, stress induced seizures, the list goes on here but never any diagnosis. I am doing less now that I ever have and avoiding stressful behaviour but I feel that ultimately if this is brain injury, this may not help. My neuro has commented on things and I have been told to go to physcologist may times (i feel I have spent my life talking there - with no real action happening in reduction of seizures. My aim is again to have seizure free life, like I have done in the past - where I was working, doing other things, taking care of kids etc with no seizures like normal people do. Thus far I have tried sodium valproate ie epilium, tompomax, lamictal (rash appeared there) and phenobarb (serious side effect there with uncontrollable mood swings extremely dangerous med for me). I have found the only thing that works 100 percent is clomazepam, because I am alseep - and this is related to sleep. I had high hopes for phenobarb because of the sleep factor but uncontrollable mood swings on taking that med made me say no thanks to that. Of these meds, epilium was working the best, with less side effect however, tomopamax worked well but side effects extremely bad to point where i was having difficulty walking and with my gait. I ended up having large seizure on that one - and came off of it - and was thankful. I have also altered in my life bad friendships, workplaces, choosing not to work, searching for better drs, and researching various topics such as epilepsy, the brain, seizures etc and speaking to others on net and within groups and various associations. I have also lost a number of jobs with their unfair situations of finding out I have seizures and then pretty much making it \"hard\" for me to stay or calling meetings etc about my condition. I have also missed out on free counselling because they did not have a specialist for me. I found that rude and something I wish to follow up as it was specialist counselling center - and I was not allowed in until after I had a drs appoint and diagnsis confirmed. It is strange to sit there and listen to their musing about something they know little about - in some of these meetings, I get told oh such and such died of seizures - very helpful. I am at the point now, where I do not tell the workplace, because I rarely have seizures and under law I dont have to anyway where I live. I only told last workplace just in case and I liked the people there and thought it fair to tell them. I have also had workplaces completely ok with it - and not make a hassle nor tell the whole staff and ask what to do etc. I can still work but choose not to at this time.

Thanks Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally a solution! uberzwitter on Mon, 2009-08-31 - 14:30 I'm glad to finally see a responce like yours because I wanted to find others like me and hopefully we could all learn something from each other. I suppose all bodies are different. Your hormones might be really strong! But as I have been told, we have epilepsy that is worsented by hormones- not hormones that cause epilepsy. You might not find an 100% solution depending on your sz. I beleve 60% of women with E have catamenial siezures. For me though these seems to be the main trigger. And for you it might be as well but- are you on any anti-convulsants as well? I take Topamax concurrently 250 mg a day. I believe it is the combination of both that helps. 250 mg a day without the hormones was NOT effective. Likewise, hormones alone might not be eitheir. I urge you to consider hormones as perhaps a concurrent treatment. I know Depo can be done alone, but perhaps in our cases where breakthroughs still are frequent, it should be viewed as a powerful add-on therapy to conventional anti-convulsants as opposed to monotherapy alone. If Depo is not working...and you are on an anti-convulsant you trust, maybe something of Depo doesn't agree with you. As odd as that would be...you could explore other progesterone, (*very* low estrogen birth control options, since Depo is the only progesterone only option) to see if there is a difference. I opted out because of weight gain with it) Good luck. Let me know what happens.

Matt Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally a solution! stewart1 on Thu, 2009-10-08 - 18:59 Hello! I was diagnosed with epilepsy approximately 7 years ago. It took my doctors about 3 years to diagnose it. Why? Because at first, I was not falling out on the floor, having convulsions, and had no known head injuries. My epilepsy started with paralisis of my arm. For about 3-4 months at a time, my right arm would become paralyzed, and then it would start working again. This happened several times over 3 years. Finally we talked to someone else who had the exact same symptoms, and he let us know that it was because of epilepsy. Shortly there after, I started going into convulsions. Anywayz, my seizures episodes ALWAYS occur at the offset of my mensturation cycle. I have indescribable cramps, and then begin to vomit. Over the last several months, I have been taken pain reliver, along with my Trileptal for about a week leading up to my cycle. This has controlled the cramps, and kept me from getting so sick and beginning to convulse. Hope that helps somebody! Hello! I was diagnosed with epilepsy approximately 7 years ago.

Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally Submitted by winged on Sun, 2009-12-13 - 16:34 Wow, I'm so glad to find a forum thread like this! I've been diagnosed with epilepsy for a long time - I had absence seizures when I was a very small child but appeared to have \"grown out of them\" and then was re-diagnosed with JME when absence and myeclonic all started popping up around age 13. I was initially put on Depakote, which helped some. However, my seizures were never satisfactorally controlled. When we moved, my new neurologist put me on Clonazepam, then switched me to Zonegran and Clonazepam. What was suspected (at first before the move and then after) - especially because my mother had had absence seizures in her early adolescent years and her sister had life-long TC seizures, both catamenial - was that the bursts of seizures I was having were during my cycle. When we discussed this with my neurologist he seemed at first dubious (seemed to think this was relatively rare or unlikely -- seems more likely that he hadn't read much about it) but accepted that we should try changing my medication. He first upped my Zonegran -- which was a terrible idea, made me about 10 times more out of it -- and then switched to a higher Clonazepam dose around my period, which was fairly but not completely effective. However, he wasn't completely satisfied with this and wanted me to try birth control, a solution I never got around to because I had slightly high blood pressure at this time and my gynecologist refused to put me on birth control with high blood pressure [she also had never heard of it as a treatment for epilepsy]. I switched later to an adult neurologist, a woman, who had heard of this (again never gave me a name but was immediately confirming of the idea). We never figured out with her what she wanted to do, although she seemed content with the idea of upping my Clonazepam. Right about the time that I moved to another state and graduated college, thus losing my medical insurance (...let me tell you, that has been a CARNIVAL of fun times), I had my first ever tonic-clonic seizure. I don't know if they can be brought on by stress or not - since everyone else in my family who's had seizures has had them brought on at a time of hormone change, and mine haven't. Since then I've had two more - love those unexpected ER visits and freaking out the new coworkers. The first was not during my period although it may have been during an ovulation cycle and was definitely during a period of not enough sleep and dehydration. The second two were both on the last day of my period - that transition period. The second two times I've also experienced what must be partial and some kind of secondary generalized seizures - the third time repeatedly and requiring repeated doses of Ativan to control them - after the TC was over. When I came home I had a migraine bad enough to vomit and my cycle is often independently marked by migraines. Whoa. Too much information. Can you tell I'm a newbie here on the boards? I don't have too many people to share my story with. In any case, I'm glad to know there's a name and a possible solution. I'll have to wait until I have medical insurance -- ER visits alone are some pretty bad debt for me -- but the thought that birth control could maybe put an end to the fear I have every time I have my period is enough for me.

Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally a solution! Thu, 2010-03-11 - 02:23 I've been seizure-free since I've combined a hormone balancing weight-loss pill (myslimquick.com-under weight loss caplets in light blue) and Keppra xr and zyprexa. I've been seizure-free since I've combined a hormone balancing weight-loss pill (myslimquick.com-under weight loss caplets in danyellehannah on Mon, 2010-09-06 - 13:18 Hello! I've been reading post for a while now and figured id add my own and see where it gets me. Anyway, I'm very interested in this, although i'm not sure if my epilepsy relates to Catamenial Epilepsy, however, I have very similar symptoms... Since I was 13 years old, I started to have seizures twice a year. I am now 18 years old and Im still having GRAND MAL seizures two-three times a year, sometimes four. I have recently noticed that my past 4 seizures have been either the start of my menstral cycle or a couple days after. I'm not irregular though. I always get my period around the same time each month, and I never miss any months also. Everytime I have a seizure, I have about a 5 to 10minute warning (which I am very thankful for, because I do know people who have absolutely no warning) I feel confused, I don't exactly know where I am or what I was doing, I can't walk straight, I walk into walls, and then I fall. I sort of feel like i'm drunk and have absolutely no clue what is going on, what is happening to me or even who I am. I have been seeing a speciallist for about a year, i've had many EGG's and MRI's telling me that it is likely that I will still continue to have seizures. My doctor has put me on Lamotrigine. I take a 150 mg in the morning and then 150 mg again before bed. So far ive been taking them for about a year and still no results. It seems I may also be having more seizures since i've been taking it, which doesn't quite make sense. Anyway, if anyone who has epilepsy and have similar symtoms to mine. Please reply! Especially if you've figured a cure or have any tips. I would really appreciate it!! Hello! I've been reading post for a while now and figured id add my own and see where it gets me.

Since I was 13 years old, I started to have seizures twice a year. I am now 18 years old and Im still having GRAND MAL seizures two-three times a year, sometimes four. I have recently noticed that my past 4 seizures have been either the start of my menstral cycle or a couple days after. I'm not irregular though. I always get my period around the same time each month, and I never miss any months also. Everytime I have a seizure, I have about a 5 to 10minute warning (which I am very thankful for, because I do know people who have absolutely no warning) I feel confused, I don't exactly know where I am or what I was doing, I can't walk straight, I walk into walls, and then I fall. I sort of feel like i'm drunk and have absolutely no clue what is going on, what is happening to me or even who I am. I have been seeing a speciallist for about a year, i've had many EGG's and MRI's telling me that it is likely that I will still continue to have seizures. My doctor has put me on Lamotrigine. I take a 150 mg in the morning and then 150 mg again before bed. So far ive been taking them for about a year and still no results. It seems I may also be having more seizures since i've been taking it, which doesn't quite make sense. Anyway, if anyone who has epilepsy and have similar symtoms to mine. Please reply! Especially if you've figured a cure or have any tips. I would really appreciate it!! Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally a solution! Submitted by winged on Sat, 2010-10-02 - 12:45 Although I don't have exactly the same symptoms you do, my seizures come at exactly the same time of the month (either right before or right after the period) that yours do. Unfortunately I'm still at a loss because of crap doctor situation, although if I'm getting lots of sleep, drinking water, taking meds on time etc it seems to drastically reduce the likelihood that a seizure will happen. So definitely, if your period is coming up, take care of yourself. It sounds at LEAST like you need to switch off Lamotrigine, or possibly reduce it and add another medication. If it's possibly exacerbating the seizures and isn't helping, SOMETHING needs to be done. It might be worth mentioning that you think it has to do with hormones. It's possible that Lamotrigine has some chemical interplay with your body that could make that more likely, but to be honest I don't know a thing about it.

I have Catamenial Epilepsy. I am 27 now and I will till you my worst years with seizures were from 22 to 25. During one of those years I actually had 6 seizures in 9hrs and was in ICU for over a week. It took so many test and meds to finally find a solution, it was about over a 4 year search. My doctor tried so much to figure out a solution for me. He even sent me to another specialist that was suppose to know more about this type of epilepsy. Which turned out to be a waste of my time since he & his physician assistant didn't go all the way through my chart and wanted to put me on a med that made me worse. I have been seizure free for almost 2yrs now. I have to take seizure medication, which is Keppra and Zonisamide, plus a Deppo shot every month. My doctor and OB talked and tried me having the shot only every three months like you are suppose to. The shot was not working I would still have my monthly cycle. Then they tried me having the shot every 2months and one off that kind of worked but not every month. So they went to 3 months as soon as they did that I was totally free of they little ones seizures and grand mil. My Doctor and OB gave it awhile and wanted to see if they could take me back down to two shots since the shot really long term at the level I am getting has side effects. As soon as they did that I had a cycle and had a seizure. I hope this post helps you in find out what works for you. If you have any questions about what I take or went through to find the solution just reply back to the post.

My query is....what would happen if I were to get a complete hysterectomy ? I know that some are trying birth control methods like neuvo ring and things. But, what is there were no hormones to fluctuate? Any ideas? Thanks so much for this discussion. ShakinWillow Hello Everyone, So glad people are talking about this.

I began having light headed spells, problems with depth perception, speech difficulties and even problems with movement for several days at a time. I resembled a stroke victim. It would occur for 4-5 days and then abate for a week - just long enough for me to hope it was a bad dream and then return the following week. The only diagnosis I could get was conversion disorder - even after a week's stay in a research hospital. I continued to search for the true cause of my problem for a couple of years. Fortunately along the way, I had some tests that led me to a physician that was finally able to diagnose catamanial epilepsy. A Naturopath did some hormone testing and I had a PET scan that showed temporal lobe hypometabolism. In December 2009, I read a paper on line about natural progesterone treatment for catamenial seizures and went to the health food store and bought a tube of Emerita ProGest cream. Within 15 minutes of rubbing the cream on my skin, my symptoms started abating. It was a miracle! I found a neuroendocrinolgist that was finally able to give me an accurate diagnosis and work with me on hormonal treatments to keep my seizures under control. The first step is to chart them correctly. Had I known this, I would have saved myself lots of time and grief. If the first day of your cycle is Day 1, begin charting your symptoms by this and begin all over again when you get your next period. Catamenial seizures occur when estrogen levels are high. This is usually during ovulation and just prior to menstruation. Charting is critical to determining if hormones play a role in seizures and seeing if there is a pattern to your symptoms. I also began paying attention to my triggers. I could almost have a panic attack walking into a big box store when I was symptomatic. Turns out, the flourescent lights were causing me to feel weird. Now I wear sunglasses and I don't have any issues. Coffee, low blood sugar, lack of sleep.. it helps to figure out what makes you feel odd and take action to avoid the situations you are able to control. I could feel fine at home and get to a Dr's office and start feeling weird. This would make me second guess my mental state and my opinion that I did NOT have a conversion disorder. Turns out, most physicians have flourescent lights in their offices! As for treatments, unfortunately, a Mirena IUD did not work for me. ProGest cream works, but I have lots of breakthrough seizures. My neuro prescribed Prometrium. I was taking as much as 1600 mg a day. The side effects were awful. My seizures were reduced but still not under control. Finally, in August of this year, I began getting Lupron Depot shots. I just had my third one. Since the first shot, I have had two seizures. I was having 40-50 every 23 day cycle. The Lupron induces a reversible menopause. It has side effects also, most noticeably lots of hot flashes, but it seems to be working and I feel hopeful that I have a chance at a life again. A few more months with this successfully working and I will opt for a hysterectomy and hopefully be able to put this chapter of my life behind me. I see young women and I think, \"why didn't anyone tell me being a woman could be so difficult? How can a hormone cause me to feel so odd and lose touch with normalcy? How can most physicians have no clue that hormones can cause such extreme symptoms?\" Perhaps it is better I didn't know this would be my fate. I am angry that I suffered as long as I did. I saw over 45 physicians in two years and no one was able to give me anything but platitudes, referrals and offers for prescriptions for antidepressants.

The best price I have found is through Amazon.com they have a deal that gives you 15% on Subscribe and Save. It is reasonably priced - especially considering its benefits. I found that a little bit could make a big difference. Especially if I spaced it out and rubbed small amounts on several times a day. 15 minutes after application, it would be like a fog lifting. 3-4 hours later, I could feel the fog rolling in. Always good to stay on top of it. This would be true of any medication. If you don't have health insurance, this would be an inexpensive thing to try. Topical progesterone creams available OTC are not regulated. Emerita is a woman owned company that has been in business for 40 years and manufactures superior products. If you purchase just any topical progesterone cream at the health food store, you might not be getting what is advertised. I feel confident Emerita brand is consistent quality.

Since taking clobazam a haven't had another gm seizure, i take 1 tablet before bed during menstruation, luckily i'm very regular and its done the trick.

I know these are random facts but I'm so frustrated with the neurologist just restricting me from driving and not asking questions.

Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally a solution! rachelr917 on Sat, 2012-05-05 - 18:39 Thank you so much for your post! For years I've taken lamictal and it has controlled my seizures EXCEPT when I was ovulating. My neuro kept jacking up the dose of lamictal which just made me tired and spacey all day long. But when I came across your post I decided to check into going on Birth Control. I've been on NuvaRing for about 1 1/2 months now and no seizures yet. Thanks for your post!

Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally a solution! Submitted by cag122 on Sun, 2012-05-20 - 22:51 I apologize in advance for the long post. The feedback here speaks greatly to my seizure disorder so felt the need to share. I am a 35-year-old woman, diagnosed with a right frontal focal partial onset seizure d/o at age 8. Having tried myriad AED's, I still experience partial seizures daily (zoning out/blank stares, jumbled speech, involuntary hair twirling, residual headaches) but never loose consciousness. They are brief but annoying and uncomfortable. A lifetime of EEGs, CT scans, MRIs have all proven unremarkable. I've been told repeatedly by neurologists that this is good news. My current neurologist (great doctor double-boarded in neurology and psychiatry) recently told me he can't technically diagnose me with Epilepsy since things have been relatively normal for the past year. I thought, what's wrong with me then!?! I thought I might be losing my mind. About one year ago I was taking an oral contraceptive (Lybrel) for my other \"diagnosis\" of Endometriosis. For the first time in a long, long time I was seizure-free. After 6 months on Lybrel my OB/GYN and neurologist decided to start weening me off everything including my AED's. Bad idea! This made for the perfect storm. I was done with my 6-month regimine of Lybrel, completely off the Lamictal and almost off the Clonazepam. On a very low dose of just Clonazepam, within a month I had my first tonic clonic seizure, next month another one, and then a third the following month. I was scared out of my mind and am now back on my 2 AED's but off Lybrel. I have been pretty stable since. No large seizures but still these smaller, nagging episodes. I've been researching Catamenial Epilepsy. My grand mal seizures must have been hormone-triggered and the frequency, severity and duration of my partial seizures spike during ovulation and menstruation. I'm presently unemployed and don't have health insurance or would probably jump back on Lybrel. It's becoming clearer that the hormone progesterone was inhibiting my seizures BUT that I also need my AED's. Lamictal has been a life changer for me but even with Clonazepam it's not enough. It's a huge relief to know there are others out there with a knowledge of Catamenial Epilepsy. I'm interested to hear more of your stories and about other alternative therapies. I'm curious about the progesterone cream mentioned - what brand, how to apply, etc. Any additional insight or advice would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I wish anyone and everyone dealing with this the very best. Thanks!!! I apologize in advance for the long post. The feedback here speaks greatly to my seizure disorder so felt the need to share.

Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally a randres on Thu, 2013-02-21 - 15:25 Hi there, In short, no, an \"increase\" in hormones would not trigger seizures as hormones do not build up. They merely fluctuate. If your body wants to have a menstrual cycle, it will, even if you are on the 3 month pill. What may be happening is your progesterone is off (too low). If this is the case, the only way to fix it is to take a low dose Estrogen pill so that your progesterone levels can try to protect you from the seizures. I should have said this earlier. The reason the doctors don't believe in Catamenial epilepsy or hormones effecting your seizure threshold is because all the research has been with the pill. The pill has been \"proven\" not to impact seizures - only the efficacy of your drugs and to shut down ovaries that are causing great fluctuations in hormonal release. However, research on natural or bio-identical hormones (the kind they use for challenging pregnancies for example) proves that if you have low or greatly fluctuating hormones, natural progesterone will prevent seizures and in many cases facilitate the reduction in your medication.

Re: Catamenial Epilepsy: Finally a solution! randres on Thu, 2013-02-21 - 15:09 Ladies, I have been researching this topic for the past two years. I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I hit puberty. At the time it was only Absence seizures. When I was in my second year of secondary school my mother decided she could cure me with herbs. She took me off of my AED cold turkey. It took about 5 days but eventually I had a severe tonic-clonic seizure. You could hear my doctor yelling at her all over the hospital!! I tell you this because it was my first experience with that sort of seizure. I came to and didn't even know my name. It took me the ride in the ambulance to start remembering...about 15 minutes. So, now I knew that an increase in Absence seizures led to a Tonic-clonic (it was my aura my neuro said). I went 25 years completely seizure free. Then the absence sz started again when I turned 42. I badgered 2 neuros (my original neuro and one closer to me) for over a year to do something. Every month on one day I was having non-stop Absence seizures which I knew would escalate. So, they tried changing my medication which resulted in the elimination of my short term memory so they changed it back. Then they suggested I \"up\" my medication 3 days prior to my anticipated problem day and continue at the increased dose for 3 days after. Well, that may have worked if I knew EXACTLY what day that was going to be but it moved around within a 3 day window. Finally, I had a tonic-clonic, fell down a flight of stairs, broke my nose and had a series of seizures which scared the doctors so much they mega-dosed me to keep me from going into Status (non-stop seizures). I took matters in my own hands to educate myself. My OB-GYN and I hashed out a scheme to shut down my ovaries because it was obvious to me that they were the problem - Seasonale. Any pill seems to work but I don't like being on them given my age and risk of heart attack, stroke and breast cancer. When you are on the pill your ovaries believe you are getting the hormones you need and don't bother working to their full extent. The REASON (while you are in peri-menopause) you want to shut them down is because the send out too much Estrongen and not enough Progesterone - they spike and trough (up and down) your hormones. Progesterone protects you from having seizures, Estrogen promotes seizures. So, I have found the answer is to get off the pill and take bio-identical progesterone. I am beginning my journey in the next month with a hormone specialist I have found. Ideally, a Neuro-Endocrinologist would be best but it's impossible to find one. The Bio-identical hormone specialists are a challenge as well because Epilepsy is not exactly (in their minds) something they want to mess around with. It's tough even when you know the answer to your problem - no one will listen or take the risk. My most amazing neuro was Dr. Warren T. Blume - he always said to me, \"it doesn't matter what anyone else says, you know your body, listen to it.\" Cheers and best wishes! Ladies, I have been researching this topic for the past two years.
