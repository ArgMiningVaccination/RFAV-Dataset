CHRIST OPHE ARCH AMBA ULT/AFP/GE TTY IM AGES After cor onavirus v accine failur es, France laments the state of its biomedical R&D By Tania Rabesandr atana Apr. 21, 2021 , 4:15 Januar y, as F rance 's thir d pandemic wa ve gather ed for ce, Christ ophe d'Enf ert, scienti\u0000c dir ector of the P asteur Institute, appear ed on national T V with a grim duty: explaining how the v ener able institute, named after v accine pioneer Louis P asteur , had giv en up on its most adv anced CO VID-19 v accine candidate. Around the same time, F rench drug giant Sano\u0000 said its own contenders wer e dela yed\u2014and that it would cut hundr eds of F rench jobs. T oday, France r emains the only nation on the U.N. Security Council without a viable v accine. T o d'Enf ert, it \"brings int o question our capacity not only t o do v ery high-le vel fundamental resear ch, but also t o transform this int o inno vation. \" The high-pr o\u0000le failur es ha ve cast a spotlight on the problems facing biomedicine in F rance. Although no one failur e could ha ve been pr edicted, the pattern \"is not just bad luck, \" says A udrey V\u00e9zian, a sociologist of biomedicine at CNRS, F rance 's national r esear ch center , in L yon. \"It shows that something isn 't workingScience 's extensiv e CO VID-19 coverage is fr ee to all r eaders.

V \u00e9zian also blames a pr oliferation of bureaucr atic or ganizations that waste r esour ces and add confusion. Margaret Kyle, an economist at Mines P arisT ech graduate school who coauthor ed a Januar y study b y the Council of E conomic Analysis (CAE), a go vernment advisor y body , says France ought t o be well-positioned to do biomedical r esear ch\u2014and t o commer cializ e it. Its education system churns out talented scientists, and it has a national health car e system, which provides data that can be deplo yed in medical resear ch. But r ecent analyses paint a pictur e of long- term er osion in public biomedical inv estment. The CAE study found that public spending on biology and health r esear ch has shrunk dr amatically since 2011, even as it gr ew in Germany and the United Kingdom (see char t, below). Bruno Canar d, a structur al biologist who studies coronaviruses at CNRS in Marseille, has f elt that decline \u0000rsthand. F or instance, he sa ys, F rance only has thr ee of the cr yo-electr on micr oscopes (cr yo- EMs) that can r eveal molecular structur es lik e that of the cor onavirus at near-at omic r esolution; Germany and the United Kingdom each ha ve about two do zen. And F rance 's national r esear ch funding agency , set up in 2005 t o provide competitiv e project-based funding, has seen its budgets dr op . Emer gency CO VID- 19 t o \u0000ow , which Canar d says has r eturned his lab 's budget t o 2003 le vels. But by the time pandemic funds wer e available, he sa ys, \"Chinese teams, among others, had alr eady published the \u0000rst cr yo-EM papers in Science , Cell, and Natur e.\" Biotech star tups, critical in pharmaceutical inno vation, are also less well funded in F rance than in its European peers. F unding thr ough F rance 's public investment bank (BPI) and tax r ebates can be gener ous in the early stages of business de velopment, but priv ate funding is t oo sparse t o enable enough companies t o grow signi\u0000cantly at later stages.
