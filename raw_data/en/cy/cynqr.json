With this third annual assessment of AEFIs reported in Ontario we aim to provide relevant and timely information about the safety of vaccines administered in the province to support health care professionals, reassure the public and build confidence in immunization. AEFIs reported following vaccines administered between January 1 and December 31, 201 4, were extracted from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). There were 568 reports of confirmed AEFIs representing an reporting rate of 4. 2 per 100 000 population . This rate w as slightly lower compared to the previous two years however an overall increasing trend since 2010 was observed . The AEFI reporting rate relative to population size in Ontario also continues to be lower than the national AEFI reporting rate, although some vaccine -specific rates are more comparable, such as those delivered primarily in school- based settings ( e.g. 24.1 vs. 23.7 per 100 000 doses distributed of Men -C-ACWY in O ntario vs. Canada, respectively ). The age -specific reporting rate varies by age with the highest reporting rate in infants less than one year of age (24.4 per 100,000 population). A female predominance in AEFI reports continues to be observed, particularly in adults 18 to 64 years of age where the female:male reporting rate ratio was 7.1. The highest vaccine -specific reporting rate was observed for Men -C-ACWY and HPV4, both of which are sc hool -based vaccination programs (24.1 and 20.0 per 100 000 dose distributed, respectively). The most frequently reported events overall were pain, rednes s or swelling at the injection site; rash and allergic skin reactions ( 40.3 %, 22. 4% and 1 5.7% of reports, respectively). The majority of events (74. 6%) were completely recovered at the time of reporting. There were 2 3 serious AEFIs , including 22 following publicly funded vaccines for a serious reporting rate of 2.6 per million doses distributed . This report finds that vaccines administered in Ontario in 2014 resulted in a low rate of report ed adverse events. Results were generally consistent with the previous two years with continued improvements in data quality. Most reported events were mild (e. g., injection site reactions) and resolved completely. No unexpected safety issues were identified . Under -reporting of AEFI s continues to be an important limitation of passive vaccine safety surveillance in Ontario. Further research is needed to evaluate health professionals' awareness and practices regarding reporting of AEFIs and inform strategies to increase AEFI reporting for a more robust provincial vaccine safety surveillance system. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 2 Background Canada has long been recognized as having one of the best vaccine safety systems in the world.1,2 Vaccines are rigorously tested and reviewed for safety and efficacy prior to being authorized for use and are also closely monitored after aut horization to ensure their continued safe use in the population. The success of this system is made possible by communication and coordination across multiple stakeholders including g overnment regulators, vaccine industry, public health officials, health c are providers , and members of the public. Public health surveillance of adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) is a cornerstone of the vaccine safety system in Canada. Individual case reports of AEFI s to public health authorities provide an important source of data which can identify previously unrecognized or rare AEFIs or an increase in frequency or severity of known AEFIs which can be further evaluated. 3 In addition, surveillance of AEFIs by public health provides valuable information to support and inform immunization program planning and evaluation . AEFIs are generally reported to public health by either health care providers, vaccine recipients or their caregivers. In Ontario, health care provider reporting to the local public health unit (PHU) is mandated by provincial public health legislation. PHUs play a central role as the pri mary recipients of AEFI reports , who investigate and document for the purposes of provincial surveillance. They also provide information, support and advice to vaccine recipients or their parents and health care providers in their community. Public Health Ontario (PHO) conducts provincial AEFI su rveillance and participates in the national AEFI surveillance system maintained by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).4 Ontario's AEFI surveillance objectives are to : Identify and investigate serious or unexpected occurrences of AEFIs, particularly for new vaccines Detec t and investigate safety signals (e.g., lot -specific problems) Estimate provincial rates of reported AEFIs by vaccine Report to stakeholders on the safety of publicly funded vaccines in Ontario Maintain public confidence in vaccine programs Ontario has made great strides in strengthening provincial AEFI surveillance processes in the recent years. Several key initiatives have been implemented to support provincial surveillance objectives including: revised provincial case definitions for AEFIs5, enhanced surveillance guidelines6 and forms7-9, improved training and resources for public health un its (PHUs ) and information for health care providers .10 While t hese initiatives have contributed to a renewed focus on AEFI surveillance and What is an AEFI? An AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence that follows immunization and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, laboratory finding, symptom, or disease.3 Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 3 prelim inary improvements in AEFI data quality , work is ongoing to monitor the impact of changes and plan new initiatives to further engage system stakeholders, particularly health care providers who administer immunizations. As immunization issues continue to dominate public and media discourse -from high profile outbreaks of vaccine preventable disease s11-13 to the ongoing debate about mandatory vaccination14,15 - now more than ever, open and transparent information about vaccine safety is vitally important to ensuring the continued success of immunization programs. With this 3rd annual report on vaccine safety in On tario we aim to provide relevant and timely information about the safety of vaccines administered in the province to support health care professionals, reassure the public and build confidence in immunization . Report o bjectives and scope This report will summarize AEFIs reported in Ontario following vaccines administered in 201 4. In addition, reporting trends will be assessed by comparison with AEFI s report ed following vaccines administered between 2010 and 201 3. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 4 Methods Reports of AEFIs are investigated by PHUs and entered into the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), the electronic reporting system for reportable diseases and events in Ontar io. AEFI reports are required to be reported in iPHIS according t o provincial protocols, bulletins and directives issued by the Ministry of Health & Long -Term Care ( MOHLTC ).5,16 The minimum dat a elements for each AEFI report are specified in the iPHIS AEFI User Guide (2015 ).6 In preparation for this report, PHUs participated in a formal data clean -up initiative between March 9 and April 17 , 2015 , to update missing or incomplete information for AEFIs reported following vaccines administered in 2014 . For more detailed information about AEFI surveillance system roles and processes please see the Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2012 . Analysis of epidemiologic data We extracted all reports of AEFIs with a vaccine administration date between January 1 and December 31, 2014, from iPHIS on May 1, 201 5. AEFI reports were classified as \" confirmed \" or \" does not meet definition \" (DNM) case classification according to provincial surveillance case definitions .5 Confirmed Any reported event (listed in section 5.0 - Clinical Evidence , of the provincial surveillance case definitions ) in a vaccine recipient which follows immunization which cannot be clearly attributed to other causes. A causal relationship with the administration of the vaccine d oes not need to be proven . Does not meet definition (DNM) Any reported event in a vaccine recipient which follows immunization which has been clearly attributed to other causes. Temporal trends were presented by year of vaccine administration and inclu ded reports between 2010 and 2013. AEFI data from 2010 and 2013 were extracted from iPHIS on the same day as the 2014 data. Case counts for historical data will differ slightly than presented in previous reports 17,18 due to delayed reporting and data entry of adverse events after these reports were completed. Descriptive analys es were limited to \" confirmed\" reports following vaccines administered in 2014. Age categories for analysis were based on key age milestones within the provincial immunization schedule (<1 year, 1 -3 years, 4 -10 years, 11- 17 years, 18 -64 years, 65+) .19 The AEFI reporting source is the source of the in itial AEFI report to the PHU and not necessarily the only source of information in the AEFI investigation. Reporting source categories presented were mutually exclusive (i.e. , physicians are a separate category from other health professionals which include s nurses and pharmacists ). Proportions are based on reports with completed data and therefore will vary by iPHIS field. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 5 The term \"vaccine\" refers to a generic active immunizing agent and include s one or more vaccine product s (e.g. , \"influenza vaccine\" refers to all influenza vaccine products). Standard acronyms for vaccines are used in this report as per the Glossary (e.g., MMR for measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine ). For a list of vaccine abbreviations and corresponding product s and trade names s ee Appendix 1. Each AEFI report includes one or more adverse events temporally associated with receipt of one or more vaccines administered at the same time (i.e., during the same day) . Adverse events have been presented both individually and by categories as per the provincial surveillance case definitions .5 All rashes following live virus vaccines were reviewed to determine the proportion that occurred within the expected time to onset for rash associated with receipt of a live virus vaccine. For the purposes of this analysis, we have typically used a range of 5-42 day s which is consistent with provincial surveillance definitions which include temporal criteria for reporting of rash following live vaccines.5 Serious AEFIs are defined based u pon International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2A and E2D guidelines20,21 adapted for public health surveillance of AEFI s in Canada by PHAC .22 Serious AEFI A serious AEFI (SAE) is one that results in death, is life -threatening, requires in -patient hospitalization or prolo ngation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . Of note, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly/birth defect were not systematically c aptured in provincial surveillance data due to the relatively brief follow -up period . Other important medical events that do not otherwise meet the above definition of serious are presented separately in the report and include the following: anaphylaxis, encephalitis, acute disseminated and thrombocytopenia. Events managed as anaphylaxis were assessed using the Brighton Collaboration case definition and diagnostic levels of certainty .23 We calculated population -based AEFI rep orting rates using Ontar io population estimates24 and projections25 for 2010- 2013 and 2014, respectively. Vaccine -specific reporting rates for publicly funded universal vaccines ( i.e., excluding travel and publi cly funded high risk -only vaccines) were calculated based on vaccine distribution data provided by the Ontario Government Pharmaceutical and Medical Supply Service (OGPMSS). These estimates were adjusted for wast ed or reusable vaccine returned to OGPMSS. Reporting rates by provider type were estimated using a combined vaccine -specific reporting rate for specific age categories and vaccines which are primarily delivered by one provider type (e.g. , primary care providers - infant/toddler vaccines, PHUs - school -based vaccines) . We performed statistical analyses using SAS version 9.3 and Microsoft Excel 2010. This project was reviewed on behalf of the PHO Ethics Review Board (ERB) through the administrative review process and was granted approval for a period of one year commencing May 16, 201 5. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 6 Notes on interpretation The adverse events we describe in this report were temporally associated and not necessarily causally linked to vaccine s. Our assessment was based on iPHIS data only and not comprehensive chart review. We provide d reporting rate estimates for comparison to other passive surveillance systems and monitoring reporting trends over time ; they should not be interpreted as incidence rates. Trends in reported AEFIs are influenced by changes to the publicly funded program. Table 1 identifies program changes in recent years that may impact AEFI surveillance data presented in this report .19,26 Table 1. Changes to the publicly funded immunization programs in Ontario (2010 -2014) Time period Vaccine program changes December 2014 Meningococcal B vaccine for high risk children aged 2 months to 17 years Meningococcal ACYW vaccine ; for high risk individuals 9 months to 55 years of age ; booster doses and expanded high risk criteria Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for all adults 18 years of age, regardless of whether Tdap was received in adolescence Pneumoc occal conjugate 13 for high risk individuals 50 years of age September 2012 Extended HPV4 vaccine eligibility until the end of grade 12 for girls who didn't receive or complete the three- dose HPV immunization series in Grade 8. April 2012 Replacement for the 4 - to 6-year -old booster dose October 2011 New influenza vaccine products implemented for the 2011 -12 influenza season including Fluad\u00ae (for high -risk persons 65 yea rs of age and older) and Agriflu\u00ae for all those aged six months and older, as well as a full dose of trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) for infants and children 6 to 35 months of age and removal of egg allergy as a contraindication to TIV August 2011 Rotavirus vaccine (Rot -1/Rotarix\u00ae) for infants at ages two and four months Routine second dose of varicella vaccine administered as the combined agent MMRV at four to six years of age (previously second dose of MMR vaccine was administered at 18 months of age) Second dose varicella vaccine catch -up program for children born on or after January 1, 2000, and at least four years of age Pertussis vaccine for all adults 19 to 64 years of age who have not received an adolescent booster at 14 to 16 years of age November 2010 Reduction from four to three doses of pneumococcal conjugate 13 -valent (Pneu -C- 13) vaccine for low -risk children Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 7 Results There were 645 AEFI s reported in iPHIS where the date of vaccination was between January 1 and December 31, 2014. Of these, 568 (88.1%) had a case class ification of \" confirmed\" and 77 (11.9%) had a case classification of DNM. Reporting trends The population -based reporting rate of \" confirmed\" AEFIs following vaccines administered in Ontario in 2014 was 4.2 per 100 ,000 population. This is lower relative to the 2012 and 2013 reporting rates (5.0 per 100,000 population in both years). However, reporting rates between 2012 and 2014 have increased (31.6% increase for 2012 and 2013, and 10. 5% for 2014) compared to the average annual reporting rate of 3.8 per 100,000 population in 2010 and 2011 (3.7 and 3.9 per 100,000 population , respectively) (Figure 1) . The increasing trend in reporting rate from 2010 to 20 14 is statistically significant (p <0.05). Figure 1. Number of AEFI reports and reporting rate in Ontario, by year, 2010- 14 Notes: 1. AEFI counts are accurate as of May 1, 2015. 2. Delayed reports accounted for a 7.1% increase of the total number of confirmed AEFIs in 2012, and a 5.5% increase of the total number of confirmed AEFIs in 2013. Delayed reports accounted for a <1% increase of the total number of confirmed AEFIs in 2010 and 2011. 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.0 0100200300400500600700800 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Reporting rate per 100 000 population Number of AEFI reports Year Confirmed AEFIs Reporting rate of confirmed AEFIs Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 8 The proportion of all reports classified as \" confirmed\" (relative to all case classifications) has stabilized in 2014 (88.1%) following an increasing trend between 2010 and 2013 (78.7%, 77.6%, 84.9% and 88.8% respectively ). The proportion of reports classified as \"confirmed\" by PHU in 2014 ranged from 55.2% to 100% . All subsequent analyses are lim ited to AEFI reports classified as \" confirmed.\" Reports of AEFI s by month o f vaccine administration in 2014 range d from a low of 2 3 reports in July to a peak of 91 and 95 reports in October and November , respectively. Smaller peaks in AEFI reporting were observed in January and April. This overall trend is similar to previous years and generally mirrors the monthly distributio n of vaccine by OGPMSS; however the peak monthly volume of AEFI reports and vaccine distribution decre ased in 2014 compared to previous years (Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Number of AEFI reports and publicly funded vaccine distrib ution1 in Ontario, by month, 2012 - 14 Notes: 1.

The age- specific reporting rates were higher among younger age groups, with the highest reporting rate in infants less than one year. The age- specific reporting rates for infants under one and children 4- to 10 -years old have decreased between 2012 and 2 014 (from 29.9 to 24.4 and 12.3 to 6.2 per 100,000 population , respectively), while the rate for 1- to 3- year olds has increase d over the same time period from 19.3 to 22.4 per 100,000 population (Figure 3). Figure 3. AEFI reporting rate per 100,000 population in Ontario, by age group, 2012 -14 Notes: 1. One report was excluded from the figure due to missing age. AEFI reports by sex continues to be weighted towards females (68.8% of all reports ), with female predominance primarily among adults 18 - to 64 -years of age ( reporting rate ratio: 7.1 ) followed by adolescents 11 - to 17 -years of age and those 65 years of age and older ( reporting rate ratio s: 2.2 and 1.8, respectively ) (Figure 4). For the 11- to 17 -year -olds, it should be noted that there is one publicly funded vaccination program that targets only female adolescents (HPV4 vaccine ); therefore we would expect more AEFI reports among females in this age group . 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.0 2012 2013 2014Reporting rate per <1 1-3 4-10 11-17 18-64 65+ Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 10 Figure 4.

Reporting source Among AEFIs with reporting source completed (94.5%; n= 537) the most frequent reporting sources were other healthcare professionals (e.g., nurses, pharmacists) who reported 34.5% of AEFIs, followed by physicians (27.2%), family members (15.3%), and self -reports (8.6%). The proportion of AEFIs reported by physicians has steadily decreased , while the proportion reported by other health care professionals has increased and replaced physicians as the most frequent reporting source (Figure 000 population Number of AEFI Reports Age (years) Male Count Female Count Male Rate Female Rate Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 11 Figure 5.

Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 13 Vaccines There were 568 AEFI reports temporally associated with 26 different vaccines in 2014. Most reports were associated with administration of a single vaccine ( 81.2%), while 10.7% of reports were associated with receipt of two vaccines and 8 .1% were a ssociated with the receipt of three or more vaccines. There were 51 4 AEFI reports associated with vaccines that are included within the publicly funded immunization program. As seen in Table 3, the highest overall vaccine -specific reporting rates in 2014 were observed with Men -C-ACWY and HPV4, both of which are school -based immunization programs . The lowest reporting rates were observed for Td and MMRV . There was some fluctuation in v accine - specific reporting rates in 2014 compared t o 2013, most notably was an increase in Tdap and decreases in MMRV and Tdap -IPV, both of which had relatively few reports in 2014 .

As a result, a vaccine -specific reporting rate for DTaP -IPV could not be calculated. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 15 Adverse events Adverse events were recorded in 99. 6% (n=566) of reports. Of those reports with a recorded adverse event, most were associated with one event ( 70.1%), while 24.7% of reports were associated with two events and 5 .1% were associated with three or more adverse events. The most frequently reported events were pain , redness or swellin g at the injection site (40.3% of reports ; n=228), followed by rash (22.4%; n=127), and allergic reactions of the skin in (15.7%; n=89) (Figure 6).

R outine ly administered vaccines with the highest reporting rate for injection site reactions were Pneu -P-23, Var and Tdap (10.8, 9.1, 7.8 per 100,000 doses distributed, respectively). The next most frequently reported event was rash which was present in 22.4% of reports (n=127) . The highest rash reporting rate for routine ly administered vaccines was MMR , Men -C-C and Var ( 12.5, 10.6 , 5.7 per 100,000 vaccine -specific doses distributed, respectively). Nearly half of all rash reports (42.5%, n=54) were associated with live virus vac cines ( MMR, Var and Zos). There were no rashes reported following MMRV. Rashes occurred with in 5 to 42 days (i.e., the expected time to onset range for live virus vaccines ) for 53.3% (n= 8), 55.9% Zos vaccines , respectively. There were 7 rashes reported following MMR vaccine where vaccine -strain measles virus was identified, as well as one lab -confirmed vaccine strain zoster infection following varicella vaccine.

Adverse event categories represent groupings of specific types of adverse events and are not mutually exclusive. For category totals, reports with more than one specific event within a category are counted only once. Thus category totals will not sum to th e total specific adverse events overall or within a category. 2. Includes only those adverse events where the count was at least one . For a complete list of possible values in iPHIS and corresponding definitions, please refer to Appendix 1 . 3. Each AEFI report may contain one or more specific adverse events which are not mutually exclusive. 4. Percentages will not sum to 100%. The denominator is the total number of confirmed AEFI reports with at least one adverse event reported. The total number of confirmed AEFI reports was 566 (t wo reports had missing adverse events and were therefore excluded) . 5. Medically important events . The frequency of reporting of specific events in 2014 was similar to 20 12 and 2013 ( See Appendix 3 ). Of note, the number of reported neurologic events declined in 2014 (3.5%, n=20) relative to 2013 (5.2%, n=35). The frequency of reporting of \"Other severe/unusual events\" remains decrease d from 19.2% (n=130) in 2012 to 14.3% in both 2013 and 2014 (n=81, n=97 respectively) . There were 12 AEFIs reported which included \"medically important events\" representing 2.1% of all reports. One event (meningitis) also met the definition of a serious AEFI and is therefore described below. The remaining 11 were reported as \"events managed as anaphylaxis \" all of which were following publicly funded vaccines . The reporting rate using all publicly funded vaccine doses distributed in 2014 as the denominator was 1.3 per million doses distributed . Upon further assessment, s ix (54.5%) reports met the Brighton definition of anaphylaxis (four level II and t wo level III). Among the remaining reports, four were managed as anaphylaxis (i.e., epinephrine administered) but had insufficient documented evidence to meet the Brighton definition and one was clearly not anaphylaxis. The proportion of anaphylaxis reports that met Brighton definition increased in 2014 (54.5%) compared with 2012 and 2013 (33.3%, 31.3% respectively) . Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 18 Health care utilization and outcome In reports with health care utilization information completed, out -patient medic al consultation was sought in 72. 4% (4 02/555), while 20.5% (1 16/565) had an emergency room visit and 3.9 % (2 2/557) were admitted to hospital. Outcome information was completed in 93.5% (n=5 31) of reports in 2014 , which has steadily increased since 2012 (91.6% in 2013 and 88.2% in 2012). The majority (74.6%; n=396 ) were recovered at the time of reporting and 22.8% were not yet recovered but likely to recover, as per the outcome definitions in the iPHIS User Guide .6 In a very small proportion of AEFI reports ( 2.4%; n=1 3) the outcome was reported as \"residual effects\" which refers to residual disability or sequelae related to the reported event . After case -level review of these reports , none met the definition of \"residual effects\" per the iPHIS User Guide or the \"persistent/significant disability/incapacity\" criterion as part of the definition of serious AEFI (See Methods ). In addition, there was one report of death, which is des cribed below (See Serious AEFI ). Serious AEFI There were 2 3 reports of AEFI s that were classified as serious , representing 4.0% (2 3/568) of all reports and a serious AEFI reporting rate of 0.17 per 100,000 population or 0.2 6 per 100,000 doses distributed1. The proportion of AEFIs defined as serious has remained stable since 2012 (4.1% and 4.6%, respectively). All but one of the serious reports in 2014 was admitted to hospital for a mean length o f stay of 3.9 days . There was a report of a death following immunization which did not occur in the hospital (see below for further information). The majority of serious AEFIs (82.6%) were under 18 years of age , and 2 1.7% were less than one year of age . There were eight serious AEFIs that were documented as reported by IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program Active)2, ranging in age from 4 months - to 3-years old. Two thirds (65.2%) of all serious AEFIs were 4 years of age or younger. Outcome information was available for all 2 3 serious reports. T he majority ( 69.6%; n=1 6) were recovered , four were not yet recovered (defined as an event that is likely to resolve, but is not resolved at the time the AEFI report is closed), two were classified as having residual effects, and one was deceased (see below for further information). It should also be noted that there were no notable differences in the distribution of outcomes between serious and non -serious AEFIs. The highest vaccine -specific serious reporting rates w ere for Men -C-C, Pneu -C-13 and Rot -1 (3.7, 2.3, 1.9 per 100,000 doses distributed, respectively). There were five publicly funded vaccines not associated 1 The latter serious reporting rate is calculated using combined , net publicly funded doses distributed as the denominator. The numerator includes all serious AEFI following publicly funded vaccines (n=22). One serious AEFI following YF has been exclude d from the serious rate calculation as it is a privately funded vaccine for which doses distributed is unavailable. 2 IMPACT is Canada's Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive, is a paediatric hospital -based national active surveillance network for adverse events following immu nization, vaccine failures and selected infectious diseases that are, or will be, vaccine preventable. IMPACT is administered by the Canadian Paediatric Society with funding from the Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases at the Public Health Agency of Canada and has sites in Ontario at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa. http://www.cps.ca/en/impact Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 19 with any serious AEFIs in 2014. The most frequent ly reported events among serious AEFIs were fever (n=8) (which by definition is only reportable in conjunction with another reportable event) followed by \"Other events\" (n= 6), rash (n= 6) and cellulitis (n=5). The following is a summary of all serious AEFI reports based on case -level review of all information entered in iPHIS, including case notes . Seven reports of fever/rash illness including three diagnosed as Kawasaki disease and one lab - confirmed vaccine -strain measles infection : age range 6 - to 17 -months of age Five reports of cellulitis , two following Pneu -P-23 vaccine, two Var and one Inf; age range 2- to 5-years old Four reports of seizures; two diagnosed seizure disorders, one diagnosed as infantile spasms, one febrile seizure : age range 2 months - to 3-years old Two severe injection site reactions in adults with concurrent conditions requiring hospitalization One report of aseptic meningitis in an infant One report of optic neuritis in an adolescent following HB and Men -ACWY One report of rhabdomyolysis (in the injected arm) in an a dult following rabies vaccine One report of possible vaccine -associated encephalitis in an adult following yellow fever vaccine In addition, there was one report of death in an infant four days after receipt of DTaP -IPV-Hib, Pneu -C- 13 and Rot -1 vaccines. A coroner's investigation was completed which found the cause of death to be unascertained, with unsafe sleep environment as a contributing factor. No link with vaccine was reported. Risk factors Among all reports , 14.6% (n=83 ) had risk factor informatio n completed in iPHIS , which is slightly increased compared to 2013 when risk factors were completed in 13.6% of reports . Similar to previous years, t he most frequently reported risk factor in 2014 was \"Chronic illness/und erlying medical condition\" reported in 68.7% (n=57) of reports with risk factors completed, followed by zation program error\" (8.4%; n=7) and \"Immunocompromised\" (6.0%; n=5). Table 5 describes AEFIs in which an immunization program error was reported. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 20 Table 5.

No unexpected safety issues were identified as a result of this analysis and findings were generally consistent with the previous two reports with continued improvements in data quality. The information presented contributes to the safety profile of vaccines administered in Ontario , and provide s relevant and timely information about the safety of vaccines administered in the province to support health care professionals, reassure the public and build confidence in immunization. The following discussion is based upon analysis of AEFI information entered into iPHIS that were temporally associated with vaccines. A causality assessment or assessment of case information beyond what is available within iPHIS has not been completed. Rep orting rate estimates should not be interpreted as incidence rates, but are used for comparison purposes and monitoring over time. The provincial AEFI reporting rate was lower in 2014 following two y ears of increasing rates ; however , the overall increasing trend in the annual AEFI reporting rate since 2010 remains statistically significant. Reasons for the decrease in 2014 are likely multifactorial, however there were notable decreases in AEFIs following vaccines which typically contribute a high proportion of reports overall (i.e. , Inf and Pneu -P-23). In addition, changes to provincial AEFI surveillance definitions made on January 1, 2013 may be continuing to influence AEFI reporting in 2014 due to increasing awareness and incorporation of the changes into routine PHU reporting practice . Many of the revised AEFI definitions increased the specificity which could reduce the overall numbe r of reports that meet provincial reporting criteria. There were some continued improvements in the quality and completeness of AEFI surveillance data in 2014. For example, completeness of the reporting source field in iPHIS continued to increase from 91.4% and 92.0% in 2012 and 2013 respectively, to 94.6% in 2014. Other data fields which showed initial improvements in completeness between 2012 and 2013, levelled off in 2014. For example the proportion of reports classified as \" confirmed\" remained the same in 2014 (88.1%) after increasing from 84.9% to 88.4% b etween 2012 and 2013. The increase in 2013 is most likely the result of revised provincial surveillance definitions which clarified that a \" confirmed\" AEFI requires only a temporal and not causal association between a vaccine and an adverse event and exclu des only reports with a clear, alternative diagnosis . In addition, for the past three years, PHO has reviewed all AEFIs on a weekly basis to ensure that they are classified appropriately and requested revisions from PHUs where indicated. Continued monitor ing and follow -up over the next few years will confirm whether the proportion of reports classified as \" confirmed\" has stabilized or if further increases are possible. The provincial AEFI reporting rate in 2014 continues to be lower in comparison to the national reporting rate. A higher overall reporting rate is an indicator of a robust passive vaccine safety surveillance system , where the quantity of AEFI reports establish a clear historical baseline to help identify future vaccine safety signals. The mo st recently published population -based AEFI reporting rate for Canada from 2012 is 10.1 per 100,000 population 22, which is more than double Ontario's 2014 rate of 4.2 per Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 22 100,000 population. The disparity between the n ational and provincial reporting rates is even more pronounced for serious AEFIs where the national population -based reporting rate is over three times the provincial population -based rate (0.60 vs. 0.17 per 100,000 population , respectively). While public ly funded immunization schedules 27and administration practices 28 are relatively similar across the country, immunization program delivery models as well as other health system factors which have the potential to influence AEFI reporting rates can vary widely between jursidictions . For example, in Ontario, one factor that may be influencing the AEFI reporting rat e is under -reporting by health care professionals.18 Our a nalysis further explores this finding, showing that the rate of AEFI reporting within primary care -delivered (infant & toddler) immunization programs is much l ower compared to PHU- delivered (school -based) programs . Looking at school -based programs only, which are primarily delivered by PHUs, Ontario's reporting rates are much more comparable or higher than the national reporting rates22 (e.g. , 24.1 vs. 23.7 per 100 000 doses distributed of Men -C-ACWY in Ontario vs. Canada, respectively) . Additionally, comparison of reporting source and health care utilization data suggests that for at least some AEFI reports, medical consultation was sought, yet the event was not reported by a health care professional (74.2% sought medical consultation; 61.6% reported by a physician or other health care professional). The reasons for under -reporting of AEFI s, particularly by health care professionals are not yet fully understood in Ontario . However , surveys from other jurisdictions have identified barriers to health care professional reporting , which include lack of familiarity with the AEFI reporting process (i.e. , paper form) , uncertainty with who is responsible for reporting and unclear definitions of a reportable AEFI.29,30 Age-specific population -based reporting rates of AEFI were as expected, with the highest rates among the youngest age groups who receive the highest number of recommended vaccine doses (i.e. nine dose of vaccine by one year of age).19This is consistent with national AEFI data which shows a similar trend22. AEFI reporting by vaccine in 2014 was generally consistent with previous years with some fluctuations. The highest reporting rates were for vaccines delivered by PHUs within the schoo l-based program , which is consistent with related findings of higher reporting rates within PHU- delivered immunization programs. There were marked decreases in the 2014 reporting rate, compared to 2013 for some vaccines including: Pneu -P-23, Td, Tdap -IPV and MMRV. For Pneu -P-23, this decrease in reporting is mainly attributable to much lower reporting of injection site reactions following this vaccine in 2014 (n=26) compared to 2013 (n= 60 ). For Td, Tdap -IPV and MMRV, the reasons for the decrease are not clear althou gh these rates are prone to fluctuations due to a low volume of reports. Though not as dramatic in terms of magnitude, the influenza AEFI reporting rate has steadily decreased each year since 2012 (5.4, 4.4 and 3.3 per 100 000 in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively) but continues to have the highest volume of reports of any vaccine . The low rate of reporting for AEFIs following influenza vaccine is consistently observed within other AEFI surveillance systems31,32 including nationally where influenza vaccine has the lowest vaccine -specific AEFI reporting rate (8.5 per 100 000 doses distributed ). Injection site reactions were again, as expected, the most frequently reported events, present in 45% of all AEFI reports . However, for the first time in 2014, both the volume and rate of reporting of injections site reactions have decreased slightly (1.85 vs. 2.02 per 100 000 population in 2014 and 2013, respectively). This may suggest early impact of revised AEFI surveillance definitions which were in part Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 23 designed to reduce the reporting burden of these typically mild events that do not require any public health action. However, further monitoring of the trend over the next few years will be required to fully assess the impact of this change. In terms of other commonly reported events, rash was assessed in more detail for the first time in this report. As expected, a substantial proportion of rashes were reported following receipt of live virus vaccine s which are known to produce virus -like rashes , particularly after the first dose (5 -10% 3-5% for MMR and varicella vaccines , respectively) .33,34 Case level review found that up to half of all reported rashes following live virus vaccines (depending on the vaccine) occurred within the expected time to onset (5 to 42 days) while others occurred outside this timeframe and therefore may have been coincidental or related to other causes. Events managed as anaphylaxis were rarely reported in 2014, with a reporting rate slightly less than in 2013 (1.3 vs . 1.8 per million doses distributed ) but still within the range of exp ected rates which is between one and ten episodes per million vaccine doses administered .35 The proportion of anaphylaxis reports with adequate information to assess using the B righton case definition and diagnostic levels of certainty23 has steadily increased since 2012 (50.0 %, 56.3 % and 63.6% for 2012 , 2012 and 2014, respectively). This is likely the result of improved data entry guide lines, data quality initiatives and most recently , the implementation of an anaphylaxis reporting form in September of 2014 .8 This form addressed a recom mendation made in the 2012 vaccine safety report 17 for improved quality and completeness of anaphylaxis reporting in order to conduct systematic assessment using the Brighton case definitions. Serious AEFIs were rarely reported in 2014, at a reporting rate of 2. 6 serious AEFI s per million doses of vaccine distributed and t he proportion of AEFI reports that were serious was consistent with previous years. The most frequently reported serious events were febrile/rash illness and cellulitis requiring hospital admission for treatment with intravenous antibiotics - all recovered at the ti me of reporting . Other serious reports were rare events which have been assessed by the Institute of M edicine (IOM) and have not been causally linked to vaccines (E.g. infantile spasms,optic neuritis) .36 There was one report of possible vaccine -associated encephalitis in a hospitalized adult following yello w fever vaccine in which the individual recover ed fully . Yellow fever vaccine -associated neurotropic disease (YEL -AND) is a known but rare reaction which has been estimated to occur at a rate of between 0.4 and 0.8 per 100,000 doses distributed , although i t is higher for individuals 60 years of age .37 YEL-AND is a group of clinical syndromes that includes meningoencephalitis (neurotropic disease), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and acute bulbar palsy. 38 The reported death of an infant following receipt of routine vaccines was subject to a coroner's investigation and review by the Pediatric D eaths Under Five Committee of the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario which found the cause of death to be unascertained and the manner of death undetermined3, with unsafe sleep environment as a contributing factor. This event is included in this 3 Unascertained cause of death refers to the absence of any anatomic or toxiologic cause of death, while undetermined manner of death indicates that \"a full investigation has shown no evidence for any specific classification or there is equal evidence or a significant contest among two or more manners of death\" 54 http://www .mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca/stellent/groups/public/@mcscs/@www/@com/documents/webasset/ec167691.pdf Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 24 report as it meets the provincial AEFI definition of a confirmed case, which includes events that are temporally associate d with receipt of vaccine which cannot be clearly attributed to oth er causes.5 As noted previously, even ts described in this report are temporally and are not necessarily causally linked to vaccines. Temporal association of unexplained infant death with vaccines is not unexpected given that infant primary immunization schedules temporally coincide with the peak age (two to four months) for the incidence of unexplained infant death.39-41 While rare, these reports have been observed in previousl y in Ontario and other passive AEFI surveillance systems31,32,42,43 however no association has been found between vaccines and sudden infant deaths.43-52 Limitations One important limitation of this analysis is the lack of a population -based provincial immunization registry to estimate the number of individuals who were immunized or doses administered. This would enable estimation of AEFI incide nce rates by vaccine or event type. In lieu of this, AEFI reporting rates are estimated using either the entire population irrespective of immunization status or doses distributed as the denominator. D oses distributed are widely used in analyses of passive AEFI surveillance systems 22,53 and can be a reasonable proxy for doses administered for established programs with known vaccine wastage. When the amount of wastage is unknown and underestima ted, this can result in underestimates of reporting rates. When doses distributed are unknown (i.e. privately purchased vaccine is not included ), this can result in an overestimation of reporting rates. Additionally, in the context of new or discontinued vaccines/programs, the AEFI reporting rate using doses distributed as the denominator can be temporarily rendered invalid due to fluctuations in vaccine distribution caused by stockpiling or large returns of unused/expired doses. Other general limitations a re shared with other passive AEFI surveillance systems such as data quality, completeness and reporting bias including under -reporting, particularly for mild or common reportable events as well as stimulated (elevated) reporting which can occur in response to media coverage and subsequently increased public awareness.53 Additionally, the provincial AEFI surveillance system does not include an unimmunized group for comparison , therefore determining whether immunization is associated with an increased risk of a specific adverse event is not possible.53 Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 25 Conclusions The Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario is now in its third year, and has established a valuable mechanism to communicate the safety of vaccines administered in the province to support health care professionals, reassure the public and build confidence in immunization. This report finds that vaccines administered in Ontario in 2014 resulted i n a low rate of report ed adverse events. Most reported events were mild (i.e., injection site reactions) and resolved completely. No unexpected safety issues were identified. Under -reporting of AEFI s continues to be an important limitation of AEFI surveil lance in Ontario. F urther research to evaluate health professionals' awareness and practices regarding reporting of AEFIs is needed to inform strategies to increase AEFI reporting in order to contribute to a more robust provincial vaccine safety surveillan ce system.

For public health AEFI reporting in Canada, the definition of \" serious \" undertakes to be consistent with the ICH internationally accepted, regulatory definition, while interpreting 'hospitalization' in terms of Canadian realities. Thus an AEFI is considered \"serious \" when it: results in death, is life -threatening , defined as: o An event/reaction in which the patient was at real, rather than hypothetical, risk of death at the time of the event/reaction (includes: status epilepticus, status asthmaticus, cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest) , requires inpatient hospitali zation, defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria: o hospital stay lasting 24 hours based on known date/time of admission and discharge o hospital stay involving all or part of two consecutive days (i.e. , admission and discharge date are at least 1 day apart but specific time of admission is not specified)results in prolongation of existing hospitaliz ation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (if known at the time of reporting) , is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . Adverse Events of Special Importance (AESI) The ICH E2A and E2D guidelines also state that other situations, such as other important medical events that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above, should also be considered serious after applying medical and scientific judgment. Those \"other situations\" are open to interpretation and could vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For Canada, in an effort to promote uniformity in reporting practices across the country, a list of high priority AESI is recommended based on both the impact of the event on the individual as well as public concern. This list may be amended periodically based on emerging issues or generation of evidence that enables rejection of the hypothesis that vaccine and event are causally related. (e.g., autism, SIDS, and most recently Bell's Palsy). Annual Report on Vaccine Safety, 2014 35 The designated Adverse Events of Specia l Importance are: Anaphylaxis (Brighton Collaboration level 1 count <150 AND clinical signs/symptoms of spontaneous bleeding) Emerging signal event based on group consensus .

Adverse event categories represent groupings of specific types of adverse events and are not mutually exclusive. For category totals, reports with more than one specific event within a category are counted only once. Thus category totals will not be the sum to the total of specific adverse events overall or within a category. 2. Includes only those adverse events where the count was 1. For a complete list of possible values in iPHIS and corresponding definitions, please refer to Appendix 1. 3. These adverse event values were discontinued in iPHIS as of Jan uary 1, 2013. 4. These adverse event values were added in iPHIS as of Jan uary 1, 2013. 5. Medically important events 6. Data extracted from iPHIS on May 1, 2015. Each AEFI report may contain one or more specific adverse events which are not mutually exclusive. Percentages will not sum to 100%. The denominator is the total number of confirmed AEFI reports with at least one adverse event reported. The total number of confirm ed AEFI reports was 566 (t wo reports had missing adverse events and were therefore excluded), 676 (one report had missing adverse events and was therefore excluded), and 676 for 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.
