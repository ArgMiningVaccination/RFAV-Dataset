You're also protecting people around you who may be at risk for disease. Watch the [video: immunity and vaccines explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOzWoetMkqQ). Vaccines are made to meet the highest standards and are continually [tested for safety and effectiveness](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/publications/healthy-living/immunization-vaccine/vaccine-safety-poster-eng.pdf). Serious reactions to vaccines remains extremely rare. If you have questions after being vaccinated and attended a public health vaccination clinic, refer to the fact sheet provided to you. Video: Reporting side effects Common side effects Most individuals feel well after getting a vaccine. Like any medicine, vaccines can have side effects and they are usually mild. Some common side effects include: - Pain, swelling, or redness where the vaccine was given - Mild fever - Headache - Tiredness - Muscle or joint aches These symptoms typically mean the vaccine is working to produce protection. Common side effects don't have to be reported. If your symptoms worsen, contact your health care provider or go to the closest hospital. Rare side effects In very rare cases, an individual may have a more serious reaction. After vaccination, pay close attention for any of the following symptoms or reactions. - Rash or hives - Seizures - Fever higher than 40 C (104 F) - Shortness of breath, wheezing or tightness in throat - Facial swelling - Joint pain or stiffness - Increased swelling that lasts four days or longer, or reaches beyond nearest joint - Severe vomiting or diarrhea - Any other unusual or unexpected event What to do if you're concerned If you're concerned about how you or someone you're caring for looks or feels after a vaccine: - Call your health care provider; or - If you don't have a health care provider for non-emergency situations, see [list of health care providers accepting new patients](/health/find-a-doctor.aspx) - Call 911 or go to the closest hospital for urgent and emergency situations Report adverse events (health effects after vaccination) Vaccine safety is taken very seriously in Canada. Reporting an adverse event is important to ensure continued safety of vaccines. An [adverse event following immunization](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/a/2020/annual-vaccine-safety-report-infographic-2019.pdf?la=en) is: - An unwanted or unexpected health effect that happens after someone receives a vaccine - A health effect that may or may not be caused by the vaccine Health care providers who administer vaccines are required by law to report adverse events following immunization. As a parent / legal guardian, you should also report adverse events following immunization to the health care provider who gave your child the vaccine. For information specific to children and adverse events, see the [adverse events following immunization fact sheet for parents](https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/immunization/docs/hcp_fact_sheets_safety.pdf). Not all reactions are considered reportable adverse events. Most reportable adverse events must be diagnosed by a physician. Some adverse events may need medical treatment. We recommend and encourage individuals to have the [adverse event form](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/a/2020/aefi-reporting-form.pdf?la=en) filled out by a health care provider. Otherwise, individuals can complete the adverse event form themselves for any adverse events that do not need physician diagnosis and submit the report to the Vaccine Preventable Disease program at Niagara Region Public Health. - Fax: To ensure secure transmission, fax the completed form to 905-688-8225 - Email: If you're unable to fax, email the completed form to aefi@niagararegion.ca.
