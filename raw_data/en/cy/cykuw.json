Robert Lee Williams, II Robert Lee Williams, II was the creator of the Black Intelligence Test of Cultural Homogeneity, an intelligence test specifically oriented towards Black experiences, language, and culture.

White is sometimes referred to as \"the father of Black psychology.\" He wrote the groundbreaking article \"Toward a Black Psychology,\" which is credited as being the first-ever strengths-based (rather than deficit-based) evaluation and description of Black behavior and culture.

He also helped found the Association of Black Psychologists as well as the Black Studies program at San Francisco State University in 1968.
