For someone who has sensitive skin, it's the only bar that cleanses and not dry up my face. The bar is long lasting which makes it worthy of the investment. Highly recommended! Agatha C. This product is wonderful! my blackheads are practically gone and my skin is incredibly soft and silky! This is an investment in your skin that really pays off!! Carson Takes off makeup with one use and leave my skin clean. Sam My pores look much smaller and lot less irritated. Love this product! Christina Worth the money and lasts forever. Dil The best cleanser I've ever used. The best cleanser I've ever used and worth every penny! This bar lasts a long time and the results are amazing. It takes off my makeup and cleans my skin so well. I've also noticed my age spots, not only on my face but also on my hand, are fading after I started using this cleaner. Highly recommend it! Trish Andrew Smooth, silky skin! I love how smooth and silky my skin feels after I use this. It is the first soap I've ever used that actually helps to get rid of blackheads. A great product! Brittany No more blackheads and white heads. Yayyy! Eleanor H. I've been using the soap for about a week or two. There's something very soothing about the combination of ingredients. My skin feels baby soft and I've noticed a visible reduction in dryer patches on my forehead and less weather damage across my cheek bones. I would recommend this to anyone looking for something less abrasive than regular brands. Katie S The best cleanser I've every used! I have been using this product for about a year and a half and I love that I can now order it through Amazon. With very sensitive skin I have found no issues while using this cleanser. It keeps my skin clean while also taking off my makeup with no hassle. My husband loves it too! I highly recommend giving it a try! Mer B Suds are Thicker than any bar soap I've used. Smells so good. Like the title said, I was really surprised how thick/smooth the soap goes on when you suds it up. It doesn't leave that dry feeling on your skin when you wash it off. Feels more moisturized. Also I can't get enough of the smell..love it. This works really well on getting my makeup off, which is probably my favorite part. Ashely Never thought I would like bar soap. I'm hooked after trying this black bar. My skin feels so clean. Liz I use this on my face and body. It has helped with my body acne a lot. Paul Starita Great product! Got this for my wife and she loves it Lauren Best product for teen acne! Can't recommend this product enough. Megan Can't go without this. It's a family favorite. Jodi One of my friends recommended this bar and I was skeptical. Boy was I surprised. Love this product now. becky r. My husband and I both love to use this bar. I love how it removes all of my makeup without drying my skin or burning my eyes. Easiest regimen I've ever used Stef When I first started using it, I noticed few breakouts. I was told my skin is detoxing so I trusted the process. I'm glad I did. My skin has never been better. Amanda My teenager has seen a huge improvement in his acne with this product. Whitney My whole family use this black bar. It's in every bathroom in the house. Jennifer S. I love this bar! I am a low maintenance type of girl, and I don't want 10 products to take care of my skin. I want quality and results in the shortest amount of time. This bar delivered both and I was sold after the first time using. BCK BEST skincare on the market - PERIOD. I have been using Kalaia for years and can confirm it is worth its weight in gold! Yes, it's exorbitant, but for that, you are getting top-of-the-line, all-natural products that are effective beyond anything you could imagine. Seriously. It has transformed my skin. For reference, I am in my early 30's and had acne-prone skin most of my life. It has calmed down in recent years with age, but I still get the occasional breakout. I also now have dry skin with accompanying texture. Kalaia has corrected all of these skin issues and truly made me feel beautiful and confident in my skin. Thankfully, I am aging well with no fine lines or wrinkles (genetics, mostly) but I know this skincare is helping to retain my youthful appearance, as well. ALL of this just makes this stuff so worthwhile, and truly justifies the price point, in my eyes. Specific to this charcoal bar, it is by far the best. Non-drying (again, already dry skin), and yet leaves my face and body feeling clean and also clear, with tightened pores and a soft, smooth texture. It is a must for maintaining optimal skin health, as are all the other products in their line. Von Just try it, you will not regret it. Krista Always thought bar soaps are drying. But not this one! Love this product. Maureen I saw a huge improvement in my breakouts. Laura This product changed my skin! Made a such a big difference with my acne. Dammi Seriously the best cleanser ever! VR I have started using the cleansing bar on my 3 year old lil girl and my 8 year old son who are both suffering from Ezcema not even knowing about the active ingredients that are in the product just becuase it worked wonders on my skin. I have only used this on kids for couple of days now and it is working wonders. The redness is almost gone and the ichiness around the badly effected areas are refused and the skin is healing without the prescription drugs. Nowinder it is working on them. Melrel etter than the Erno Laszlo detox bar!!! - I have always preferred bars of soap for both my face and body over there liquid counterparts. For the past two years now I have been using Erno Laszlo bars which I love. But amazingly this Kalaia detox and balance bar is even better than the Erno Laszlo detox bar! While I love the Erno Laszlo one, it does dry out my skin if I do not use the cleansing oil with it along with a stringent skincare regime. But this Kalaia one doesn't dry my skin out anywhere near as bad as the Erno Laszlo one does! But it still manages to make my face feel super clean! I'm not sure about the long term benefits as of yet, but I have already purchased another bar for when I run out of this! So far though I am absolutely loving it! Kim I'm a busy mom so before Kalaia I barely found time to wash my face at night. Now I look forward to it and love having one cleanser that does it all! Debra E. I love the smell, and the way it lathers and feels so creamy on my face. I noticed an immediate difference and glow in my skin. Wylee Gentle of sensitive skin. I'm using this Kalaia detox cleansing bar only on my face as I want it to last a long time . It's very gentle on my skin and cleans well without stripping my skin or drying. This bar of soap is much smaller than I expected but with my using it on my face only it should last me several months. I appreciate that this bar of soap is free of artificial colors, fragrance and nasty chemicals. This soap is also cruelty free and vegan. I'm very pleased at how well this soap is working on my mature, sensitive and very dry skin. R I wasn't sure this would be suitable for my normal/dry skin, but I was wrong. My face feels so clean and soft after use, and looks perfectly bright. It contains charcoal to draw out impurities, enzymes to exfoliate, and different butters and oils to moisturize and hydrate. This is truly suitable for.all skin types. Sam Clean Glowing skin - Have been using this product for a couple of year! Keeps my break outs in check. Controls my combination skin. Nothing not to love Cindy Jenkins My daughter told me about this product and swears by it. I'm happy to report it doesn't disappoint. I love all the natural and clean products it contains. I also love it's a cleansing bar for my face and entire body!! I recommend it to all my friends now too. amwalker The only soap you need! I have been using Kalaia for 3 years and this soap is amazing! I use it for my face and as a body wash. My skin is so clear and I no longer struggle with acne. I have been wearing a mask since the pandemic started and thanks to this bar still do not have break outs. 2 people found this helpful Dineka Love love love this bar. A must have! Susan Mazur Where do I start?? I start my day with the pink magic powder and then move on to the serum and eye cream.

It leaves my skin feeling so clean and the natural fragrance is truly refreshing. We use the Charcoal Bar as our shower bar and also have one by the sink. When we travel my husband always ask \"Did you pack the charcoal bar?\" We love the little black bar Amanda Howard What a bar! To say I don't like bar soap is an understatement. I hate how they feel when they get slimy. I have used this bar for months and no sliminess. My face feels so clean after I use this bar. I can't believe I didn't want to try it at first. HarleyM Buy more than one!!! This cleansing bar changed my life for the better! I just to think my face felt clean after I washed it with other facial soaps... I was so wrong!! This bar makes a huge difference!! It's so natural and safe for all skin types I ever use it on my children! I use it on my face and body! Absolutely love!!! I've been using it for 13 months now! Simon As a dude who gets lots of dust, mechanical dirt on my skin, face, I enjoy using the black bar soap. It cleans really well and restores my skin. Thank you. Christina W Everyone needs this. I love the black detox and cleanser bar! It smells amazing and is just the zing I need in the morning to get me going. I love using it on my whole body and my face. I can no longer live without it and I make sure that I have a back up at all times! If you are not sure where to start start with this! Jennifer R Amazing Black bar. I love the smell and feel of this soap on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate me at all. I highly recommend that everyone tries it. Lisa Palombo Gentle yet effective. I love the Kalaia Cleanser Bar. For someone with sensitive skin, this bar is gentle yet controls the oil buildup. I use it twice a day and never feel dried out. My skin is smooth and clear! Carmen I swear I've been using mine for 4 weeks now only on my face. In the past 2 weeks I have used twice a day! I can easily see that it will last me another couple of months. EASY!! So if it last 3 months... 90 days... 28 bucks up front... comes up to 31 cents per day. I don't know about you but what's 31 cents per day? And the way it makes my skin feel and face look, that's just priceless. No makeup, No filter, no flash. Just me, my skin and the KALAIA charcoal bar. (I do moisturize with over the counter product for now) Just wanted to share my testimony here for anyone to see. 46 years old, turning 47 in August. Kanchana H As women we all would love to dress nicely and put a nice make up on when we go out or for work. I have a toddler who waits until I get home to jump into my arms. Due to hygiene reasons I always prefer to remove the make up I wear and have a wash before I go to my baby. The real struggle is how long I spend to remove my make up. I use three different products for make up removal that takes ages and then the my toddler loses her temper when I get late to go to her. Today I received my first Kalaia soap and I was so excited to use it. It's a life changing product, I only spent 2 mins to remove my make up. Instead of using different products, one thing did the job well. This soap does wonders. Aryanny Zaini I love everything about Kalaia and all their products. I have used them for a couple of months now and noticed a difference of how it looks and feels on my skin. My favourite product from Kalaia is Detox & Balance - Cleansing Bar. Every time I use it, it gets off all the dirt and grime off my skin. It even manages to get off my full coverage makeup with no makeup remover prior! The Cleansing Bar has a clean fresh scent that is not over-powering and it doesn't leave a dry and tight feeling after, which tends to happen with some other well-known brands. What's amazing about this Bar, it can be used on the body as well. The areas that I have used on are specifically on my elbows as they have eczema.The Bar has combat the overall dryness and itchiness in that area and I'm blown away. I highly recommend Kalaia for any skin concerns. Rhonda D Any other soap, I would have discarded when I am down to a sliver...not this one Jen W I'm so impressed! I just removed all my Halloween makeup with my Detox and Balance Cleansing Bar from Kalaia! I was wearing white concealer, black eyeliner, red Lipsense, green blue pink denim shadowsense. I did not do close to my eyes with the bar BUT did do one with a makeup remover wipe so you can see the difference and how little rubbing I needed to do! Natalie A While bars of soap are kinda weird to me, I decided to try the Kalaia Detox Bar since I had read great things about its results. I've been so pleased. My face is clean, fresh and soft after use. No facial makeup remover needed. The soap dish is perfect and allows the bar to dry nicely. Now if I can get my teenage son to try it for his acne. I know it will help. My bar and soap dish traveled with me on vacation. I didn't want to go dirty for two weeks! Nadia P KALAIA BLACK SOAP!! This is the part of my evening routine I look FORWARD to. This cleanser smells invigorating and leaves my skin silky smooth and clean, helps with balancing my oily spots, and is an amazing makeup remover. I use this twice a day, morning and night. It lasts for ever, it took me 6months to finish it up. I'm hooked for life. Elaina A This #littleblackbar has been life changing for my teen. He struggled a lot with body acne. While he won't let me take pics to show you before and after I can tell you that it's made a huge difference. After just 2 weeks of use it's almost all gone. He friend came over this weekend and used it. Said it felt great on his trouble spots as well. I felt a pimple coming up and hit knee it was going to be bad. You know that feeling, it's going to hurt. Well I used it twice that day and what do you know, no pimple!! Annie Jensen Bought the charcoal bar. I've been using it for about 3 weeks and I love it. My pores are clearer, my skin is glowy (is glowy a word?) I don't get dry flaky patches (combination skin) or oily patches. Takes off all my makeup the first time. Leaves no residue and it doesn't irritate my eyes. I also have mild rosacea and it doesn't irritate. It's awesome. Bomalee Dissanayake Kalaia is the BEST!!! A product worth your money. You got to experience the difference right away. My skin feels so soft and the blemishes starting to fade away. Kalaia is simply amazing I am loving it! Can't thank you enough Gaya, the founder of KALAIA !!! Natalya Melnik Here is my one week results with the added new cleanser!!! (don't mine my red eyes, allergies). Can "}
