Food may be the most important factor to maintain the health of your body. When you eat it, you are supplying your body with the nutrients that it uses to build and maintain your cells, create hormones, run chemical reaction. nutrition nutrition is the intake of food, considered in relation to the body's dietary needs. good nutrition - an adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity - is a cornerstone of good health. Poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity. By W.H.o. (World Health organization)Nutrition is the process which involves taking in and the utilization of food substances by which growth, repair and maintenance of the body are accomplished. Nutrients are stored by the body in various forms and are used when the food intake is not sufficient. the moment you place a piece of food in your mouth and you begin to chew, your brain is stimulated to secrete powerful digestive enzymes that will help your body digest the food. once the food is broken down, the nutrients (Proteins & carbohydrates) are absorbed in your intestines to be used by your body. When your body has taken and used what it needs, the waste products are eliminated from your body. this physiological unit - 1 6process relies on thousands of chemical reactions and enzymes, and is only possible because of the nutrients in the foods that you eat. Classification of Food nutrient is a normal diet. Food can be obtained from animal as well as plant kingdom from organic as well as inorganic sources. Food is classified according to its nutrients composition and also according to the function it serves in the body. Nutrient Classification nutrients can be divided into seven groups: 1. Proteins 2. Carbohydrates 3. Fats 4. Vitamins 5. Minerals 6. Water 7. r oughage Food is a must for man or of any other organism to survive. no life on this earth is possible without food. the desire to eat is normal and basic in human beings. this does not however mean that an individual is eating well. eating just any food will satisfy the appetite and provide energy.in the body protein, fats, carbohydrate can be described as energy yielding nutrients. They are also called as macronutrient because we need large quantities of them on daily basis. these macronutrients are also called as organic. organic nutrients contain hydrogen, oxygen and carbon. Vitamins, Minerals and water do not yield energy in the body. Although vitamins are classified as organic nutrient whereas minerals and water are inorganic (they do not contain carbon).Vitamins and minerals are called as micronutrients because we need only tiny amounts of them compared to the macronutrients.Beauty and Wellnessunit - 1 7food Pyramid A Typical Food Pyramid All Food Nutrients are required by individual to have healthy body. Food helps body to fight against the diseases and keep everyone healthy. Right kind of food keeps body physically, mentally and psychologically fit.

Several mineral salts are required by the body in large amounts and others in traces (trace elements). Deficiency of minerals can result in food consumed not being fully utilized by the body to the nutritional values of foods being properly extracted. Minerals are not dissolvable nor digested; they work as catalyst to break down foods into a workable form. In addition to those minerals listed below, we also require: copper, zinc, sulphur, chlorine and magnesium.

It forms a part of fluids in body tissues; eg the amniotic fluid surrounds and protects the fetus during pregnancy. 6. Saliva is about 99.5% water which makes swallowing easier by moistening the food and finally helps in digestion. 7. Requirement of water varies according to climate, diet, activities and surface area of the body. as a rule a person should take enough water to excrete about 1200 ml-1500 ml of urine per day. normal intake of water ranges between 8 - 10 glasses per day. Prevention of dehydration: Dehydration can be prevented by taking sufficient amount of water as fluids. The correction of dehydration is called rehydration.oral rehydration Salt: WHo, uniCeF formula consist of the naCl - 3.5 g, naHCo3 - 2.5 g, KCl - 1.5 g and glucose 20 g to be dissolved in one litre of potable drinking water. Potable water is that which is safe and wholesome i.e, free from pathogenic agents and chemicals. roughage (fibre) Adequate peristalsis occurs in the bowel only when there is sufficient residue for the muscle wall to work on. roughage is mainly provided by the cell walls of plants. it is found in green vegetables, wholegrain products (cereals), granary bread, bran etc. fibre diets Fiber or roughage is the name for carbohydrates found in the cell walls of plants. Fiber passes through the body without being absorbed and helps maintain a healthy large intestine (bowel) and controls both blood sugar and blood cholesterol bowels. Fiber gives a feeling of bulk and fullness; this reduces the desire to eat and therefore is an advantage when trying to lose weight adolescent: nutritional Guidelines nutritional factors 1. Specific changes during adolescence that affect nutritional requirements are : i ncrease in the growth rate Height and weight increase Changes in body composition a ttainment of sexual maturityunit - 1 162. g rowth rate is different for boys and girls.

Adequate energy and good quality protein is vital for both boys and girls to meet the needs of the growth spurt. 5. Due to rapid growth and bone mineralization, adequate calcium is important. 6. i ron is especially important for adolescent girls due to menstrual losses. 7. n eed for iodine is increased in adolescence. a day's sample diet plan for a 14 year old boy Personal data age 14 years Sex Male SeS Mig Food Habits n on-veg Recommended Dietary Allowances energy 2750 Kcal Protein 54 gm Calcium 800 mg thiamine 1.2 mg food exchange Plan food Groups no. of exchangeenergy (Kcal)Protein (g)Carbohydrate (g) fat (g) Milk 2 340 16 24 20 Meat 2 140 14 - 10 Pulse 2 200 14 34 - Cereal 15 1050 30 225 - Vegetable a 1 - - - -Beauty and Wellnessunit - 1 17food Groups no. of exchangeenergy (Kcal)Protein (g)Carbohydrate (g) fat (g) Vegetable B 3 120 6 21 - Fruit 2 80 - 20 - Sugar 8 160 - 40 - Fat 8 360 - - 40 distribution of exchanges & Menu Plan Meal exchanges no.

Session-2: yogic Sukshma Vyayama yoga Yoga means \"union\" a sum of unity of two entities. Here it means the unison of self with god. it has been developed and practiced for thousands of years by our Sages and this is now known world over as a part of Indian Culture. It was first presented in a formal and systematic written work by Great Patanjali. The term Yoga was defined by sage Patanjali as \"Chitta-Vriti-Nirodh\", which means as: Mind - its Fluctuations - and Control. the word 'y oga' is derived from the Sanskrit root 'yuj' which means to join, to direct and concentrate the attention in order to use it for meditation. it is the communion of the human soul with divinity. it provides us physical, mental, and spiritual well-being with a long life.Beauty and Wellnessunit - 1 23Path & Principles of yoga ashtangyog there are different ways to reach a desired common destination. in yogic discipline there are four paths in an order of yoga-Karma, raja, Bhakti, and Jnana-all leading to the same centre of consciousness, Patanjali evolved eight stages on the path yoga leads the individual from ignorance to knowledge, from darkness to light and from death to immortality. y ama n iyama a prarthana Buddhi-tatha-dhrti-Sakti-Vikasaka (developing the Mind and Will-power) 4 Smarana-sakti-vikasaka (developing the Memory) 5 Medha-sakti-vikasaka (developing the intellect) 6 netra-sakti-vikasaka (improving the eye-sight) 7 Kapola-sakti-vardhaka (rejuvenating the Cheeks0 8 Karna-sakti-vardhaka (improving the power of Hearing) 9 griva-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the neck) [1] 10 griva-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the neck) [2] 11 griva-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the neck) [3] 12 SkandhatathaBahu-mula-sakti-vikasaka (developing the strength of the Shoulder- blades and joints) 13 Bhuja-bandha-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the upper arms) 14 Kaphoni-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the elbow) 15 Bhuja-balli-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the Fore-arms) 16 Purna-bhuja sakti-vikasaka (developing the arms) 17 Mani-bandha-sakti-vikasaka (developing the Wrists) 18 Kara-prstha-sakti-vikasaka (developing the back of the Hands) 19 Kara-tala-sakti-vikasaka (developing the palms) 20 anguli-mula-sakti-vikasaka (developing the Finger-joints) 21 anguli-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the Fingers)unit - 1 2422 Vaksa-sthala-sakti-vikasaka (developing the Chest) [1] 23 Vaksa-sthala-sakti-vikasaka (developing the Chest) [2] 24 udara-sakti-vikasaka (developing the abdominal muscles)-ajagari[1] 25 udara-sakti-vikasaka (developing the abdominal muscles) [2] 26 udara-sakti-vikasaka (developing the abdominal muscles) [3] 27 udara-sakti-vikasaka (developing the abdominal muscles) [4] 28 udara-sakti-vikasaka (developing the abdominal muscles) [5] 29 udara-sakti-vikasaka (developing the abdominal muscles) [6] 30 udara-sakti-vikasaka (developing the abdominal muscles) [7] 31 udara-sakti-vikasaka (developing the abdominal muscles) [8] 32 udara-sakti-vikasaka (developing the abdominal muscles) [9] 33 udara-sakti-vikasaka-nauli (developing the abdominal muscles) [10] 34 Kati-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the Back) [1] 35 Kati-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the Back) [2] 36 Kati-sakti-vikasaka (developing the strength of the Back) [3] 37 Kati-sakti-vikasaka (developing the strength of the Back) [4] 38 Kati-sakti-vikasaka (developing the strength of the Back) [5] 39 Muladhara-chakra-suddhi (t oning up the Bowels) 40 upastha tatha Svadhisthana-chakra-suddhi (Cleansing and toning up the Bowels) 41 Kundalini-sakti-vikasaka (developing thepower of the Mystic coil)-(Kundalini) Pindali-sakti-vikasaka (developing theCalves) 46 Pada-mula-sakti-vikasaka (developing the strength of the Soles) 47 gulpha-pada-prstha-pada-tala-sakti-vikasaka (developing the strength of ankles and the Feet) 48 Padanguli-sakti-vikasaka (developing the toes) yogic Sukshma Vyayama 1. uccarana-Sthala t atha Visuddha-Cakra-Suddhi Posture: With your feet together and body erect, tilt your head slightly backward while keeping your eyes wide open and your mouth closed.

Using firm 'balance-point' positioning and holding the toenail trimmer like scissors- between thumb and middle finger, leaving the index finger free for balance- slide the tip of the trimmer under the corner at a 45\u00b0 angle, so you can see the trimmer on the other side of the nail. Make sure you don't leave a hook or spike behind on the lateral nail edge. g uide a curette, small spoon tool or orangewood stick along the lateral nail edge in the direction of nail growth. do this on both sides of the nail to remove non-living tissue and debris. 128unit - 3 After all five toenails have been pedicured, rinse the foot in the bath and pat dry .

Knead up and down along each bone by raising your thumb and lower fingers to apply pressure. Effleurage on Top of Foot: Place both thumbs on top of foot at instep. Move your thumbs in circular movements in opposite directions down the center of the top of the foot. Continue this movement to the toes. Keep one hand in contact with foot or leg, slide one hand at a time back firmly to instep and rotate back down to toes.130unit - 3 Effleurage on Heel (bottom of foot): use the same thumb movement that you did in the massage technique above. Start at the base of the toes and move from the ball of the foot to the heel, rotating your thumbs in opposite directions. Slide hands back to the top of the foot. Effleurage Movement on Toes: Start with the little toe, using thumb on top and index finger on bottom of foot. Hold each toe and rotate with the thumb.

Effleurage a French word meaning \"to skim\" or \"to touch lightly on\", is a series of massage strokes used in Swedish massage to warm up the muscle before deep tissue work using petrissage. Petrissage from French p\u00e9trir, \"to knead\" are massage movements with applied pressure which are deep and compress the underlying muscles. Kneading, wringing, skin rolling and pick-up-and-squeeze are the petrissage movements. They are all performed with the padded palmar surface of the hand, the surface of the finger and also the thumbs. types of Pedicure regular Pedicure: a simple foot treatment which involves foot soaking, scrubbing, clipping of nails along with shaping them, massaging foot and calf muscles, moisturizing followed with nail paint. the regular pedicure consists of soaking feet in a warm tub of smelly salts and scrubbing with a pumice stone or foot file. This removes the dead skin around the front and back of the foot. The toe nails are clipped, filed and cleaned, then set out to dry so polish adheres to the nail. While toes nails dry, apply a moisturizer to the foot and calf and massage the leg. lastly, the nails are painted.Beauty and Wellness 131unit - 3Spa Pedicure: the spa pedicure is an upgrade to the regular pedicure because of a few extra steps during the process. Spa pedicures receive all the basics of the regular pedicure. in addition to a few extra minutes and a slightly higher price, the spa pedicure typically involves a paraffin wax, mud mask or salt scrub. Dip feet into a paraffin wax and allow the wax to cool completely before simply peeling it off and revealing smooth skin. a mud mask is similar to a face mask, but for the feet; it helps to remove dead skin and relax sore feet. Salt or sugar scrubs are another exfoliation and moisture-enhancing technique. Paraffin Pedicure: Paraffin that is used for salon treatments is actually an alkaline (opposite of acidic) substance that contains hydrating factors for the skin. it comes in a very viscous and waxy form which is applied all over the skin on the feet and the hands (palm and back of hands). one's hands and feet are then wrapped with for the moisture to seep through the skin. Paraffin manicure and pedicures also include regular nail cleaning and shaping. Stone Pedicure: Stone pedicures help relax and work out sore muscles, aches and pains in the feet and calves. the pedicure includes the amenities from the regular pedicure. in addition; warm to hot stones are used to rub down the foot to help loosen tight muscles. depending on the salon, patrons may receive a foot rub with essential oil, then place their feet onto a smooth stone, or the professional may rub down the foot and calves with the stones and essential oil. french Pedicure: A regular pedicure which ends with the \"French\" style of nail paint characterized by white nail polish at the nail tips with a sheer pink colour on the nail base. Mini Pedicure: The mini pedicure is fast, quick and inexpensive. Because of the term \"mini\", the pedicure does not contain the massage or exfoliation to the feet. Unknowingly, women usually give themselves mini pedicures at home because the mini pedicure is simply removing the polish, filing the nails and re-polishing the toes. review exercise 1. l ist the tools and supplies used in pedicure. 2. l ist any 05 points of toe nail care. 3.

Session-2: Hygiene and Sterilization (Same for Manicure also) Sterilization is a term referring to any process that eliminates (removes) or kills all forms of microbial life, including transmissible agents (such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, spore forms, etc.) present on a surface, contained in a fluid, in medication, or in a compound such as biological culture media. Sterilization can be achieved by applying the proper combinations of heat, chemicals, irradiation, high pressure, and filtration. all your tools must be washed in warm soapy water, then rinsed and then dried thoroughly before sterilizing them. this removes any debris and prevents contamination of the sterilizing method. few techniques for sterilizing of tools are a utoclave: High pressure steaming at a minimum of 121 degrees celsius for 15 minutes. the autoclave method is suitable for stainless steel and glass tools u ltraviolet: Used mainly to store already sterilized equipment. The UV method is only effective on the surfaces it touches, so the tools will need to be turned overBeauty and Wellness 135unit - 3 Glass Bead: glass beads are heated to 190 degrees celsius to 300 degrees celsius. they are kept at this temperature for 30- 60 minutes before use. Suitable only for very small items such as tweezers and cuticle pushers. Chemical Sterilizers: the most common chemical sterilizer is Barbicide. the tools are totally immersed in a solution of Barbicide or another chemical and water. always follow the instructions to the letter. the chemicals are extremely strong and can cause harm to the skin, so be careful when handling them. also always dry the tools well when removed from the solution. disinfectant disinfectants are substances that are applied to non-living objects to destroy microorganisms that are living on the objects. disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms, especially resistant bacteria spores; it is less effective than sterilization, which is an extreme physical and/or chemical process that kills all types of life. disinfectants are different from other antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics, which destroy microorganisms within the body, and antiseptics, which destroy microorganisms on living tissue. disinfectants are also different from biocides \u2014 the latter are intended to destroy all forms of life, not just microorganisms. disinfectants work by destroying the cell wall of microbes or interfering with the metabolism.

Skin type changes from person to person. determining you skin type is an important step in knowing how to treat skin, what products to use and how to have a perfect skin. Skin pH one of the most important roles of our skin is to protect our insides from the external environment, acting both as a barrier and a filter between outside and inside. In addition skin is involved in regulation our body's temperature. the pores of our skin are made up of a combination of oil and sweat glands helping to keep our skin healthy and elastic. When in balance, the combined excretion of oil and sweat from the skin's pores has a ph of about 5.5. importance of the skin's pH one of the major reasons that radically alter the pH of the skin is soap. Soaps available are highly alkaline (pH range 9-11) and raise the skin's pH to be much more alkaline. this can be adjusted by using products such as herbal toner or rose water, depending on the skin type. these toners restore normal pH of the skin and thus provide an environment not conducive to the growth of bacteria. types of Skin normal d ry o ily Combination SensitiveBeauty and Wellness 147unit - 4 normal Skin Few clients will have normal skin, as this skin type is very rare indeed. normal skin has a good oil and water balance. the best example of normal skin is in children from birth up until puberty. When questioned, the client will usually report that they have very few problems with their skin. dry Skin a dry skin is so called because it is either lacking in sebum or moisture, or both. it develops as a result of under activity of the sebaceous glands. the skin's natural oil, sebum, lubricates the corneum layer and in the absence of this oily coating the dead cells start to curl up and flake. The sebum coating also helps to prevent moisture loss through evaporation, and for this reason dry skin has difficulty retaining inner moisture.although dry skin is hereditary, it can also develop as a result of the ageing process. the client will usually report that their skin feels tight and dry. they many also complain of sensitivity and premature ageing. oily Skin oily skin is hereditary, and develops due to an overproduction of sebum from the sebaceous glands. there is always a tendency for clients to overtreat their skin if it is oily; however, this can compound the problem as excessive stimulation results in stripping and irritating the skin, making it become dry and unbalanced. the skin's natural 148unit - 4protection mechanism will then respond by producing more oil. the client will usually report that their skin develops a 'shine' during the course of a day, their skin often feels thick and dirty, due to the accumulation of the sebum and dead cells clogging the surface and suffer with blemishes. Combination Skin this is actually the most common skin type. as its name suggest, this skin is a bit of a mixture; typically the t-zone (central area of the face corresponding to the forehead, nose and chin) is oily and the cheeks and neck are dry/normal. Combination skin can therefore be both dry and oily at the same time. review exercises 1.

The beneficial effects produced by massage depend upon the type, intensity and extent of the manipulations employed. Massaging must be performed systematically. it should never be a casual or irregular process. Consideration must be given to the condition of the skin and the general physical condition of the parton. 152unit - 4 Massage Manipulation Basic Massage Manipulations The primary rule in the application of massage manipulations is: \"When massaging any part of the head, face or neck, all pressure should be applied in an upward direction.\" This rule should be followed in all massaging services, whether they are intended to stimulate, relax or soothe the skin. When applying rotary manipulations, the same rule applies because the pressure should be applied on the upward swing of the movement. the basic manipulations used in massage are as follows: 1. Effleurage: this is a light, continuous movement applied in a slow and rhythmic manner over the skin. no pressure is employed. over large surfaces, the palm is used; while over small surfaces, the fingertips are employed. Effleurage is frequently applied to the forehead, face and scalp for its soothing and relaxing effects. 2. Petrissage: In this movement, the skin and flesh are grasped between the thumb and fingers. As the tissues are lifted from their underlying structures, they are squeezed. Rolled or pinched with a light, firm pressure. This movement exerts an invigorating effect on the part being treated. 3. f riction: This movement requires pressure on the skin while it is being moved over the underlying structures. The fingers or palms are employed in this movement. Friction has a marked influence on the circulation and glandular activity of the skin. 4. Percussion or tapotement: this form of massage is the most stimulating. it should be applied with care and discretion. tapping movements are gentler than slapping movements. Percussion movements tone the muscles and impart a healthy glow Beauty and Wellness 153unit - 4to the part being massaged. In tapping, the fingertips are brought down against the skin in rapid succession, whereas in slapping, the whole palm is used to strike the skin. Hacking movement employs the outer ulnar borders of the hands which are struck against the skin in alternate succession. in facial massage, only light digital tapping is used. 5. Vibrations: The fingertips or vibrator are used to transmit a trembling movement to the skin and its underlying structures. to prevent over-stimulation, this movement should be used sparingly and should never exceed a few seconds duration on any one spot. There are many different massage sequences which are to be followed for facial massage. 1. Spreading the cream on the shoulders. 2. t humb kneading to the shoulders. 3. Finger kneading to the shoulders. 4. Vibration to the shoulders. 5. Circular massage on the neck. 6. Hand cupped on the neck. 7. Knuckling on the neck. 8. Circular on the mandible. 9. Flick-ups 10. l ifting the eyebrows. 11. inner and outer eye circles. 12. Circling on the chin, nose and temple. 13. l ifting the mandible. 14.

Session-4: light Make-up application the main objective of applying make-up is to enhance the natural beauty of the face by emphasizing on good features while minimizing less attractive features. Make-up is an art and as a make-up artist one must have the fundamental knowledge of - 1) Structure of face. 2) Colors and their relationship to one another. 3) Principles of optical illusion. 168unit - 4There is no fixed pattern for applying make-up; application may vary from client to client based on her individual needs; the make-up artist must take following points in consideration while planning a make-up for her client: 1) t ype of face make-up. 2) Hairstyle. 3) Harmony of color in the clothing. eye, hair and skin. 4) i ndividuality of facial features. 5) Personality of the client. 6) a ge. 7) Profession. 8) o ccasion. Contraindications Part of the skin analysis procedure also involves identifying any contra-indications before you begin the demonstration. these are existing skin conditions or problems. Sometimes you won't be able to do any demonstration on the client. But this happens rarely. More likely will be the situation where you need to alter the demonstration or product recommendations. Contraindications or untreatable conditions are conditions which prevent a treatment being performed. For example if the client has scabies, an infectious disease of the skin, you cannot do any treatments on this highly contagious condition until it has cleared. treatments must not be conducted where contagious diseases are present or there is evidence of infection (redness, pus, tenderness and swelling). refer your client to a medical practitioner. general contra-indications to lash and brow treatments include: Bacterial, viral or fungal infections such as: Herpes, warts - viral infections Impetigo known as sores' fungal infectionBeauty and Wellness 169unit - 4 Injury/Surgery scar Micro - organism infections such as scabies and pediculosis (lice) Boils and carbuncles bruising or swelling in the treatment area cuts and abrasions in the treatment area recent scars in the treatment area Bacterial infection Fungal infection Prepare the client for make-up any service begins with a warm greeting. you should introduce yourself to the client. Whilst you are doing that you should make some initial assessments about the client's style and requirements. The make-up station should be an area that is specifically lit for make-up applications. Lighting as close as possible to natural light is the first choice for a make-up service. 170unit - 4you will also need to ensure that the area is cool so that the make-up does not become too warm and change colour or 'run'. the make-up station should have a large mirror so that the client can see you working and can ask questions about the different stages of the make-up process. Before you apply any make-up to your client you need to ensure that your client feels at ease and is protected at all times. it is important the client is seated comfortably at your eye level. The whole face should be clearly visible to allow the work to proceed efficiently. adjust the chair before beginning the make-up service. ensure the client does not have to stretch their neck to see you. and ensure that you are standing in a comfortable position so that you can apply the make-up without continuously bending your back. Cover the client's clothes with a protective covering, such as a cape. the salon will be liable for any damage done to clothing or jewellery from make-up spills. use a headband or clips to pull back the hair. if the client is having their hair done as well, then the make-up needs to be applied last. if the client wants a brow shape this is best performed a few days before the make-up service as the skin will be red and prone to possible infection. Beauty and Wellness 171unit - 4Consult with the client Your client will come to you with specific needs and expectations. Clarify these needs by questioning the client to confirm your understanding of their expectations, negotiate the various aspects of the service and answer any questions they may have. Encourage the client to raise any concerns so that you can discuss it with them and offer solutions. When questioning the client, listen carefully to their main concerns about their skin and make-up requirements. identify the image that the client is trying to create. For example, does the client want the make-up service to be suitable for: business pleasure social occasions a certain time of the day special occasion such as a ball or wedding. identify skin type and condition in order to design a suitable make-up plan for your client, you need to consider the following: skin type skin condition contraindications.

Conditioner is a substance used, often after shampooing, to detangle and improve the condition of the hair. like shampoo, it is applied to wet hair and then rinsed out after applying. Shampoos are designed to cleanse the hair and scalp by removing oil, dist, dandruff, dead skin, environmental pollutants and other contaminant particles that gradually build up in the hair. they form the heart of hair care daily routine. a good shampoo does not interferes with the production of sebum or natural oil secretion. Shampoo cannot change the process of overactive oil glands. History The word shampoo is derived for the word \"Campo\" in 1762. Shampoo had originated in Bengal region. it was introduced as head massage and contained alkali, natural oils and fragrance. The modern shampoo was first introduced in 1930 which contains synthetic surfactants. Washing with shampoo does not dry out hair because an ideal shampoo will not cause drying of hair or scalp or stimulates greasy scalp. Composition of Shampoo Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate and/or sodium laurethsulfate with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropylbetaine in water to form a thick, viscous liquid. Other essential ingredients include salt (sodium chloride), which is used to adjust the viscosity, a preservative and fragrance.[9] other ingredients are generally included in shampoo formulations to maximize the following qualities: Pleasing foam e asy rinsing Minimal skin/eye irritation Feels thick and/or creamy Pleasant fragrance l ow toxicity g ood biodegradability Slightly acidic (pH less than 7) n o damage to hairBeauty and Wellness 199unit - 5Many shampoos are pearlescent. This effect is achieved by addition of tiny flakes of suitable materials, e.g. glycol distearate, chemically derived from stearic acid, which may have either animal or vegetable origins. glycol distearate is a wax. Many shampoos also include silicone to provide conditioning benefits. types of Shampoos Shampoo contains detergents which remove dirt and grease from hair and can be rinsed off with water. all shampoos fall into two categories: 1. Cleaners - those need a follow up conditioners. 2. Shampoo + Conditioners - these shampoo plays double role of a shampoo and a conditioners most shampoos available are in this category only other special shampoo are as follows: d aily use Shampoo- they are very gentle and have low amounts of cleansers and generally contains conditioners. d ry Shampoo- they are called powder shampoo as they are applied directly onto the dry hairs and them brushed out. they don't really clean the hair but they are helpful when you can't shampoo hairs because of cold weather, pronged illness, in hurry, or in long travel these shampoo help. Baby Shampoo-These are special shampoos for babies who have very fine hairs. these are very mild shampoo preparations. Shampoo for color treated hairs- these shampoos are rich in natural oils and moisture so that they can restore water to the hair shaft. they are low in alkalinity. they don't have saturated castor oils so that the color doesn't strip. Shampoos for permed or processed hairs- they are rich in moisturizes and protein and are low in alkalinity. they are made for damaged or chemically treated hair as these hair tangles easily; use instant conditioners after each shampooing service. Medicated Shampoos/Anti-dandruff shampoos - apart from regular ingredients for daily use shampoos they contains some special chemicals in ingredients to remove dandruff such azonic. tar derivatives, anti-bacterial as well as antifungal etc. a nti lice Shampoo - applied in proper manner they can kill the lice these shampoos contains gama benzene hexa chloride as permethrin, - 5 pH Balance Shampoo- these shampoos have pH factor similar to the stains hair, which is between 4.5 to the 5.5. they counteracts the effect of chemicals on the scalp.

Peroxide Shampoo: this shampoo is used to give hair brightening and highlighting affect. these shampoos are strong and can lighten the natural color of hair and thus should not be used on regular basis. Hair Conditioners & rinses natural oil sebum secreted by scalp helps to keep hair glossy, sometimes there oil glands may not produce enough oil in this case conditioning adds brilliance to the hair, especially dry hair can be benefited to get a luminous shine. All types of hair require conditioning Conditioners help the hairs that has been exposed to excess sunlight, bleaching, and faulty diet. Conditioners help to find in moisture and keep the hair smooth & self-conditioning, helps in removing tangles and makes the hair easy to manage conditioners should be applied to freshly shampoo hair that has been blotted by with a towel to remove excess moisture. History - For centuries natural oils have been used to condition human hair. this natural product oil is still used today. Modern conditioner was created in 20 th century called brilliantine. Conditioners were made with silicon, fatty alcohols and some ammonium compounds. These chemical products allow the benefits of hair conditioner without feeling greasy or heavy hair conditioner is a thicker substance which coats the cuticle of the hair. Hair rinse Hair rinse is the product you use to coat your hair after shampooing & conditioning. the main aim of hair rinse is to restore the acid-alkaline balance of the scalp. Hair rinses gives luster and volume to hair. there are two types of hair rinses natural and chemical. Chemical based rinses are available in the market. Some commonly used natural rinses are natural rinses are tea rinse, lemon rinse, Beer rinse, Vinegar rinse, Chamomile rinse.Beauty and Wellness 201unit - 5Hair Conditioners When considering the question of how hair conditioner works you first need to know about the structure of hair. Hair, as you may know, is composed of a protein called keratin. this fact is important because keratin has a high percentage of those amino acids which have negative charges sticking out, like the hairs on a nettle. the next thing you need to know is that most hair conditioners contain positively charged molecules called cationic surfactants. soap, shampoo, and other cleaners contain surfactants (also called detergents) that are anionic; that is, negatively charged. these cleaners are very effective at removing dirt, but they also remove natural oils and positive charges from the hair. the positively charged surfactants in hair conditioner are attracted to the negative charges in your hair, and do not rinse out completely with water. When the hair dries, it is coated with a thin film, which adds weight, makes the hair easier to comb, and prevents static electricity from building up and 'frizzing' the hair. types of Conditioners Conditioners add brilliance to all types of hairs, especially the dry hairs. Sebum the natural oil secreted by the scalp helps to keep the hair glossy sometimes oil glands may not produce enough oil or other factors may affect the production of sebum Glossy hair has cuticle scales that lie flat and neatly overlap. In this condition, hair reflects the light. Chemical perming or colouring and rough handling of hairs conspire to lift the cuticle, which allows moisture to be lost from the cortex which in turns make the hair dry and luster less and prone to tangle. Hairs get thinner and break easily. to put the shine back and to repair the split ends, it is necessary to use a specific conditioner . Basic Conditioners - They coat the hair with a fine film temporarily smooth the cuticle and making the hair shiny & soft. they should leave on the scalp for few minutes before rinsing out. they are available for all hair types. the restore body and acid volume to the hairs.

They penetrate the cortex and helping to repair the inner part of damaged hair. Color/Perm Conditioner - they are specially designed for chemically treated hairs. Add a protective film around porous areas of hair it helps in preventing colour loss. after perm it helps to stabilize the hair and helps to keep the bounce in curls.

Most states require MSDS to be available upon request by an inspector, and a fine might be levied for salons that don't have them, so keep MSdS for all of your products in an easily accessible location. Many manufacturers have MSdS on their websites that can be easily downloaded. Proper ventilation in salons is essential for client and worker safety and comfort.

How can you tell if your henna contains metallic salts if they're not listed in the ingredients?

Professional Hairdressing Scissors Holding the Shears Properly holding tools is important can help to avoid muscles strain in hands, arms, neck & back.222unit - 5 Open your right hand (left hand if you are left-handed), and place the ring finger in the finer grip of the still blade and the little finger in the finger brace (tang) Place the thumb in the finger grip (thumb grip) of the moving blade. Practice opening and closing the shears. Concentrate on moving only your thumb. A great way to get the feel of this is to lay the still blade against the palm or forefinger of your other hand, which holds it still while you move the other blade with your thumb. Holding the Shears and Comb during the hair cutting process, you will be holding both the comb and the shears at the same time. you may be tempted to put the comb down while cutting, but in the long run this wastes a lot of time. it is best to learn early how to hold both tools during the entire haircutting process. Palming the shears - remove your thumb from the thumb grip, leaving your ring and little fingers in the grip and finger rest. Curl your fingers in to \"palm\" the shears, which keeps them closed while you comb or part the hair. this allows you to hold the comb and the shears at the same time. tension - tension in hair cutting is the amount of pressure applied when combing and holding a subsection, created by stretching or pulling the subsection. tension ranges from minimum to maximum. You control tension with your fingers when you hold the subsection of hair between them. the teeth of the comb also affect tension; greater tension can be achieved with closer and finer teeth. Consistent tension is important for consistent, even results in a haircut. use maximum tension on straight hair where you want precise lines. With curly or hair, however, a lot of tension will result in the hair shrinking even more than usual when it is dry. Use of Scissor for CuttingBeauty and Wellness 223unit - 5the shear, or scissor is the instrument that is used for most hair shaping or hair cutting. Shear come in various lengths and weights and differ in the quality of the steel they are made from. a tapering or thinning shear is used to thin the hair where there is too much bulk. it may also be used to blend in and shape a haircut that has left the hair with stubby, blunt ends. these shears may have notched edges on just one blade or on both of them. they are available with from thirty to forty six teeth. tapering shears with only one notched blade remove more hair than do shears with double notched blades. this is because hair that fits between the blade notches is not removed when the blades are closed over the hair strand, and there are more notches on a double notched blade. the more teeth the shear has, the finer the thinning. Sectioning for Haircuts the purpose of sectioning for a haircut is to determine the actual size of the head. Sectioning is very important because the most important part of any haircut is determining the distribution of hair to the top, the two sides, the crown, and the nape. if you consider that sectioning is done for this reason alone, you will understand why all haircuts require similar sectioning, based on the bone structure of the individual head. depending on the style you want to achieve, the angles of the cut will vary in direction within the various sections. Sectioning for the t op the correct amount of hair to be parted off for the top section. the small protrusions on either side of the head, starting at the center part on the top of the head, run your fingers lightly down the side of your head toward the ear. the top section extends back to the highest point of the head. this highest point is easier to see by making a center part in the hair and then looking at the patron's head from the side. Sectioning for the nape the crown section of hair pinned up out of the way, you have the right amount of hair that belongs in the nape section. to determine the width of the section by placing your fingers behind the ears and feeling for the projection of the end of the temporal bones. 224unit - 5By using these bones as your guide, the exact amount of the hair for the nape, and it will be centered exactly in the middle of the back of the head. Sectioning for the Sides after the top, crown, and nape have been sectioned off, the sides have been outlined. now see the division between the top section, the crown section, and the nape section. Hair partings within the section are determined by the type of haircut to be given. For a layered haircut, vertical parting are used within the sections. For a one-length cut, horizontal partings are used. the angle used for each of the partings will vary depending upon the style. the sides and the nape section are parted in the same manner. Safety in Haircutting it is absolutely essential for you to keep in mind that when you are cutting hair, accidents can happen. you will be handling sharp tools and instruments, and you must always safeguard yourself and your client by following the proper precautions. a lways palm the shears and the clippers when combing or parting the hair. this keeps the points of the shears closed and pointed away from the client while combing, which prevents you from cutting yourself or the client. Palming the shears also reduces strain on the index finger and thumb while combing the hair . a t the time of cutting around the ears or in the case of shorter haircuts, take extra care not to accidentally cut the ear. While cutting bangs or any area close to the skin, balance the shears by placing the tip of the index finger of your left hand (right hand if you cut left-handed) on the pivot point. this prevents the client from being accidentally poked with the shears if she moves suddenly. this also helps to balance your shears and cut a cleaner line. a t the time of working with electric clipper always use a guard. once you are comfortable with holding, palming, and cutting with the razor, you may practice without a guard, but always let your instructor be your guide. a Medium-length Haircut This type of haircut is perfect for extremely fine hair.

Session-5: Blow drying Blow drying is the technique of drying and styling damp hair in one operation-has revolutionized the hairstyling world. Today's women desire hairstyles that require the least time and effort to maintain. The selection of styling tools, techniques, and products must relate to the client's lifestyle.230unit - 5tools for Blow-dry Styling The following the basic tools used for blow-drying techniques. the Blow dryer a blow-dryer is an electrical device designed for drying and styling hair in a single service. its main parts are a handle, a slotted nozzle, a small fan, a heating element, and speed/ heat controls. Some also come with cooling buttons. the temperature control panel helps to produce a steady stream of air at the desired temperature. the blow-dryer's nozzle attachment, or concentrator, is a directional feature that can direct the air stream to any section of the hair more intensely. The diffuser attachment causes the air to flow more softly and helps to accentuate or keep textural definition.Beauty and Wellness 231unit - 5to keep your blow-dryer as a safe and effective as possible, make sure that it is always perfectly clean and free of dirt, grease, and hair before using. dirt or hair in the device could cause extreme heat and hair burn. the air intake tat the back of the dryer must be kept clear at all times . if this intake is covered and air cannot pass through freely, the dryer element could burn out. Combs and Picks Combs and picks are designed to distribute and part the hair. they come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes to adapt to many styling options. the length and spacing of the teeth may vary from one comb to another. teeth that are closely spaced remove definition from the curl, thus creating a smooth surface, while widely spaced teeth shape larger sections of hair for more surface texture. Combs with picks at one end lift the hair away from the head. Brushes When choosing a styling brush, take into account the texture, length, and styling needs of the hair that you are working with. Brushes come in many sizes, shapes, and materials. a classic styling brush is a half-rounded rubber-based brush with smooth round- ended nylon quills, usually in either seven or nine rows. They are heat resistant and antistatic, ideal for smoothing and untangling all types of hair. While they are perfect for blow-drying precision haircuts where not too much volume is desired, they are less suitable for smooth classic shapes with rounded edges. excellent airflow through the brush is also a feature of the classic styling brush. Paddle brushes, with their large, flat bases, are well suited for mid-to longer- length hair. Grooming brushes are generally oval with pure natural bristles or quills of bristle and nylon mix. the nylon bristles stimulate the circulation of blood to the scalp. Vent brushes, with their ventilated design, are used to speed up the blow-drying process, and are ideal for blow-drying fine hair. round brushes come in different diameters. the client's hair should be able to wrap twice around the brush. round brushes normally have natural bristles. large 232unit - 5round brushes can be used to lift the hair at the scalp. Some round brushes have metal cylinder bases so that the heat from the blow-dryer is transferred to the metal base, creating a stronger curl. a teasing brush is a nylon styling brush that has a tail for sectioning, along with a narrow row of bristles. teasing brushes are perfect for backcombing hair and then smoothing out the hair into a style, using the sides of the bristles. Sectioning clutches. these clutches are usually metal or plastic and have long prongs to hold wet or dry sections of hair in place. it is important to keep whatever wet hair you are not working on sectioned off in clutches so that the wet hair does not sit over the dry hair, especially when drying long hair. Roll the Hair to the Base Full Base Section for Blow-Drying. Syling Materials Styling lotions. It is known as \"liquid tools\". They give a style more hold and can add shine and curl, or take curl away. foam or mousse is a light, airy, whipped styling product that resembles shaves foam. it builds moderate body and volume into the hair. Massage it into damp hair to highlight textural movement, or blow-dry it straight for styles in which body without texture is desired. Foam is good for fine hair because it does not weigh the hair down. it will hold for six to eight hours in dry conditions. Conditioning foams are excellent for drier, more porous hair. Gel is a thickened styling preparation- firm-bodied and usually clear or transparent- that comes in a tube or bottle and probably has the strongest hold of all products, other than a finishing spritz or spray. It creates the strongest control for slicked or molded styles and distinct texture definition when spread with the fingers. When Beauty and Wellness 233unit - 5brushed out, it creates long-lasting body. gel that produces the longest hold may overwhelm fine hair because of its high resin level. This is not a concern if fine hair is molded into the lines of the style and does not get brushed through when dry. liquid gels or texturizers are lighter and more viscous, or liquid, in form. They allow for easy styling, defining, and molding. With bushing, they add volume and body to the style. Straightening gels relax the hair for a smooth, straight look, with the most hold in dry outdoor conditions, when applied to damp hair that is wavy, curly, or extremely curly and then blow-dried. Finished Style Volumizers are sprayed into the base of fine, wet hair add volume to the shape, especially at the base Hair spray, or finishing spray, is applied in the form of a mist to hold a style in position. it is the most widely used hairstyling product. available in a variety of holding strengths, in both aerosol ornonaerosol sprays, it is useful for all hair types and effective in dry or damp weather.234unit - 5 Hair being diffused Procedure Blow-drying Implements and Materials blow-dryer with attachments wide-tooth comb styling cape styling lotion round brush neck strip Preparation for all Hair t ypes 1. a fter shampooing, return the client to the seated position and comb out any tangles in the hair. remove excess moisture from the hair by blotting with a towel. 2.
