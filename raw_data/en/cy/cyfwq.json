Several additional considerations are required to safely administer any protocol for an individual. This information is NOT intended to diagnose, treat or encourage self-treatment of any medical condition. \"Long Covid\" is a condition where there is persistence of symptoms after the covid vaccine or natural covid infection. The most common symptoms are fatigue, fog and shortness of breath. It probably represents 1) persistence of the virus, 2) insufficient detoxification after infection or vaccine and/or 3) secondary effects on the adrenal, gut and immune systems.
