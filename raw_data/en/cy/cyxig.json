The study was conducted to explore the effect of high-dose intramuscular vitamin D in hospitalized adults infected with moderate-to-severe SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the standard of care in the COVID-19 protocol. Materials and Methods: Two groups of patients were compared in this prospective randomized controlled trial as the vitamin D was administered orally to group 1 (alfacalcidol 1 mcg/day) and intramuscularly to group 2 (cholecalciferol 200,000 IU). One hundred and sixteen participants were recruited in total, with fifty-eight patients in each group. Following the Egyptian Ministry of Health's policy for COVID-19 management, all patients received the same treatment for a minimum of five days. Results: A significant difference was recorded in the length of hospital stay (8.6 versus 6.8 days), need for high oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilator (67% versus 33%), need for a mechanical ventilator (25% versus 75%), clinical improvement (45% versus 55%), the occurrence of sepsis (35% versus 65%), and in the monitored laboratory parameters in favor of high-dose vitamin D. Moreover, clinical improvement was significantly associated with the need for low/high oxygen, an invasive/non-invasive mechanical ventilator (MV/NIMV), and diabetes, while mortality was associated with the need for MV, ICU admission, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and the occurrence of secondary infection. Conclusions: Our study showed that high-dose vitamin D was considered a promising treatment in the suppression of cytokine storms among COVID-19 patients and was associated with better clinical improvement and fewer adverse outcomes compared to low-dose vitamin D.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-09-27", "cleaned_text": "Evidence for the Efficacy of a High Dose of Vitamin D on the Hyperinflammation State in Moderate-to-Severe COVID-19 Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak has prompted a global effort to combat the disease and identify risk factors and prognosis markers [ [2](#B2-medicina-58-01358)]. Vitamin D insufficiency is an example of the factors which may affect snowballed COVID-19 risk and mortality [ [3](#B3-medicina-58-01358)]. [4](#B4-medicina-58-01358)]. Several health organizations of different governments have recommended that vitamin D supplements are to be taken during the summer months of the COVID-19 pandemic as people are strongly encouraged to spend as much time as they can at home [ [5](#B5-medicina-58-01358)]. [6](#B6-medicina-58-01358), [7](#B7-medicina-58-01358)]. It is also known as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), which are hormone precursors and play a crucial role in regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism [ [8](#B8-medicina-58-01358)]. Moreover, it was found that vitamin D has an anti-inflammatory effect and is associated with a significantly lower level of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, tumor necrosis factors, and interleukins [ [9](#B9-medicina-58-01358)]. [10](#B10-medicina-58-01358)]. Therefore, it can prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by decreasing the synthesis of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interferon, simultaneously boosting anti-inflammatory cytokine expression by macrophages [ [9](#B9-medicina-58-01358)]. The contribution of vitamin D to the integrity of the physical barriers that keep viruses from entering body tissues and causing infection has been also reported [ [11](#B11-medicina-58-01358)]. [Figure 1](#medicina-58-01358-f001)) [ [12](#B12-medicina-58-01358), [13](#B13-medicina-58-01358)]. This step is critical because SARS CoV-2 has been shown to infect host cells via employing ACE2 as a receptor [ [14](#B14-medicina-58-01358)] and downregulates the expression of ACE2 [ [15](#B15-medicina-58-01358), [16](#B16-medicina-58-01358)]. The downregulation of ACE2 throughout COVID-19 infection causes a cytokine storm in the host, resulting in ARDS [ [17](#B17-medicina-58-01358), [18](#B18-medicina-58-01358)]. [19](#B19-medicina-58-01358), [20](#B20-medicina-58-01358)]. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design and Patients [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov)NCT04738760). The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and in accordance with amended good clinical practices [ [21](#B21-medicina-58-01358)]. All participants or their legal guardians provided written informed consent. [Figure 2](#medicina-58-01358-f002)). 2.2. Eligibility Criteria 2.3. Treatment 2.4. Study Outcomes 2.5. Sample Size Calculation 2.6. Biochemical Analysis 2.7. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Baseline Patients' Characteristics [Table oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) were similar in both groups with no statistically significant difference. 3.2. Changes in Biochemical Parameters between Both Groups [Figure 3](#medicina-58-01358-f003)and [Figure 4](#medicina-58-01358-f004). 3.3. Impact of Both Treatment Arms on the Clinical Outcomes [Table 2](#medicina-58-01358-t002). By the end of treatment, 55% of patients in the high-dose vitamin D group (group 2) compared to 45% of patients in the low-dose vitamin D (group 1) were severe in illness (p = 0.09). In group 2, 47% of the patients compared to 51% of the patients in group 1 needed low oxygen (p = 0.42). In group two, 67% of the patients in compared to 33% of the patients in group 1 needed high oxygen or a non-invasive mechanical ventilator (NIV) (p = 0.03). In group 2, 25% of the patients compared to 67% of the patients in group 1 needed an invasive mechanical ventilator (MV) (p = 0.03). In group 2, 42% of the patients compared to 65% of the patients in group 1 required ICU admission (p = 0.016). In group 2, 55% of the patients compared to 29% of the patients in group 1 showed clinical improvement (p = 0.03). In group 2, 45% of the patients compared to 55% of the patients in group 1 died (p = 0.49). In group 2, 33% of the patients compared to 64% of the patients in group 1 showed secondary bacterial infection in the form of sepsis (p = 0.04). 3.4. Predictors of Clinical Improvement by Binary Logistic Regression Analysis [Table 3](#medicina-58-01358-t003). [Table 4](#medicina-58-01358-t004). 3.5. Predictors of [7](#B7-medicina-58-01358)]. In critically ill patients, 25-OH-cholecalciferol levels are inversely linked with the incidence of abrupt respiratory failure. In addition, Biesalski et al. (2020) emphasized that there is a deadly association between vitamin D deficiency and comorbidities in COVID-19 patients [ [26](#B26-medicina-58-01358)]. In addition, another study indicated that optimizing the vitamin D status certainly has benefits in COVID-19 patients [ [27](#B27-medicina-58-01358)]. This study revealed that the incidence of mechanical ventilation, ICU hospitalization, death, sepsis, and atrial fibrillation in the high-dosage vitamin D group was considerably reduced compared to the low-dosage vitamin D group. However, the need for high oxygen was significantly higher in the high-dose vitamin D group compared to the low-dose group. Additionally, there was a significant difference in the monitored parameters before and after treatment in favor of the high-dose vitamin D group including CRP, LDH, D-Dimer, ferritin, TLC, AST, and ALT, which were significantly lower in the high-dose vitamin D group compared to the low-dose group. Furthermore, a greater percentage of patients who were given large doses of vitamin D demonstrated better clinical improvement, a shorter amount of time needed for improvement, and a shorter amount of time spent in the hospital. [28](#B28-medicina-58-01358)]. In addition, Castillo and colleagues demonstrated that the administration of vitamin D, as opposed to a placebo, decreased the number of COVID-19 patients who required intensive care unit treatment in 76 hospitalized patients who were receiving the most effective treatment available [ [29](#B29-medicina-58-01358)]. [30](#B30-medicina-58-01358)]. Moreover, a number of studies indicate that the severity of hypovitaminosis D appears to be associated with a poor prognosis of COVID-19. This is because COVID-19 cases that are accompanied by hypovitaminosis D are more likely to exhibit severe COVID-19 symptoms, which can lead to death [ [7](#B7-medicina-58-01358), [31](#B31-medicina-58-01358)]. Both the mean blood concentration of vitamin D and the levels of IL-6 were revealed to be independent predictors of COVID-19 severity and death. Significant negative relationships were established between the two variables [ [32](#B32-medicina-58-01358)]. [33](#B33-medicina-58-01358)]. In addition, strong associations between vitamin D deficiency and hospitalization, illness severity, and mortality, especially in the elderly, have been recently indicated by a non-peer-reviewed study conducted in Cincinnati [ [29](#B29-medicina-58-01358)]. This is owing to the fact that a severe lack of vitamin D is considered to be a reliable predictor of community-acquired pneumonia [ [34](#B34-medicina-58-01358)]. [35](#B35-medicina-58-01358), [36](#B36-medicina-58-01358)]. These results are in line with the research that has questioned the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 [ [37](#B37-medicina-58-01358)]. Additionally, the results of a recent study that was conducted on COVID-19 patients showed that older COVID-19 patients who used vitamin D3 supplements had a greater survival rate after three needed for assessing whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation may significantly improve the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and its prognosis, and if it plays a vital role in decreasing the mortality rate in high-risk patients or not. 5.
