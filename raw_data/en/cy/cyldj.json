The terms of reference of the working group are to: 1. Recommend the vision, values, goals, objectives and indicators of a long -term (5 year) strategy in Global Health for the Faculty of Medicine ; 2. Develop and implement a roadmap for the coordination of activities ( research, education and creative professional activities ) of faculty and students in global health; 3. Develop principles and criteria for collaboration or affiliation with international institutions; 4. Develop a strategy for communicating and linking global health initiatives within the Faculty, affiliated partners an d externally; 5. Elaborat e a mechanism (or mechanisms) for sharing expertise and partnering with the Health Sciences Faculties and the University on evolving strategic issues in global health and a framework for partnership that meets each Faculty's strategic goals. Definition of Global Health The Working Group agreed on the following definition of global health to provide greater clarity around the focus of its deliberations. Global health is \"an area for study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide. Global health emphasizes transnational health issues, determinants, and solutions; involves many disciplines within and beyond the health sciences and promotes interdisc iplinary collaboration; and is a synthesis of population -based prevention with individual -level clinical care \". (Koplan JP, Bond TC, Merson MH, Reddy KS, Rodriguez MH, Sewankambo NK, et al. Towards a common definition of global health. Lancet 2009; 373:1993-5) Context The Faculty of Medicine has a long history in international and global health. In 2000, the Faculty established a Centre for International Health (CIH) with a view to enhance the University's research, education and creative professional activities in inter and multinational health endeavors, thereby providing a new focus of excellence and scholarship at the University1. The Centre was established as a program within the Department of Health Policy Management and Evaluation2. The belief was that through a more systematic and coordinated approach to international health, the Centre would leverage the high number and quality of human resources at the University. The CIH's intention was to create a new environment for interdisciplinary res earch, teaching and information dissemination. It would attract visiting scholars and international students and would further engage the University of Toronto into world -wide health research, teaching and development networks. The CIH was expected to provide a focal point for U of T faculty and students to learn about and make contributions to t he growing global health agenda. 1 The University of Toronto Centre for International Health, Proposal, May 10 , 2000 2 The CIH never sought or received approval as an EDU, nor was there a formal relationship between HPME and other departments o r faculties with respect to the Centre Medicine at U of T: A Roadmap for Global Health 2011 -2016 4 In 2005 the Centre moved to the Department of Public Health Sciences as an academic program and became part of the new Dalla Lan a School of Public Health when the latter was established in 2008. As of January 2011 the Division of Global Health was created within the School. CIH activities were subsumed under the new Division of Global Health . The Dalla Lana School of Public Health describes its global health focus as \"the inter -relationships among local, regional, national and international factors influencing health, as well as the effective program and policy interventions that will address these factors. A stron g equity orientation means that emphasis is given to low -income countries, their relationships to high -income countries and marginalized populations in all countries\". Global health is a core commitment for the Dalla Lana School of Public Health as part of the Faculty of Medicine . Why a Faculty of Medicine Global Health Strategy ? There is significant activity and commitment to global health across the Faculty of Medicine. Increasingly, academic departments and units within the Faculty are developing global health strategies, embedding a global health orientation in their curriculum, supporting faculty and learner local and international experiences and establishing partnerships across the globe. As the world indeed becomes flatter, the demand for greater engagement within and outside our complex network of diverse communities grows. Achieving the Faculty's vision of \"International leadership in improving health through innovation in research and education\", and its mission of \"We fulfill our social responsibility through developing leaders, contributing to our communities, and improving health of individuals and populations through the discovery, application and communication of knowledge\", requir es a broader , inter disciplinary and multilateral world view. A commitment to global health is central to the Faculty's priority strategic direction for Social Responsibility. Vision , Mission and Principles for Global Health The first task of the G loba l Health Working Group was to articulate a vision, mission and principles for Global Health for the Faculty of Medicine. A planning session was held on March 16th, 2011 in which Working Group members and a number of invited guests , considered a bold destination, core purpose and defi ning set of principles for global health . Several themes emerged as important to expressing a unique Faculty of Medicine missio n and vision for global health. These include the need to: reinforce the breadth and depth o f expertise across the Faculty of Medicine, the University of Toronto and its partnerships and foster greater synergies amongst these strengths; recognize the uniqueness of Toronto and the G reater Toronto Area as one of the most culturally diverse regi ons in the world ; be clear on outcome s of improving health and well being and alleviating the burden of suffering and disease world -wide; appreciate the relevance of both describing global health issues and conditions, as well as discovering and innovatin g through scholarly research to provid e health solutions to address these problems; confirm education, scholarship, knowledge exchange , capacity building and partnerships as the way in w hich the Faculty can best contribute to achieving these outcomes ; unde rscore the importance of interdisciplinary , reciprocity and bilateral exchanges as a means of achieving this vision and mission .

Expected Outcomes 12 - 24 months Expected Outcomes 5 Years Criteria for partnership engagement are confirmed The continuum of types of partnerships and reciprocal expectations of those partnerships have been defined; this includes protocols for international relations, affiliation agreements, letters of intent and memoranda of understanding as appropri ate The Faculty of Medicine identifies priority global health projects which it will champion and support through capacity building and educational initiatives The key partnerships in which the FOM engages are understood, including the goals and objective s of the partnerships The Faculty of Medicine establishes metrics and a framework with core indicators to demonstrate impact of the global health strategy The Faculty of Medicine and its partners demonstrate a sustained impact in global health as a resul t of progress in goals 1 - 4 above Using framework of core indicators, the Faculty of Medicine tracks achievement in global health on a regular basis Medicine at U of T: A Road map for Global Health 2011 -2016 9 Priority Actions - Year 1 To move forward with each of the five goals, we have identified the following priority actions which must be undertaken within the first twelve months of this plan . 1. Communicate, consult and share the global health vision broadly across the Faculty of Medicine. An immediate first step is to develop a targeted consultation strategy, which includes all academic units and sectors, as well as other stakeholders in global health who may not have engaged in the current Working Group process. This consultation strategy is to be developed in collabo ration with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health Division of Global Health . 2. Develop pre -departure and orientation modules. Appropriate pre-departure training for all global health learners will soon be a national requirement and has been adopted broadly by universities across the country . Appropriate training modules and the requirement to fulfill this training must be implemented in the first year of this plan. This curriculum should be built upon the success of the Global health Certificate Prog ram already offered to postgraduate trainees. 3. Conduct an environmental scan and establish a baseline for global health research. There are pockets of global health research throughout the Faculty. An inventory is required to better understand the range of activity , identify potential collaborations and establish a baseline for measuring progress towards our goal of advancing research, innovation and scholarship. 4. Map global health educational offerings. A first step in developing a robust menu of educational offerings is to understand what is currently being provided by the Faculty and its partners and to identify priority needs for new curriculum, course offerings, etc. 5. Establish criteria , and define the continuums for partnerships and the reciprocal expectations resulting from these partnerships. The Vice Dean Research and International Relations will take a lead role in clarifying the range and scope of these partnerships as well as the appropriate agreements to form alize these partnerships. 6. Develop a framework to measure the impact of the global health strategy. Metrics and core indicators are required to track progress against goals and determine the overall value and effectiveness of the global health strategy. Developing the measurement framework is an essential component of the Year 1 action plan.
