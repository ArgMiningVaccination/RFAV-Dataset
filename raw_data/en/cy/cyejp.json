Preparations of Hepatitis A Vaccine Hepatitis A (HepA) vaccines are prepared from formalin-inactivated, cell culture-derived hepatitis A virus. Both vaccines are available in pediatric and adult formulations. A combined vaccine hepatitis A vaccine/hepatitis B vaccine is also available. Indications for Hepatitis A Vaccine The hepatitis A vaccine is a routine childhood vaccination (see [CDC: Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule by Age](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html)). HepA vaccine also is indicated when any of the following is present (see [CDC: Adult Immunization Schedule by Age](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html)): A desire for protection from hepatitis A in people not previously vaccinated Travel to or work in endemic areas Occupational exposure (eg, working with primates infected with hepatitis A virus [HAV] or HAV in a research laboratory) Sex between men Use of illicit drugs (injected or not), such as methamphetamine Homelessness HIV infection in all people 1 year of age A chronic liver disorder (eg, people with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] level greater than twice the upper limit of normal) Anticipated close personal contact (eg, as members of the household or as regular babysitters) with an adopted child during the first 60 days after the child's arrival in the United States from an endemic area Healthy adults 40 years who have recently been exposed to hepatitis A virus and adults > 40 if hepatitis A immunoglobulin cannot be obtained Pregnant women who are identified to be at risk of HAV infection during pregnancy (eg, women who are international travelers, who use illicit drugs [injected or not], who have occupational exposure risk, who anticipate close personal contact with an international adoptee, or who are homeless) or who are at risk of having a severe outcome resulting from HAV infection (eg, women who have chronic liver disease or HIV infection) During hepatitis A outbreaks, people 1 year of age who are at risk of HAV infection should be vaccinated. The combination hepatitis A vaccine/hepatitis B vaccine can be used in people 18 years who have indications for either hepatitis A or hepatitis B vaccine and who have not been previously vaccinated with one of the vaccine components. Contraindications and Precautions for Hepatitis A Vaccine The main contraindication for HepA vaccine is A severe allergic reaction (eg, [anaphylaxis](/en-pr/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/allergic,-autoimmune,-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/anaphylaxis) [Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen. Symptoms... read more](/en-pr/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/allergic,-autoimmune,-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/anaphylaxis)) after previous dose or to a vaccine component The main precaution with HepA vaccine is Moderate or severe illness with or without a fever (vaccination is postponed until the illness resolves) Dose and Administration of Hepatitis A Vaccine The HepA vaccine dose is 0.5 mL IM up to age 18 years or 1 mL IM for adults (age 19 years). Children are given a 2-dose series typically at age 12 to 23 months and 6 to 18 months after the first dose. Depending on the manufacturer, adults are given the vaccine in a 2-dose series at 0 and 6 to 12 months (Havrix) or 0 and 6 to 18 months (Vaqta). Or adults may be given the combination HepA and HepB vaccine on a 3-dose schedule: at 0, 1, and 6 months. The first and second doses should be separated by 4 weeks, and the second and third doses should be separated by 5 months. Alternatively, the vaccine may be given on an accelerated 4-dose schedule: on days 0, 7, and 21 to 30, followed by a booster 12 months after the first dose. As soon as an adoption of a child from an endemic area is planned, close contacts should be given the first dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series, ideally 2 weeks before the adopted child arrives. Adverse Effects of Hepatitis A Vaccine No serious adverse effects have been reported. Mild effects include pain, erythema, swelling, and occasionally induration at the injection site.
