In addition to biodynamic-osteopathic approaches, we will also show discharge protocols, meditative exercises and naturopathic-medicinal support. The concept with which we work in the practice and on which our strategy in the accompaniment of Long Covid, acute Covid19 diseases or the accompaniment of vaccinations is based is an osteopathic therapy approach developed by me with influences from Jim Jealous, Tom Shaver, Patrick van den Heede, Jaap van der Waal, Rudolf Steiner, Dr Hemmerich. I teach this approach as part of my paediatric osteopathy training - Individual Paediatric Osteopathy. In our experience, it also makes sense to add naturopathic remedies to the treatment. We have developed our own test procedure, which has been tried and tested for years, which supports the selection of naturopathic remedies and the diagnosis. 1st evening: Theoretical and practical introduction to the therapy concept. Concept of the invisible person in us in connection with the 4 midlines according to Patrick van den Heede. 2nd evening: Theoretical and practical introduction to the diagnostic principle with Long Covid, vaccination support 3rd evening: Treatment protocol and case studies Since the beginning of the pandemic until today, Peter Altmeyer and his team have treated about 4000 patients of different ages.
