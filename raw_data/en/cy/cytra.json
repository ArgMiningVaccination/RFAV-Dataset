Unfortunately, many loved and commonly eaten Chinese dishes are high in fat and drenched in sodium-packed sauces. That's not to say you can't indulge every once in awhile, but it's important to know your best bets for preparing or ordering a healthy Chinese food meal. During holidays, such as Chinese New Year, deep fried meats, egg rolls, dumplings and cakes are served, making it difficult to eat healthfully during the holiday season. Plus, anytime you walk into a Chinese food restaurant in the United States, the menus are full of meat-centered, oily meals served with heaps of carbohydrates. But these choices do not represent the traditional Chinese diet. Traditionally, steamed vegetables have been a main staple of Chinese food. These steamed vegetables and tea, combined with only occasional red meat and minimal fried food, led to immense health benefits for Chinese people. Their traditional plant-based diet has been shown to be one of the main factors in decreased rates of heart disease, diabetes and obesity among rural Chinese people. "}
