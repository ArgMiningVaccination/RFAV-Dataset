We are first exposed to micro-organisms during the birthing process whilst being delivered through the birth canal and then acquire more through the mother's breast milk Later on, diet and environmental exposures diet can change one's micro-biome to be either beneficial to health or place one at greater risk for disease. Our microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms (also called micro-biota or microbes) of thousands of different species. Both helpful and potentially harmful microbes, (pathogenic promoting disease), but most are symbiotic where both the human body and micro-biota mutually benefit from the co-relationship. These include not only bacteria but fungi, parasites, and viruses. In balance, these \"bugs\" coexist peacefully, and the largest numbers are found in the small and large intestines but also throughout the whole body. The microbiome is considered so important in the role that it plays, in supporting so many of the key functions that promote the smooth daily operations of the human body. [https://therootbrands.com/product/relive-green/](https://therootbrands.com/product/relive-green/) A balanced microbiome is essential to our overall health as the bacteria it contains in that it not only helps digestion and break down potentially toxic compounds in our food, but regulates our immune system, protecting against other bacteria that cause disease, and produces vitamins including B vitamins B12, thiamine and riboflavin, and Vitamin K, which is needed for blood coagulation. Disturbance in that balance can be brought on by infectious illnesses, certain diets or pathogenic organisms enter the body through drinking or eating contaminated water or food. or a prolonged use of antibiotics or other bacteria-destroying medications Dysbiosis occurs, stopping these normal interactions and as a result, the body may become more susceptible to disease. [Relive Greens](https://therootbrands.com/product/relive-green/) is a powerhouse of vegetables, fruits, pre-biotics, and pro-biotics uniquely blended to work synergistically to support and balance a healthy microbiome and immune system.

Organic, Green and Clean, taken daily, as a reviving green drink or added to a smoothie, this carefully orchestrated formula has proved to be an essential health maintenance \"Must\" and vital sustenance for a healthy gut/brain balance! How Microbiota Benefit the Body There, the microbiota helps to break down these compounds with their digestive enzymes. but more complex carbohydrates like starches and fibres are not as easily digested and may travel lower to the large intestine. The fermentation of indigestible fibres causes the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) that can be used by the body as a nutrient source but also play an important role in muscle function and possibly the prevention of chronic diseases, including certain cancers and bowel disorders. Clinical studies have shown that SCFA may be useful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Microbiota stimulate the [immune system](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/nutrition-and-immunity/), break down potentially toxic food compounds, and synthesize certain vitamins and amino acids, including the B vitamins and vitamin K. For example, the key enzymes needed to form vitamin B12 are only found in bacteria, not in plants and animals.

When the chakras are balanced clear and flowing, the serpent of kundalini energy is free to rise up the spine and flow into our auric fields empowering us to step into the world of 5d and beyond. (Joy, bliss love) [https://www.organic-aromatherapy.co.uk/soma](https://www.organic-aromatherapy.co.uk/soma) Somatic Healing The SOMA Chakra vibrates in the magenta realm of ultra violet. It is not as well-known as the other chakras, veiled in the shadow of the 'Third-Eye' and supporting the crown, positioned at the hairline / widows peak, are important and worthy distinctive forces. Colour: Ultra violet/Pure White Location: Slightly above the Ajna in the centre of the peak Phenecite, diamond, Preseli Bluestone Nectar, Spiritual Connection Clarity, Completion, Expansion The 'Soma' is also known as Amria Chakra - which means 'the Nectar of the Crescent Moon'. It provides the framework for the 'A-KA-THA' - the inverted triangle, symbol of feminine energy, and the great seat of Shiva & Parvati consciousness. This impelling energy represents the realization of our inherent animation to create, preserve and dissolve; the foundational embryos which lay dormant within the First (base/root) Chakra. Think of the merkaba .. 2 pyramids interlocking and connecting. The Shiva / Parvati union is the expression of three aspects of consciousness: 'Knowing, Feeling & Doing'; the emanation of truth, beauty and goodness. The realization that these forms existing, within all expressions of life, is the expression of the highest state of living. To incorporate them into your life is the highest state of realization. Symbolically, Shiva provides the stimulus to awaken the Shakti and draw her wisdom into union with him. When first awakened she is a furious serpent whose breath is fire. She proceeds upward from her nest within the root chakra via the path of 'Sarasvati' and soon the ego subsides. Sarasvati is the goddess of eloquence and transcendent-knowledge . She is depicted as a graceful woman, holding a lute (sound), a book (wisdom), a rosary (mantra prayer), a conch (pronouncement utterance). a bell (transience), a plow (cultivation) and a bow (determination). Soma Healing Healing is a restorative process that re-kindles the essence of the Divine in every aspect thus liberating us from the suffering caused by painful experiences of life on the physical, emotional, mental, and / or spiritual plane of existence. Soma means healing nectar. This healing nectar is generated in one of the energy centres of the Chakra system of our bodies known as the Soma Chakra. The Soma Chakra is activated using touch, the Soma Chakra cream, meditation and mantra therapy. The flow of soma is directed to wherever one desires to experience healing.

The fully awakened 'Soma' is the ultimate union of Shiva and Shakti within which non-dualistic realization is achieved. Such potency is pooled physically, within us, in the energetic union of two brain glands; pituitary and pineal. The pituitary governs the stuff of physical incarnation (method). The pineal, establishing transcendent (spiritual) awareness/awakening (wisdom).Being governed by a shadowing planet Rahu it is ignored by lots of healers and Yogi's this is the most powerful of the lot. Soma Chakra governs the whole body. This chakra is situated in the forehead. It has twelve petals and is Ultra Violet in colour, with residing male energy is Shiva and the female goddess Kalratri. Meditating on the Soma Chakra clears the negativities and brings clear visionary powers to transmute. And it corresponds to all the organs of the body. Positive Potential (Balance) - Fully aware and conscious. - Rejuvenation, bliss, immortality - Physical awareness/character: union of male/female energies (Shiva/Shakti) within the spiritual plane. Active kundalini energy. Signs of Imbalance - Cut off from spiritual nourishment and connection - Attachments: Lost souls and 'walk ins' - Accelerated ageing, dryness of skin, dehydration of the body or drying up of one's spirituality Physical connection: Pineal and pituitary glands - Metal: Silver - Sound: Aum Soma Healing Healing is a restorative process that re-kindles the essence of the Divine in every aspect thus liberating us from the suffering caused by painful experiences of life on the physical, emotional, mental, and/or spiritual plane of existence.

Ayurveda is a science-based healthcare approach that treats illness and promotes wellness by focusing assessment on biochemically-unique aspects of each patient, and then individually tailoring interventions to restore psychological, physiological and structural imbalances. Ayurvedic medicine not only recognizes the uniqueness of the individual but also the oneness of all creation and how this translates into human health on all levels. There has been a worldwide surge of interest in Ayurvedic medicine as people seek health and well-being. [https://www.ayurvedacollege.org/our-courses](https://www.ayurvedacollege.org/our-courses) The College of Ayurveda and Yoga Therapy is the premier educator for individuals seeking to make a difference in the world through a career restoring the natural balance of body, mind and spirit with the wisdom of Ayurveda. This mission has been the central driving force of the College since its inception. The College of Ayurveda and Yoga Therapy is the only institution in the UK that offers a complete Ayurvedic programme comparable in content to the B. A. M. S. (Bachelor of Ayurveda Medicine & Surgery) degree course taught in India. The basic principles upon which Ayurvedic medicine/healthcare operates are: - Biochemical individuality based on genetic and environmental uniqueness; - Dynamic balance of internal and external factors; - Web-like interconnections of psycho-physiological processes; - Health as a positive vitality - not merely the absence of disease; - Promotion of organ reserve through psycho-neuro-immunological processes; - Patient-centred rather than disease focused healthcare. Using these principles, Ayurvedic healthcare practitioners focus on understanding the fundamental physiological processes, the environmental inputs, and the genetic predisposition that influence every person's experience of health and disease. A person is considered an integral part of the Universe which is governed by natural laws. Ayurveda works primarily on human constitution called Dosha and Prakruti through lifestyle counselling, herbal preparations, nutrition, massage, yoga and Panchakarma all used to bring about balance and harmony in the body. The College, which promote the values of a tolerant and democratic society and the ideals of scholarship and the benefits of life-long education and training, aims to provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive Ayurvedic medical education.

We will remember him as the kindest of men and the most brilliant of thinkers. His love of beauty extended way past his tireless pursuit for excellent quality in aromatic ingredients into perfumery, music, poetry, history, and stories of Glastonbury's Ladies of the Lake. His brain was rich with curiosity, adoring the quest for knowledge. His astute mind analysed, assessed, and saw to the truth of so many situations, medical, cosmetological, political and otherwise. His understanding of how fixed oils affected the skin was unparalleled and he remains one of the foremost authorities on the biome and how environmental factors may influence disease. And yet, alongside his scientific and rational brain, he possessed the most glorious imagination able to create stunning word pictures that drew his listeners in. Jan knew, (put very simply), a great many things. [https://www.facebook.com/fragrantearth](https://www.facebook.com/fragrantearth) Over the years, he scattered teaching seeds far and wide, generously casting them and carefully watching where they fell. When a sapling mind burst forth, he was there to nourish and support them, always for the good of the industry that he loved so much.. He was a teacher, a creator, a builder, and a great friend. Myriad projects have been made better by his input and while he created many wonderful things, he has probably nurtured equally many things for other people that no-one talks about. Jan was the most honourable of men. A man of great vision, and a visionary man. He wandered through the streets of Glastonbury, dapper in his suit, as all the finest gentlemen do, smiling at hippies in floating dresses and men in steam punk hats waved back, familiar and accepting of everyone, as he always was. He will be missed by his life partner, by Glastonbury, by his family, by employees of Fragrant Earth, by his friends and by a much wider aromatic family worldwide. His humility perhaps prevented him from knowing just how important his presence was. We know how much he was admired and respected, but sometimes we wonder if he did. So please, we'd ask you to join us. Close your eyes for a moment and bring to mind some of the ways he touched your life. Perhaps it was feasting over great food which he adores, listening to his soft spoken teachings, or listening to him chuckle, chortle, or guffaw. He did like to laugh, did our lovely Jan, Or maybe simply, it was being able to open a bottle of essential oil and trusting it as the best quality, beautiful version he could source for you to enjoy. Of course, that legacy lives on and will always do so through Fragrant Earth. This has been a terrible shock for all of us. So, if, like us, you are not quite ready to let go yet, perhaps peer up into tonight's inky sky. Search for the star that scintillates brightest and imagine that mischievous twinkle in his eye. Maybe light a candle as we have and watch as the flame flickers like his cheeky smile when he'd said something and waited for the penny to drop. For us, it will continue.

[Thrity Engineer](https://www.positivehealth.com/author/thrity-engineer/thrity-engineer), founder of the Supercoherence System and co-creator of the Supercoherence Return To Love Frequencies was born in 1942 in Mumbai, India and died on 8th March 2023, also in Mumbai. [https://www.supercoherencereturntolovebook.com/](https://www.supercoherencereturntolovebook.com/) It was a blessed passing. She had just travelled back to her place of birth- Mumbai, India after not being able to travel for over 3 years. She was delighted to be back, having had an unexpectedly lovely trip from London, where she had lived and worked. After spending a beautiful day with her loved ones, filled with joy, warmth, good food, and even better company, she retired for the night. In the early hours of the following morning she awoke, went to tell her cousin that she couldn't breathe (although without displaying any signs of distress), then sat on an armchair and took her leave. It was all so quick, so painless and full of ease and grace. Of course, we were shocked and terribly upset....for ourselves! But the beauty and perfection of all that unfolded was not lost on us, her family and friends. Thrity herself had often referred to physical death as a \"change of cosmic address\"- a phrase coined by a client of hers many years ago, and one with which she resonated based on her own experience, particularly in relation to her work. Thrity was an explorer, a pioneer and entrepreneur, and author of two books - [Supercoherence - The 7th Sense](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Supercoherence-7th-Sense-Thrity-Engineer/dp/1401915841) and [Supercoherence The Return To Love;](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Supercoherence-Return-Love-Thrity-Engineer/dp/1910708003) as well as being the founder of the Supercoherence System and creator of the Supercoherence Frequencies, amongst other things. She worked very closely with her daughter Meher right until the end. (Meher is committed to the task of continuing and growing the work they did together). Thrity touched very many lives in the course of her life in profound and often magical ways. Being highly sensitive and intuitive, she would often pick up the phone and call a loved one just when they needed it. Her words of wisdom, forthright but generous counsel, and tender loving care and attention are very much missed by family and friends alike. Perhaps her greatest gift and legacy to us all was to have been a living example of the power of following your dreams and living your own truth fearlessly, of the transformation that is possible for us all as humans, and the ability to come to/ from a place of unconditional love when we have the awareness, willingness and appropriate tools for the job. Her dream, vision and heartfelt desire was to help ease and break the age-old cycle of human suffering. In her death as well as in her life, she remained true to that.
