OUR UNIQUE SERVICES LASER is an acronym that stands for \"Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\". Commonly the term \"LASER\" refers to the device that emits the light. This light is special and unique because it is coherent, monochromatic, and collimated. Shockwave therapy is currently being used to treat a growing number of joint, tendon, and muscular disorders. These include: arthritis of multiple joints, tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis), tendinitis of numerous muscles, plantar fasciitis, frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) and many other inflammatory conditions. Adjacent vertebrae in the spine are separated by discs. Compression of these discs due to load bearing or vibration can cause nerve impingement and pain. At night, while we sleep the discs are no longer under pressure and absorb water through a process known as imbibition. We actively perform this imbibition process by decompression, which is accomplished through the use of our Leander Flexion/Distraction Tables.
