Robert Brulle, PhD, professor, Department of Sociology Climate Change and Society: Sociological Perspectives Climate change is one of the most critical issues of the 21st century, presenting a major intellectual challenge to both the natural and social sciences. While there has been significant progress in natural science understanding of climate change, social science analyses have not been as fully developed. 'Climate Change and Society' breaks new theoretical and empirical ground by presenting climate change as a thoroughly social phenomenon, embedded in behaviors, institutions and cultural practices. Brian P. Daly, PhD, assistant professor, Department of Psychology Aimee K. Hildenbrand, clinical psychology doctoral candidate, Department of Psychology ADHD in Children and Adolescents This is a comprehensive overview of essential information for understanding, assessing and treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

However, there is a wealth of research that shows that the traditional incarceration model is not effective with this population, and that many of these individuals can be helped in the community at less cost without increased risk to public safety by addressing their risk-relevant needs and improving their opportunities for recovery. As a result, during the last decade there has been an increasing interest in community-based alternatives to incarceration for individuals with severe mental illness. Richardson Dilworth, PhD, professor, Department of Politics Informatics: Collaboration at the Nexus of Policy, Technology and Design, People and Data Information shapes urban spaces in ways that most people rarely stop to consider. From data-driven planning to grassroots activism to influencing the routes we walk, bike and drive, new information technologies are helping city dwellers to leverage information in new ways.

Among the stories by young writers are two by current Drexel student Shalom Mensu Ikhena. Anthony Glascock, PhD, professor, Anthropology A Dead Cow, Milkshakes, Hyper-Masculinity and Jinn: Stories from Fieldwork in Somalia Anthropology is a narrative discipline and Anthony Glascock has always used stories from his research to illustrate important points in class. The problem has been that the students more often remember the stories, but not always the point that the story is to illustrate. In this book, Glascock starts with the stories from his research in Somalia and uses them to draw out the important points, rather than the other way around. It is a different approach, but one that is quite effective. John Kounios, PhD, professor, director of doctoral program in Applied Cognitive and Brain Science, director of Creativity Research Lab, Department of Psychology The Eureka Factor: Aha Moments, Creative Insight, and the Brain In a book perfect for readers of Charles Duhigg's 'The Power of Habit,' David Eagleman's 'Incognito,' and Leonard Mlodinow's 'Subliminal,' the cognitive neuroscientists who discovered how the brain has Aha Moments -- sudden creative insights -- explain how they happen, when we need them and how we can have more of them to enrich our lives and empower our personal and professional success.

Mimi Sheller, PhD, professor, director of the Center for Mobilities Research and Policy, Department of Sociology Mobility and Locative Media: Mobile Communication in Hybrid Spaces The growing pervasiveness of location-aware technology urges us to rethink the intersection among location, mobile technologies and mobility. Few studies have addressed the many transformations taking place in mobile sociality and in urban spatial processes through the appropriation of these technologies. This edited collection will address this gap by exploring the intersection of mobility, mobile communication and locative media, as well as the implications of this for adjacent fields such as mobile art, mobile gaming, architecture, design and urban planning. James Spotila, PhD, L. Drew Betz Chair Professor, Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science Leatherback Turtles: Biology and Conservation Weighing as much as 2,000 pounds and reaching lengths of over seven feet, leatherback turtles are the world's largest reptile.

Brendan Triplett (Michael Westen), student, Criminal Justice Department ID It doesn't matter how the world ends, only that those who are left behind must take up the standard of humanity and see us through the darkest days. Through the eyes of the living and the poor souls who become the undead we learn just who will inherit the earth. Will the hordes of undead prevail? Will heroes rise and save us all? Will our sanity reach its limits and turn us into monsters far more dangerous then those we seek to kill? Christine Maguth Nezu, PhD, professor, Department of Psychology Arthur M. Nezu, PhD, Distinguished University Professor of Psychology The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies This handbook provides a contemporary and comprehensive illustration of the wide range of evidence-based behavioral and cognitive psychotherapy tools available to both clinicians and researchers.

This book provides a complete set of tools and case examples for the development of pre-design performance criteria for facility projects. COLLEGE OF MEDICINE Herbert B. Allen, MD, professor and chair, Department of Dermatology The Etiology of Atopic Dermatitis This book presents completely new, unique findings in eczema: sweat ducts that become occluded with staphylococcal biofilms trigger the innate immune system with TLR2 receptor activity and this leads to production of the 'itching' and inflammation in this disease. Dermatologists and pediatricians treat eczema exceedingly well and this is ordinarily accomplished with corticosteroid containing topicals. However, after treatment, it is intriguing that aggressive moisturization and cautious bathing will in most instances prevent future flares of the disease. Michele L. Spotts, instructional designer, Department of Emergency Medicine Zotts & His Unfortunate Spots This is the tale of a zebra named Zotts who was unfortunately born with spots instead of stripes. Every day a monkey named Marty walks around the zoo saying hello to all the animals. When he stops at the zebra pen, he notices Zotts and laughs at him for being different.

KLINE SCHOOL OF LAW Adam Benforado, associate professor Unfair: The New Science of Criminal Injustice A child is gunned down by a police officer. An investigator ignores critical clues in a case. An innocent man confesses to a crime he did not commit. A jury acquits a killer. The evidence is all around us: our system of justice is fundamentally broken. But it's not for the reasons we tend to think. Even if the system operated exactly as it was designed to, we would still end up with wrongful convictions, trampled rights and unequal treatment. In 'Unfair,' Benforado shines a light on this troubling new field of research, showing, for example, that people with certain facial features receive longer sentences and that judges are far more likely to grant parole first thing in the morning. David S. Cohen, professor Krysten Connon, alumna Living in the Crosshairs: The Untold Stories of Anti-Abortion Terrorism Living in the Crosshairs is a rich and humane portrait of women's health professionals who persist in their work despite harassment because they believe in what they are doing.

Witty and insightful, 'Called On' is an insider's peek into the struggles of learning law and the satisfaction of finding a new path in life. Donald F. Tibbs, PhD, associate professor Hip Hop and the Law What is important to understanding American law? What is important to understanding hip hop? Wide swaths of renowned academics, practitioners, commentators and performance artists have answered these two questions independently. And although understanding both depends upon the same intellectual enterprise, textual analysis of narrative storytelling, somehow their intersection has escaped critical reflection. 'Hip Hop and the Law' merges the two cultural giants of law and rap music and demonstrates their relationship at the convergence of legal consciousness, politics, hip hop studies and American law.

Demoulas, the company's managers and rank-and-file workers struck back. Risking their own livelihoods to restore the job of their beloved boss they walked out, but they didn't walk far.

Callahan, clinical professor, program director of Human Resource Development Realizing Critical HRD: Stories of Reflecting, Voicing, and Enacting Critical Practice This book contends that the project of Critical Human Resource Development (CHRD) is to effect change/transformation and that critical scholars must expose the injustices and inequities associated with the neoliberal narrative, which forms the dominant rationality of current mainstream HRD practice.
