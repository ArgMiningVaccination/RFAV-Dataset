Live [bacterial](https://www.rxlist.com/bacterial/definition.htm) [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) are biological products that provide [immunity](https://www.rxlist.com/immunity/definition.htm) against certain bacterial infections. Live bacterial vaccines stimulate the body's [immune system](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_system/definition.htm) to produce antibodies against specific types of [bacteria](https://www.rxlist.com/bacteria/definition.htm) and protect a vaccinated individual from diseases caused by these bacteria. Live bacterial vaccines are weakened ( [attenuated](https://www.rxlist.com/attenuated/definition.htm)) forms of [disease](https://www.rxlist.com/disease/definition.htm)-causing bacteria. Live bacterial vaccines produce a strong and often life-long immunity similar to the [acquired immunity](https://www.rxlist.com/acquired_immunity/definition.htm) from a natural [infection](https://www.rxlist.com/infection/definition.htm), but without causing serious disease, because they only contain a small amount of the weakened bacteria. Live bacterial vaccines are derived by weakening the disease-causing bacteria [in](https://www.rxlist.com/in/definition.htm) laboratories, usually with repeated culturing. Live bacterial vaccines must be stored and handled with care because they are fragile and can be damaged by heat and light. Live bacterial vaccines may not be safe for individuals with compromised immunity. People with weakened [immune](https://www.rxlist.com/immune/definition.htm) systems should consult with their [health](https://www.rxlist.com/health/definition.htm) care providers before receiving live bacterial vaccines, because they may cause severe infections that their immune systems may be unable to [control](https://www.rxlist.com/control_research/definition.htm). [BCG](https://www.rxlist.com/bcg/definition.htm) ( [bacillus](https://www.rxlist.com/bacillus/definition.htm) Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) live bacterial vaccine that [tuberculosis](https://www.rxlist.com/tuberculosis/definition.htm) ( [TB](https://www.rxlist.com/tb/definition.htm)) is also used as [immunotherapy](https://www.rxlist.com/immunotherapy/definition.htm) in treating [bladder cancer](https://www.rxlist.com/bladder_cancer/definition.htm). The vaccine stimulates the immune system to attack the [cancer](https://www.rxlist.com/cancer/definition.htm) cells. BCG vaccine is derived from [Mycobacterium](https://www.rxlist.com/mycobacterium/definition.htm) bovis which is similar to [Mycobacterium tuberculosis](https://www.rxlist.com/mycobacterium_tuberculosis/definition.htm) that causes TB. The [FDA](https://www.rxlist.com/fda/definition.htm)-approved live bacterial vaccines provide immunity against the following bacterial infectious diseases: - Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis [Cholera](https://www.rxlist.com/cholera/definition.htm), caused by [Vibrio cholerae](https://www.rxlist.com/vibrio_cholerae/definition.htm)serogroup 01 [Typhoid fever](https://www.rxlist.com/typhoid_fever/definition.htm), caused by [Salmonella](https://www.rxlist.com/salmonella/definition.htm)typhi How are live bacterial vaccines used? Live bacterial vaccines are mostly administered as single or a series of doses through the following routes: [Oral](https://www.rxlist.com/oral/definition.htm)suspensions or capsules [Intramuscular](https://www.rxlist.com/intramuscular_im/definition.htm)(IM) injections into the [muscle](https://www.rxlist.com/muscle/definition.htm) [Percutaneous](https://www.rxlist.com/percutaneous/definition.htm)injections the [skin](https://www.rxlist.com/skin/definition.htm) - Instillation into the [bladder](https://www.rxlist.com/bladder/definition.htm)with a [catheter](https://www.rxlist.com/catheter/definition.htm) Live bacterial vaccines approved by the FDA include: - BCG vaccine for [immunization](https://www.rxlist.com/immunization/definition.htm)against tuberculosis for: - Adults and children in developing countries, primarily. - TB exposed health care workers in high-risk settings. - BCG vaccine as immunotherapy in bladder cancer in adults. [Cholera vaccine](https://www.rxlist.com/cholera-vaccine-drug.htm)for immunization in persons of ages 2-64 traveling to cholera-affected areas. [Typhoid](https://www.rxlist.com/typhoid/definition.htm)vaccine for selective immunization against typhoid [fever](https://www.rxlist.com/fever/definition.htm)in adults and children traveling to typhoid- [endemic](https://www.rxlist.com/endemic/definition.htm)areas. What are side effects of live bacterial vaccines? Side effects of live bacterial vaccines may include the following: [Malaise](https://www.rxlist.com/malaise/definition.htm) - Fever [Headache](https://www.rxlist.com/headache/definition.htm) [Pain](https://www.rxlist.com/pain/definition.htm)and soreness [Induration](https://www.rxlist.com/induration/definition.htm)(hardening of the [tissue](https://www.rxlist.com/tissue/definition.htm)) at the injection site - General aches [Chills](https://www.rxlist.com/chills/definition.htm) [Nausea](https://www.rxlist.com/nausea/definition.htm) - Vomiting - Loose stools/ [diarrhea](https://www.rxlist.com/diarrhea/definition.htm) [Abdominal pain](https://www.rxlist.com/abdominal_pain/definition.htm) of consciousness - Increase in [blood urea nitrogen](https://www.rxlist.com/blood_urea_nitrogen/definition.htm)( [BUN](https://www.rxlist.com/bun/definition.htm)) - Increased [creatinine](https://www.rxlist.com/creatinine/definition.htm)in the blood - [sepsis](https://www.rxlist.com/sepsis/definition.htm) - Coagulopathy (bleeding disorder) - Myoglobinuria from to muscle [cell](https://www.rxlist.com/cell/definition.htm)) [Nephritis](https://www.rxlist.com/nephritis/definition.htm)( [kidney](https://www.rxlist.com/kidney/definition.htm)inflammation) [Uveitis](https://www.rxlist.com/uveitis/definition.htm)(inflammation of the [uvea](https://www.rxlist.com/uvea/definition.htm), the middle layer of the [eye](https://www.rxlist.com/eye/definition.htm)) Information contained herein is not intended to cover all possible side effects, precautions, warnings, drug interactions, allergic reactions, or adverse effects.
