In many respects, Western medicine also had similar origins and beliefs, however, the introduction of anatomical dissection and progressive application of scientific evidence based practices have resulted in divergent paths taken by these systems. We examined the lives, careers, and contributions made by nine ancient Indian physicians. Ancient texts, translations of these texts, books, and biographical works were consulted to obtain relevant information, both for Indian traditional medicine as well as for Western medicine. Ayurveda has retained principles enunciated by these physicians, with minor conceptual advances over the centuries. Western medicine separated from ancient Indian medicine several hundred years ago, and remains the foundation of modern medicine. Modern medicine is evidence based, and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard by which efficacy of treatment is evaluated. Ayurvedic medicine has not undergone such critical evaluation to any large extent. The few RCTs that have evaluated alternative medical treatment recently have shown that such therapy is no better than placebo; however, placebo treatment is 30% effective. We suggest that foreign domination, initially by Mughals, and later by the British, may have contributed, in part, to this inertia and protracted status quo. Keywords: Ancient medicine, biographical study, evolution of medicine Ancient Indian medical traditions span millennia, and its legendary physicians are known for many contributions to traditional as well as modern medicine. Information about individuals who lived several thousand years ago is not easy to obtain, especially when records of births, deaths, educational institutions, and case records do not exist. However, much may be gleaned from texts attributed to them, and from written historical and biographical treatises. We examined the lives of nine legendary Indian physicians, with three objectives. Firstly, to describe their medical contributions; secondly, to determine if Indian and Western medical traditions share similarities in their evolution; and thirdly, to determine the contribution of these physicians to modern medicine. Since some of these physicians have mythological references, it is not possible to verify when and whether they existed. References to medicine in the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda are largely theurgic, and rely on divine and supernatural remedies to treat bodily ailments. It is only during the post-Vedic period (800 BC to 1000 AD) that ancient Indian medicine began to develop and take on the form as it is known today. An elegant story illustrates both the charm and the difficulty in obtaining accurate information about these ancient physicians, and also in deciphering fact from myth. During a conference of ancient rishis it was determined that someone should obtain medical knowledge to cure the many ills that plagued humanity. This knowledge had been imparted by the divine creator Lord Brahma, first to Daksha, then to the Ashwini twins, and finally to Indra, Lord of the heavens. Bharadwaja volunteered for this mission and brought back the necessary information from Indra. Bharadwaja's pupils included Atreya, and it was Agnivesha (circa 800 BC), a student of Atreya who is credited to be the author of the first Indian treatise on medicine. Ashwini twins: (Mythological) These celestial physicians Bharadwaja (Mythological) This ancient rishi (sage) and the father of the great Dronacharaya (Mahabharata), was one of the greatest rishis of his time, known to be one of the seven great rishis (saptarishis) of India. The others being Atri, Gautama, Jamadagni, Kashyapa, Vasishtha, and Vishvamitra. He was famous for his insatiable appetite for learning and scholarship. Another story depicts him as an orphan adopted by Bharata, son of King Dushyanta and Shakuntala. As mentioned earlier and referred to in the Charaka Samhita, Bharadwaja was selected by the rishis to go to Indra and learn the science of life (Ayurveda). After returning from the heavens, Bharadwaja in turn taught Ayurveda to his disciples, a group that included Divodasa Dhanvantari, a king from Benaras (not to be mistaken for the physician to the Gods who also carried the same name, and is discussed next). Dhanvantari (Mythological) An ancient physician by this name lived before the time of Sushruta. He is mentioned in the Sushruta Samhita, Although a celestial physician, Dhanvantari was taught Ayurveda by none other than Bharadwaja, and he taught his disciples the Shalya Tantra (Surgery). He is credited with the discovery of the antiseptic properties of turmeric and the preservative properties of salt, principles which were incorporated in his cures. He has several ayurvedic preparations named after him (Dhanvantari ghritam, rasa rajendra, among others), and he is also credited as being the author of Chikitsa Tatva Vigyan, Dhanvantari Nighantu, among others. Rajgriha (Rajgir, Bihar) near Nalanda and Gaya, Jivaka became one of the most celebrated physicians of his time. Upon learning of his humble origins, Jivaka sought to earn respect by becoming a great physician. He traveled along the established trade route to Taxila University (near Islamabad, Pakistan) to study medicine under the tutelage of the famous teacher Atreya. He studied for seven years and his powers of observation and deduction were similar to those of the legendary Sherlock Holmes. There are many stories written about various episodes in his career, and we would be remiss without narrating two of the very best. Prior to graduation, Jivaka and his classmates were asked to go to a nearby hill and bring back plants that did not possess medical properties. Most of the students returned with a variety of plants, but a disappointed Jivaka returned much later without any and said 'O teacher, all things (i.e. plants) are remedies; there exists nothing which is not a remedy'. Jivaka's contributions include the use of purgatives for constipation, abdominal surgery for intestinal obstruction, and the use of herbal remedies for wound healing. He is best known for his amazing powers of observation and intuition. Illustrations of Jivaka's work have been detailed in the Bower manuscript, and in Buddhist chronicles such as Deepvamsa and Mahavamsa. Sushruta (Benaras, 4 th century BC to 3 rd century AD) Perhaps the most prominent of all ancient Indian physicians, Sushruta is considered to be the father of Indian surgery as well as the first plastic surgeon in the world. The text attributed to him, though not available in its original form, is called 'Sushruta Tantra'. It was subsequently revised and expanded by Nagarjuna into the work we now know as Sushruta Samhita. Sushruta is most famous for introducing rhinoplasty, a procedure performed commonly since mutilation of the nose was often the punishment accorded to criminals and prisoners. The procedure described by him is as follows, 'Now I shall deal with the process of affixing an artificial nose. First the leaf of a creeper, long and broad enough to fully cover the whole of the severed or clipped part should be gathered, and a patch of living flesh, equal in dimension to the preceding leaf, should be sliced off (from below upwards) from the region of the cheek and, after scarifying it with a knife, swiftly adhered to the severed nose.' Charaka (Northern India, 1 st century AD) There is considerable disagreement about the period during which Charaka lived. Charaka emphasized a rational approach to the etiology and treatment of diseases and relied heavily on physical examination and direct observation. He believed that success required a team approach - emphasizing that the skill of the physician needed to be complemented by appropriate nursing care, dietary and therapeutic interventions, and participation by the patient. He introduced the concept of digestion, immunity, metabolism, and the genetic basis of inherited characteristics. He believed that genetic defects were transmitted by either the sperm or the ovum. He attributed a central role to the heart, and taught that the body contained 360 bones (including the teeth). He is credited with proposing a revolutionary idea - that prevention was as important, if not more so, than treatment. He emphasized the importance of cleanliness, exercise, and a healthy diet and lifestyle. He advocated professionalism, laying down a strict code of ethics, warning against malpractice by incompetent or unscrupulous physicians who merely wished to profit from the illness of their patients. Moreover, he believed that treatment should be customized for each patient since the conditions under which the illness occurred varied between one patient and another. Charaka's approach was a major milestone in the advancement of ancient Indian medicine, away from the belief that illness was caused by supernatural forces that needed treatment by prayers, rites, and rituals. He believed that disease was caused by natural phenomena, and therefore natural, rather than spiritual, means were necessary to enable a cure. Nagarjuna (1 st century BC to 4 th century AD) Famously recalled in ancient Indian texts as 'Bodhisattva Nagarjuna', the father of chemotherapy, considerable doubt exists about the period during which he lived, and it is more than likely that we are dealing with more than one person when we consider all that is attributed to Nagarjuna. Vagbhatta (circa 4 th to 7 th century AD) It has been argued that Vagbhatta lived during the reign of King Samudragupta (AD 325-375), or at a much later period in the 7 th century AD. Vagbhatta broke with tradition by questioning the concepts and ideas behind kapha, pitta and vayu. He emphasized the importance of personal hygiene to good health, and introduced the importance of combating pollution by elaborating the role of contaminated river water in adversely affecting health. He prepared numerous antidotes and worked on their formulae, some of which are in use today (e.g. asafetida churna). Madhava (circa 7 th century AD) Not much is known about Madhava, perhaps owing to the fact that this was a very common name. Historians have identified several dozen prominent individuals with the same name, and this has added to the difficulty and confusion that arises when one studies Madhava. Madhava is famous for being the best pathologist and diagnostician of his time. He was the son of Indukar (a disciple of Vagbhatta) and an astute pathologist in his own right. Madhava's text includes chapters on the pathology of a wide variety of ailments such as fever, hemorrhage, asthma, diarrhea, worms, anemia, jaundice and much more. His systematic approach included five methods of evaluating a disease - etiology, the prodromal or preclinical stage, main presenting signs and symptoms, complications, and progression of the illness. He developed astute diagnostic criteria for these diseases at each stage of the illness. He suggested that each disease was an independent entity and other diseases may follow as complications. However, he emphasized the importance of distinguishing one illness from another, and introduced the concept of differential diagnosis. He also popularized the notion of symptom clusters and specificity. Before 800 BC, illness and disease were felt to be a result of divine or supernatural influences. Although the extent to which cadaveric or animal dissection occurred in ancient India is not known, this practice began in the West with another Greek physician, Galen (131 - 201 AD). Many aspects of the origins of traditional Indian and Western medicine bear close resemblance. Prayer and holistic approaches predominated thinking until supernatural causes gave way to natural ones. Here too, the concept of balancing various body fluids and gases (ethers) prevailed for centuries, until dissection and experimentation gave a scientific basis to medical practice. What remains amazing is that ancient practitioners were able to achieve so much even in the absence of what we now consider scientific knowledge. Performing simple as well as complicated cosmetic surgical operations, Sushruta is accepted as the first surgeon and the father of plastic surgery. It is remarkable that he was able to describe a malaria-like illness attributable to mosquito bites. The code of ethics enforced by Hippocrates, Sushruta, and Charaka had many similarities. The elaboration of specific diagnostic criteria by Madhava predates those used by modern clinicians by centuries. Yet, despite these advantages, while Western medicine continued to make steady progress, traditional Indian medicine remained firmly entrenched in the status quo. As indicated earlier, the attitudes of Mughal and British rulers may have played a role, but even today, in the absence of outside rulers, few investigators carry out rigorous scientific examinations to validate the efficacy of various Ayurvedic treatments. Two recent books have examined the benefits of alternative complementary medicine of various origins.
