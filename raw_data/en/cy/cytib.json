There are over 160 Waldorf Schools in the USA. Waldorf schools have their foundations in [anthroposophy](https://waldorfeducation.org/showpage.aspx?relid=624401\u00aeistered=1), which the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America defines as \"the belief that humanity has the wisdom to transform itself and the world, through one's own spiritual development.\" Some of these Waldorf schools are the leading Nonmedical Exemption (NME) schools in various states, such as: - Waldorf School of Mendocino County (California) - 79.1% - Tucson Waldorf Schools (Arizona) - 69.6% - Cedar Springs Waldorf School (California) - 64.7% - Waldorf School of San Diego (California) - 63.6% - Orchard Valley Waldorf School (Vermont) - 59.4% - Whidbey Island Waldorf School (Washington) - 54.9% - Lake Champlain Waldorf School (Vermont) - 49.6% - Austin Waldorf School (Texas) - 48% Dr. Iannelli's reporting is supported by new state-based, kindergarten vaccination data from 2017, which identifies Waldorf Association schools as NME leaders in these states: Vaccinations have proven to be one of the most cost-effective and successful public health interventions, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Vaccines are effective not only because they protect individuals who have been vaccinated, but also because they confer a broader protection for communities by establishing \"herd immunity.\" Which means, when a sufficiently high proportion of a population is vaccinated against communicable diseases, the entire population can obtain protection. \" [Thanks to the Vaccines For Children (VFC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html) program, children in our country are no longer at significant risk from diseases that once killed thousands each year,\" said CDC / NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD, in a [recent podcast](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-statement-hiv-vaccine-awareness-day-may-18-2018). Each year, [vaccines prevent](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0424-immunization-program.html) 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the last 20 years. \"Current measles outbreaks in the U.S.A. and around the world serve as a reminder that infectious diseases are only a plane ride away.\" \"Borders can't stop measles, but vaccination can,\" said Dr. Fauci. Previously, the actual cost to a city or state treating a measles outbreak was tough to calculate. But [recent data](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/measles-management-costs-range-over-25000-patient) indicates treating a single measles case could cost a health system between $4,500 up to $25,000. This amount is significantly more expensive than a measles vaccination, which generally costs less than $100 at a local pharmacy. Or is a free vaccine funded by the VFC program. Measles can be prevented with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine which has been found to be very safe and effective. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective, says the CDC. In the USA, 2 measles [ vaccines](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines) are available, MMR-II and ProQuad. The [CDC Vaccine Price List](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/) provides the private sector vaccine prices for general information, and vaccine discounts can be found [here](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/discounts). Vaccines like any medicine, can have side effects, says the CDC. You are encouraged to [report negative side effects](https://vaers.hhs.gov/) of vaccines to the FDA or CDC.
