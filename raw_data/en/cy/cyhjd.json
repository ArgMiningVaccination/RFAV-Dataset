Explore lifestyle changes, herbal remedies, and nutritional tips in our comprehensive guide to immune health.\" We all know how important it is to have a robust immune system, right? Especially at this time of year when we re heading into the depths of winter. As a naturopath who loves working with busy women like you , transitioning through peri menopause and beyond, I am always working to ensure my clients know what to do to support their immune system. as part of the toolbox of self care strategies. Many of my clients dealing with symptoms common in perimenopause such as poor stress tolerance, disrupted sleep , brain fog and weight gain, find themselves more prone to viruses or less able to bounce back from winter colds as quickly as they used to . Some recent research has even suggested that women in the menopausal phase are more prone to long COVID , in fact many of the symptoms described above are similar to those experienced by long COVID patients which can be a double whammy! Before we jump into the strategies for boosting immunity, let's quickly understand how the immune system works its magic. Think of your immune system as your body's defence system, working tirelessly to keep you healthy and protected. It consists of a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to identify and eliminate harmful substances, such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins. When your immune system is strong and in balance, it's better equipped to fend off invaders and keep you well. But when it's weak, it's like the world's worst security guard, letting anyone in and causing all kinds of trouble. Understanding the Immune System during the menopausal transition: There are several factors during menopause that can weaken your immune systems, key ones include shifts in progesterone & oestrogen, stress, poor sleep, fatigue, and your gut health. If you are in peri menopause ,it's important to pay attention and support your immune system in part because your body is going through \"re wiring\" . The declining levels of sex hormones, oestrogen and progesterone in a natural menopause can contribute to changes in how the immune system functions and can predispose women to immune dysfunction be it, an increase in the frequency of the common cold and flu or the even development of autoimmune conditions such as Hashimotos or rheumatoid arthritis\" But knowing how to nourish yourself is key to offsetting these changes. Remember , menopause is not a disease but our symtpoms can be clues to what we need to focus on in our health. Think of the symptoms as being a report card for general health and an opportunity to address issues to create a healthier blueprint going forward! In addition , during peri-menopause, the stress hormone cortisol, is often ramped up. When you have too much cortisol for too long, , it can increase inflammation and weaken your immune system's ability to fight off infections. That's why in this article we're going to explore some ways you can naturally boost immunity, from simple lifestyle changes to powerful herbal & nutritional supplements. So, get ready to arm your immune system and equip yourself with some valuable knowledge! 6 Signs You Have a Weakened Immune System Your Stress Level is Sky-High. .

PSSSST. Coming Soon 14 Cleanse and Balance Quickstart Program GINGER & LEMON TEA A piece of fresh ginger rhizome the size of your thumb, scrubbed and not peeled, a fresh whole unpeeled lemon, 1 litre of filtered boiling water and a dessertspoon raw honey. Blend the ginger and lemon in a high-speed blender until quite fine; top with boiling water and honey and allow to steep for about 10 minutes. Strain off the pulp and pour liquid into a coffee mug. I suggest drinking the entire litre within an hour in the absence of food, especially if this is the first sign of a respiratory infection. If you catch it early enough, this can be enough to stop the infection in its tracks. If not, it is still worth persevering - although not quite so 'magical'. With a lot of nasal congestion, it can also be useful to do a steam inhalation using eucalyptus or tea tree oil. Add the oil to a cup of boiled water and put a paper bag over the cup, resting the open ends on the table. Snip off the corner of the bag to provide a spout through which to inhale the directed steam ( recipe C Houghton) References: Harvard Health Publishing. (2014). How to boost your immune system.
