The presence of fever is often a cause for concern among patients and caregivers. Pharmacists can be an excellent resource for those seeking guidance regarding the use of nonprescription antipyretics. Fever is a very common symptom that is often recognized as one of the primary causes for pediatrician and emergency department visits for children younger than 15 years.1 Although the majority of fevers can be managed easily with proper treatment, fever may also indicate a serious underlying illness, such as an acute infection, that requires immediate evaluation and treatment.1,2 Fever is defined as a body temperature higher than the normal core temperature of 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C).1,2 Normal body temperature can fluctuate, ranging from 97.5\u00b0F (36.4\u00b0C) to 98.9\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C).1-3 Fever may be idiopathic in nature, or it can result from various factors such as an infectious or pathologic process, vigorous exercise, or a response to the use of certain pharmacologic agents (also known as a drug fever).1-6 Fever may also occur after the administration of common childhood immunizations.3 The majority of fevers are caused by microbial infections, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and yeast infections.2,5 Patients with fever may also experience other signs and symptoms that can cause discomfort, such as headache, flushed face, a general feeling of malaise, chills, sweating, and arthralgia or myalgia.1-3 Detecting Fever During counseling, patients and caregivers should be advised to avoid feeling the forehead to check for fever and instead to use a reliable thermometer and follow the manufacturer's recommended procedures to obtain an accurate reading. Digital thermometers, the most widely used measuring devices, are available with a variety of features enabling temperature measurement via oral, tympanic, axillary, rectal, or temporal routes.1,7 During a course of illness, temperature should be measured with the same thermometer at the same site because readings from different thermometers or sites can vary (Table 11,8). Use of a rectal thermometer is the preferred method for temperature measurement in patients 6 months and younger.1-3 Tympanic thermometers are not recommended for this age group because of the shape and size of an infant's ear.1 While measuring temperature rectally is preferred for patients aged 6 months to 5 years, oral, tympanic, or temporal temperature measurement may be used in this patient age group if proper technique is used.1 In patients older than 5 years, oral, tympanic, or temporal temperature measurement can be used.1 Treating Fever The primary goal in the treatment of fever is to relieve discomfort; this occurs when body temperature decreases to normal. It is also important, however, to identify and treat the underlying cause of fever.1,3,4 Nonprescription antipyretics and nonpharmacologic measures are often used in the treatment and management of fever. Available nonprescription antipyretics include acetaminophen (N-acetylp- naproxen. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are the 2 most extensively used antipyretics.1,5 Ibuprofen is only approved for fever reduction in patients older than 6 months.1 Antipyretics are available in a variety of formulations for the adult and pediatric patient population, including singleentity or combination products in tablet, capsule, gel capsule, liquigel, enteric-coated, extendedor sustained-release, liquid, suspension, rapid-release gel capsule, and chewable tablet forms (Online Table 2). Typically, temperature decrease and alleviation of discomfort occur about 30 to 60 minutes after administration of antipyretics.1 TABLE 2: EXAMPLES OF NONPRESCRIPTION ANTIPYRETICS Active Ingredient Brand Name Acetaminophen Aspirin Ibuprofen Naproxen sodium Miscellaneous product Homeopathic/alternative remedies Nonpharmacologic measures (eg, adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration, wearing lightweight clothing, maintaining a comfortable room temperature) should also be incorporated in treatment.1,3 Role of the Pharmacist During counseling, pharmacists should ensure that patients and caregivers understand how to use antipyretics products properly, including dosing, administration, and possible adverse effects (Online Table 3).1,3,6,8,9 Pharmacists should also screen for potential drug interactions and contraindications. Because antipyretics can also be found in many allergy, cough, cold, and flu products, patients should be advised to always read all medication labels before administering antipyretics to avoid therapeutic duplications or possible medication overdose. Moreover, caregivers who are unsure about correct dosing, especially for infants and children, should always contact their primary health care provider to avoid potential dosing errors. Patients and caregivers should be advised to always contact their primary health care provider immediately regarding fever in the following circumstances1,3,8,10: TABLE 3: KEY COUNSELING TIPS REGARDING FEVER Adapted from references 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
