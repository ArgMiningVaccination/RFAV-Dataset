On Jan. 1, members of Blue Cross and Blue Shield's Service Benefit Plan received partial coverage for therapies such as chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy and health products. Administered by the American Specialty Health Networks (ASHN), the program provides members up to a 25-percent discount for ASHN's network of chiropractors, acupuncturists and massage therapists. These services are available without a physician's referral. In addition, members are able to buy more than 3,000 health care products via ASHN's affiliate, Healthroads.com. According to ASHN, Blue Cross and Blue Shield's Service Benefit Plan is the largest employer-sponsored health plan in the United States--it covers approximately four million federal employees, retirees and their family members. \"We recognize our members' desire for more choices and direct access to CAM [complementary and alternative medicine] services,\" said Steve Gammarino, senior vice president of the Federal Employee Program and Integrated Health Systems. However, ASHN noted that its CAM services are not included in the Service Benefit Plan premium, and any charges for these services do not count toward deductibles or out-of-pocket costs.
