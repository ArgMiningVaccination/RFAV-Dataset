Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on May 09, 2019 Crystal therapy or crystal healing is a form of vibrational medicine. Crystal therapy involves the application of crystals or gemstones to facilitate healing. Gemstones house spiritual and healing properties that can be tapped into a variety of ways. Crystals can be carried or worn on the person, or placed in a location where their healing vibrations can be felt by whoever is nearby. Healers also place stones on their clients' reclined bodies to balance the chakras and aura. Each type of stone has its own unique talent. Gemstone colors, shapes, and textures all have special meanings. Crystal elixirs can be made by soaking crystals for a few hours in a glass of water. Healing crystals are used for divination and meditation purposes. You can intuitively choose which crystals to use by noticing which stones you are attracted to. Keep your heart and hands open and allow the appropriate healing crystals to find their way to you. Seasonal Stones You may discover that some stones are better suited to a specific season. Yellow topaz and citrine are good examples. These two healing crystals are wonderful energizers, they carry sun energies and are great for uplifting depressive thoughts that linger during dark overcast periods. Anyone who suffers from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) will benefit from wearing either of these \"sun-bright gems\" on dark days. It is little wonder that both yellow topaz and citrine represent November birthstones. These stones may feel \"too hot\" to carry in summer months. Cooler stones more suitable during hot periods are pearls and coral. Emeralds and turquoise are perfect for springtime. Sapphires and opals in autumn. Record Keepers Stones are ancient and wise. In general, they are excellent memory keepers. Certain stones are better at absorbing and retaining information than others. Red stones (rubies, carnelians, garnets, etc.) are especially good at holding onto information. Melody, author of Love is in the Earth, identifies record keeper crystals as having one or more raised triangles located on the face of the crystal. Keep a memory-keeper stone with you while attending classes if you are a student. The stone will not only take notes but will help you stay grounded and be focused on the lecture being given. Don't forget to carry your memory-keeper in your pocket on exam days. Why We Are Attracted to Gemstones Rocks are pretty. As children, we loved to dig them out of the dirt, hold them in our hands. A child's first collection is often an assortment of colored rocks found in the play yard or fished out pebbles from the bottom of a shallow creek. You may have kept these nature treasures inside an egg carton or a cigar box, and maybe kept them hidden under your bed for safe keeping. Gemstones as Gifts Gemstones are delightful to give or receive as gifts. They are mother nature's natural healers. Gifting someone with a crystal is the same as offering a healing. There are hundreds of different types of stones to choose from. Some people feel that crystals should never be purchased for personal use, they believe that crystals should only be accepted as gifts directly from the earth or given to you by another person. This belief is born out of the idea that crystals and gemstones come into our lives at the appropriate times when we are in need of their healing gifts. On the other hand, giving yourself a crystal is a form of self-healing. If you are in a store and you sense a vibrational pull toward a particular crystal or gemstone then it is probably meant for you. If you can afford it, buy it! If a crystal is crying out \"take me home,\" please listen! Rocks will talk to you if you are willing to listen. Choosing Gold or Silver Settings Choosing what type of metal to wrap around your stones or as settings for your gemstones in rings, pendants, and brooches is also important. Silver tends to enhance or magnify the properties of the gemstones. Gold gives the opposite effect, it tames overpowering stones. If you are extremely sensitive to stone energies, gold is a good choice because it will lower the vibrational pulse of the stone so that the healing effects are subtle, offering the wearer a more comfortable transition from imbalance to balance. Lost or Misplaced Crystals Crystals can be purchased but they can never be truly owned. So, if you have lost or misplaced a crystal this probably means that it has found a new home where its powers can be better utilized. Or, you may get a strong urge to pass on a cherished stone into the hands of someone else. Our healing crystals are very good at sending us intuitive messages whenever they want to be given away, and to whom. Certain crystals carry very powerful energies and can be overwhelming when worn or carried daily. These types of crystals tend to get lost or misplaced. It is not beneficial to be stimulated by vibrational energies that are too powerful. Crystals and gemstones will either get lost permanently or will be misplaced temporarily. Searching all the nooks and crannies in your home will do no good. Not to worry, lost stones tend to resurface when their services are needed. You may think you have lost a crystal only to have it show up several months later. Or, they are replaced by a more suitable stone that unexpectedly comes your way. For example, you may lose or give away an amethyst, later you find or are given a different amethyst or an entirely different type of healing crystal meant for you. It is best to allow crystals to come and go since they do their work best without restrictions. Don't feel bad if you have lost or misplaced a crystal. It is either taking a timeout in hiding until you need it or it has moved on to a more suitable place or person.
