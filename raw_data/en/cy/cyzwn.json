Sanford completes a community health needs assessment every three years. It is through this work that we identify the unmet needs in the community and strategically plan how we can best address those needs. The CHNA process aligns with Sanford's mission - Dedicated to the work of health and healing. During 2017 and 2018, members of the community were invited to complete a survey to help identify the unmet needs. Key stakeholders completed a survey to identify concerns for the community related to economic well- being, transportation, children and youth, the aging population, safety, and access to mental and behavioral health. Sanford analyzed the data from the primary research and met with key stakeholders to prioritize the identified needs. Our strategies to address the needs are included in this report. Sanford will addre ss the following health needs through a formalized implementation strategy for the 2019- 2021 fiscal years: Access Mental Health and Substance Abuse The CHNA also focused on the strengths of our community . The many community assets that are available to address the community health needs are included in the asset map . We have also included an impact report from our 2016 implementation strategies. Sanford Fargo is committed to extending care beyond our bricks and mortar. We are committed to meeting the health care needs of the broader community. Together, we can fulfill our mission.

Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and develop a Community Investment/Community Benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community healt h needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify and defend the not-for-profit status , and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a broad perspective. A community health needs assessment identifies the community's strengths and area s for improvement. A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital Community Investment/Community Benefit Program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retaining our not -for-profit status. Our Guiding Principles All health care is a community asset Care should be delivered as close to home as possible Access to health care must be provided regionally Integrated care delivers the best quality and efficiency Community involvement and support are essential to success Sanford Health is invited into the communities we serve Regulatory Requirements Federal regulations stipulate that non -profit medical centers conduct a community health needs assessment at least once every three years and prioritize the needs for the purpose of implementations strategy development and submission in accordance with the I ntern al Revenue Code 501(r) . The Internal Revenue Code 501( r) requires that each hospital must have: (1) conducted a community health needs assessment in the applicable taxable year ; (2) adopted an implementation strategy for meeting the community health nee ds identified in the assessment ; and (3) created transparency by making the information widely available. The regulations stipulate that each medical center take into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community. We are required to seek at least one state, local, tribal or regional government public health department or state Office of Rural Health with knowledge, information or expertise relevant to the health needs of the community . Non -profit hospitals are required to seek input from members of medically underserved, low income, and minority populations in the community, or organizations serving or representing the interest of such 5 populations, and underserved populations experiencing disparities or at risk of not receiving adequate care as a result of being uninsured or due to geographic, language or financial or other barriers. The community health needs assessment includes a process to identify community resources that are available to address the assessed needs and to prioritize the needs. Hospitals are to address each and every assessed needs or defend why we are not addressing the needs. Once the needs have been identified and prioritized, hospitals are required to develop an implementation strategy to addres s the top needs. The strategies are reported on the IRS 990 and a status report must be provided each year on IRS 990 Schedule H. Finally, hospitals are to be transparent with the findings and make the written CHNA report available to anyone who asks for the report. Sanford place s the CHNA reports and the implementation strategies on the Sanford website. Hospitals are required to kee p three cycles of assessments on the web si te. The 2018 report will be Sanford 's third report cycle since the requirements we re enacted in 2010. Study Design and Methodology 1. Primary Research A. Key Stakeholder Survey An online survey was conducted with identified community key stakeholders. The study concentrated on the stakeholders' concerns for the community specific to economic well - being, transportation, children and youth, the aging population, safety, health care and wellness, mental health and substance abuse. The study was conducted through a partnership between Sanford Health and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the online survey tool. Sanfo rd Health and Cass and Clay Public Health distributed the survey link via email to stakeholders and key leade rs located within the Fargo/Moorhead community and Cass and Clay counties . Data collection occurred from December 2017 to January 2018. A total of 222 community stakeholders participated in the survey. B. Resident Survey The resident survey tool included questions about the respondent's personal health. An online survey was developed in partnership with public health experts from across the Sanford footprint. The Minnesota Health Department reviewed and advised Sanford about key questions that the y request of the State Health Improvement Program ( SHIP ) surveys and those questions were in cluded in the resident survey. The North Dakota Public Health Association developed an Addendum to the survey with questions specific to the American Indian populat ion. The survey was sent to a representative sample of the Cass County and Clay County populations secured through Qualtrics, a q ualified vendor. A total of 547 community resident s participated in the survey. C. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted to find the community resources available to address the assessed needs. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available to address the needs. Once gaps were determined, the prioritization exercise followed w ith key stakeholder groups determining the top needs. 6 D. Community Stakeholder Discussions Community stakeholders were invited to attend a presentation of the findings of the CHNA research. Facilitated discussion commenced and each particip ant was asked to consider his or her top two or three priorities that should be further developed into implementation strategies. The meeting served to inform the group of the findings but also served as a catalyst to drive collaboration. E. Prioritization Process The primary and secondary research data was analyzed to develop the top unmet needs. The analyzed list of needs was developed into a worksheet. A multi -voting methodology from the American Society for Quality was implemented to de termine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. Key community stakeholders met with medical center leaders to complete the multi -voting exercise. 2. Secondary Research A. The 2018 County Health Rankings B. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates C. Community Com mons were reviewed and specific data sets were co nsidered. The Community Commons link is https://www.communitycommons.org/maps -data/ D. The Fargo Cass Pubic Health - Cass County Community Health Profiles - April 2018 E. Greater Fargo Moorhead Community Needs Assessment Secondary Data: Cass and Clay Counties was reviewed and presented to key stakeholders. The data is available in the Appendix. Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in Cass County, North Dakota and Clay County, Minnesota. A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. However, when comparing certain demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, income, minority status) with the current population estimates from the U.S. Census Bu reau, there was improvement over the last several CHNAs but there is still a need to capture demographic that better represents the community. This is part of our CHNA continuous improvement process. Inter nal Revenue Code 501 (r) requires that a broad base of key community stakeholders have input into the needs of the community. Those community members specified in the statute inc lude persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility includ ing those with special expertise in public health; Federal, tribal, regional, state and or local health or other departments or agencies with information relevant to the health needs of the community served; and leaders, representatives, or members of medi cally underserved, low income, and minority populations. Sanford extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. We worked closely with public health experts throughout the assessment proce ss. Public comments and response s to the community health needs assessment and the implementations strategies are welcome on the Sanford website or contact can be made at https://www.sanfordhea lth.org/contact -us/form . 7 Key Findings Community Health Concerns The key findings are based on the key stakeholder survey, the resident survey and secondary research. The key stakeholder survey ranked key indicators on a Likert scale with 1 meaning no a ttention needed and 5 meaning critical attention ne eded. Survey results ranking 3.5 or above are considered to be high ranking. Sanford is addressing many of the needs that ranked below 3.5 ; howeve r, the high ranking needs of 3.5 or above are considered for the prioritization process. The resident survey addresses personal health needs and concern. The secondary research provides further understanding of the health of the community and in many cases the indicators are aligned and validate our findings. Economic Well -Being Community stakeholders are most concerned that there is a need for housing that accepts people with chemical dependency, mental health problems, criminal history or victims of domestic violence ( ranking 4.22) , affordable housing (4.21 ), hig h concern for homelessness (3,88 ), and hunger (3.64). People in Cass County and Clay County are stru ggling with food insecurity - 30% of resident survey report that their food did not last until they had money to buy more.

Health Care Access Community stakeholders are most concerned about the availability of mental health providers (4.28 ), the availability of behavioral health ( substance abuse) providers (4.21 ), access to affordable health insurance (4.05), ac cess to affordable health care ( 4.01), access to affordable prescription drugs (3.91), access to affordable dental insurance (3.82), the availability of non -traditional hours (3.63), access to affordable vision insu rance ( 3.58 ), the use of emergency room servic es for primary health care (3.53), the availability of health care services for Native American people (3.50), and coordination of care between providers and services (3.50). 8 Mental Health and Substance Abuse Community stakeholders are most concerned about drug use and abuse (4.40), alcohol use and abuse (4.15), depression (4.10), suicide (4.01), stress (3.81), and d ementia and Alzheimer's (3.61). Resident survey participants are facing the following issues: 66% report that they are overweight or obese 50% self- report binge drinking at least 1X/month 46% have been diagnosed with anxiety 40% have been diagnosed with depression 30% have not visited a dentist in more than a year 30% report running out of food before having money to buy more 29% have been diagn osed with high cholesterol 26% have a diagnosis of hype rtension and 21% report that alcohol use has had a harmful effect on them or a member of their family in the past two years 21% currently smoke cigarettes 17% self -report that they have drugs in their home they are not using Community stakeholders worked through a multi- voting prioritization process to determine the top priorities and needs of the community. Sanford Fargo will address the following health needs in a formalized implementation strategy for the 2019- 2021 fiscal years: Health Care Access Mental Health/Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse 9 Implementation Strategies Priority 1 : Health Care Access According to the County Health Rankings for Clinical Care, access to affordable health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. H ealth insurance, local care options, and a usual source of care help to ensure access to health care. Having access to care allows individuals to enter the health care system, find care easily and locally, pay for care, and get their health needs met. Sanford has made health care access a significant priority and has developed strategies to promote and improve ac cess to services. It is Sanford's goal that all patients requiring access to health care are successful in securing timely appointments . Priority 2 : Mental Health/Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse Mental health is important at every stage of life an d affects how people think, feel, and act. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the U.S. Current research suggests that depression is caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Sanford has made mental health a significant priority and has developed strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from mental health and behavioral h ealth and substance abuse. It is Sanford's goal to reduce the number of individuals whose overall well- being is negatively impacted by addiction and mental illness. 10 Sanford South University Medical Center Fargo Community Health Needs Assessment 2018 11 Purpose The purpose of a community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community.

It has 170 licensed beds and serves as a hub for orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation with inpatient units for these services. The South University ca mpus will eventually become a stand -alone orthopedics and sports medicine clinic and hospital, the only one in the state of North Dakota. Work is already in progress. South University also currently houses highly specialized services, including a behavio ral health inpatient and partial hospitalization unit, an eating disorder inpatient and a partial hospitalization unit, ophthalmology, a center for cardiac and vascular screening, and a bio -skills and cadaver lab for medical residents. Sanford Health is a major teaching hospital in partnership the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences. They recently collaborated to launch an orthopedic residency program that began in summer 2018 at Sanford South University Medical Center. This first -of-its-kind program in North and South Dakota creates three residency positions per year that will study in both Fargo and Sioux Falls, eventually resulting in 15 residents training at a time during the five -year program. Residents will see a wide range of orthopedic disorders for adults and pediatric patients that include adult reconstruction, orthopedic trauma, spine, hand, foot, ankle, amputations, athletic injuries and orthopedic oncology. They will also focus on research and improving patients ' care and treatments. Sanford Health is the largest employer in the Fargo metro area with 9,400 Sanford employees in Fargo - Moorhead -West Fargo, including 500 board -certified physicians and 200 advanced practice providers (APPs). It is accredited by The Joint Commission. 18 Description of the Community Served Fargo is a diverse, dynamic, family -oriented community on the eastern border of North Dakota. It is the largest city in North Dakota, accounting for nearly 16 percent of the state population and the county seat of Cass County. Fargo and its twin city of Mo orhead, Minn., and adjacent West Fargo, N.D. and Dilworth, Minn., form the core of the metro area, which in 2018 has a population of 240,000. Founded in 1871, Fargo is the economic center of southeastern ND. It is a cultural, retail, health care, educati onal and industrial hub for the region. The Fargo -Moorhead metro area is home to three universities: North Dakota State University, Concordia College, Minnesota State University Moorhead, and numerous other private and state colleges and technical schools and is home to over 38,000 students. Although the economy of the Fargo area has historically been dependent on agriculture, the city now has a growing economy based on food processing, manufacturing, technology, retail trade, higher education and health care. US News & World Report ranked Fargo as the #1 city for finding a job, Farmers Insurance named it the #3 most secure places to live, and Moving.com named it #5 on its list of best places to live in America. Fargo -Moorhead is home to a growing numbe r of innovative technology and biomedical companies, attracted to the community by its educated workforce, low labor costs, favorable tax climate, advanced telecommunications infrastructure and available energy and water supplies. Education and health serv ices account for the largest non -agricultural industries. 19 Key Findings Community Health Concerns The key findings are based on the key stakeholder survey, the resident survey and secondary research. The key stakeholder survey ranked key indicators on a Likert scale with 1 meaning no attention needed and 5 meaning critical attention needed. Survey results ranking 3.5 or above are considered to be high ranking. Sanford is addressing many of the needs that ranked below 3.5; however, the high ranking needs of 3.5 or above are considered for the prioritization process. The resident survey addresses personal health needs and concerns. The secondary research provides further understanding of the health of the community, and in some cases , the indicators align with and validate our findings. Economic Well -Being: The concern for the community's economic well -being is focused on the need for housing that accepts people in recovery, mental illness, criminal history of victims of domestic abuse, affordable housing, homelessness and hunger. Healthy People 2020 has defined the social determinants of health. Social determinants of health are conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality -of-life outcomes and risks. Conditions (e.g., social, economic, and physical) in these various environments and settings (e.g., school, church, workplace, and neighborhood) have been referred to as \"place.\" The patterns of social engagement and sense of security and well- being are also affected by where people live. Resources that enhance quality of life can have a significant influence on population health outcomes. Examples of these resources include safe 2.913.273.313.443.443.643.884.214.22 1 2 3 4 5Employment options (N=219)Help for renters with landlord and tenants' rights issues (N=208)Maintaining livable and energy efficient homes (N=214)Skilled labor workforce (N=210)Household budgeting and money management (N=215)Hunger (N=216)Homelessness (N=216)Availability of affordable housing (N=218)Housing which accepts people with chemical dependency, mental health problems, criminal history, or victims of... Mean attention needed (1=No attention needed; 5=Critical attention needed)20 and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy foods, local emergency/health services, and environments free of life- threatening toxins.

Researchers have identified risk factors that can increase a person 's chances for misuse, and protective factors that can reduce the risk. However, many people with risk factors do not abuse substances. The risk factors for substance abuse among youth include boredom, stress, curiosity, the desire to feel grown up, or to lessen peer pressure. Youth may also be more likely to try drugs because of circumstances or events called risk factors. Examples of risk factors include: Poor grades in school Engaging in alcohol or drug use at a young age Friends and peers who engage in alcohol or drug use Persistent, progressive, and generalized substance use, misuse, and use disorders by family members Conflict between parents or between parents and children, including abuse or neglect Bullying Protective factors include: Havin g high self -esteem Attending a school with policies against using alcohol and drugs Having an adult role model who doesn't use tobacco or drugs or misuse alcohol Participating in athletic, community, or faith -based groups Living in a community with youth activities that prohibit drugs and alcohol Aging Population: The cost of long term care and memory care are top concerns once again and were top concerns during the 2016 CHNA cycle. The cost of in -home services and the availability of resources for family and friends helping to make dec isions for elders and resources to help the elderly stay safe in their homes are also high concerns. Current state of community issues regarding the AGING POPULATION Acording to the U.S. Health and Human Services Administration on Aging, the cost of long term care depends on the type and duration of care you need, the provider you use, and where you live.

Sanford s ocial workers, case managers, and discharge planners refer patients to area service providers to make certain that patients receive a safe discharge and transition to the appropriate levels of care. Safety: The abuse of prescription drugs, the culture of excessive drinking, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect, sex trafficking and the presence of street drugs are top concerns for safety in the community. Current state of community issues regarding SAFETY The National Institute on Drug Abuse state s that the misuse of prescription drugs means taking a medication in a manner or dose other than what was prescribed; or taking someone else's prescription, even if for a legitimate medical complaint such as pain; or taking a medication to feel euphoria (i.e., to get high). The term non- medical use of prescription drugs also refers to these categories of misuse. The three classes of medication most commonly misused are opioids, central nervous system depressants (this category includes tranquilizers, sedati ves, and hypnotics) and stimulants - most often prescribed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Prescription drug misuse can have serious medical consequences. Providers at Sanford Health have reduced opioid prescriptions over the last three years in an effort to have fewer pills in circulation and a reduced opportunity for misuse. 2.462.842.923.333.343.373.553.593.683.803.814.17 1 2 3 4 5Lack of police or delayed response of police (N=191)Availability of emergency medical services (N=193)Presence of gang activity (N=188)Presence of drug dealers (N=189)Elder abuse (N=188)Criminal activity (N=196)Presence of street drugs (N=190)Sex trafficking (N=190)Child abuse and neglect (N=193)Domestic violence (N=196)Culture of excessive and binge drinking (N=197)Abuse of prescription drugs (N=195) Mean attention needed (1=No attention needed; 5=Critical attention needed)23 Health Care and Wellness: The availability of mental health and behavioral health providers are ranked very high among the top concerns for the community. Access to affordable health insurance and affordable health care, affordable prescription drugs, affordable dental and vision insurance, availability of non -traditional hours, the use of the emergency room for primary health care, the availability of healthcare for Native people and the coordination of care between providers and community services Are all high concerns for community stakeholders.

Current state of community issues regarding MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reports that \" Mental and substance use disorders can have a powerful effect on the health of individuals, their families, and their communities.

This document is referred to as an asset map. Sanford Health conducted asset mapping by reviewing the primary and secondary research and iden tifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources are available in the community and county to address the needs. The asset map was reviewed by Sanford leadership and by community key stakeholders to validate the assets. The asset map helped to identify gaps in services. Once gaps were determined the key stakeholder group proceeded to the prioritization discussion and multi -voting exercise. The group was asked to prioritize the top two concerns that would be further developed into implementation strategies. The process executed in the work was based on the McKnight Foundation model \"Mapping Community Capacity\" by John L. McKnight and John Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Nor thwestern University. The asset mapping process identified needs from the following: Key stakeholder survey Resident survey Facilitated discussion by the key stakeholders Secondary research Community resources that are available to address the needs Please see the asset map in the Appendix. 40 Prioritization A multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. Key community stakeholders met with medical center leaders to discuss community needs and complete the multi -voting exercise.

Comments from respondents Comments Affordable health and mental health services and affordable/accessible housing are MUCH NEEDED!! Any examination of issues and/or accompanying policies should be intersectional - that's critical! High need for behavioral health support in schools. Homeless seniors (over age 60) is a critical and growing issue -- getting bigger all the time. I believe in universal health care like the rest of the civilized world has. I do not work directly with homeless youth, but I work with homeless adults and incarcerated persons. Behavioral Health and affordable housing with support services are critical needs, but homeless youth are even more neglected it seems. Family Healt hCare is the only option for affordable, sliding scale care, and even with insurance people can't afford care or medications sometimes, get bumped off their insurance because they don't follow up, etc. Politicians continue to try to cut services to the one s who need them the most, and it's infuriating. I am happy to meet with anyone in person to discuss finer details for the purpose of this study. I wish NA would have been explained. There were several, I didn't feel qualified to answer but did because that option wasn't listed. In regards to mental health, there is a great need in schools to identify children needing mental health services and provide these services within the context of the school day. It occurs to me that several of the questions ab out serious/moderate situations are serious, but a small percentage of people have the serious level of the problem. However, to them it is a serious problem. Mental illness / wellness is a critical concern for youth - as we help them now, we help the fu ture. Money has been cut for homeless youth for sex trafficking. Needs to be restored and fund both. Not enough questions regarding mental health needs. On the subject of non -school activities for young people they also need down time; they do not have to be over -booked like their parents. No one should be in an unsafe environment - drug dealer[s] need to be removed from society. No one should be abused or neglected and go into the highest need category. Re: housing that takes those with CD/other issues . The problem is paying for full -time staff to monitor activity for safety of all residents, and to deal with the numerous issues. Seems like FirstLink is a great resource for continued care, open 24/7. Sexual assault/rape is a huge issue in the FM area, especially at bars and at the college campuses. This is something that needs to be addressed! Special needs based services were not addressed in the survey. To include: ASD, Down Syndrome, Multiply impaired, Intellectual Disability, and EBD. I know that the schools are very taxed currently with the demands of supporting the diverse population. My question is are we addressing support and interventions for the special needs population post academic age. Substance abuse programs tend not to use best practi ces...seem to be stuck in the 1930's...very unproductive. The way our cities are built (sprawling/car -dependent) significantly impacts the physical and economic health of our population, especially the low -income and disabled population. If our cities wer e built in a more -dense and livable way, all populations could feasibly walk, bike, and use public transportation. Currently we are mandated to own and pay for a car in order to maintain a normal lifestyle. (The average American pays over $8,000 per year to own and maintain a car - Source AAA .) Transportation to medical care. We need a television channel that constantly scrolls events, information, and news regarding all of the above issues as well as short video clips about injuries, how to fill out for ms, correct ways to raise children, or help the elderly, etc. We need more effort to prevent age 12 to 18 from ending up in detention centers. Yes when looking at the challenges with our aging population, it is a matter of not just finding them a place to live, it is finding them a place to live if they have been kicked out of a nursing care facility and need a higher level of care, but nowhere to go. More homes and respite care for seniors 117 Appendix Table 1.

Need to take local and regional partnerships to the next level and use our strong collaborative approach to support these initiatives. Piggyback off our strong local collaborative relationships to support ongoing efforts. o Compare and contrast with other communities like ours to see what is or is not working or what could work o We can solve this if we get together o Get at the root causes, intervene, get people connected o Unit ed Way has programs that help with these issues and problems; would not always need to create a new program; identify programs that are best at doing this General 128 o Support outreach programs o Bring services to the people o Catalysts are law enforcement o Decreas e polarization; no trust because of different messages o Consider how public policy supports and/or complicates these issues. Testimonies and stories and inclusion from frontline responders and people would help support this process. 129 Secondary Data 130 Secondary Data: Cass and Clay Counties, Fargo -Moorhead 131 Insert Greater Fargo Moorhead CHNA doc here in PDF form 132 Fargo Cass Public Health April 2018 Authors: Tracy K. Miller, PhD, MPH State Epidemiologist Kodi Pinks, MPH Epidemiologist Cass County Community Health Profile 133 134 The Demographic Section of this report comes from the US Census Bureau ( www.census.gov ). Most tables are derived either from the census estimates for 2015 or from the Community Population Survey aggregated over a several year period. The table header describes the specific years from which the data is derived. The tables present the number of persons and percentages which in almost all circumstances represent the category specific percentage of all persons referenced by the table (e.g., percentage of persons age 15 and older who are married). Age specific poverty rates represent the percentage of each age group in poverty (e.g., percentage of children under five years in poverty). The Vital Statistics section of this report comes from the birth and death records collected by the North Dakota Department of Health Vital Records. This data is aggregated over a five year period. All births and deaths represent the county of residence not the county of occurrence. In order to maintain a person ' s confidentially, the number of events is blocked if fewer than six. The Adult Behavioral Risk Factor section of this report is derived from the North Dakota Department of Health ' s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. The aggregated data (the number of years specified in the table) is continuously collected by telephone survey from persons 18 years and older residing in North Dakota. All data is self - reported data. Data presented in the Crime section of this report is collected from the North Dakota Attorney General website located at: www.ag.nd.gov/Reports/BCIReports/CrimeHomicide/ CrimeHomicide.htm . Data presented in the Child Health Indicators section of this report is collected from the Kids Count Data Center website located at: www.datacenter.kidscount.org .

Pregnancies = Live births + Fetal deaths + Induced termination of pregnancy. Pregnancy Rate = Total pregnancies divided by the total resident population x 1,000. Fertility Rate = Resident live births divided by female population (age 15 - 44) x 1,000. Teenage Birth Rate = Teenage births (age <20) divided by female teen population x 1,000. Teenage Pregnancy Rate 1,000. = Teenage pregnancies (age<20) divided by female teen population x Out of Wedlock (OOW) Live Birth Ratio = Resident OOW live births divided by total resident live births x 1,000. Out of Wedlock Pregnancy Ratio = Resident OOW pregnancies divided by total pregnancies x 1,000. Low Weight Ratio = Low weight births (birth weight < 2,500 grams) divided by total resident live births x 1,000. Infant Death Ratio = Number of infant deaths divided by the total resident live births x 1,000. Childhood & Adolescent Deaths = Deaths to individuals 1 - years of age. 19 Childhood and Adolescent Death Rate = Number of resident deaths (age 1 - 19) divided by population (age 1 - 19) x 100,000. Crude Death Rate = Death events divided by population x 100,000. Age - Adjusted Death Rate = Death events with age specific adjustments x 100,000 population. Cass County Community Health Profile 2018 Page 5 Cass County Community Health Profile 2018 Page 6 Cass County Community Health Profile 2018 Page 7 The following three pages represent data received from the Adult Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Numbers given are point estimate percentages followed by 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance can be determined by comparing co nfidence intervals between two geographic areas. To be statistically significant, confidence may not overlap. For example the confidence intervals 9.3 (8.3 - 10.8 (10.0 and 10.2) - overlap (see 11.6) picture below) so the difference between the two numbers is not statistically significant. That means that substantial uncertainty remains whether the apparent difference is due to chance alone (due to sampling variation) rather than representing a t rue difference in the prevalence of the condition in the two populations. The less they overlap, the more likely it is that the point estimates represent truly different prevalence's in the two populations.
