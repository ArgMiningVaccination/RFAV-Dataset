Pancreatic Cancer: Promise of Doublet Chemotherapy http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27550853 (above) Journal : Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology Institution(s) : Nature editorial offices, London, UK Corresponding author( s): Lisa Hutchinson Major finding : The survival duration of patients with panc reatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the lowest of all cancers. For patients who present with resectable PDAC, adjuvant gemcitabine -based chemotherapy is the standard treatment; however, survival improvements have been noted in patients receiving doublet gemcitabline and platinum -based therapy. Small Molecule Stabilization of the KSR Inactive State Antagonizes Oncogenic Ras Signalling http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556948 Journal : Nature Institution(s) : The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY Corresponding author( s): Arvin Dar Major finding : Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a MAPK scaffold that is subject to allosteric regulation through dimerization with RAF . Direct targeting of KSR could have important therapeutic implications for cancer; however, testing this hypothesis has been difficult owing to a lack of small - molecule antagonis ts of KSR function. These results reveal confo rmational switching in KSR as a druggable regulator of oncogenic Ras, and further suggest co -targeting of enzymatic and scaffolding activities within Ras -MAPK signa ling complexes as a therapeutic strategy for overcoming Ras -driven cancers . Bazedoxifene as a Novel GP130 Inhibitor for Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27535971 Journal : Molecular Cancer Therapeutics Institution(s) : Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan, China , and others Corresponding author( s): Jiayuh Lin Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : Jiayuh Lin , PhD : recipient, 2009 Pilot Grant Major finding : The authors ' results support that Bazedoxifene as a novel inhibitor of GP130 signaling and may be a potential and safe therapeutic agent for human pancreatic cancer th erapy v/pubmed/27555347 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27477511 Journal : Trends in Molecular Medicine Institution(s) : Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA Corresponding author( s): Nabeel Bardeesy Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author Bardeesy , PhD : recipient, 2008 Randy Pausch, PhD - Pilot Grant Major finding : Cancer requires mechanisms to mitigate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during rapid growth, such as induct ion of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nrf2. However, the targets of ROS -mediated cytotoxicity are unclear. Recent studies in pancreatic cancer show that redox control by Nrf2 prevents cysteine oxidation of the mRNA translational machinery, thereby supporting efficient protein synthesis . 14 Pancreatic Cancer: A Role for Redox Regulation in R eviews Gastroenterology and Hepatology Institution(s) : Nature editorial offices, London, UK Corresponding author( s): Iain Dickson Major finding : The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid -derived 2 -like 2 (NFE2L2, also known as NRF2) is a redox master regulator that maintains p ancreatic cancer proliferation by stimulating mRNA translation and mitogenic signalling, according to a new study published in Cell.
