The data suggests that they appear to be ineffective. Can you share please, age, underlying conditions, and location of the dead from COVID-19 since February 1 2021, and most importantly, whether these people were injected or not injected with the drugs or vaccines before they died? Can you confirm the number of dead and injured from the experimental drugs (vaccines) please? We said Thank you for your enquiry. We do publish breakdowns of COVID-19 deaths separately by age, underlying conditions and location. Unfortunately, we do not hold this analysis broken down by whether or not the deceased had received the COVID-19 vaccine. We are currently developing our analytical plans with an intention to publish analysis on the effectiveness of vaccinations. This will be based on linking vaccination data to mortality data, and we intend to include the number of cases where people have died after having received the vaccine as a part of that analysis. Once we have finalised these plans a publication date will be announced on our [Release Calendar.](https://www.ons.gov.uk/releasecalendar) Please see the following publications, which provide analysis related to your request: COVID-19 deaths with pre-existing conditions: ONS have been producing [Pre-existing conditions of people whose death was recorded with an underlying cause of COVID-19, deaths registered in 2020](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/preexistingconditionsofpeoplewhodiedduetocovid19englandandwales), this dataset can be found in section 8 of the Monthly mortality analysis bulletin. This dataset provides a greater insight into the leading pre-existing cause of death groups, for deaths occurring in England and Wales in 2020 that were due to COVID-19. Please see 'table 1a, row 28' for deaths where COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause, with breakdowns of leading pre-existing cause groups. COVID-19 deaths by age: Deaths involving COVID-19 are split by five-year age bands in the 'Covid-19 -- Weekly registrations' table of the [weekly deaths dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales). COVID-19 deaths by location: Deaths \"involving COVID-19\" can be found within [Death registrations and occurrences by local authority and health board](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/datasets/deathregistrationsandoccurrencesbylocalauthorityandhealthboard) dataset. Deaths \"involving COVID-19\" at MSOA geographical level are available are available via our [Monthly Mortality Analysis](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/february2021) under section 3, figure 3. COVID-19 Vaccinations data: Total number of people who have suffered injury following the COVID-19 vaccination: We are unable to provide figures for those who have suffered illness from a COVID-19 vaccination as this is not recorded on the death certificate. As you have quoted statistics from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), we would recommend contacting them directly at [info@mhra.gov.uk](mailto:info@mhra.gov.uk) Total number of deaths as a direct result of receiving the Covid 19 vaccination: You can find the number of deaths involving COVID-19 in table 12 of our [Monthly Mortality Analysis dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales), these include figures for deaths involving adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccination. There are currently 0 deaths registered with the aligning ICD codes for this. However, should this change, they will be updated in this table.
