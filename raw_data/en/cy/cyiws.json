A genome sequence of a virus can reveal mutations in a virus that make it unique. Mutations are changes in a genome sequence (usually one-letter changes) and occur naturally over time. Collecting the genome sequence of virus specimens can also reveal information about the relatedness of viruses and the similarities shared among groups of viruses. Groups of same-species viruses that share a set of genome mutations are referred to as a lineage. Scientists compare viral genomes to better understand virus transmission, how viruses can spread from person to person. Sequencing allows Public Health Ocials to monitor viruses involved in outbreaks, characterize outbreaks, detect clusters of cases and monitor new lineages. Novel mutations can emerge with new lineages and scientists refer to these new lineages as emerging variants. Some of these variants are classied by CDC as variants of concern and others as variants of interest, because of their attributes, which can be for example: increased transmissibility, decreased neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, or increased severity of disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has extensive information about the variant classication (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.html), which is updated as new evidence becomes available. Sequencing can only be performed on samples that contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which means only samples used for molecular tests (such as PCR) can be included. For this reason, this report is limited to conrmed cases only. The genomes that are sequenced and compared are those of the virus, not humans. Sequencing can be performed on stored specimens at any time. For this reason, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and batches of stored specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. The State of Hawaii has conducted sequencing on approximately 6% of positive specimens that were detected sincethebeginningofthetesting, whichranksamongthebestinthenationaccordingtotheCentersforDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#published-covid-sequences) In February 2021, the State Laboratories Division of the Hawaii Department of Health has ramped up the sequencing done on positive samples to increase the ability to detect the new variants of concern and variants of interest early. Since then, between 15-20% of the samples that were detected positive on PCR Covid-19 tests were sequenced (see below for details). 3Acknowledgements This report integrates genomes sequenced since Jan 1, 2021 by: Institution Program/partner Count Percent Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch, State Laboratories Division2786 79.40% Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3)228 6.50% Quest Diagnostics Incorporated 215 6.13% Laboratory Corporation of America 126 3.59% Aegis 54 1.54% Total 3509100.00% Notes: the samples sequenced by CDC in the NS3 program are collected, quality controlled and shipped to CDC by Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch, State Laboratory Division, Hawaii Department of Health County distribution of genomes sequenced since Jan 1st, 20210 Honolulu County Maui County Hawaii County Kauai County unknown Total 1625 441 389 98 233 2786 Notes: County information is currently unavailable except for the samples sequenced by LPRB. Short summary The vast majority of the genomes from Hawaii sequenced in the last 2 weeks belong the Delta variant, which accounts for the current surge in cases in Hawaii, as in the rest of US. The current surge in cases has put a strain on many components of the system that is required to do whole genome sequencing of the virus, including shortages of consumables (pipette tips, sequencing reagents), availability of lab personnel, which are overwhelmed with performing PCR testing and also receiving the samples from our clinical labs partners has been delayed, as they face similar issues caused by the surge. This has resulted in an increased lag from the time a sample is collected to the time it is sequenced and reported, with less data available for the most recent weeks. The Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch within State Laboratories Division has taken steps to overcome these diculties, including implementing a new protocol for genome sequencing, which allows faster turn-around times and increased throughput and it is not aected by the current nation-wide sequencing reagents backlog. 4As a result of these measures and also due to CDC and its commercial partners sequencing more genomes from Hawaii compared to previous months, the rst half of August has been covered at levels comparable to the pre-surge intervals. 5Signicance of variants of concern and variants of interest It is important to note that evidence to date shows that vaccination leads to milder cases, not requiring hospitalization, for all the variants of concern and variants of interest that are described here, even if the ecacy of antibodies is diminished against some of these variants compared to the original version of the virus. Also,noneof these variants are classied as a \"variant of high consequence\" , according to CDC variant categories (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#Consequence), which is a category that would imply a variant has the ability to evade diagnosis, signicantly reduce the vaccines eectiveness and protection against severe disease, signicantly reduce susceptibility to treatments or lead to more severe disease and increased hospitalizations. Variants of concern Delta variant (B.1.617.2 and AY.* sub-lineages) B.1.617.2 was rst identied in India and it is also known as variant 21A. WHO labeled it Delta on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the L452R mutation in the spike protein that is present in Epsilon variants, plus a few additional spike mutations predicted to have functional consequences (e.g. T478K). The Delta variant is highly contagious, more than 2x as contagious as previous variants. For more information about Delta, go to (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html). Alpha variant (B.1.1.7 and Q.* sub-lineages) B.1.1.7 was rst identied in the United Kingdom and it is also known as VOC202012/01 and 20I/501Y.V1. WHO labeled it \"Alpha\" on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the N501Y mutation and a short deletion in the Spike (S) protein. This variant is concerning because it has been shown to be signicantly more transmissible (~50%) than the original SARS-CoV-2 lineages and recent analyses from the United Kingdom suggest that B.1.1.7 cases are more likely to require hospitalization. B.1.1.7 does not appear to evade vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses. Gamma variant (P.1 and P.1.* sub-lineages) P.1 was rst identied in Brazil and it also known as variant 20J/501Y.V3. WHO labeled it \"Gamma\" on May 31, 2021. This variant also contains the N501Y mutation, like B.1.1.7 but not the deletion in the spike protein. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant. Beta variant (B.1.351 and B.1.351.* sub-lineages) B.1.351 was rst identied in South Africa and it is also known as 20H/501Y.V2. WHO labeled it \"Beta\" on May 31, 2021. This variant is highly infectious and can quickly spread from person to person. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant. 6Variants of interest Mu variant (B.1.621) Lineage B.1.621 was rst identied in Columbia in January 2021 and it has a couple of mutations that are common with the Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma( P.1) variants, which have been associated with high transmissibility (N501Y) and a level of vaccine eciency decrease (E484K). It has been designated by WHO as a variant of interest on Aug 30 (https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/) and labeled \"Mu\", but CDC has not included it in its variants of interests list (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ 2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#Interest), as its prevalence in US has been low (<0.1%) and hasn't increased in the last few months and therefore, we are not showing it in the charts and tables below as a variant of interest. So far, this variant has been seen in 35 samples from Hawaii, the rst one in the beginning of June 2021 and the last one at the end of July 2021. Iota variant (B.1.526) B.1.526 was rst identied in New York and is classied by CDC as a variant of interest, because there are signs that it has increased transmissibility. WHO has labeled it \"Iota\" on May 31, 2021. Some of the samples (but not all) of this variant contain a mutation (E484K) that is also present in B.1.351 which can potentially make it less responsive to antibodies. Epsilon variant (B.1.429 and B.1.427) These closely related variants, B.1.429 and B.1.427, were rst identied in California and designated initially as CA VUI1. WHO labeled them \"Epsilon\" on May 31, 2021. They can quickly spread from person-to-person, with an estimated ~20% higher eciency than the original virus. CDC has deescalated \"Epsilon\" from a \"variant of concern\" to \"variant of interest\" on June 29, 2021, due to the signicant decrease in the proportion of B.1.429/B.1.427 lineage viruses circulating nationally and available data indicating that vaccines and treatments are eective against this variant. CDC has removed B.1.429 and B.1.427 from the \"variants of interest\" list in July 2021 due to declining prevalence and very few detections in recent months. Zeta variant (P.2) P.2 was rst identied in Brazil and is classied by CDC as a variant of interest. It contains a mutation (E484K) that is also present in B.1.351 which can potentially make it less responsive to antibodies. This variant has been removed from the \"variant of interest\" list in July 2021 due to few detections in recent months. 7State of shows the total number of variants by lineage detected in the State of Hawaii in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient) Variants of concern are shown as follows orange/brown = Delta (lineages B.1.617.2 + AY.*) , dark blue = Alpha (lineages B.1.1.7 + Q.*), purple = Beta (lineage B.1.351) and green = Gamma (lineages P.1 + P.1.*) Variants of interest are shown in pink: Epsilon (lineages B.1.429 and B.1.427) and Iota (lineage B.1.526) The red line graph above it shows the percentage of the PCR-test positive samples from each 2-week time interval that were sequenced.

Not all positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens are sequenced and sequenced specimens are not a random selection of all COVID-19 cases in Hawaii. This chart has been generated only counting samples that were selected randomly for the purpose of surveillance, to avoid over-representing the samples that were selected for investigations of clusters. The last 2-week interval numbers will most likely change, as a number of samples that are currently being processed will be added. Sequencing of certain specimens can be delayed for technical reasons. For this reason, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. 9Variants of concern in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Delta 1226 B.1.617.2 India 822 18 May 2021 05 Sep States 14621 Jun 2021 Sep 2021 AY.3 United States 90 28 Jun 2021 25 Aug AY.1 Europe 5330 Jun 2021 23 Aug 2021 AY.2 States 29 01 Jun 2021 22 Jul 2021 AY.14 United States 2724 Jun 2021 19 Aug 2021 AY.13 United States 17 09 Jun 2021 19 Aug AY.20 United States/Mexico1510 Jul 2021 02 Sep 2021 09 2021 21 Aug States/Mexico601 Aug 2021 2021 04 2021 United States 45 21 Mar 2021 03 Aug 2021 Gamma 184 P.1 Brazil 103 21 Mar 2021 21 Jul 2021 P.1.10 United States 8124 Apr 2021 14 Jul 2021 Beta B.1.351 South Africa 15 16 Feb 2021 08 Jul 2021 Variants of interest in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Epsilon 771 B.1.429 California 712 31 Dec 2020 03 California 5907 Dec 2020 05 Iota York 128 06 23 Jul 2021 10Honolulu County Total shows the total number of variants detected in Honolulu County in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown - (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient) Variants of concern are shown as follows orange/brown = Delta (lineages B.1.617.2 + AY.*) , dark blue = Alpha (lineages B.1.1.7 + Q.*), purple = Beta (lineage B.1.351) and green = Gamma (lineages P.1 + P.1.*) Variants of interest are shown in pink: Epsilon (lineages B.1.429 and B.1.427) and Iota (lineage B.1.526) The red line graph above it shows the percentage of the PCR-test positive samples from each 2-week time interval that were sequenced.
