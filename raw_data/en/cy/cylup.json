The choice of a PCP is made solely by the Member . If the Member is a minor or otherwise incapable of selecting a PCP , the Subscriber should select a PCP on the Member's behalf. If the Member does not select a PCP within a reasonable time after being eligible for Covered Benefits , the HMO will designate a PCP for the Member and notify the Member of such selection. The Member can change the selection of PCP thereafter. The PCP is not an agent or employee of the HMO and the selection of a PCP by HMO is merely a convenience for Members to provide access to Covered Benefits The Primary Care Physician The PCP coordinates a Member's medical care, as appropriate, either by providing treatment or by issuing Referrals to direct the Member to another Participating Provider . The PCP can also order lab tests and x- rays, prescribe medicines or therapies, and arrange hospitalization. Except in a Medical Emergency or for certain direct access Specialist benefits as described in this Contract , only those services which are provided by or referred by a Member's PCP will be covered. Covered Benefits are described in the Covered Benefits section of this Contract . It is a Member's responsibility to consult with the PCP in all matters regarding the Member's medical care. Certain PCP offices are affiliated with integrated delivery systems or other provi der groups (i.e., Independent Practice Associations and Physician -Hospital Organizations), and Members who select these PCPs will generally be referred to Specialists and Hospitals within that system or group. However, if the group does not include a Provi der qualified to meet the Member's medical needs, the Member may request to have services provided by nonaffiliated Providers. In certain situations where a Member requires ongoing care from a Specialist , the Member may receive a standing Referral to such Specialist . Please refer to the Covered Benefits section of this Contract for details. If the Member's PCP performs, suggests, or recommends a Member for a course of treatment that includes services that are not Covered Benefits , the entire cost of any such non -covered services will be the Member's responsibility. Covered Benefits also include Telemedicine through TelaDoc . Registration with an internet service vendor may be required . Information about TelaDoc who conduct Telemedicine consultations may be found in the provider Directory, online in DocFind on www.Aetna.com or by calling the number on your Member identification card. Availability of Providers Aetna cannot guarantee the a vailability or continued participation of a particular Provider or Participating Medical Group in the Aetna Value Network . Either Aetna or any Participating Provider HI IVL1a -Contract 0 2 IVL 2015 Off -Exchange NV ed. 5 -5-15 - 7 - may terminate the Provider contract or limit the number of Members that will be accepted as patients. If the PCP initially selected cannot accept additional patients, the Member will be notified and given an opportunity to make another PCP selection from the Participating Medical Group in the Aetna Value Network . The Mem ber must then cooperate with Aetna to select another PCP . If the Member does not select a PCP within a reasonable time after being eligible for Covered Benefits , the HMO will designate a PCP for the Member and notify the Member of such selection. The Mem ber can change the selection of PCP thereafter. The PCP is not an agent or employee of the HMO and the selection of a PCP by HMO is merely a convenience for Members to provide access to Covered Benefits. Changing a PCP You may change your PCP at any time by calling the Member Services toll- free telephone number listed on the Member's identification card or by written or electronic submission of the Aetna's change form. A Member may contact Aetna to request a change form or for assistance in co mpleting that form. The change will become effective upon Aetna 's receipt and approval of the request. Ongoing Reviews Aetna conducts ongoing reviews of those services and supplies which are recommended or provided by Health Professionals to determine whether such services and supplies are Covered Benefits under this Contract . If Aetna determines that the recommended services and supplies are not Covered Benefits , the Member will be notified. If a Member wishes to appeal such determination, the Member may then contact Aetna to seek a review of the determination. Please refer to the Claim Procedures/Complaints and Appeals section of this Contract . The Referral Process Except for PCP , direct access and emergency or Urgent Care services, you must have a prior written or electronic Referral from your PCP to receive the plan's network level of coverage for all services and any necessary follow -up treatment. How Referrals Work Here are some important points to remember: When your PCP determines that your treatment should be provided by a Specialist or Hospital or other health care professional, you will receive a written or electronic Referral . The Referral will be good for 60 days, as long as you remain covered under th e plan. Go over the Referral with your PCP. Make sure you understand what types of services have been recommended and why. When you visit the provider or facility, bring the Referral (or check in advance to verify that they have received the electronic Referral ). Without it, you will receive out -of-network coverage even if you receive your treatment from a Participating Provider . Certain services such as inpatient stays, outpatient surgery and certain other medical procedures and tests require both a PC P referral and Precertification . Precertification verifies HI IVL1a -Contract Off -Exchange NV ed. 5 -5-15 - 8 - that the recommended treatment is a Covered Benefit as described in the Covered Benefit section. This is not a guarantee that benefits will be payable if, for example, it is determined at the time the claim is submitted that you were not eligible for benefits at that time. Your PCP or other Participating Providers are responsible for obtaining Precertification for you. You cannot request a Referral from your PCP after you have received serv ices or supplies from a Specialist or Hospital . If a service or supply that you need is not available from a Participating Provider , your PCP may refer you to an Non -Participating Provider . Your PCP or other network Physician must get pre - approval from Aetna for services from Non -Participating Providers so that Covered Benefits can be covered at the network level of benefits as shown in your Schedule of Benefits . Ongoing Specialist Care If you have a condition which requires ongoing care from a Specialist , you or your Physician may request a standing Referral to such Specialist . Circumstances which may warrant this type of Referral include, but are not limited to, a high risk pregnancy or dialysis treatment. You should initially make this Request through your PCP. If Aetna, the PCP and/or Specialist, in consultation with a medical director, determine that such a standing Referral is appropriate, Aetna will authorize such a Referral to Specialist who is a Participating Provider . Aetna is not required to permit you to elect a Specialist who is an Non - Participating Provider , unless such a Specialist is not available within the network. Any authorized Referral shall be made pursuant to a treatment plan approved by Aetna in consultation wi th the PCP, the Specialist and you, or your designee. The treatment plan may limit the number of visits or the period during which the visits are authorized and may require the Specialist to provide the PCP with regular updates on the specialty care pro vided, as well as all necessary medical information. When You Don't Need a PCP Referral You don't need a PCP referral for: Emergency care - See Coverage for Emergency Medical Conditions . Urgent care - See Coverage for Urgent Conditions . Direct access services - Services from Participating Providers for which the Referra l is not required. Certain routine and preventive services do not require a Referral under the plan when accessed in accordance with the age and frequency limitations outlined in the Covered Benefits section and the Schedule of Benefits . Refer to the Covered Benefits section for information on when these benefits are covered. You can directly access these Participating Specialists for: - Routine gynecological and Pap smear visits - Obstetrical services - Annual screening mammogram for age -eligible women - Routine prenatal care - Routine eye exams, including refraction - Preventive Dental Care for your dependents under the age of 19 HI IVL1a -Contract 0 2 IVL 2015 Off -Exchange NV ed. 5 -5-15 - 9 - Precertification Certain services and supplies under this Contract may require precertification by Aetna to determine if they are Covered Benefits under this Contract.

HI IVL1a -Contract 0 2 IVL 2015 Off -Exchange NV ed. 5 -5-15 - 34 - Getting an Advance Claim Review The purpose of the advance claim review is to determine, in advance, the benefits the plan will pay for proposed services. Knowing ahead of tim e which services are covered by the plan, and the benefit amount payable, helps you and your dentist make informed decisions about the care you are considering. Important Note: The pre -treatment review process is not a guarantee of benefit payment, but rather an estimate of the amount or scope of benefits to be paid. When to Get an Advance Claim Review An advance claim review is recommended whenever a course of dental treatmen t is likely to cost more than $300. Ask your dentist to write down a full description of the treatment you need, using either an Aetna claim form or an ADA approved claim form. Then, before actually treating you, your dentist should send the form to Aetna . Aetna may request supporting images and other diagnostic records. Once all of the information has been gathered, Aetna will review the proposed treatment plan and provide you and your dentist with a statement outlining the benefits payable by the plan. You and your dentist can then decide how to proceed. The advance claim review is voluntary. It is a service that provides you with information that you and your dentist can consider when decidi ng on a course of treatment. It is not necessary for emergency treatment or routine care such as cleaning teeth or check -ups. In determining the amount of benefits payable, Aetna will take into account alternate procedures, services, or courses of treatment for the dental condition in question in order to accomplish the anticipated result. (See the Alternate Treatment Rule later in this amendment for more information on alternate dental procedures.) What Is a Course of Dental Treatment? A course of de ntal treatment is a planned program of one or more services or supplies. The services or supplies are provided by one or more dentists to treat a dental condition that was diagnosed by the attending dentist as a result of an oral examination. A course of treatment starts on the date your dentist first renders a service to correct or treat the diagnosed dental condition. In Case of a Dental Emergency If you need dental care for the palliative treatment (e.g., pain relieving, stabilizing) of a dental emergency , you are covered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. HI IVL1a -Contract 0 2 IVL 2015 Off -Exchange NV ed. 5 -5-15 - 35 - A dental emergency is any dental condition which: Occurs unexpectedly; Requires immediate diagnosis and treatment in order to stabilize the condition; and Is characterized by symptoms such as severe pain and bleeding.

If you are not able to reach your dental network provider or are away from home, you may get treatment from any dentist . You may also call Aetna Member Services at the toll -free telepho ne number on your ID card for help in finding a dentist . The care received from a dental out -of- network provider must be for the temporary relief of the dental emergency until you can be seen by your dental network provider . Care received from a dental out-of-network provider for other than the temporary relief of the dental emergency may cost you more. To receive the maximum level of benefits, care should be provided by a dental network provider. What does the Plan pay when you go to an out -of-network provider for a Dental Emergency? The network level of coverage applies for services and supplies received from a dental out -of-network provider for the temporary relief of a dental emergency . The care provided must be a covered service or supply. You must submit a claim to Aetna describing the care given by an out -of-network provider in order to receive reimbursement. Reimbursement will be based upon the network covered amount according to the Type of dental expense, as shown in the Schedule of Benefits , up to the dental emergency maximum. You are responsible for charges above the dental emergency maximum. Additional dental care to treat the dental condition after the dental emergency has been stabilized will be covered at the appropriate coin surance level depending upon where you receive service. If you use a dental network provider for follow -up care, the network level of benefits applies. The plan pays a benefit up to the dental emergency maximum for care provided by an out -of-network provider.
