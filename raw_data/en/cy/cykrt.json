Current strategies to mitigate IAV risk focus on prophylactic seasonal vaccines manufactured primarily in embryonated chicken eggs, requiring long lead times and that vaccines be updated and re-administered on a yearly basis due to antigenic changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. A clear need exists for influenza vaccines that can be rapidly manufactured and result in broader immunity and protection against disease caused by influenza virus infection. In this dissertation, I describe the production and characterization of novel IAV virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines containing neuraminidase (NA) from recent seasonal IAV strains produced using a recombinant baculovirus expression system in Trichoplusia ni insect cells. I demonstrate that NA virus-like particles produced using the NA sequence derived from the H1N1 virus A/California/04/2009 (NA1) and the H3N2 virus A/Perth/16/2009 (NA2) are immunogenic in a murine model. Additionally, I demonstrate that the bivalent administration of NA1 and NA2 VLPs is protective in a murine model against lethal challenge with both heterologous H3N2 mouse adapted A/Hong Kong/1/1968 virus and homologous H1N1 mouse adapted A/California/04/2009. Furthermore, I show that bivalent administration of NA1 and NA2 VLPs reduced viral lung replication after A/Hong Kong/1/1968 challenge compared to monovalent administration of NA2 VLPs. I also investigate NA2 VLP vaccination in a swine infection model. I compared the immunogenicity and virological responses against a commercially available licensed swine influenza vaccine. Pigs vaccinated with NA2 VLPs demonstrated a superior anti-NA immune response compared to vaccination with the commercial vaccine or mock vaccination. Furthermore, pigs vaccinated with NA2 VLPs and the commercial vaccine had a similar and significant reduction in virus replication in lung tissue and pulmonary histopathology scores compared to mock vaccinated controls post challenge with the recently circulating H3N2 swine virus, A/swine/NC/KH15/2016. This work has demonstrated that anti-NA immunity is capable of conferring protection against IAV challenge and could augment existing influenza virus vaccines. NA VLPs have the potential to supplement current influenza virus vaccines and should be considered in future vaccine development.
