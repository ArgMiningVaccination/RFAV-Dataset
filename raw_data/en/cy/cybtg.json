Each essential oil has a unique composition of chemicals, and this variation affects the smell, absorption, and effects on the body. The chemical composition of essential oil may vary within the same plant species, or from plant to plant. Health benefits of essential oils - Stress and anxiety - Headaches and migraines - Sleep and insomnia - Reducing inflammation - Antibiotic and antimicrobial Usage: 1. Inhalation Essential oils typically are extracted using steam distillation, a process that involves applying steam to a plant until only oil remains. Essential oils contain volatile compounds, which make up the strong characteristic scent of a plant and give them their therapeutic effects. In aromatherapy, these volatile compounds are inhaled using either a drop of oil on a piece of cloth, jewelry, or other items, or diffused into the air with an aromatherapy diffuser. When inhaled, molecules in essential oils are believed to influence the nervous system and the limbic area of the brain, as well as hormones, brain chemicals, and metabolism. 2. Topical Essential oils sometimes are applied directly to the skin to treat pain in a specific body part\u2014to relieve backache, for example, or to ease sore muscles, or to relieve sinus pain\u2014and some may be used topically for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, such as for acne or fungal infections. 3. Ingestion Some essential oils can be used in cooking or even swallowed in small doses as medication, but this should be done with great caution. While many are safe in small doses, others are inherently poisonous and should never be ingested. [Similia Arnica Hair Oil "}
