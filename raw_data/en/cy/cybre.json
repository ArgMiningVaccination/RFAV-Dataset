Last unit of this block will help you to voice your own problems and raise iss ues and find practical solutions. Friends, you have all gained some experience as teachers. We all look at the craft of teaching by recalling our teachers who thought us during our student-hood. Our elders at home, our friends, our peers who could not attend class always inquire about what our tea chers taught us on a particular day or during a particular period in our class. All wer e really interested in knowing what we learned during the day or during the particular period thr ough the teaching of our teachers. In short all of us are interested in our learning and teaching of our teachers. That is why any person enters into teaching profession considers herself or him self to be as competent and qualified for teaching. 1 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesUNIT 5 PLANNING & MANAGING SCIENCE AT UPPER PRIMARY LEVEL Structure 5.0 Introduction 5.1 Learning Objectives5.2 Overview of Planning5.3 Planning and Curriculum Coverage in Science 5.3.1 Curriculum and Syllabus115.3.2 Curriculum and Instruction5.3.3 The Goal of Science Education5.3.4 Scientific Concepts at Elementary Level5.3.5 Issues In Planning Science Curriculum5.3.6 Advantage of planning of science curriculum5.4 Planning At Class Level: Lesson Plan5.4.1 A Well-Developed Lesson Analysis:5.4.4 Steps of Lesson Planning:5.4.5 Design/Format For The Lesson 5.5 Identifying And Using Various Resources 5.5.1 Meaning of Resources5.5.2 Importance of Resources5.5.3 Types of Educational Resources 5.5.3.1 Resources At School Level5.5.3.2 Resources At Local Level 5.5.4 Classification of Resources 5.5.4.1 Non-Electronic Resources 5.5.4.2 Electronic Resources 2Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)5.5.5 Advantages of Resources 5.5.6 Criteria For Selection of Resources 5.6 Recording And Reporting 5.6.1 Evaluation of Students Learning5.6.2 Evaluation of Planned Curriculum5.6.3 Role of Teacher 5.7 Let Us Sum Up5.8 Model Answers to Check Your Progress5.9 Suggested Readings and References5.10 Unit-End Exercises Unit 5 Planning & Managing Science education at Elementary Level Planning Science education at Elementary Level Managing Science education at Elementary Level Overview of Planning Planning and curriculum coverage in science Planning at class level: lesson plan Using various resources Electronic Materials Non electronic Materials At local level At school level Identifying various resources Recording Reporting Concept MapUnit 5 5.0 INTRODUCTION Teaching of science, particularly at the elementary level, is an important aspect of present day science education. In the previous block you have studied the nature ofthe science subject and the different approaches and strategies for teaching science 3 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNoteswith an emphasis on the inquiry-based approach. As a science teacher you must be very much interested in planning and organizing the science curriculum over a periodof that time so that you and your students enjoy learning science together and makingit a joyful experience. In this unit we will discuss the whole process of how to plan the curriculum holistically following the approach 'from whole to parts'. This will be done sequentially from yearplan to lesson plan using and managing the resources and then recording and reportingthe assessment to the stakeholders i.e. students, parents and school authorities. 5.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES After going through this unit, you should be able to: explain the need for planning curriculum prepare a year plan and unit plans based on concept maps for science curriculumfor your class. plan lessons at the class level. identify various resources of teaching science at school and local level. assess and select various resources on the criteria of relevancy and ageappropriateness. use appropriate resources- non-electronic and electronic, in teaching science. describe procedure of recording and reporting. 5.2 OVERVIEW OF PLANNING Imagine that you are suddenly asked to deliver a 30 minute talk on a topic. What willbe your thoughts? \"Do I know the topic thoroughly? Will I be able to organize mypresentation sequentially? Will it sound logical?\" so on and so forth. Since you havenot planned the talk and not prepared you may have goose bumps on your skin andyou may become nervous. But if you know well in advance that you have to make apresentation, you will make notes, organize, practice and will be very confident. Ahousewife plans the dinner for the guests to the minute details. A lawyer spends hoursplanning a case before appearing in court. An executive plans his day in advance withspecific appointments and assignments. A political leader plans his/her speech beforespeaking in public. A coach spends hours planning the play. Then when we attempt thecomplicated teaching-learning process, is it not necessary to plan and prepare for thisimportant activity? You know that the quality of planning affects the quality of results. A careful preparation results in excellence. To be effective in our class we shoulddevote much time and energy in carefully planning and preparing for the whole year foreach unit of the syllabus and for the daily lessons. 4Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)Year Plan: Year plan is an outline of many units of the whole curriculum and also the time required to realize the curriculum. The syllabus is divided into a number of unitsand then the time is allocated to each unit which involves teaching, revision andassessment. It is the program of action of curriculum. In the very beginning of the year, your first task is to plan for the whole year by considering the units to be covered inscience and the number of periods available for each unit in the whole year. You needto analyze the content and plan for teaching-learning, revising and testing. You alsohave to consider the holidays and vacations when you allot the time for each unit. Unit Plan: The unit is an outline of the program of action after determining the sub- units. It is a detailed plan which consists of intended learning outcomes, teaching-learning strategies and activities and assessment tool for the learning outcomes. Adetailed analysis of the unit and its sub-units is required while preparing the unit plan. The formats for year plan and unit plan are provided at the end of this unit as Appendix 1 and 2 as examples for you to go through and prepare for your class and subject. Lesson Plan: A lesson plan is for a particular period and may be of 30/40 minutes as per your school schedule. It is a very detailed and specific plan consisting of intendedlearning outcomes, description of teaching- learning strategies and activities and actualtool for assessment of the learning outcomes. This is further described in detail insection 5.4 below. Figure 5.1 shows the relationship between them: Figure 5.1 Relationship between Year plan, Unit Plan and Lesson Plan 5.3 PLANNING AND CURRICULUM COVERAGE IN SCIENCE In your school staff room you may have heard words such as the following: \"There is never enough time to complete the curriculum\" \"The science curriculum is so vast and difficult...\" 5 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes \"I found an amazing website for science lessons.\" \"I need extra lectures to complete the syllabus.\" You may have spoken also such words yourself. Let us be clear and get exact about this concept. The word \"Curriculum\" is derived from the Latin word curere which means the course of a chariot race. However, curriculum means much more than a onetrack race and claims for an understanding giving functional meaning to education. It can be perceived as a connective link between the teacher and the students so as to achieve the goals of education. It provides a framework that explains external settingsfor the learning process. It is concisely defined in Webster's Dictionary as: \"A courseof study offered by a school\". Curriculum can be considered as \u2014 Content: A body of knowledge that is to be transacted. It is equated with syllabus. Product: An attempt to achieve certain goals for students. Objectives are set, the content plan is developed and practiced, and the outcomes are determined.Thus, it is a product of a systematic study. Process: Teachers think critically, about their role, propose activities based on educational goals, modify as per the need of the students, demonstrate in-action, thinking, encourage, dialogue between students and themselves. They continually evaluate the process and what they can see of outcomes. Doll (1996) defines it as follows \"The curriculum of a school is the formal and informal content and process by which learners gain knowledge and understanding, developskills, and alter attitudes, appreciations, and values under the auspices of that school\". ACTIVITY -1 Draw a flow chart /mind map for the above definition of curriculum. ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ Decide which aspect of the curriculum you believe - Content, Product or Process? Give reasons for your choice ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 6Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)5.3.1 Curriculum and Syllabus Many a times these words are used interchangeably, however they represent different but connected concepts. A syllabus is an outline of a specific course. It includes thetopics to be covered, their order, often the required and suggested reading material,and any other relevant information. A curriculum refers to all the courses offered in aspecific program. It is a complete set of taught material in a school system. Curriculumprescribes the objectives while, the syllabus describes the means to achieve them.Hence curriculum is prescriptive while syllabus is descriptive. 5.3.2 Curriculum and Instruction Curriculum is the goals, the content, and the process of how to teach that content toachieve the set goals. Instruction is a more detailed plan of how to teach that contentalong with its implementation. The curriculum answers the question what is to be taught.It is designed by state boards of education and is influenced by policies, mandates,and legislation. Instruction answers the question how. For optimum students' learningboth should be congruent. Therefore the instructional methods and strategies selectedand used by you should be compatible with the curriculum. Instruction is the deliveryof the content by you to achieve the set goals making them accessible and attainable toall students using your personal and professional skills. 5.3.3 The Goals of Science Education The goals of science education at any level can be broadly categorized as: development of skills of inquiry, nurturance of positive attitudes, and acquisition of scientific knowledge about the biological and physical aspects ofthe world As a science teacher you should see that the science curriculum is structured in such a way that children can experience all these elements. A shared understanding of thepurpose and nature of science will promote a coordinated approach to the planningand teaching of science throughout the school and will also facilitate the evaluation ofteaching resources and approaches. 5.3.4 Scientific Concepts at Elementary Level The nine scientific concepts that elementary school children should learn and understandare given in figure 5.2 below: 7 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes Scientific Concepts Figure 5.2 The nine scientific concepts for elementary Education Source: The National Center for Improving Science Education. Let us see what we mean by each of these nine concepts before working out activity indicated at figure 5.2 . These nine concepts are:1. Organization : Science is the study of the natural world. Scientists organize and classify the objects and events they observe to understand how things work suchas: Hierarchy-ranking according to some characteristic and Grouping-based onshared characteristic. You can ask your students to collect leaves, flowers, stonesetc. and sort according to their characteristics. They can learn the concept oforganization through this activity. 2. Cause and effect : Science seeks to explain and understand the natural world. Things happen for a reason: there is a cause for every effect. Such as growth ofa plant, colours in a rainbow, evaporation etc. You can point out these things toyour students by asking them to plant seeds and observe. 3. Systems : A system is a group of related, interacting parts that together form an interdependent whole. Students can learn about systems by observing the changesin the various parts of the whole, using familiar things in their lives such as anaquarium or a pond. 4. Models : A model is a physical object which represents another thing. You can ask the students to make models from clay and compare it to the actual object. 8Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)For example, making a clay model of a plant or a body, and asking them to relate them to actual thing. 5. Scale : This refers to size and quantity. Students can demonstrate by actually measuring heights and weights of classmates, temperature of warm and coldwater and mixing them. 6. Structure and function : There is a relationship between the way things look, feel, sound, etc. and how they act or what they do. Students can observe andanalyze the differences in the structure of objects around them and try to relatethem to the different functions of those objects for example, human body orplants have different parts to do different jobs. 7. Change : The natural world constantly changes. Some of these are quick and easy to observe while others take place over days or months or years. Studentscan be asked to observe the changes in the world around them. For example, theweather, phases of the moon, day and night temperature, seasons etc. Studentscan experiment with freezing, melting, evaporating and boiling of water tounderstand the water cycle. 8. Variation : Everything, living or non-living, has a set of characteristics, or properties, different from other. The world is full of variations. Some of these differences aresmall or insignificant, like hair color while others are much more significant, likethe difference between living and non-living things. There are variations betweenthe individuals within a species such as breed of dogs or cats, as well as in anindividual as it grows and changes throughout its life like a caterpillar changinginto a butterfly. Students can observe these changes and can draw conclusions. 9. Diversity : This is the most obvious characteristic of the natural world. You can make your students to understand that diversity in nature is essential for naturalsystems to survive. Children can explore and investigate a pond, for instance, tolearn that different organisms feed on different things. ACTIVITY -2 Column A has scientific concepts and column B has some examples. Match the example from column B with each concept in column A Column A: Scientific ConceptsColumn B: Examples 1. Organization a. exploring and investigating a pond 2. Cause & Effect b.

To be sure you may check their answers given at the end of this unit. 5.3.5 Issues in Planning Science Curriculum How will you plan for your lessons in science? What are the things you will have to consider before planning? You should be aware of the following issues in planning yourscience curriculum: Theme based versus subject-centered approach An integrated curriculum is particularly suited to younger children, because they view the world and their experiences in a holistic way. Theme teaching and subject integrationare important at all levels, but require careful planning. Planning helps to ensure that,within the range of themes used, a comprehensive coverage of the content componentsis achieved and adequate opportunities are provided for the development of scientificskills and concepts. One of the most important aspects of the science curriculum is the emphasis placed on the exploration of the local environment of the child and school. If you are familiar withthe locality of the school, the range of habitats in the area and other features of thenatural environment it will facilitate the planning process. Textbooks and worksheetsThe use of textbooks and worksheets needs to be limited as supportive to active exploratory/investigative work. You all should discuss and evaluate these resourceswhen you plan for science education. Science lessons should not be based only ontextbook or worksheet. You should select activities that will assist children in undertakingopen-ended tasks. 10Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)Safety in science activities You should be well aware of the safety implications of any exploratory or investigative work to be undertaken. Safety should permeate all aspects of the teaching of science,and children should be encouraged to observe safety procedures during all tasks.Safety precautions cannot remove all risks but should eliminate unnecessary hazards.Science activities at elementary level should not involve the use of chemicals or otherhazardous materials. ACTIVITY-3 Select a topic from science syllabus of class VI or VIII. Decide on a teaching- learning activity as per your choice. Write the title of the lesson: ........................................ Std. ........................... Fill In the following table with respect to selected activities. Basic Identifiable Pr ecautions to Management procedures hazards be taken of hazards 5.3.6 Advantages of Planning of Science Curriculum Planning of science curriculum helps you to ensure a proper provision of the following and many more: access to a comprehensive range of scientific concepts opportunities to work scientifically a balance between the different aspects of the curriculum integration of science and technology inquiry based activities activities to explore and investigate the environment 11 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes provides for continuity and progression in the development of scientific ideas and in the application of investigative skills. Besides, there should also be a balance between the development of scientific knowledge and understanding on the one hand and the processes of workingscientifically on the other. 5.4 PLANNING AT CLASS LEVEL: LESSON PLAN To ensure optimum learning, we must carefully select and arrange activities that willproduce the desired learning outcomes in our students. Only through careful planningwe can be certain that we include all necessary information and have our lesson planproperly organized to achieve the lesson objectives. A lesson plan is a teacher's detailed description of the course of instruction for one class. Daily lesson plan is developed by a teacher to guide her classroom instruction.Details will vary depending on the preference of the teacher, the topics being covered,and the need of the students. 5.4.1 A Well-developed Lesson Plan A well-developed lesson plan reflects interests and needs of students. It features bestpractices of curriculum transaction. The lesson plan correlates with the teacher'sphilosophy of education what the teacher thinks as a purpose of learning that topic. The 5 W's and 1 H is a strategy that is regarded as basics in knowing and understanding something. It is a sort of checklist of six questions to get a full story of something. Wecan use it for our planning of daily lessons. Rudyard Kipling (1902) has put them inone of his poems as: \"I keep six honest serving-menThey taught me all I knew;Their names are What and Why and When And How and Where and Who\". Figure 5.3 5 Ws and 1 H 12Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)5.4.2 Planning Science Lessons Applying the 5Ws and 1 H strategy to planning science lessons requires you to answer the following four basic questions. Try to get the answers. The answers to the remainingtwo questions are already with you. Figure 5.4 Let's explain the above figure in brief. What to teach? (Selecting the content/concepts) The content is decided and is given in the syllabus. The pedagogical analysis of the content will help you in organizing and sequencing of the content. You candevelop a concept map of the concepts involved for effective planning. Why to teach? (Deciding the learning outcomes) You need to consider why is a particular content is included in the syllabus. What is expected of a student after learning that content? Those are the intended learningoutcomes. While selecting the learning outcomes, you need to consider the abilitiesof your students. Lesson outcomes anticipated by you are based on the sciencesyllabus you follow. You also will learn about these in detail in the unit \"Assessment and Evaluation\". How to teach? (Selecting methods and strategies) In the earlier units you have learned about different methods, strategies and approaches. Decide the suitable approaches for the content and the intendedlearning outcomes. As your teaching practices develop, you will be able to plan 13 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesscience lessons that cater effectively for different learning styles. You will also provide for activities catering to the various multiple intelligences. Undoubtedly,you will need to include activities to help students who are lacking behind as wellas for the gifted and talented students. You also need to take into consideration the timeframe while scheduling the activities. Also decide about the resources required. They can be human orenvironmental. How to assess? (Deciding the assessment procedures): You want to know, whether the learning outcomes which you have started with, are achieved or not. So you need to select appropriate procedures to checkstudents' progress. You will learn about them in detail in the unit \"Assessment andEvaluation\". 5.4.3 Pedagogical Analysis This whole process mentioned above is known as \"pedagogical analysis\" It is done atthree stages Pre-active stageThis stage involves the following activities: Ascertaining entry competence Stating learning outcomes Analyzing content and subordinate concepts Identifying types of learning Interactive stageThis stage involves the following activities: Deciding methods/approaches of stimulus presentation Deciding on expected learners' responses Giving feedback Evaluative stageThis stage involves the following activity: Determining the tools to check for achievement of the intended learning outcomes. This analysis is translated into action through lesson planning and practiced in the field which is described in the next point. 14Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)5.4.4 Steps of Lesson Planning When you put all the above stages together you will find that the complete cycle of lesson planning includes eight steps: 1. Determine the objectives2. Research the topic as defined by the objectives3. Select the appropriate instructional method4. Identify a usable lesson planning format5. Decide how to organize the lesson6. Choose appropriate support material 7. Prepare the beginning and ending of the lesson 8. Prepare a final outline.While planning the lesson you need to rigorously focus on the following points: Framing the learning objectives:An objective is a statement of purpose for the whole lesson. It specifies what students will be able to do by the end of the lesson. The statement must use averb that states the action to be taken to show accomplishment. The objectivedecides the total lesson. ACTIVITY -4 Modify the following sentences into proper form of learning objectives and write in the parenthesis. The student will be able to-1. Learn the function of heart (..................)2. Understand the concept of adaptation (..................)3. Know the difference between breathing and respiration (..................) Selecting the teaching-learning strategy An effective teaching strategy will decrease your classroom management problems and will increase involvement of your students in the teaching-learning process.It will definitely result in a good learning environment. You have already learnedabout the various strategies and their merits in the previous chapters. These 15 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesteaching strategies bring about new dimensions to your science lessons and provide considerable variety for students. A carefully selected strategy is crucial to aneffective science lesson. A teacher may have mastery over the content but may not know how to teach. In that case the teacher cannot be considered an effective teacher. Thus, a teacherrequires both the bases: the content base and the pedagogy base. A meaningfulintegration of both these bases is referred to as pedagogical content knowledge.It provides you ways to engage your students in learning. Selecting teaching learning activities/learning experiences Selecting teaching-learning activities for science relates directly to the objectives and the identified scientific concepts involved. It also provides the basis forassessment. You may find numerous activities that could suit to the desiredobjectives and the content. To decide the most appropriate activities you need toconsider the timeframe, health and safety issues, resources, and the suitability ofthe activity to students' abilities, needs and interests. Also it is necessary to arrangethe activities logically and sequentially. ACTIVITY -5 Let us assume that you have thought of 5 activities for a particular lesson. Decide the topic and the class. But because of time constraint you can selectonly 3 activities. Answer the following question in this context. 1. Which three activities would you select and why? Activity 1: ...................................................................................... Activity 2: ...................................................................................... Activity 3: ...................................................................................... Selecting Appropriate Resources You have selected now an activity that requires suitable and manageable resources - human or environmental. Human resources are experts you require to perform theselected activity. Environments are invaluable resources, as they present uniquesituations for students to learn about science. A classroom environment can be createdto construct a \"real world\" experience. For example, you can set up an aquarium inthe class room which will help your students to study the aqua life. Or you can bring innatural objects such as different types of rocks to give hands-on experiences to them.School ground, gardens, local community or more distant locations are environments 16Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)beyond the classroom. Students can explore and learn through this investigation as they provide first-hand experiences. For example through the study of flora and faunain their surroundings they can learn many scientific concepts such as variation, change,diversity etc. Books, journals and magazines, computer programs and the Internetalso can be used to aid learning. It is good to have access to as many resources aspossible and use them judicially as per the requirement of the activity and the strategy.We will learn more about resources in the next section 5.5. 5.4.5 Design/Format for the Lesson After selecting an appropriate strategy, activity and resources with consideration of your students' health and safety, you can start designing the structure and form of yourlesson. There are many formats for a lesson plan but they contain the following commonelements 1. Title of the lesson2. Duration3. List of required resources4. List of learning objectives5. The set induction to focus students on the learning and to motivate.6. The direct instruction that describes the sequence of events that make up the lesson, including the teacher's instructional input and guided practice the studentsuse to try new skills or work with new ideas 7. Independent practice that allows students to extend skills or knowledge on their own 8. A closure that concludes the discussion and answers questions 9. An assessment/evaluation tool to check the achievement of the intended objectives. 10. A continuity component which reviews and reflects on content from the previous lesson. Reflection: This is the most important part that comes after the deployment of the lesson. The teacher reflects on the lesson itself; what worked, what needs improvementetc. The format for the lesson plan is provided at the end of this unit as Appendix 3 and 4 as example for you to go through and prepare for your class and subject. 17 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes ACTIVITY-6 Suppose you want to prepare a lesson plan of 30 minutes duration for your students. Prepare a lesson plan based on the above format.Check your plan on the basis of the following questions At the end of lesson what will be the learning outcomes? What content needs to be covered to fulfill these intentions? Which teaching methods are best suited to achieve these intentions? Which class management strategies will match the students' learning needs? What resources and audio/visual aids need to be prepared in advance/beavailable? How will variety of activity be used to sustain student's interest? How will learning outcomes be recorded for evaluation? ............................................................................................................... .............................................................................................................................................................................................................................. After completing the activity, grade yourself on the following rubric: Self-Evaluation Rubric for Activity: A Lesson plan includes all of the important elements. They are well aligned and appropriate to the target audience. B Lesson plan includes almost all of the important elements. They are aligned and appropriate to the target audience. C Lesson plan includes some important elements. They show little connection and are not appropriate to the targetaudience. D Incomplete activity. Careful lesson planning can help you to facilitate students' learning. Incorporating best practices in teaching-learning process will realize the learning outcomes you decided.In Albert Einstein's words \"It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy increative expression and knowledge.\" 18Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed) ACTIVITY -7 Given below is a description of two lessons in brief. Read them carefully. In your opinion which lesson will be more effective for students' learning?Give 5 reasons to support your answer. Lesson 1 Lesson 2 1. Focus on teaching 1. Focus on learning 2.

Assessment using student portfolios, performance checklists, science curriculum needs to be improved and teachers should develop good science lesson plans. You must have realized that every timeyou investigate science with your students, you also learn more in the process.So continue the process of think- select- adopt- think. 5.5 IDENTIFYING AND USING V ARIOUS RESOURCES As an elementary science teacher you can be very effective when you involve yourstudents - the young children - in the teaching learning process. They will learn betterand remember the experiences you have created for them using the resources. As thechild progresses from one class to the higher class the impact you have created andthe impressions you have made will remain with him forever. Each teacher is different.That means no two classrooms will be the same. Your choice of resources should be 19 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesdone very carefully to bring about the desired learning outcomes. We have already learned previously in section 5.4 about selecting resources for lessons. Here we willlearn in detail about different types of resources and their use. 5.5.1 Meaning of Resources Learning resources are defined as information represented, accessible, or stored in avariety of media and formats. They can be print and non-print materials, or nonelectronic and electronic materials that meet the learning outcomes, course contentand specific needs. They are available in school as well as locally and globally. 5.5.2 Importance of Resources A famous quote says \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\" You must have heard theChinese proverb \"I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand\"Your experience with your students or your own learning also will substantiate that if ateacher uses visuals, retention increases by 50 percent. If you reflect on your ownteaching in the past, you will realize that whenever you have used activities and involvedstudents more, learning is more or less permanent. You are already aware that we learn through our 5 senses: vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. We learn 1 percent through taste, 1.5 percent through touch, 3.5 percent through smell, 11 percent through hearing and 83 percent through sight. Also we retain: 10 percent of what we read , 20 percent of what we hear , 30 percent of what we see and 50 percent of what we see and hear together We tend to learn more as we: Go from concrete to abstract. Add more sensory information. Make the learning experience more like \"Doing the Real Thing\". Become more involved. Higher levels of retention can be achieved through active involvement in learning. Figure 5.5 shows the involvement of the learner from Passive to Active. Figure 5.5 20Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)5.5.3 Types of Educational Resources There are a wide variety of educational resources available for anyone who wishes to learn more about a particular subject. Teachers use educational resources for theirprofessional development and for classroom instruction. Students use them for self-study and often need them to complete their homework, assignments and projects.They can be available in the school, or locally and globally (made available through theinternet). 5.5.3.1 Resources at School Level Library The school library can be made the hub of all the activities planned and executed in school. It houses both, print and non-print materials(electronic) such as different kindsof books ( General books, Textbooks, Reference books), visuals (pictures, photographs, charts, graphs, maps, atlas, globes etc.), audio ( CDs, cassettes, records and tapes), audio visuals (video CDs, films, tapes, slides, transparencies etc.) and games and toys used for interactivity . All these are classified and organized in such a way to make immediately available to the library user. Computers and internet facilityis also made accessible in the library where ever possible. Laboratory The school science laboratory is always been used to promote a wide range of educational outcomes. Students learn how to conduct the practical work by manipulatingthe equipments and materials. While conducting these experiments, students work incollaboration interacting with each other, communicating ideas. The inquiry basedapproach enhances conceptual understanding. The scientific investigation processhighlights the importance of observations, evidence, arguments, findings, justificationsetc. all resulting in inculcation of the core component; \"the scientific temper\". Garden School Gardens can be an excellent resource as a living laboratory to observe, discover, experiment, and learn. Gardening can engage students and help them gain subjectspecific knowledge. They get involved in the learning process. Garden related activitiesintegrate subjects such as science, maths, social studies, and the environment, andpersonal skills areas such as leadership, problem-solving, and team building. You caninitiate Classroom Projects on garden-related activities along with ideas for hands-onlessons. The objectives are to encourage students to develop more diverse ways ofdescribing everyday objects, processes, and events. They often get involved deeplywith plants and nature, which renews and sustains the essential connection betweenthe person, and the environment. Playground Many of the science concepts such as gravity, friction, force, momentum etc. can be learned by students playing on slides, swings, spinners, and a number of other standard 21 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesand custom playground equipments. Students can explore the scientific principles of motion, balance, sound, sight, levers and simple machines, as well as about sun, windand water. Motivating them to mthelook at the science underlying the enjoyable hands-on activities, their playing can be turned into a joyful experiential learning by an innovativeteacher like you. You can also encourage them to ask questions, to observe record,predict, and deduce; performing all scientific activities. 5.5.3.2 Resources at Local Level All the above resources may be available at the local level in the neighbourhood, in the locality, or at nearby places but on a large scale. Apart from these, planetariums,herbariums, vivariums such as aquariums, science parks, science museums, zoos,botanical gardens may be available in the locality. You can arrange excursions andfield trips for your students to enhance their learning. A Planetarium It is a theatre built primarily for presenting educational and entertaining shows aboutastronomy and the night sky. It shows simulated movements of stars, planets and othercelestial objects on a large dome-shaped projection screen. The accurate relativemotion of the sky can be presented using many technologies. The program can displaythe sky from anywhere and at any time; past, present or future. They can be as huge asaccommodating 400 people which are normally a permanent part of science parks orthey can be small and portable to be used for small groups. A Herbarium It is a place where a collection of preserved plant specimens is stored. These specimens may be whole plants or parts of plants. They are usually dry parts mounted on a sheetor preserved in alcohol or some other preservative. They may preserve an historicalrecord of change in vegetation over a period of time. Some plants become extinct inone area, or may become extinct altogether. Then, in that case, the specimens representthe only record of the plant's original distribution. Environmentalists use such data totrack changes in climate and human impact. Specimens housed in herbarium identifythe flora of that area. It helps to better understand the variations of forms in the plantsand the natural distribution over which the plants grow. A Vivarium It is an enclosed area for keeping and raising animals or plants for observation or research. A portion of the ecosystem for a particular species is simulated on a smallerscale, controlling the environmental conditions. A vivarium can be small to be kept ona table or large outdoor structure. There are many forms of vivarium depending on thetype of habitat. - Aquarium simulates a water habitat- Insectarium contains insects and arachnids. 22Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)- Paludarium simulates a rain forest or swamp. - Terrarium simulates a dry or a jungle-like habitat.Let us learn about an aquarium in detail and the teaching learning opportunities it can provide. The other vivaria will function in a similar manner. An Aquarium It consists of at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept. You can keep various kinds of aquatic animals and plants depending on thesize. If it is in the school or if students can keep one at home it excites the students, andthey become enthusiastic. For them the learning taking place through this activity isfun. They share their learning with family and friends which develops relationships andbonding. An aquarium is a great way for students of all ages to learn about a variety oftopics and gain valuable life lessons. It can be used to teach students specific sciencetopics such as different water species, fish anatomy, food chain, water/nitrogen cycleetc. Students collect data from an aquarium by measuring and recording watertemperature, pH, ammonia, and nitrate levels. Any event, even the loss of a fish, is anopportunity to discuss possible causes and their effects, preventions, and ways toimprove existing conditions. A creative teacher like you can select a number of waysto use aquarium as an excellent hands-on teaching tool. Students get the opportunityto learn directly through experience. Caring for the aquarium kindles a sense ofresponsibility, achievement, and a genuine desire to learn. The opportunities are endless. A science center/science museum It offers interactive exhibits covering a wide range of topics related to science. This interactivity encourages visitors to experiment and explore. They also offer a widerange of enrichment programs for students complementing the school's scienceeducation. Visiting a science centre can become an inspiring and exciting experiencefor students. Science Parks are places for scientific research. Usually, they are associated with higher education institutions such as colleges and universities. Theydiffer from science centres as they are interested with future developments in scienceand technology. They are encouraged by local government, in order to attract newcompanies to towns. Many resources and facilities are available at one place andsharing them reduces the overhead cost A botanical garden It is an area with special collections of a wide range of plants such as cacti, succulent plants, tropical plants, exotic plants, herb gardens, etc. with their botanical names.Their role is to maintain the collection of living plants with proper documentation forthe purposes of scientific research, conservation, display and education. The visit tosuch place offer unlimited opportunities learning plant diversity. It is an excellent mediumfor communication between the world of botany and students. Nowadays, they alsoprovide visitors, information related to the environmental issues particularly plant 23 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesconservation and sustainability. They are very useful in creating an awareness of the threat to ecosystems from human overpopulation and the need for these biological andphysical resources to humans. Zoos They are maintained to study the animals, like botanical gardens are maintained to study plant kingdom. The natural-like habitat for animals provided in zoos helps tostudy them in their natural environment. Zoos aim to provide leadership in animal care,science education, and sustainability. They are used to find science-based solutions toconservation problems. Science is essential to understand and reduce the negativeeffects of environmental change on the survival of species and their habitats. Zoosinspire students to study, understand and care for the world's biological diversity. 5.5.4 Classification of Resources All these resources can be classified broadly as electronic (requiring electricity) andnon-electronic (not requiring electricity). 5.5.4.1 Non-electronic Resources They can be categorized broadly in two parts: verbal and visual. Their furtherclassification with use is given below. Verbal (print material) stores and communicates information emphatically in verbal form. Books: Books are the most common educational resource and most important. We cannot think of learning, today, without books. They can be used by people of allages; you as well as your students. Even when books are read to children, their speaking,writing, and listening abilities are improved. Encouraging reading may foster love forbooks at an early age. This can help people in lifelong learning. We can get booksalmost on any subject and for any level. The local library is a great place to find booksthat can be used as educational resources. There are a variety of books with differentpurposes. They are described below. A textbook is designed for classroom use and is written by experts in the field. It is equipped with the usual teaching devices. It is basically used by students for self learningbut also is used as a reference point for the syllabus while the workbook is used for drill and practice. A reference book is designed to be consulted for a specific piece of information rather than to be read through form cover to cover. They contain largenumber of facts organized for supplementing the content so they are required whenextra information is needed to carry out such as project work. A picture book focuses on illustrations that carry the essence of the book's meaning. This type of book is moreuseful for the teachers to build a story, to develop verbal conversations, vocabulary,reading comprehension, etc. It can also develop visual thinking ability. 24Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)Periodicals: They are published at a fixed period of time (daily, every 15 days, or every month, or every 3/6 months, or every year) such as newspapers, magazines , and journals . They contain a variety of edited articles authored by different people. They are very useful to get extra up-to-date information required assignments projectetc. The articles there in can also be used for posing question or initiating brainstorm. Visual material Boards are used to scribble, to write messages, to list items, to draw diagrams so on and so forth. The black board/ chalk board have now become an inseparable part of classroom fixtures. Its best advantage is the re-use. The step by step process/diagrams can be developed in front of your students. The flannel board is a large board, covered with flannel fabric; on which felt or lightweight paper cut-outs canstick. You can use photographs also to stick by gluing a small piece of Velcro at theback. The magnetic boards are actually iron boards on which magnets are attached to hold photographs, objects etc. They are used to display previously prepared materials.They can be used to demonstrate a variety of science concepts to young children, likethe life cycle of a butterfly, water cycle, classification, diet and nutrition. Students canmanipulate the pieces, providing hands-on learning. These boards are most effectivein elementary education. They help in gaining attention and arousing curiosity. Charts and posters are displays on large sheets of papers meant to be clearly viewed by all the students in a large class room. They contain text with illustrations, figures, orpictures that can enhance learning. The content can be presented graphically in theform of Flow charts, Tree charts or Pie charts. A poster communicates the message in a symbolic form through pictures, figures etc. and using minimum words. Both can beused to show relationships/comparisons, development, process, classification andorganization. A flip chart is a sequence of charts bound together by a ring, hook or a bracket.. The charts are flipped one after the other to present information in a logicalcontinuation layer by layer. Graphs are visual representation of numerical data. This representation can take the form of a line graph, a bar graph, a circle or pie graph or a pictorial graph as the namesuggests. Maps, atlas, and globes: A map is a type of picture of an area as it may be seen from above. It will have symbols and other information to help make it easier tounderstand. A map can show the street that you live on or it can show the world. It isa drawn to scale diagram showing flat but accurate representation of a part or all of theearth or the universe. It presents the details of boundaries of earth's surface, continents,countries etc. An atlas is a document, which contains several maps, and a globe is a model (spherical representation) of the earth. It gives the most accurate and relativepicture of the shapes and sizes of land and water areas on the earth. Compare to 25 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesglobes, Flat maps are cheaper and easier to use. They are designed to show smaller areas in greater detail. Maps help people in finding locations and directions. To usemaps effectively, you must teach students how to read them. Pictures and photographs: Pictures include illustrations, drawings, paintings, prints, reproduction, technical drawings etc. They are a key resource. They provideinformation which does not require translation and hence avoid long explanations.They set the scene or context. Photographs are pictures taken by a camera. Theyrepresent the world as it is. They bring history to life. They are engaging tools of anyeducational experience. Good photographs can help the students to understand theconcepts faster and in a better manner. Aerial photographs provide a useful supplementto topographic maps. Specimens and models: Specimens are real objects which are preserved such as seals, coins stones, flora and fauna etc. Models are the enlarged or diminished replica of real objects which are used to explain the features of real situations. Working models are used to explain the processes involved. 5.5.4.2 Electronic Resources These resources require electricity for their functioning. They can be classified as audio, visuals, audio-visuals, animations or videos (Movies). Audio resources Radio, cassettes and audio CDs can be used to enrich and reinforce learning science. Students get benefit of listening to experts' talk on radio. They can be recorded andplayed again using cassettes and CDs. These resources can also be used to learnmany science topics particularly related to \"Sound\" Visual resources (projected) A slide projector is a specialized projector which is designed to be used with slides. Slides are small transparencies mounted in sturdy frames. Slide projectors display images onto a screen or wall. It is used to project enlarged images onto the screen orwall for audience to view. It can be adjusted to project at a variety of distances, withthe use of focusing tools resulting in high image quality. The use of slide projectors is indecline, as preparing slides is a skilled job and other projection methods have becomemore popular. An overhead projector is a very basic but reliable form of projector. Teaching materials can be written or printed on plastic sheets (Transparencies) beforehand by anyone.The transparencies can be reused whenever required. This saves time and energy. It enables you to face the class and facilitates better communication. It facilitates an easylow-cost interactive at the same time very effective environment. The overheadprojector is a common feature now-a-days in most of the developing countries for 26Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)higher education but still a long way for school education. Recently, it has seen a decline in use, as more sophisticated computer based projectors are favored. Video projectors display videos, images or computer data on a screen or other flat surface. They eliminate the need to create hard copy transparencies. Software likeMicrosoft Power Point helps us to make animated, interactive presentations withmovement and video. These features are not supported by overhead projector. Audio-visual resources Films and videos on a wide variety of subjects are available. They provide a visual and auditory experience to students to enhance learning. There are a number of Internetsites such as \"You Tube\" (http://www.youtube.com/) that offer educational videoswhich you can easily download for use both in and out of the classroom. Television is a telecommunication medium for transmitting and receiving moving images. Many television channels offer specialized programmes in a wide range of subjects.Various lessons and demonstrations using models, specimens etc. can be viewed bythe students and the teachers. Many important talks, scenes and sights can be seenthrough it. Channels such as Discovery, National Geographic are very helpful inunderstanding science for both teachers and students. ICT tools Computer s have complemented and supplemented the earlier educational resources. They can be used to present content, provide drill and practice, and offer tutorials,present simulations, encourage self-paced learning. The Internet is an excellent source for a wide variety of educational resources for schools, teachers and students, which is particularly useful for explaining key scienceconcepts and interactivity with science at appropriate levels. All the above types ofresources in e-form, and many more, are available within reach at the flick of the click.Through the Internet, you can gain instant access to millions of different educationalwebsites from all over the world. A simple online search can lead us to such usefulresources in abundance providing a multitude of learning options. The Search Engineslike google, yahoo, bing, Wikipedia. altavista are very much in use by the students andteachers. It is ideal to have access to as many resources as possible. However, the type of the school and its location may impose limitations for accessing resources, such ascomputers and broadband Internet connections. However, with the advent of ICT,the teacher's role is changing from 'knowledge provider' to 'facilitator of learning'.This requires the ability to guide students in making the best educational and informationaluse of technology. Under your guidance the students should communicate globally andbecome lifelong learners, with an intelligent use of the vast information resources availableto them. 27 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes ACTIVITY -8 Select any one topic for a particular class and identify the resources to teach it. How best you can use these resources to make your teaching more effectiveand interesting? Write down in the space given below. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Open Educational Resources (OER) OER are digital materials that can be re-used for teaching, learning, research and more, and are open to anyone for use. They include courses, course materials, contentmodules, learning objects, collections, and journals all in digital form. They also includedifferent tools: software that support the creation, delivery, use and improvement ofopen learning content, searching and organization of content, content and learningmanagement systems, content development tools, and on-line learning communities.They also include materials on best practices such as stories, publication, techniques,methods, processes, incentives, and distribution. Two such OERs are given below:\"Your Sky\" is an interactive planetarium of the Web. You can produce maps for any time and date, viewpoint, and observing location at http://www.fourmilab.ch/yoursky/ \"Stellarium\" is also a free open source planetarium for your computer. It shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope.It can be used to investigate astronomy through scientific exploration at www .stellarium.or g. ACTIVITY -9 Search for at least 5 more OERs and describe in brief their use. ..................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... Figure 5.6 shows the classification of the material in various forms 28Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed) Figure 5.6 Classification of resources 5.5.5 Advantages of Resources The judicious use of resources by the teacher helps in: involving students actively giving concrete examples and illustrations retaining learning for longer period providing variety doing things that cannot be done otherwise showing things that cannot be seen otherwise. Abstract methods of teaching require more skills of the learners to interpret the message. The different media and material will hold students' attention for longer period andmore retention and transfer of learning is possible. They engage students' other sensesin the learning process sending the information to the brain through as many channelsas possible, resulting in multi-sensory instruction. 'Multi-Sensory learning' means useof all the five senses at the same time incorporating simultaneously i.e. 'V AKT' (Visual-Auditory-Kinesthetic-Tactile) activities. Thus, the resources are useful to reinforcewhat you are saying, ensuring that your point is well understood. 29 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes5.5.6 Criteria for Selection of Resources Usefulness and appropriateness are two important criteria for selecting relevant material. It should help both you in teaching and your students in learning. It shouldhelp in attaining the lesson objectives and should have a high possibility for permanentlearning. If you select material only because of the availability, it may not serve the purpose. Students will grasp and retain facts and concepts that are enriched with interestingsupport material and arranged in a way that enhances learning. Some additional criteriaare listed below: Clarity: The learners should easily comprehend what is conveyed and further explanation should not be required. Simplicity: The language used should be simple and easy to understand. Lengthy sentences and flowery language should be avoided. Relevancy: The resource should be suitable for the purpose for which it is selected. Specificity: While providing the resources unnecessary as well as too much material should not be given. Visibility: should be neat and readable to all; whether individual or group. Practicality: The resource should be affordable and within the reach of the user. ACTIVITY -10 Fill in the following table Resource Use Advantage 1 23456 5.6 RECORDING AND REPORTING It is necessary that the students and the parents should be informed about the progress of the students. Parents should be aware of what is expected from their child and should have data as proof of it. Some parents want to know the position of their child in relation to all the 30Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)students in the class. Information about their child's attitude towards learning and their achievement is valuable to the parents. Your students also will be motivated to learnfurther when they know about their progress. The school authorities are also interestedin results. Thus a teacher has to assess and evaluate students' learning. This also helpsthe teacher to get a feedback about her planning and transacting curriculum. 5.6.1 Evaluation of Students Learning The assessment of children's learning is an essential and continuous part of the teaching and learning process in science, as in the other areas of learning. The continuous andcomprehensive evaluation process requires proper planning and execution of activitiesfor achievement of the desired learning outcomes. An important aspect of the schoolplanning for science is to help you understand each child's progress in science. Theassessment techniques in science must focus on cognitive objectives, understanding ofscientific concepts, competence in the application of experimental and investigativeskills and the nurturance of scientific attitudes. Hence the plan itself should provideappropriate methods and strategies for assessment based on the objectives decided.Formulate and summative evaluation need be done as per the requirement. Objectivebased evaluation need be conducted by adopting paper-pencil tests through essaytype, restricted answer/short answer type and objective type test items. 5.6.2 Evaluation of Planned Curriculum Assessment of the students' learning should facilitate you teachers in evaluating thesuitability of the science program you have planned. The following assessment methodscan be used to obtain a balanced picture of the child's progress in science: teacher observations concept-mapping performance on teacher-designed tasks Products and Processes observed by teacher and presented in portfolios. This assessment needs to be documented and proper records require to be maintained. Your records of all the above is of great significance. The parents should be informedabout the way students' progress is monitored and the results of the assessment. Theresults should be reported to all the stakeholders. 5.6.3 Role of Teacher You should Mark and record the results of all the assessments and evaluation to accuratelyassess students' progress Report the results of formal assessments as required. 31 Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes Share the results of assessment and progress grades with student Develop and implement an appropriate system for recording, analyzing and reporting student assessment and progress data. The tools and techniques of recording the assessment and evaluation you will be learning in the next unit i.e. Unit 6: 'Assessment and Evaluation' . 5.7 LET US SUM UP We have learned in this unit how to plan and manage science education at upper primary level. We know now the importance of planning, purpose, how to manage thecurriculum throughout the year, how to design and develop year plans, unit plans andlesson plans. We have also learned that science learning can be designed in many forms. The selection of the type of activities is based upon the learners' needs; the age and stage of thegroup, intended learning outcomes, health and safety requirements, resources, andlesson appropriateness. We have learned different types of resources in electronic and non-electronic form and their use for providing hands-on experiences and hence, facilitating learning. We have also seen about what are the available resources in the school and in the community, so that they can be utilized in science teaching. Whatever we have learned in earlierunits about scientific inquiry and hands-on experiences we can use in planning forscience lessons. We have got acquainted about the role of teacher in recording the progress of the students and reporting it to students, parents and school authorities. We now have a holistic picture of planning, organizing and managing science curriculum. The details about it such as different domains, the classification of learning outcomes/objectives, various strategies and activities for teaching and learning, assessment andevaluation techniques, and procedures we will be learning in the next unit . 5.8 MODEL ANSWERS TO CHECK YOUR PROGRESS Key to Activity-2 1d 2 f 3h 4b 5g 6 c 7i 8e9a 32Notes Planning & Managing Science at Upper Primary Level Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)5.9 SUGGESTED READINGS AND REFERENCES Dale E.

And what are different approaches to teaching of science?You have also learnt about various types of learning experiences we need to provide 38Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)for facilitating learning and how to plan for these experiences. Though all this is very important and essential, as teachers it is equally important to know the effectivenessand the appropriateness of the teaching-learning process carried out in the classroom.Hence, in the present unit, we shall learn about an important and inevitable aspect ofthe teaching-learning process i.e. assessment and evaluation. You may have a look atFigure 6.1 and see the relationship among various concepts included in this unit. 6.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES After goings through this unit, you should be able to: differentiate between the concepts of measurement, assessment and evaluation. distinguish between objectives and specifications and describe their relationshipto the subject matter (content), learning experiences and evaluation. explain taxonomy of educational objectives and write objectives and specificationsappropriate to your subject area and the topic you are to teach. compare formative and summative evaluation. justify the importance of internal assessment. explain the significance of Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation and its use inteaching-learning. establish the need for diagnostic and remedial teaching. plan for cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains evaluation. Any activity that we undertake needs to be evaluated to find its utility, effectiveness, quality and for its future improvement. In case of a manufacturing unit, the finishedproduct is passed through a process of quality control, to check the quality of thefinished goods. In case of any defects or drawbacks, the particular piece is rejected.The process is rechecked or assessed for improvement, so that there are no rejections.In case of education what do we do for the quality control? The process of educationhas to be effective and the end product has to be good. This is because, we deal withhuman beings, that is, students and hence, no rejection is possible. In this situation,proper assessment and evaluation is of utmost importance to ascertain the effectivenessof the teaching-learning process. The evaluation of the students for their learningoutcomes can be used to find out the effectiveness of the teaching-learning process. 6.2 SOME COMMONLY USED TERMS We often use the terms, 'assessment' and 'evaluation' interchangeably or synonymously. Are they synonymous? Do they mean the same thing? Let us try to understand the 39 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesconcept of evaluation and see how it is different from assessment. We will now examine some common words, which are used along with evaluation in the field of education. Test: Test is one of the tools of evaluation. It may consist of a set of questions, which are answered by the learners. Teacher corrects these answers and assigns a numericalvalue for the correct answers. This numerical value is called as marks. Measurement: This quantifies the performance of a student in a test, as it assigns the numerical value (marks) to express the performance of the student. It measures theachievement based on a specific test offering numerical value. We measure quantity of milk, weight of the person or rainfall in a day. Such 'physical' attributes like volume, weight etc. can be measured accurately using some instrumentslike measuring cylinder, weighing balance, etc. But in case of attributes like academicscholarship we do not get such accurately measuring instruments. We depend on theteacher-made test for this. Assessment: This term is mainly used when the performance is expressed in qualitative terms. Here the quality of the performance is described. All these terms are essential to understand the concept of evaluation but are not synonymous with evaluation. 6.2.1 Definitions of the Terms Measurement : It is a process of quantification of measurable phenomenon. \"In its broadest sense, measurement is the assignment of numerals to objects, or events, according to rules\" - Stevens (1951) \"Measurement is the assignment of numerals to entities according to rules\" - Stufflebeam (1968). \"Measurement entails certain rules and procedures for assigning numbers to attributes in such a way that the numbers to attributes in such a way that the numbers representthe quantity of the attribute\" - A Dictionary of Education (1981). Assessment \"Assessment is a process of describing certain traits, processes, programmes in qualitative terms. It has to be done in the context of the objectives of the system ofeducation\" Measurement gives the quantitative description, whereas Assessment gives the qualitative description of student's progress. Evaluation is more comprehensive term,which includes both, measurement as well as assessment and goes beyond. Evaluation \"It is an act or a process that allows one to make a judgement about the desirability or value of a measure\". 40Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)Stufflebeam and others (1968) define it as, \"Evaluation is a process of delineating, obtaining and providing useful information for judging decision alternatives\". Patel (1984) defines it as, \"Evaluation is any systematic, continuous process of determining The extent to which specified educational objectives, previously identified anddefined are attained, The effectiveness of the learning experiences provided in the classroom, How well the goals of education have been accomplished. By now you must have realized that the test is a tool which helps in measurement for evaluating various abilities of the students ACTIVITY -1 1. Discuss the difference between test, measurement and assessment with the help of suitable examples in about 100 words. .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 2. Explain the concept of 'educational evaluation' with formal school teaching-learning. .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 6.3 CONCEPT OF EVALUATION The concept of evaluation can be expressed as follows: Quantitative measure Qualitative description V alue Evaluation = of + of + Judgement student's achievement student's achievement by teacher To understand this better, have a look at the following example: 41 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesRaju is studying in standard VII. In the first terminal examination he got 89 percent marks in the written examination. From the observation done by the teacher, shewrites that Raju is always punctual and very neat in his work. He is a voraciousreader and always shows keen interest in curricular activities as well as in elocution,essay writing and in debates. She also observes that ... Raju does not mix aroundwith other students. He prefers to work alone on the project rather than working ina group. On field visit or on excursion he prefers to be on his own to explore thesurroundings. Based on this, teacher gives the value judgement that though Raju isvery good in curricular activities; his social and emotional development needs to beimproved. From this example you will realize how evaluation is all compassing term and how it goes much beyond measurement and assessment. For instance, in the example givenabove, 89 percent of marks are the quantitative measure/ description about Raju.'Raju is neat and punctual in his work, is the qualitative description. 'Raju is very goodin curricular activities but his social and emotional development needs to be improved'is the value judgement given by the teacher. Now, let us read the definition of evaluation given by Dr. Patel (1984) once again (as given below) and try to understand the new terms we have come across. Previously identified and defined specified educational objectives. Learning experiences. Goals of education. Systematic continuous process. For undertaking any activity it is essential to know why that activity is being undertaken. What can be achieved through it? In other words, it is essential to know the objectivefor undertaking the activity. In the process of education, the aims of education areclear from the 'why' aspect of education. These are broad and long term. 'Objectives'are the smaller steps, achievable through the teaching-learning process in the classroomand the achievement of objectives helps us in moving closer to the aim. Objectives arethe well-defined purposes of education which are achieved through various subjectstaught in the school. The subject matter is called as the content. For helping students learn the content, teacher adopts various methodologies as explained in Unit 3 and carries out certainlearning activities in the class Ex. teacher may give explanation of certain concept, shemay explain with the help of a diagram, or a model. She may demonstrate an experiment.Students, when interact with these, internalize them which result in learning experiences.You have learnt about the learning experiences in the previous chapter. You know thatthe learning experiences can be direct / first hand or indirect / second hand. Ex: A childtouching a hot vessel and getting a burn has the direct or firsthand experience. But for 42Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)his friend, hearing about it and seeing the pain on the face of the child who has got the burnt, it is an indirect or secondary experience. In the teaching - learning process,these learning experiences should result in the desirable modification in the behaviourcalled learning. Evaluation helps us in confirming the attainment of learning. At this stage the teacher needs to know the effectiveness and appropriateness of the learning experiences given. Hence, the teacher administers different techniques andmethods of evaluation. It is obvious that while choosing various methods and techniquesof evaluation, the teacher has to keep in mind the learning experiences given to thestudents, as the same need to be evaluated. It can be said that the objectives, thecontent, the learning experiences and the evaluation methods are all interrelated. Thereare mutually supporting each other. This can be diagrammatically represented inFigure 6.2. CONTENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES EV ALUATION (Well-defined PROCEDURES purpose of (written/oral tests, education) observation, etc.) LEARNING ACTIVITIES (Methods, experiments, discussions, questions, Demonstrations, etc) Figure 6.2 Four aspects of educational evaluation (Patel, 2001) Let us understand this diagrammatic representation with the help of an example. The science text-book for class VI prepared by NCERT contains a chapter on the 'getting to know plants'. This is the 'content'. What are we to achieve after teachingthis content? The answer to this question tells us the 'objectives'. For standard VI, the specific objectives could be,1. Pupil recalls the parts of a plant 2. Pupil recognises the parts of a plant 3. Pupil describes the functions of various parts of a plant 4. Pupil draws a diagram of parts of a plant 5. Pupil labels the parts of a plant 6. Pupil identifies the parts of a plant in the given specimen, etc. Now, for achieving these objectives what are the relevant learning experiences which need to be provided? 43 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesA teacher can: 1. Show the actual specimen of a plant.2. Draw a diagram on the chalk board and give explanation to it.3. Show a chart and give explanation to it, and also show it through animation.4. Take students out in a garden and ask them to observe various plants and identify the parts. 5. Ask students to sow a few seeds and ask them to observe and note down about the development of various parts of a plant on the germination. After providing the learning experiences, it is essential to know about the effectiveness of those learning experiences. This is done through the evaluation. The following canbe done for this: 1. Asking questions orally 2. Giving written test3. Asking students to draw and label the diagram4. Showing specimen and asking students to identify the parts5. Asking students to collect various specimens and stick them in the book and then label the parts. How do you think teacher should evaluate the students? We have to note here that teacher has shown diagram / specimen to the students. Hence she can ask students to identify those parts. But if teacher merely describesthem, without any visual experience, can the teacher ask students to identify the partsby showing specimen? Teacher cannot include that in the evaluation procedure as shehas not given that learning experience to the students. Let us see another example. The teacher wants to explain the 'Laws of Reflection' in the chapter 'Light'. Teacher can conduct following learning activities in the class - 1. Draw a diagram on the chalkboard or display a chart and explain.2. Demonstrate the experiment to prove the law and ask students to observe the demonstration. 3. Instruct students to carry out the experiment themselves and then to note down and verify the results. If you, as a teacher, adopt the first option during the teaching-learning process, how would you evaluate your students? You know that you can adopt the paper-pencil test 44Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)for checking the learning outcome but you cannot ask the students to carry out the experiment (practical test), as they have not undergone the learning experience ofhandling the apparatus. Hence, it is seen that there is a direct relationship between the objectives, the content, the learning experiences and the evaluation procedure. Therefore to begin with, teachermust have clear idea about objectives. 6.4 OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFICATIONS What are objectives in the context of teaching-learning? Objectives are the achievable targets of the educational process. They are subject- specific and achievable through the classroom teaching-learning processes. Hence,they help the teacher in day-to-day activities. Education is meant for the all-rounddevelopment of the personality. This means the balanced development of the HEAD(i.e. Cognitive Domain), the HEART (i.e. Affective Domain) and the HAND (i.e.Psychomotor Domain). Dr. Benjamin S. Bloom had given the objectives of cognitive domain, which were later revised by his student Anderson and colleague Karthwohl. The hierarchy of the affectivedomain was developed by Dr. Karthwohl and that of the psychomotor domain by Dr.Dave. The hierarchy of educational objectives cover all the aspects of human personality.They are as follows: 1. COGNITIVE 2. AFFECTIVE 3. PSYCHOMOTOR DOMAIN DOMAIN DOMAIN Remembering Receiving Imitation Understanding Responding Manipulation Applying Valuating Precision Analysing Organizing Articulation Evaluating Characterization Naturalization Creating Figure 6.3 Taxonomy of educational objectives 45 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesThe hierarchy means the difficulty level goes on increasing and when one moves to the higher objective, it means the lower objective is already achieved. Ex., in cognitivedomain, if student has understood the concept of effects of force on a body that meanshe knows what force is. The cognitive domain includes those objectives which deal with the recall or recognition of knowledge and the development of intellectual abilities Ex. Developing the understanding of the concept of acids and bases, their properties and selecting the appropriate chemical for cleaning the floor (making use of it in dailylife) is a cognitive activity. In the revised taxonomy of the cognitive domain, two dimensions are considered - the knowledge dimension and the cognitive process dimension Table 6.1 Anderson and Kartwohl's revised taxonomy of cognitive domain Cognitive Processes The KnowledgeDimensions Factual Conceptual Procedural Metacognitive The description of this table is given below: The Knowledge dimensions can be defined as follows:Factual Knowledge is knowledge that is basic to specific disciplines. This dimension refers to essential facts, terminology, details or elements students must know or befamiliar with in order to understand a discipline or solve a problem in it. Ex. Oxygen isrepresented by O 2. Conceptual Knowledge is knowledge of classifications, principles, generalizations, theories, models, or structures pertinent to a particular disciplinary area. Ex: Conceptof gravity. Procedural Knowledge refers to information or knowledge that helps students to do something specific to a discipline, subject, and area of study. It also refers to methodsof inquiry, very specific or finite skills, algorithms, techniques, and particularmethodologies. Ex: Dissecting the flower to study the internal parts of a flower. Metacognitive Knowledge is the awareness of one's own cognition and particular cognitive processes. It is strategic or reflective knowledge about how to go about 46Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)solving problems, cognitive tasks, to include contextual and conditional knowledge and knowledge of self. The cognitive process dimensions are the following:Remember - Retrieving the relevant knowledge from long-term memory. Understand - Construct meaning from instructional messages, including oral, written and graphic communication. Apply - Carry out or use a procedure in a given situation. Analyze - Break material into its constituent parts and determine how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose. Evaluate - Make judgements based on criteria or standards. Create - Put elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganize elements into a new pattern or structure. The revised model lays out the components nicely so they can be considered and used, and so cognitive processes as related to chosen instructional tasks can be easilydocumented and tracked. This feature has the potential to make teacher assessment,teacher self-assessment and student assessment easier or clearer as usage patternsemerge. The affective domain includes those objectives which are concerned with changes in interest, attitudes and values and the development of appreciations and adjustment.Karthwohl, et al. (1964). Ex. Developing scientific attitude, realizing the importance of taking care of the plants and animals in our surroundings, showing concern and helping the needy, taking effortsto keep the surroundings clean, is the part of the affective domain. The psychomotor domain includes those objectives which deal with manual and motor skills. It covers the aspects of the physical development. Ex: Handling the apparatus properly, measuring the volume of the given liquid accurately, drawing a neat diagram, planting and taking care of the plant, etc. come under thedevelopment of psychomotor domain. ACTIVITY -2 1. Write down the levels of objective in cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains with proper illustrations, considering a suitable example inaround 350 words. .............................................................................................................................................................................................................................. ............................................................................................................... 47 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes'Taxonomy of Educational Objectives' covers all the three aspects of personality. Ex: when student learns about pollution, (cognitive aspect), he becomes conscious of hisactivities and takes care that he does not do things to add to the pollution (affectiveaspect). He cleans his surroundings himself (psychomotor aspect). He may also motivatehis friends to keep the surroundings clean (affective aspect). This means, these are notexclusive of each other, they are interdependent and inseparable. The objectives ineach domain are arranged in hierarchical order. That means, when one moves to thenext level, the difficulty level increases. The teaching-learning process needs to be properly arranged so that a student finds it easier to go from lower level objective to the higher level objective. Ex: to applyNewton's first law in the real life situation, student needs to understand it first. But tounderstand it, student needs to first know the statement of the law properly. Thishierarchical importance is applicable to all the three domains. Giving proper weightageto the learning experiences provided from all three domains ensures the harmoniousdevelopment of the personality. These objectives when written in terms of specific content are called as specifications. The specifications indicate the student's achievement in terms of the specific contentby indicating the change in student's behaviour. When you write 'Pupil explains thestructure of a plant cell', the word 'explains' shows the action of a student or the overtbehaviour of the student and 'the structure of a plant cell' tells us the specific content.You will learn more about this in the following paragraphs. There are certain norms / criteria followed for writing the statements of specifications. The statement of that for the specification contains the action verb. We will now study,how to write the statements of the specifications. The statement of specification should 1. contain action verb 2. contain worthwhile specification (as per the age and physiological and psychological needs of the learner) 3. be related to the human ability (which can be developed or achieved with the help of education) 4. mention the subject-matter (i.e. content)5. be in the form of student's achievement and not in the form of teacher's intention6. be written in the form of achievement of one single pupil and not in the form of the achievement of a group of students 7. contain only one ability which is to be developed, achieved or modified.8. contain one and only one content. 48Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)Ex: 'Pupil recalls types of motion'. In this statement, 'recall' is the action verb and 'types of motion' is the content part. ACTIVITY -3 Statement of Specification Action Verb Content Objective Pupil recalls the statement of Newton's first law. Pupil describes the organelles of plant cell. Pupil explains the structure of atom.Pupil discriminates between longitudinal waves and transversewaves. Pupil gives examples of oscillatory motion. Pupil suggests ways to control spread of waterborne diseases. Pupil draws a diagram of structure of leaf. 6.4.1 Writing Objectives and Specifications for Science Find below the illustration of writing the specifications. First three, i.e. remembering,understanding and applying are from cognitive domain and skill is from psychomotordomain. The objectives pertaining to affective domain like developing scientific attitudeor aesthetic sense take long for the development. Let us look at the following illustrations:Remembering:Pupil recalls scientific terms, symbols, names of scientists, structures, patterns, formulae, etc. The pupil recognises the portraits of scientists, apparatus, parts of various organ systems, diagrams, etc. Understanding:The pupil develops understanding of various principles, concepts, processes, theories, etc. 49 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesThe pupil discriminates (compares, contrasts, distinguishes) between - The pupil explains (gives reason) - cause and effect relationship -The pupil gives examples (illustrates) - The pupil detects errors (identifies the mistakes) - The pupil rectifies the error (corrects the mistakes) -The pupil generalizes (infers, draws inference) the rule-The pupil classifies -The pupil selects proper apparatus, procedure, etc.The pupil solves problems based on the principles taught - Applying:The pupil applies the understanding in new situation The pupil analyses the problem / question -The pupil selects proper information or data-The pupil gives scientific reasons for various statements-The pupil predicts the probable reasons, effects, etc.The pupil suggests improvisation in apparatus, process, etc. Skill:The pupil develops skill in observation, recording, performance, drawing diagram, etc. A. Process of PerformanceThe pupil checks apparatus regarding its working The pupil cleans apparatusThe pupil sets up apparatusThe pupil draws diagramThe pupil records reading /observationsThe pupil measures weight, volume, etc. The pupil takes proper precaution while performing experiment. The pupil observes accurately. B. Product of PerformanceThe pupil summarizes the observations The pupil calculates the results (e.g. focal length of lens). 50Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)By now, you must have understood the concept and realized the importance of the objectives and specifications. Now, you will be able to plan your lesson effectively, forthe given content in such a way that, at the end of the lesson, the set objectives areachieved. This again will help you in planning the evaluation procedures for finding outthe achievement of your students. ACTIVITY -4 1. Select one unit from the Science textbook. Write down the objectives and specification for the same. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 2. Consider any unit of your choice. Decide the objectives you would like to achieve through that. Plan the activities (learning experiences) andthe evaluation procedures for the same. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 6.5 TYPES OF EVALUATION We have so far seen that evaluation has to be a continuous process for the proper evaluation of a student. This brings us to two types of evaluation. They are formative evaluation and summative evaluation 6.5.1 Formative Evaluation Nitko (1983) defines it as, \"Formative evaluation is concerned with judgements madeduring the design and / or development of a programme which is directed towardsmodifying, forming or otherwise improving the programme before it is completed\". This means that it is an on-going process of systematic evaluation of the learner's achievements. This is done during the instructional phase and helps teacher knowabout the learner's progress and helps the teacher reflect on the effectiveness of thelearning experiences provided. As it gives immediate feedback, it gives the scope ofimprovement for both the teacher as well as the students. 51 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesEx. while teaching the unit on Magnetism, teacher may ask questions based on the properties of magnet, types of magnet, laws of magnetism etc. during the teaching -learning process, to find out how much the students have understood. 6.5.2 Summative Evaluation Nitko (1983) defines it as, \"Summative evaluation describes judgements about themerits of an already completed programme, procedure or product\". E.g. semester examination or the final examination helps in summative evaluation. During summative examination, teacher can cover larger portions and also check for higherlevel objectives. Teacher can also check for the integration of the knowledge whichwas taught as separate subunits, during the teaching - learning process. For the summative evaluation teacher can ask question of higher difficulty level - application type questions to the students. Ex: on magnetism teacher can ask followingquestion: 'If you are given an iron rod, how will you decide, whether it is plain iron rodor magnetic rod?' In this question, student has to make use of the knowledge ofproperties of magnet, laws of magnetism. Formative evaluation is immediate hence considers limited content and short-range objectives. It gives immediate feedback and hence provides scope for the modificationof the methods of teaching and provisioning of learning experiences. Summative evaluation is long-range and comprehensive. It considers the course in its totality and also helps in evaluating higher level objectives. ACTIVITY -5 1. Distinguish between formative evaluation and summative evaluation. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................ .............................................................................................................. 2. List any three limitations of formative and summative evaluation. .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 6.6 INTERNAL ASSESSMENT You are aware that, education aims at all-round development of the personality. Mere acquisition of knowledge is not sufficient for the development of the balancedpersonality. Development of desired attitudes, interests, skills and various personaland social qualities are equally important. But assessment of these aspects is not possiblewith external examination, which mainly comprises of a paper-pencil test. Various 52Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)personality aspects can be evaluated by the one who is in constant contact with the student. Hence there is need for the evaluation of the student by the teacher who hastaught the student, as only she can judge the progress of the student. This evaluation iscomprehensive and continuous and is called as the internal assessment. Internal assessment helps in giving a complete picture of the learner. For this, the teacher has to consciously select tools (e.g. paper-pencil tests, rating scale, and checklist)and techniques (e.g. observation, sociometry) of evaluation. It helps in giving thefeedback to the students about their progress in all the three domains. Based on this,the teacher can reflect and introspect on the methodologies used and on the effectivenessof the learning experiences provided. The teacher can employ the diagnostic testingand remedial teaching at the right time. Internal assessment can be carried out by administering the teacher-made tests, and through the observations of the behaviours of the students in various situations andvarious activities in which they participate. In the process, the teacher can evaluate thestudents continuously on cognitive, affective and psychomotor aspects. As the teacher is continuously in touch with the students, she can monitor their progress individually with the help of internal assessment. Internal assessment also helps thestudents in developing good and consistent study habits. Because of the continuousevaluation, the student does not depend on the last minute studies. This reduces theundue examination tension and facilitates the overall development of the personality. For effective internal assessment the teacher needs to use variety of tools and techniques of evaluation. But for the Internal Assessment to be successful, teacher has to beimpartial and properly trained. ACTIVITY -6 1. List out the areas from cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains, which you will consider for conducting the internal assessment of yourclass. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 2. Prepare a plan of various activities along with the evaluation procedures for evaluating different domains of the personality. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 53 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesFrom all the discussion done so far, you must have realised that for the proper evaluation all three domains must be given equal importance and evaluation has to be continuousand the integral part of the teaching-learning process. But, in reality, the evaluation done in the schools is far from what really needs to be done. It is observed that mostly it stresses on the content and the lower level objectivesof the cognitive domain only. To improve the present system of evaluation, the systemof Comprehensive Continuous Evaluation has been introduced. 6.7 CONTINUOUS COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION (CCE) We will try to understand the rationale behind the introduction of CCE: The Kothari Commission Report (1966) states \"the internal assessment or evaluation conducted by schools is of great significance and should be given increasing importance.It should be comprehensive, evaluating all those aspects of students' growth that aremeasured by the external examination and also those personality traits, interest andattitudes which cannot be assessed by it\". (9.84). National Policy on Education (1986) also states that \"Continuous and Comprehensive evaluation should incorporate both scholastic and co-scholastic aspects of evaluationspread over the total span of instructional time (8.24(iii)). The National Curriculum Framework (2005) has proposed the examination reforms. Its position paper on Aims of Education - NCF -2005, NCERT says, School based CCE system should be established to...Reduce stress on children, Make evaluation comprehensive and regular Provide space for the teacher for creative teaching Provide a tool of diagnosis and remediation Produce learners with greater skills Right of children to Free and Compulsory Education Act(RTE -2009)Government of India adopted a new act - \"right to free and compulsory education for children between 6-14 years of age\". This law came into force for the entire country, except for Kashmir with effect from 1st April 2010. It states that students up to Std. VIII should not be made to appear for any board examination and from the year 2010-2011 a scheme of Continuous ComprehensiveEvaluation to be implemented from Standard. I to VIII 54Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)You have already learnt about this in your course 1 in 'Elementary Education in India: A Socio-Cultural Perspective'. Now let us study more about CCE.What is Continuous Comprehensive Education (CCE)?CCE refers to a system of school based evaluation of students that covers all aspects of student personality. It is a curricular initiative, attempting to shift emphasis frommere testing to Holistic Learning. Continuous indicates that the evaluation of identified aspects of students' growth and development is a continuous process and cannot be done in discrete patches. It has tobe in-built in the total teaching - learning process and must be done throughout theacademic year. Comprehensive means the scheme must attempt to cover both the scholastic (i.e. considering the objectives of cognitive domain) and the co-scholastic aspects (i.e. theobjectives of affective and psychomotor domain) of students' growth and development. What can be achieved with CCE? The core objective of CCE is to have continuity in evaluation and assessment of broad based learning and behavioural outcomes. This can help in achieving the following outcomes - To help develop skills (cognitive and psychomotor) To lay emphasis on thought process and de-emphasise memorization To make evaluation an integral part of teaching learning process To use evaluation for improvement of students' achievement To guide teaching-learning strategy on the basis of regular diagnosis followed by remedial instructions To make the process of teaching and learning a 'Learner Centred Activity'. How is CCE going to be beneficial to the students and the teachers? Elimination of chance factor and subjectivity. De-emphasis on memorization. Encouragement of comprehensive evaluation covering scholastic and co-scholastic aspects. Continuous evaluation throughout the total span of the instructional time. 55 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes Functional and meaningful declaration of results for effective use. Wider use of test results for improvement through diagnosis and remedial/ enrichment programme. Improvement in the mechanics of conducting examination. Introduction of desired changes in instructional material and methodology. Use of grade in place of marks in determining the level of pupils' performanceand proficiency. 6.7.1 Tools for CCE Since CCE is continuous and comprehensive, you need do to evaluate your studentsfor both the short term as well as long term objectives. Hence you need to carry outCCE at both the formative as well as the summative stages. 6.7.1.1 CCE for Formative Evaluation Day-to-day observation Oral work (question answers, loud reading, dialogues / conversation, role-play,interview, group discussion, etc.) Practical / experiments Activity (Individual, Group, Self-study) Projects Tests (Informal small duration written tests, open book tests, etc) Homework / class work (Informative, descriptive, essay, report, story and letter.Dialogue, expressing imagination, etc.) Others (questionnaire, self-evaluation, peer-evaluation, group work and othersimilar tools) 6.7.1.2 CCE for Summative Evaluation In written, oral and practical form At the end of first and second semester You must have realized that, CCE is a positive step for enhancing the all-round development of a student. But in the present circumstances, it foresees a lot ofchallenges. They are, Large class-strengths High pupil /teacher ratio 56Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed) Teachers' perceptions and competencies Diversity of learners Time constraints Monitoring and feedback Remediation and enrichment Teaching-learning resources Uniform applicability Preventing nepotism and victimization Switching from CCE to traditional evaluation in higher class To meet with these challenges the teacher needs positive attitude, open-mindedness, responsible behaviour and willingness to adapt to new changes. 6.8 DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND REMEDIAL TEACHING These two terms, 'remedial' and 'diagnostic' are borrowed from the medical field. When a patient goes to a doctor for the treatment, the doctor asks a few questions tofind out the symptoms and then suggests the treatment. He asks the patient to take thetreatment for 2-3 days and then report. If the patient reports to be feeling better, heeither asks to continue the treatment or to stop it, depending on the condition of thepatient. But if the patient does not show any improvement, he changes the treatment orasks for some tests to be done. Doctor knows that though two patients may exhibitsame symptoms the root cause of the problem may vary from person to person. Bydoing this, the doctor is able to pin-pointedly diagnose the problem and recommendthe appropriate treatment. Same is applicable with the teaching - learning process. In a classroom there are so many students, each one with different background, IQ, attitudes and likes and dislikes.The teacher has to cater to all of them. In this process, some students may not be ableto cope up. Sometimes, a student may remain absent due to ill health or due to someother reasons and hence may lag behind in the studies. Due to this, students may notbe able to keep pace. In that case, teacher needs to know the exact problem faced bythe particular student pin-pointedly. This is where teacher can start evaluating theparticular student on the specific content with basics and simpler concepts, slowlyincreasing the difficulty level. Once the blockage in learning is diagnosed, the teachercan use the appropriate remedial teaching. Ex: The teacher realizes that after teaching the unit on 'Chemical Equations', some students are not able to write them in the balanced form. 57 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesNow, the teacher has to find out why few students are unable to do it. First step would be to give the equations where all the radicals have the same valancy1. e.g. Na + + Cl- NaCl. 2. Next she can give the equations where the radicals have different valances, such as Mg++ and Cl- and ask students to write the balanced equation. 3. Slowly she has to increase the difficulty level of the types of equation, whereby she will come to know the exact nature of the problem. She may realize about thevariety of problems faced by the students. In one case the student mat not haveunderstood the concept of valance, in other case the student may not knowabout the valancies of different radicals. In one case, the student may not havethe clear concept of 'equation' / 'equality'. After diagnosing the exact difficulty ofthe student, she can give the appropriate remedial teaching to the student. The purpose of the diagnostic testing is to find out the problems or the difficulties faced by the student in learning particular content. Here the teacher starts from basics andslowly goes on increasing the difficulty level of the test. This helps her to pin pointedlyfind out the difficulty or the problem faced by the student in learning. After this she canaccurately chalk out the effective remedial programme so that student is able toovercome the difficulties in learning. The teacher can plan individual or group remediationprogramme by organizing appropriate learning experiences. ACTIVITY -7 1. Explain the importance of the diagnostic testing and remedial teaching in science teaching. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 2. Explain how diagnostic testing helps in designing suitable remedial teaching. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 3. Conduct a diagnostic test for any one student who is facing difficulty in learning particular content in your class. Analyse the test results andprepare a remedial teaching programme for him/ her. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 58Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)6.9 EVALUATION: COGNITIVE, AFFECTIVE AND PSYCHOMOTOR DOMAINS So far, you have seen that, three domains represent three aspects of personality and though they are not mutually exclusive, they are distinct. The cognitive aspect dealswith the development of head, the affective aspect deals with the development of heartand the psychomotor aspect deals with the development of hand and body parts.Hence naturally, the evaluation techniques for each domain are different. Cognitive domain : This mainly concentrates on the curricular activities and can be evaluated through the paper-pencil tests, oral questions, etc. Affective domain : As this domain deals with the emotions, attitudes, interest, it takes quite long for the development of the objectives of this domain. But evaluating thedevelopment of the students in this domain is a challenging task for the teacher. Theteacher can make use of projects, group discussions, debates for this purpose. Fieldvisits can be organized by the teacher and observing the students will help in theevaluation. The teacher can employ the technique of observation for the evaluation ofaffective domain. Psychomotor domain: This domain deals with the motor development. Evaluation of the students in this domain is an important aspect for the science teacher. The practical examination is an essential tool for the science teacher for evaluating psychomotor domain. ACTIVITY -8 1. Consider any unit of your choice. Prepare a comprehensive plan for evaluating all the three domains through that unit. ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 6.10 STRUCTURING ASSESSMENT OF CHILDREN'S IDEAS, SKILLS AND ATTITUDES For the teachers of the 21st century the knowledge explosion is a reality. The technological development has made knowledge available at the click of a mouse.Due to this, the first are the students who are very much updated from time to time.Hence, the teachers need to be updated and dynamic. The teacher needs not only theupdated knowledge but should also be conversant with the various methodologies of 59 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesteaching. The teacher needs to be creative in her approach. She should be able to improvise on the available resources to inculcate creativity as well as scientific temperamongst the students. The science teachers need to be good in the demonstration skill.They also need to be creative to make use of incidental education for making scienceeducation effective, and relate it to the real life situations of the students. Science is a very practical subject and is applicable everywhere in our daily lives. Naturally, the teacher needs to give the practical and concrete experiences to thestudents. It cannot be taught with explanation only. The teacher needs also todemonstrate the experiments. In case some instruments and equipment are not available,the teacher needs to improvise on the available material. The science teacher has to bevery creative and must make use of indigenous materials to prepare effective teachingaids. The teacher must also look for the happenings in surroundings, which can beeffectively used for explaining scientific principles. This is called as 'incidental learning',which is of great significance in the teaching of science. The science teacher must bevigilant and creative in planning and utilizing the available resources. As a teacher, you need to find out about children's ideas, process skills and their attitudes and link the knowledge to their daily experiences. This calls for properstructuring of evaluation. The teacher may observe the ability of raising probingquestions. Similarly, the teacher may create situations wherein the students demonstratetheir attitudes, such as, scientific attitude. Therefore, assessment in such cases needsto be a structured observation over a period of time. Many times students come upwith the questions of 'why, why not and how'. Even in problem-solving cases, students'ideas and process skills may show new alternatives. And, therefore, the evaluationshould include verbal questions, structured written tests and observations. This will help them to know about the blocks faced in the learning so that they will be able to overcome them. The teacher should help the students in preparing a simple checklist or a rating scale for this purpose, which will include aspect like punctuality, time schedule, regularity,etc. ACTIVITY- 9 1. Enlist the challenging questions/ ideas raised by your students on any topic. Reflect on handling the same by a teacher. .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 60Notes Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)2. Prepare a set of activities for enhancing students' scientific attitude and a scheme for evaluating the same. .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 6.11 LET US SUM UP So far we have seen why it is important for the science teacher to know about various aspects of personality which need to be developed. Proper evaluation of all threedomains, cognitive, affective and psychomotor, is essential and hence the teacher mustunderstand what evaluation is and what the means of carrying it out effectively are. Proper evaluation acts as a feedback to the teacher on the teaching -learning experiences she provides. It helps students and their parents in knowing the academicdevelopment. Evaluation is also important for the principal of the school in finding outabout the effectiveness and utility of the activities planned in the school. The curriculumplanners, researchers and the controlling authorities are also benefitted by the properevaluation. The information gathered can be used by them for understanding theeffectiveness of the curriculum and the problems faced in implementing the same. Thishelps the making necessary changes and improvements in the curriculum. You willlearn more about this in the next chapter on the Challenges and Issues in ScienceTeaching. 6.12 KEY POINTS 1. Test is a tool used for the measurement of the students' achievement and is not synonymous with evaluation. 2. Evaluation is a continuous comprehensive process which consists of the qualitative aspect, the quantitative aspect and the value judgement. 3. Education is meant for the all-round development of the personality, which includes all three, the cognitive, affective and the psychomotor aspects. 4. The objectives, the content, the learning experiences and the evaluation are interrelated with each other. 5. The internal assessment is the one which is carried out by the teacher who teaches. 6. Formative and summative evaluations are complementary to each other. 7. The CCE makes the process of teaching and learning a 'Learner Centred Activity'. 61 Assessment and Evaluation and Related Issues Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes8. For removing the blocks in learning, the diagnostic testing should be used, which is to be followed by the remedial teaching. 9. Teacher must do her self-assessment to know the effectiveness of the learning experiences provided and for the continuous improvement. 10. Teacher should encourage and guide students to do their self-evaluation for developing the analysing skills for better learning. 6.13 GLOSSARY /ABBREVIATIONS 1.

In the previous units you have learnt about the nature of science, the various skills required for learning science, various approaches to fulfillthe objectives of science learning, and how to plan and assess so as to help the studentsin their science learning. In this unit, we will see towards science learning with some broader perspective. Is science learning leading to the development of scientific temperament? Even if anystudent did not continue formal education in science, is he/she able to think scientifically? 64Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)Are the learners of science able to solve problems scientifically? Do people, after studying science for many years, gain the power of reasoning? Do these, and the like,stand as challenges in science teaching today? Therefore, you must teach your students the necessity for application of science in day to day life. It is also essential to establish correlations between various concepts in thecurriculum and day to day life experiences of the students. Then only the student willable to reason out rationally about various events that are occurring around him / her. To achieve this we must know various advancements in science and teaching science. We can optimize the use of different technological gadgets to make the teaching learningprocess effective. With limited resources, it is challenging to make wide use of technologyin actual teaching learning process. It is therefore, necessary to change methods ofevaluation accordingly. In this unit we will take up such challenges and issues in scienceteaching. It is also necessary to prepare children studying at upper primary level for the adolescence phase in their life. Though it is challenging, teacher can play importantrole in this context while teaching science subjects. One thing is sure that, we want to imbibe rational thinking and scientific attitude in the students so that they will become, empowered and also responsible citizen of India.This is our ultimate objective. Figure 7.1 Unit Concept Map 65 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes7.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVES On completion of this unit, you should be able to: examine different perspectives about the necessity of science in our day to day life. describe the importance of scientific literacy in our day to day life. interpret the events in day to day life with a scientific attitude. identify the issues involved in learning science teaching. explain correlations between various scientific concepts in the curriculum with theday to day life experiences. identify various challenges in science learning due to changes in social and culturalpatterns. explaining how to teach science children with special needs. integrate the advancements in science and technology with the process of in scienceteaching-learning. 7.2 SCIENCE FOR ALL Science is ultimately a social endeavour. Science is knowledge and knowledge ispower. With power can come wisdom and liberation. Or, as sometimes happensunfortunately, power can breed arrogance and tyranny. Science has the potential to bebeneficial or harmful, emancipative or oppressive. History, particularly of the twentiethcentury, is full of examples of this dual role of science. The use of atomic power is anexample, as it can be harnessed for either electric power generation or as an atomicbomb. The benefits of science cannot be limited to a selected few, but it is for the benefit of entire humanity. All can enjoy the fruits of scientific discoveries, inventions, andinnovations. The use of mechanical tools in the field of agriculture can be seeneverywhere. Similarly, medicine, a contribution from the field of scientific studies, ismade available for all. Science deals with vari-ous aspects of the physical and biological world. Does this mean that understanding science is simply a journey through massive amounts ofinformation and mastery of disconnected concepts? No, it is not. Science educationhelps us to do much about it. Humanizing science is essential, as it is a basic aim of science and technology is to make our life easier. The Department of Science and Technology, Government of 66Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)India is conducting various programmes and launched various schemes. Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) is a flagship programme of thisMinistry / Department which has five components covering entire range of educationand research from class 6 th to post graduate stage of a student. The first component of this programme is the \"INSPIRE Award\" which recognizes the talent among studentsat a very early stage. Under the scheme, a onetime award of Rs. 5000/- is given to the students for making a science project or model. The scheme envisages selection of 1 million (10 lakh)students during the 11 th Five Year Plan that is from 2007-08 to 2011-12 for this award. The basic motive behind this scheme is to trigger innovativeness and creativityat a very early age. The Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India has two autonomous wings, one is the 'National Council for Science and Technology Communication'(NCSTC) and the other is 'Vigyan Prasar'. These two organizations are set up withthe objectives of communicating science and stimulating scientific temper amongst thepeople. These two organizations support research programmes, software development for exhibitions, websites, puppet shows, street theatre, radio and television programmes,presents awards and fellowships to outstanding science communicators, catalyzes local,regional and national level field programmes, encourages international collaborationand supports long , medium and short term training programmes. The National Children Science Congress (NCSC) is a prestigious project of NCSTC- Network being supported by Dept. of Science and Technology, Govt. of India. Themain feature of this movement is any child between the age group of 12 to 17 canparticipate in this activity, no matter whether he / she is taking formal education or not.Therefore, the name of this project is National CHILDREN Science Congress and not National Students Science Congress. There are many non-governmental organizations working in different parts of the country in the field of science communication. For example, Marathi Vidnyan Parishad is a NGO in Maharashtra, works for imbibing scientific attitude in the society throughvarious programmes. Similarly, Keral Sastra Sahitya Parishad is an organization in Kerala works in science communication. Similar work is done by Vikram SarabhaiCommunity Centre for Science in Gujarat. Centre for Environmental Education isanother organization which works nationwide to create awareness about environmentand to impart environmental education. 7.2.1 Need and Significance To understand the need and significance of science, let's go through a small incidenceas given below. 67 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesGopal is studying in 5th class. One day he was going to weekly market with his father. When they were walking, a cat crossed them. Spontaneously, Gopal' sfather told him to walk seven steps behind. \"Why?\" Gopal asked.\"Otherwise we would not complete our work today\", father replied. \"Why is it so?\" Gopal still had a question in his mind. \"Because, crossing by the cat is considered as a bad omen\", father explained.Gopal was not fully satisfied by the explanation given by his father. However, he followed his father and walked seven steps behind before moving further. After reading this small incidence few questions come to mind. Does a cat really be an obstacle? What do you think? If so, then how? Is the remedy suggested by Gopal's father was correct or wrong? If opinion of Gopal's father is wrong and based on superstition then how can we convince Gopal? How can we become successful to remove such superstitions in the minds ofelder persons? If you feel Gopal's father was wrong and the cat cannot cause any obstacle to his work, then you might also be convinced that there is a need for science and scientificawareness to every one of us. The question is how can it be done? One very powerful tool is with you and it is 'Science Education'. By imparting science education in the right way, we can imbibecertain values in the young minds and a science teacher is the right person to do it in abetter manner. ACTIVITY -1 Through science teaching in the classroom, you can correlate day to day life experiences with scientific concepts. Thus, children may get convinced andstart thinking analytically and with scientific attitude. However, can webecome successful in convincing elder persons to get rid of their wrongnotions through their children? Write your experiences within about 100words in the space given below. ..................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... 68Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)7.2.2 Science Education Science education can be considered as the education in natural and social sciences, mathematics, and technology. This larger vision of science focuses on inquiry aboutthe physical world in the context of society. This vision can be thought of as aninterrelationship of several factors: concept understanding; process skills; habits ofmind; and connections among science, technology, and society. An old proverb says that 'given a fish, one can eat for a day; taught to fish, one can eat for a lifetime'. Think of effective science teaching and let teaching enable learners to fish. Once learners come to understand and use scientific thinking to learn moreabout the world around them, they have become fishers with a lifetime thirstfor knowledge and the skills to seek and learn on their own. What should science education aim at? Science education needs to prepare citizens to deal with global, national, and local problems such as population growth; loss ofresources; and the effects of pollution, disease, and other social issues. In other words, learning science does not mean reading text, answering textual questions correctly, solving numerical problems, or for that matter just performing experimentsgiven in the books. We must encourage rational thinking through science education.Then only we can find the solution to avoid the situations like the one faced by Gopal. There is a beautiful word for this and it is - 'scientific literacy'. What do you mean by scientific literacy and how can be achieve it? We will discuss it in our next sub-section.Before that, let's carry out the following activity. ACTIVITY -2 1. \"Everyone has the ability to learn, but this ability to learn differs from person to person\". How will you teach, taking this aspect intoconsideration? ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 2. Select and explain any problem that you have solved using the scientific knowledge. ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 69 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes7.2.3 Scientific Literacy Scientific literacy means that a person can ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences. This means that a person has theability to critically observe, describe, explain, and predict natural phe-nomena. Scientific literacy implies that person can identify scientific issues underlying national and local decisions and express positions that are scientifically and technolog-icallyinformed. Scientific literacy also implies the capacity to pose and evaluate argumentsbased on evidence and to apply conclu-sions from such arguments appropriately. Real life connected problems, experiences, interactions, experimentations; innovations etc. need also to form the part of scientific literacy. You might be aware about the 'garbage problem' in urban areas. As population of our country isgrowing day by day, more and more garbage isalso produced. Garbage produced in a city likeRanchi, Mumbai, Kolkata is collected at oneplace; it will probably form a tall mountain. Therefore, it is required each of us to segregate the garbage generated in our homes. Bio-degradable and non-degradable garbage shouldbe separated and treated accordingly. (Seefigure 7.2). If we can generate awareness about the garbage problem in the community then it will contribute to scientific literacy. Similar activity can be given to the students so that they become aware about this problem. As a part of this activity a quiz or debate can be conducted on the topic -\"Plastic: Boon or a curse? \" In order to achieve scientific literacy, key components should be carefully and creatively integrated into the school curriculum. The components in the school curriculum mightinclude the following - A knowledge base emphasizing basic concepts and principles as well as moreabstract concepts such as unity and diversity. An understanding of the interrelationships of science, technology, and society. Strengths and limitations of science as a human enterprise. The ability to think and trust the thinking process and to develop problem-solvingskills and processes. The ability to read and interpret science publications, evaluate argu-ments basedon evidence, and apply for conclusions. Figure 7.2 Segregation of waste 70Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed) ACTIVITY -3 Analyze the science curriculum which you are teaching, with regard to the components of scientific literacy and find out the examples in whichcomponents of scientific literacy are included. No. Component Example in the curriculum 1. Ability to think rationally 2. Ability to observe 3. Ability to classify 4. Ability to analyze 5. Correlation with day to day events from immediate environment of achild 6. Applications in daily life7. Utility for solving problems 7.2.4 Teaching Science to Children with Special Needs As you know there are children with special needs. Remember, these children may not be necessarily handicapped or disabled children. These children may be having somepsychological problems. A child studying at primary level and has a tremendous frightin talking in group or with peer group is also considered as a child with special need.Thus, in broader perspective, the children who need some extra attention to be givenor some extra efforts are to be needed to take on them are categorized as childrenwith special needs. Thus, they may include disabled children. According to NCF 2005, there has to be an inclusive education. Thus, the children with special needs should be taught in the same class along with the normal children. Ifwe believe in the idea that every learner is different than other in all respects, then as ateacher, it's a challenge to teach children having special needs with other children. Toteach science to such children is challenging task. Just imagine, in your class there is ablind child who has good understanding abilities. How will you teach such child alongwith normal children? You will find that, while teaching such a child, it is required to devote more time on that child. You are required to adapt different teaching methods and you need to explainevery small thing in detail. It is now accepted fact that the children learn not only whenteacher teaches them, but they learn from their parents, peers and more importantlythrough there immediate environment and experiences. So to a normal child, it is notrequired to explain what you mean by a tree. The child can see different types of trees 71 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesaround, sees different parts of those trees, notes differences and similarities among them. However, you need to explain what you mean by a tree to a child who never hadseen the trees. Thus, it's your responsibility to give appropriate teaching learningexperiences to such a child so that idea of tree is clear. ACTIVITY -4 You are explaining different types of rocks in the classroom. If in your classroom there is a child with special needs, then you are required to followdifferent approach and different method. Match the following columns inthis regard. Column A : Type of child Column B: Method 1. A blind child a. Show the chart having pictures of different types of rocks 2. A deaf and dumb child b. Take child to actual field to have a feel of the rock. 3. A child who cannot walk c. Show actual specimen of rocksd... Give description of different types of rocks inthe classroom Is it advisable to use more than one method for a particular type of child? Which type of disability is easy to tackle from your point of view? Justify ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Remember there is not a single method or strategy of teaching which is considered as 'the best'. Varying styles of presentation, varying activities on the basis of variedresponses of the learners is essential. Sometimes, you need to modify your strategy atthe last moment after receiving responses from learners. Thus, there has to be a mixture of teaching approaches which can match with a range of learning activities. But, you will definitely agree that, \"Chalk-Talk-Test\" method inteaching science is not advisable while teaching children with special needs and alsofor the normal children. It is also necessary to prepare children studying at upper primary level for the adolescence phase in their life. It's a challenge, but a science teacher can play vital rolein this context. 72Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)Children during adolescence are likely to try to be free of the confines of home and parental care and assert their independence. During this phase, children becomesuspicious about everybody around them, even about themselves. As a science teacheryou need to be sensitive to their explorations of their self and body, as well as theoutside world. While science textbooks provide factual information on the humanbody, reproduction, safe sex, drugs, smoking, etc., but this is not enough. A science teacher can interact with children and prepare them mentally for the important phase in their life. ACTIVITY -5 To design science related activities to a blind child, which skills of that child you will utilize? Will you give the same activities to a deaf child or modifythem? Justify your answer with examples. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 7.3 TEACHING DIFFERENT ABILITIES According to Mahatma Gandhi, \"True education is that which draws out and stimulates the spiritual, intellectual, and physical faculties of thechildren\". Implicit in this aim is the belief that education has the potentialto transform individuals and societies. What is scientific method? (Recall unit 1 ). The scientific method is perhaps more easily discerned than defined. But broadly speaking, it involves several interconnected steps: observation, looking for regularitiesand patterns, making hypotheses, devising qualitative or mathematical models, deducingtheir consequences; verification or falsification of theories through observations andcontrolled experiments, and thus arriving at the principles, theories, and laws governingthe physical world. There is no strict order in these various steps. Sometimes, a theorymay suggest a new experiment; at other times an experiment may suggest a newtheoretical model. You have learnt this in Unit 1 . You have also learnt various skills of science learning in unit 2 of the same course. Process and thinking skills are embedded in the procedures of a scientific activity. The inquiry approach to learning science is rich with process and thinking skills that allow the learner to become active, make use of his / her senses, and become involvedemotionally. Thus, the learner is able to make more meaningful connections. 73 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesFor example, you are teaching concept of floatation of solid substances. If you directly speak about ship and submarines then the students may not understand. Since theydon't get a chance to see ship or submarine, they may not even visualize the situation.In this case, what can be the method of teaching so that it encourages the inquiryapproach with process and thinking skills? Here is one method - Ask students to putvarious solid objects such as stone, paper, wooden piece, key, pencil, etc. into avessel full of water. Ask them to note down their observations. Some solids will float,while some will sink in water. Ask them to classify. Through this activity explain theconcept of floatation. Figure 7.3 Process Skills of Learning Science 7.3.1 Role of Experiments in Science Learning The goals of elementary school science education require programmes that emphasizeexperiences designed to further the intellectual,emotional, physical, and social development ofa child. Firsthand observation and learning bydoing have always been recognized as importantin achieving these goals. It is rightly said that, science cannot be understood without carrying out an experiment. Experiments are the hallmark of science, and for science learning, they are essential.Unfortunately, we are not giving enough weightage for the experimentation in actualclassroom teaching. The characteristic feature of any science experiment is that, if the same experiment is carried out in the same experimental conditions by anybody then the same resultsshould be obtained within the experimental limits, no matter how many times and 74Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)anywhere the experiment is carried out. Thus, within the same experimental conditions, the results obtained should be independent of time, space and the person who carriesout the experiment. Here, the 'same experimental conditions' mean all the parameterswhich affect the experiment. These parameters may include surrounding conditionssuch as temperature, pressure, humidity, availability of light, concentration, and physicalstate of chemicals used in the experiment, etc. While teaching any scientific concepts, experiments should be designed carefully, considering following points: Content in the curriculum Level of the student Availability of material Cost of material Duration required for the demonstration Participation of the student Justifiable to the content Carrying out the experiment does not suffice the objective. It is necessary to teach student: To do the same experiment with different experimental conditions that is bychanging variables To take accurate observations To choose right tools of measurement To make accurate measurements To document the observations in systematic manner To study the pattern seen in observations To draw inference To validate To draw conclusion To apply the results practically If we follow the above steps then various skills can be developed in the student. You have already learnt about various skills and their types in the previous units. However,just to recapitulate, see figure 7.4 given below. 75 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes Figure 7.4 Skills of Learning Science It is observed that, people complain about lack of laboratory facility, availability of instruments and materials, lack of time, etc. when asked for teaching science throughexperimental method. However, to carry out experiments at school level does notrequire sophisticated equipments. You can develop your own kit from household objectssuch as pencil, rubber, balloons, nails, paper, cardboard, glass, etc. The only thingwhich is required is innovativeness and creativity of utilizing these objects. ACTIVITY -6 Develop an apparatus from house hold material to demonstrate any experiment in the syllabus that you are teaching. Use this apparatus in actualclassroom teaching. Give it to students to handle. Write your experience in the classroom in about 50 words. You can write it with the help of following points: materials used, process of developing the apparatus, learning of the concept using this apparatus, timemanagement, classroom management, joyfulness among the students. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 7.3.2 Students' Inquiry in Science Learning It seems that too much science instruction is based on imparting knowledge to the students and then having them apply this knowledge to solve some day to day problems. 76Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)This is what scientists do. They spend their lives answering questions that they ask of themselves. One of the major factors that influence a student's interest in science is the way that the student is taught. Traditional science instruction often consists of reading, writing, andmemorizing facts. In contrast, inquiry-based science provides students withopportunities to explore, investigate, research, and discover. Children are naturally curious. Given the freedom, they often interact and experiment with things around them for extended periods. These are valuable learning experiences,which are essential for imbibing the spirit of scientific inquiry, but may not alwaysconform to adult expectations. It is important that any programme of study give children the needed space, and not tie them down with constraints of a long list of 'topics' waiting to be 'covered'. Denyingthem this opportunity may amount to killing their spirit of inquiry. To repeat an oft-quoted saying: \"It is better to uncover a little than to cover a lot.\" Our ultimate aim is to help children learn to become autonomous learners.What kinds of questions are worthy of student inquiry? Well, let's take an example. Have you noticed that, we only see one side of the Moon from Earth? This is because our Moon rotates on its axis at the same rate it revolves around the Earth. Why is that? Rather than providing a readymade answer, students will learn far more if they think about this question themselves. Of course, this is an example of a question that has aknown answer. A more complex question is based on the following two images(figure 7.5). Figure 7.5 Two sides of the moon The image on the left is the face of the Moon seen from Earth. That on the right is the \"far side\" of the Moon. There are striking differences in these two images - mostnotably the virtual absence of mares on the far side. How did these differences comeabout? 77 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesIt turns out that this is still an open question. While a student may not come up with a definitive answer, this project provides a great deal of opportunity for research, and issure to result in students learning far more about the Moon than they would in anytextbook-driven course. Remember children have their own concepts. For example, when asked about the shape of the earth, some will explain that the earth has to be flat because, if it wereround like a ball, people and things would fall off it. Presented with a globe and told that this is the true shape of the earth, these children may adapt their explanation by saying that the earth is hollow and that people liveon flat ground inside it. What is your experience? ACTIVITY -7 1. Enlist three activities that you and your students have enjoyed during teaching of science in the classroom. .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 2. Studies done in India have found that tribal students' knowledge about the living world is rich and largely reflects their environment and lifestyle.In comparison, urban students' ideas about living things are shaped byknowledge gained through books and stories. Do you like to list fewreasons from your own learning? .............................................................................................................. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 7.3.3 Correlation with Day to Day Life Experiences You have already learnt in Unit 2 about the goals of science education can be met through a strong commitment to an inquiry-based science teaching as the means forlearn-ing concepts, developing skills, exploring their connection with the day to daylife experiences, and practicing scientific habits in real life. Understanding the relationship of science to technology and society is also a critical component. Interest in science seems to wane when it is not seen as a vital componentof our lives. For example, how can we remove stain of turmeric from the cloth? Whether we should apply soap or tamarind on the cloth for it? 78Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)Can you relate this answer with the contents in the science text book? When a student recognizes connection of what he/she is learning with day to day life experiences, he/she begin to appreciate the value of scientific discoveries and becomeaware of the strengths and limitations of science in relation to social problems. It is necessary to connect science content with students' interests and personal lives, with societal issues, and with other school subjects. The question is HOW? Science teachers can use following techniques to connect content with student interests: Connect the concepts and instructions explicitly to learners' personal experiences. Make use of specific examples, analogies, and metaphors. Plan lessons to emphasize themes of science, technology, and society. Ask students to organize data into diagrams, tables, and graphs. Ask students to identify patterns and make predictions. Ask students develop and role play scenes in which they use scientific thinking or play the roles of scientists. ACTIVITY -8 Chanda is living in a small hamlet in the hills. She helps her parents in their seasonal work of rice, regional maize farming. She sometimes accompaniesher brother in taking the goats to graze in the bush. She walks 5 km everyday to attend the nearest school. Chanda maintains intimate links with her natural environment. She has used different plants as sources of food, medicines, and fuel wood. She hasobserved parts of different plants used for household purpose, in religiousrituals and in celebrating festivals. She recognizes minute differences betweentrees, and notices seasonal changes based on shape, size, distribution ofleaves and flowers, smells and textures. She can identify about a hundreddifferent types of plants around her. Can we help Chanda translate her rich understanding into formal concepts of biology? Can we convince her that school biology is not about some abstract world coded in long texts and difficult language: it is about the farm she workson, the animals she knows and takes care of, the woods that she walksthrough every day? How? ..................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... 79 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes7.4 KNOWING ADV ANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE AND SCIENCE TEACHING Being a science teacher, it is necessary to know the advancements in science. Also, it is necessary to reflect these advancements in science teaching. Thus, teachingmethodologies can be accordingly framed. For example, we can show a film onAntarctica in the classroom while teaching about it. This is possible due to theadvancements of various gadgets such as projector, PC, CD ROMs, or Video player.Thus, we can bring different media into the classroom through visuals and sounds. Useof media can help your teaching easier and more exciting. 7.4.1 Advancements In Science As the time progresses, there are so many discoveries and modifications took place inthe sphere of knowledge. In unit 1 , you have learnt about history and philosophy of science. With the advancement in technology, our understanding about various aspects became more clear and accurate. For example, before the launching of artificial satellites, groundobservations were used to take to predict the stretch of the cloud. However, onecould not predict the height of the cloud from ground. This became possible with thehelp of artificial satellites. Also, we can prepare accurate maps with the help of satellites. Think about the times when there were no mobile phones or not even STD telephone facility. In this situation if you want to call a doctor who is residing far away from you,how much time it would have taken? Or think of a situation when you want to giveurgent message to somebody. Was it possible? Now a days it is possible as we all are experiencing revolution in telecommunication field. It is possible now to talk with any person, any time in the world even if we are intravel. We can even access internet through mobile phone. Thus, due to theadvancements in science and technology, we consider entire world as a global village . In a village, every person virtually knows every other person living in that village.Similarly, we can access any person in the world. This is the advantage of advancementsin science and technology. ACTIVITY -9 Science and technology plays vital role in our day to day life. Electricity is one such important application of science. Imagine for a while what wouldhappened if electricity is not there. Which difficulties you might face withoutelectricity? ..................................................................................................................... 80Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)..................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... Do you think that the use of electricity has increased your efficiency? ..................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... ..................................................................................................................... You might be aware that, solar energy can be converted into electricity which can be used for house hold purposes and also for street lighting, for running pumps on thefarms, etc. In our country there are various Non- governmental organizations (NGO) whichwork in rural areas. They interact with thevillagers and explain the benefit of use of solarenergy. Our Government and various NGOsalso provide financial assistance for installingunit of solar energy. Have you come across with such situations around you? If yes, just interact with the peoplewho are using solar energy. Find out thechanges and benefits they are experiencingwhile using solar energy. Progress in science and technology has also reflected in various branches in science education also. There are courses for fundamental science and also for the applicationsof scientific research through different technologies. See figure 7.6 given below. Figure 7.6 Various Branches in Science Education On broader perspective, there is an inter link between various disciplines of science. 81 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotes ACTIVITY -10 Study the following concept map carefully. Please interpret various correlations shown in this concept map? Would you like to add anything in the above concept map? ..................................................................................................................... .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 7.4.2 Advancements in Science Teaching Our teaching should also reflect the advancements in science and technology. One important thing that we must remember that, the curriculum has made activity orientedand child centered. The emphasis is given on learning by doing, rather than learningonly text. i) Learning Activity CentreInvestigating and experimenting are great ways for children to form knowledge relating to science and increase their understanding of scientific ideas. In Unit 4 of this course,you have learnt the role and importance of hands on science experiences. Hands onexperiences help children think critically and gain confidence in their own ability tosolve problems. Young children especially are engaged by things they can touch,manipulate, and change; and by situations that allow them to figure out what happens- in short, events and puzzles that they can investigate, which is at the very heart ofscientific study. If a child learns to learn then our purpose gets fulfilled. This is possible through learning activity centre. The big advantage of such centre is that the child has a freedom to dowhat he / she likes to do. Thus, the child enjoys the process of learning. 82Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)You can set up a Learning Activity Centre in your classroom. What is learning activity centre? It is a small place in the corner of a classroom where children can quietly workand learn at their own pace. All the materials required to carry out various activities areprovided to the children at this place. Now it is your innovation power and creativitywhich will decide which activities are to be set up in learning activity centre. The onlycare that you are supposed to take is the materials in the centre should be safe for thechild to use alone. The learning activity centre should contain a variety of activities geared to the varying intellectual ability, maturity, and interest levels of the children. Learning activity centre gives freedom to the children to test all the possibilities come in their mind experimentally. Thus, it helps to provide an opportunity for creativity.After performing the activity children analyze the collected data and draw conclusions. While hands on science experiences work well, they can also be messy and time consuming. So, before you start, you need to see what is involved in an activity and theduration it will take. ii) Use of Multimedia in Teaching - Learning Process Because of the revolution in information technology and telecommunication, most students are aware of some of the areas of science, such as the exploration of outerspace, the hunt for the fossils of extinct dinosaurs, newer technological advancements. Through various media, students are exposed to scientific fictions as well as facts. It is critical that students understand the differences between science facts and sciencefictions. When students study significant scientific theories, history of science, and theevolution of science, they recognize the value of obtaining and relying on evidence. Radio, and more recently television, has played a major role in the field of science communication. The SITE experiment in the mid-1970s was probably the biggestsocial experiment anywhere in the world that established the importance of satellitecommunication in the field of education. Ever since, educational technology has come to be regarded as an important means for universalisation of education in India. The widespread use of personal computers(PC) since nearly two decades ago advances in telecommunication, and Internet adecade ago along with convergence of various technologies has, in the form ofInformation and Communication Technology (ICT), opened up new opportunitiesand challenges in the field of education. Although the vast potential of ICT in the fieldof science education has been well recognized, it still remains largely untapped. The efforts have been piecemeal and sporadic. A beginning for introducing computers in the school system was made through the Computer Literacy and Studies in Schools(CLASS) project in the early 1980s. However, schools faced problems ofinfrastructure, appropriate software, and lack of trained manpower. 83 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesToday, the scenario has changed: with the increasing use of personal computers in schools, homes and workplaces, and internet connectivity, ICT shows renewed promiseas a powerful tool for education, but only if these developments are complimented bymaking available quality software in different disciplines of science. Appropriate multimedia software both in English and other Indian languages suited for various age groups in schools is still a rare commodity. Development of software is anexpensive affair and the Government should make sufficient funds available for thepurpose. Software produced should be widely disseminated via Internet and CD-ROMs. The Internet opens up vast possibilities; it could provide an e-platform for discussion of topics relevant to school children both scholastic and co- scholastic where studentsand teachers could post queries, provide answers, discuss with experts, and exchangeviews. Innovative scientific experiments using a PC could be designed for school studentsthrough a software and hardware interface to help students to measure common physicalparameters (e.g. temperature, luminosity of light, humidity etc.), and also control theseparameters. Such applications would serve to introduce the role of computers inindustries, laboratories, communication and so on. On 20 September 2004, an artificial satellite EDUSAT was launched. It is specifically designed for the educational purpose. It provides an interactive satellite-based distanceeducation system for the country utilizing audiovisual medium, and employing Direct-To-Home (DTH) quality broadcast. With its multiple regional beams covering different parts of India and a beam covering the Indian mainland, it is possible to establish talk-back terminals - one way video andtwo ways audio - for interactive programmes on science education. These wouldprovide an interactive channel for students with experts and could include talks, lectures/ demonstrations, discussions, question-answer sessions, etc. Talkback terminals andreceive-only terminals could be set up at selected schools that could also be utilized byother schools in the neighborhood. To fully utilize the capabilities of EDUSAT, necessaryhardware would need to be made available and efforts strengthened to produce qualitysoftware at regional levels. The importance of community FM radio in science communication needs also to be emphasized. Such low-range community radio stations could be established at selectedschools and the school students encouraged in producing science programmes relevantto the local areas. The audio channels of EDUSAT could beam such programs overwider areas. Satellite Radio has opened up the possibility of a countrywide digital audio science channel. It can cover the remotest and most interior parts of a vast country like Indiawith the help of a specially designed satellite radio receiver. This digital satellitecommunication radio system uses geosynchronous communication satellites dedicated 84Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)for radio broadcasts and is essentially a direct-to-home radio (currently under the name World Space Radio). Access to news, educational broadcasts, and entertainmentfrom all over the world through its unique global relay capability are the remarkablefeatures of this system. Two-way interactivity is possible through telephone lines. In particular, production of software is relatively easy and cheaper to produce. Satellite Radio can prove to be animportant tool for science communication / education in India. Since the broadcast is digital, it is possible to download data files along with pictures, sounds, and movie clips into a PC. It is hence possible to transmit and receive slides /visuals, store them in a personal computer, and synchronize with the audio broadcastfor a full fledged lecture-cum-demonstration which can be projected on to a largescreen to an entire class. Photographs of various things such as bacteria, viruses canbe shown on the screen. Visuals can help us to explain abstract concepts so that theybecome concrete. Mrs. Sharma is a school teacher. She has to teach a topic related to volcano. Do you think that reading the text book, explaining in terms of words andshowing static pictures of volcano will give the correct idea about volcanicirruption? Surely not! Mrs. Sharma also is well aware of this fact. So she has decided to show a movie clip on volcano. For this she keeps a track on the schedule ofGyan Darshan Channel on Doordarshan. It' s her regular practice to showprogrammes telecasted from Gyan Darshan to the students. Mrs. Sharmaalso uses Audio-Visual aids in the form of CDs to teach such topics and togive live experience of the text given in the books. Would you like to adapt the same technique?Will you find it useful? According to you, which problems or obstructions are there, if you want to implement this technique in regular class roomteaching? You can also demonstrate various experiments through virtual simulations using digital technology. Thus, the difficulties of non-availability of apparatus or resource materialcan be overcome. Also, certain topics such as dissection of earthworm can be shownthrough movie clip to explain its anatomy. Smart Class is a solution designed to help teachers in meeting with new challenges and developing students' abilities and performance. Smart class is an interactive andsophisticated way of teaching. It uses various technologies such as TV , LCD, computers,etc. It helps the teachers to access multimedia content and information that can be used for teaching students more effectively. It helps the teacher in expressing their views and 85 Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Block 2 : Managing and Measuring Science LearningNotesteacher ensures that every student is learning. A well designed module of smart class allows a student to visualize the concept much better than static images. ICT as a tool should be used with care so that it serves to bridge the social divide and equalize opportunity; inappropriate and insensitive use may as easily widen the divide.Given the growing reach of the technology, it is imperative that efforts are initiated toutilize ICT at the school level to prepare children to face the challenges of a societythat is fast transforming into information driven society. ACTIVITY -10 1. Can a mobile phone be used effectively in actual Teaching - Learning process? How? Share your experiences after using it actually as per yourideas. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ 2. Apart from simple experiments and hands on experiences, discussions in the class with the teacher, peer interactions, gathering information fromnewspapers, talking to knowledgeable persons in the neighborhood,collecting data from easily available sources, and carrying out simpleinvestigations in the design of which the students have a major role toplay. Biographical narratives of scientists and inventors are a useful practice to inspire students. Enlist such innovative methods to engage the students (in groups) in meaningful investigations; particularly about the problems they perceiveto be significant and important. ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ iii) Where can I Find Resources? After learning this unit, you might be thinking of utilizing some of the methodologies mentioned in it. However, you may ask where to find the resources in the form ofcontents, materials, guidance, etc.? 86Notes Challenges and Issues Involved in Learning Science Teaching Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed)For this you can contact various organizations working in our country. Some of them are National Institute of open schooling (NIOS), Indira Gandhi National OpenUniversity (IGNOU), Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE), NationalCouncil of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) etc. For contacting them,you can go through their web sites on internet. There you will find the addresses, e-mails, and phone numbers. You can definitely get help from resourceful and eminentexperts. You will also get material in the form of books, CDs, experimental kits etc.from these organizations. 7.5 LET US SUM UP In this unit, we learned the fact that, learning science as a 'subject' is not sufficient. It isnecessary to have scientific literacy in the society. Our science education should besuch that it triggers scientific attitude and rational thinking among the children. While teaching, we have to keep a wide perspective in our mind that, science education should prove helpful in catering needs of the society. Hunger, malnutrition, poverty,corruption, stress and tensions, superstitions are the challenges in front of us. Thescience education should help us in finding solutions on these issues. Due to advancements in science and technology, variety of aids is available for us to make teaching learning process effectively. We must take advantage of it in innovativeand creative manner. 7.6 GLOSSARY/ABBREVIATIONS CLASS Computer Literacy and Studies in Schools DTH Direct to home FM Frequency modulation ICT Information and Communication Technology PC Personal Computer SITE Satellite Instructional Television Experiment 7.7 SUGGESTED READINGS AND REFERENCES Elizabeth Hammerman and Diann Musial (2008) Integrating Science with Mathematics & Literacy.
