Hot flush A. Definition B. Incidence [1](#B1)Daily routine is compromised in 10% who undergo hot flush due to its intensity. Hot flush typically begins immediately after the last menstruation. It is frequent for the first 2 years in case of natural menopause and gradually subsides subsequently. Surgical castration triggers intense hot flush in a few weeks after the surgery. Those who receive tamoxifen as a treatment for breast cancer are reported to undergo severe and frequent hot flush for the first 2 to 3 months followed by gradual decrease and stabilization. Hot flush usually lasts for several months although it may persist for years. C. Risk factors [2](#B2)Hot flush also varies between ethnicity or culture. For instance, it is less frequent in asians and caucasian than in african Americans. Also, in a prospective study of women with natural menopause, hot flush was more frequent in women who had longer period of transition (51% vs. 39%). [3](#B3)Further investigation is warranted regarding the relationship between hot flush and other factors such as genetic factors, diet, or exercise. D. Cardiovascular risk [4](#B4) II. Pathophysiology A. Estrogen withdrawal and hormonal change B. Hypothalamus [5](#B5) [6](#B6)Also, the thermoregulatory zone moves downward in those with hot flush and the zone is narrower. Heat loss occurs only with 0.01 degree of increase in core temperature over thermoregulatory zone and menopausal women who have narrow homeostatic range of temperature easily loose heat only with minute change in core temperature before hot flush followed by series of symptoms. Dysfunctional regulation of core temperature is mediated by number of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, production of norepinephrine is depressed by endorphins and catecholamine which is estrogen metabolite in temperature control nucleus. Estrogen and testosterone also stimulates endogenous endorphin production hence directly indirectly control norepinephrine secretion. [7](#B7)In an animal model, hyperthermia was prevented by 5-HT2a antagonist, whereas hyperthemia was induced by direct stimulation of 5-HT2a receptor in rodents. On the contrary, peripheral injection of 5-HT1a agonist lowered core temperature in rodents and human. These indicate that the balance between 5-HT1a and 5-HT2a receptor is crucial in adequate control of body temperature. Manifestation and activation of 5-HT receptor can be regulated by gonadal hormones and adrenal corticosteroid which suggests that serotonin is linked to other hormonal systems related to hot flush. Estrogen withdrawal leads to decrease in serum serotonin, increase in sensitivity of 5-HT2a in hypothalamus. And under this condition, certain intrinsic or extrinsic stimulus increases serum serotonin and induces 5-HT2a receptor, changes set-point of temperature control, and eventually hot flush appears. [7](#B7)When hot flush appears, set-point is down-regulated and normal body temperature is identified as being higher than the new set-point, leading to the activation of temperature regulation mechanism to lose heat. When the core temperature decreases, it stimulates heat preservation mechanism leading to the series of symptoms related to hot flush. [8](#B8) D. Hot flush induced by factors other than menopause [9](#B9) III. Treatment A. Medication [10](#B10) 1. Hormone therapy 1) Estrogen 2) Progestin [11](#B11)The reduction of hot flush was dose-dependent and irregular bleeding was the most frequent complication. Oral medication of MPA was less accompanied by complication. Daily oral MPA of 20 mg reduced hot flush by 76% which was significantly lower than 26% reduction in placebo group. [12](#B12)Megestrol acetate (MA), which is another progestin, is also effective for hot flush in dose-dependent manner. High-dose MA is an effective treatment for breast cancer, however low-dose progestin theoretically induces cancer growth and reported to increase incidence and recurrence of breast cancer, hence precaution is needed for breast cancer survivors. 2. Non-hormonal alternatives 1) New anti-depressants [13](#B13)A large scale placebo-controlled randomized phase III trial was performed for 4 weeks showed 40% and 60% reduction when 37.5 mg and 75 mg or 150 mg was used, respectively, which was effective in reducing hot flush while placebo group only showed 27% reduction. [14](#B14)Side effects of venlafaxine includes dry mouth, anorexia, constipation, and nausea. Nausea usually disappears a week after administration. Though rare, the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) was reported in elderly was reported. Loss of libido, orgasmic dysfunction was complained by 15% of subjects. On the contrary, another report showed increased sexuality score in 4 weeks of venlafaxine administration for hot flush, to improve sleep pattern, and relieve depression. 2) Gabapentin / Pregabalin [15](#B15)Common side effects includes drowsiness, disorientation, headache, and peripheral edema. Also, when 75 mg and 150 mg of pregabalin was administered twice a day for 6 weeks, hot flush was significantly reduced in 65% (P = 0.009) and 71% (P = 0.007), respectively. 3) Clonidine [16](#B16)Dry mouth is the most common side effect and insomnia, headache, depression, and nausea may occur, hindering from wide prescription. 4) Veralipride 5) Bellergal [17](#B17) B. Non-pharmacologic treatment 1. Tolerance and behavior modification 2. Vitamin E [13](#B13)Notable side effect was not reported. "}
