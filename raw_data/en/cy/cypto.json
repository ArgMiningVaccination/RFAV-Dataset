Ostfeld and Keesing (2000 a, b ) recently offered a theory termed the \"dilution effect,\" which would link frag mentation and human health through a complex set of ecological interactions that may inc rease the risk for Lyme disease in highly fragmented areas. The purpose of this study was to test the dilution effect by examining the impacts of habitat fragmentation on l ocal densities of deer ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) and their infection rates by the bacteria that ca uses Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi ). My work first tests the three main assumptions of the dilution effect: (1) white-footed mice ( Peromyscus competent hosts of B. burgdorferi , are habitat generalists that live at high densities in habitat fragments of all sizes, (2) as the area of a fragment decreases the small mammal speci es richness also decreases, and (3) as small mammal species diversity decreases, P. leucopus account for a smaller proportion of the small mammal population. I then a ddress the main prediction that as the size habitat fragments decreases, the deer tick inf ection rates will also increase. I conducted research across 27 fragmented sites (0. 57 to 427 ha) in the Albany Pine Bush ecosystem, New York. I quantified the vegetation a t all sites and used small mammal data from 21 sites (Dewan, 2002). I also used stan dard drag sampling to make three collections of ticks: spring 2002 (22 sites), fall 2002 (22 sites) and spring 2003 (27 sites). I tested ticks for the presence of the bacteria tha t causes Lyme disease ( B. burgdorferi ) using a PCR-based test. From these data, infection rates of ticks were determined for each site. All field and laboratory work was conduc ted in collaboration with the New York State Department of Health, following protocol s for handling hazardous biological agents. I collected a total of 4845 deer ticks and tested 7 33 for B. burgdorferi infection. Overall infection rates were 0.22 for spring '02, 0.56 for fall '02 and 0.23 for the spring '03. My results supported two of the three assumptions of t he dilution hypothesis: Peromyscus occurred in all fragments, and was overall the most abundant species and there was higher small mammal species diversity in larger fra gments. However, as small mammal species diversity decreased, Peromyscus did not account for a larger proportion of the small mammal population. Additionally, the main pre diction of the dilution effect was not supported, as I found no relationship between t ick infection rates and small mammal species richness or forest fragment size. I found small scale microhabitat variables (e.g. canopy cover, understory cover, and litter depth) t o be better predictors of the local densities of infected ticks. While the dilution ef fect has robust theoretical support, my data show that its assumptions and main predictions are not upheld in this suburban setting, and therefore, the effect may not be relev ant in areas where humans are most likely to come into contact with ticks.

General introduction The spread of housing out of cities and into the su burbs and rural fringe has brought millions of humans closer to natural areas, which a re habitats for deer ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) and their hosts. Deer ticks are parasites that a re not host-specific, feeding on a variety of vertebrates throughout their two-year life cycle. They themselves can also host microparasites (e.g. bacterial diseases), and their lack of host-specificity facilitates the transmission of internal parasites between a wi de range of mammalian species, including humans. Adult deer ticks rarely transmit bacterial diseases to their larvae (Piesman et al, 1986); instead they become infected when feeding on previo usly infected hosts. When a blood meal is taken, microparasites, such as the Lyme dis ease bacteria ( Borrelia burgdorferi ), are ingested and held in the midgut of the tick (Bu rgdorfer et al, 1982). During successive blood meals, these bacteria penetrate th e midgut wall of the tick, translocate to the salivary glands and are ultimately transferred into the host's bloodstream (Gray, 1999). The potential for human contact with infected ticks has increased through suburbanization, resulting in growing rates of Lyme disease and an increasing concern for public health. This disease has a broad range of symptoms including erythema migrans (a bulls-eye rash), headache, sore muscles, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological problems, and cardiac problems such as heart blocka ge (CDC, 2002). Although not life- 2 threatening in its early stages, when unchecked the disease can cause many debilitating symptoms, and in rare cases, even death. Unfortun ately, the disease does advance to later stages in many patients because it is difficu lt to diagnose (Steere, 1994). At present, Lyme disease is the most prevalent arth ropod-borne human disease in the United States and Europe (Gray, 1999). The magnitu de of the threat of this disease is evident in the increasing number of cases of Lyme d isease throughout the United States, including New York State, and in Albany County (Fig ures 1 and 2; White, et al, 1991; CDC, 2002). The threat of this disease could be re duced if there was a better understanding of its ecology, including the roles o f vectors and reservoirs in the transmission of the disease, and the impacts of sit e-specific factors (Caraco et al., 1998). This has been a focus of recent research that has f ound that I. scapularis survival is influenced by a number of microclimate variables su ch as vegetation structure (Adler et al, 1992), relative humidity (Sonenshine, 1991, Gra y, 1999 and Randolph and Storey, 1999), as well as the availability of hosts for eac h life stage (Rand et al, 2003). Further, LoGiudice et al. (2003) found that B. burgdorferi can be transmitted by a number of different mammalian and avian reservoir species, wh ich are each variably effective in transmitting the on disease to ticks. Recent theoretical studies have utilized large-scal e ecological relationships to predict that the threat of Lyme disease is influenced by habitat fragmentation, through related changes to surviving mammal communities. Termed th e dilution hypothesis (Ostfeld and Keesing, 2000), this theory suggests that the size of a natural fragment influences the 3 diversity of small mammals within the patch, which in turn, influences the types of mammals that a tick will feed on. The hypothesis h inges on the ecological generalist Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse), the most competent reservoir for the transmission of Lyme disease to ticks (Spielman et al, 1985, LoGiudice et al, 2003) and one of the mammalian species best adapted to deal w ith habitat fragmentation. Because they transmit B. burgdorferi to 92.1% of larvae that molt to nymphs (LoGiudice e t al, 2003), an increase in the number of ticks feeding o n Peromyscus in a given area would lead to an increase in tick infection rates. (Note: a second species of Peromyscus , P. maniculatus is involved in this transmission cycle, but it is difficult to distinguish from P. leucopus . Thus, all further references will be to Peromyscus , meaning one or both of these species.) Larger fragments are expected to contain a greater diversity of species of small mammals, so in these fragments I. scapularis would have a greater probability of obtaining a bl ood meal from a mammalian species other than Peromyscus . As a result, in larger patches Lyme disease prevalence in ticks should be less tha n that of smaller patches. Based on this theory, Lyme disease threats are greater where habitat fragmentation is high and mammalian biodiversity is low (Ostfeld and Keesing, 2000 a, b ). In a recent study, LoGiudice et al (2003) modeled t he relationships between species richness and tick infection rates. Their model sup ported the dilution hypothesis and pointed to the importance of maintaining biodiversi ty and stability to decrease nymphal infection rates. The dilution hypothesis was also supported by one recent field study in 4 Dutchess County, New York. Allan et al (2003) foun d that the infection prevalence, density of nymphs, and density of infected nymphs w ere all negatively related to the size of the fragment. In very small fragments (<2 ha), t he density of nymphs and density of infected nymphs greatly exceeded those of larger si tes such that the 5 smallest fragments had an average of 7 times higher density of infect ed nymphs than larger fragments. The dilution effect suggests that management of na tural areas should aim to decrease fragmentation and maintain larger continuous tracts of natural area to preserve biodiversity and reduce the risk to human health. However, the components of the hypothesis remain controversial and there is questi on as to how widely applicable it is. For example, the application of the hypothesis to s uburban areas, which have a different ecology than forest fragments in rural or logged la ndscapes, is untested. Small fragments in residential areas may be too degraded or isolate d to support Peromyscus and deer ticks, but still may contain other species that benefit fr om residential areas such as squirrels (Sciurus sp. ) or rabbits ( Sylvilagus sp. ). Thus, the dilution effect offers the potential for a connection between biodiversity and human health, b ut needs to be tested in a variety of contexts to determine how widely applicable it is. The Albany Pine Bush ecosystem is a natural area th at has been highly fragmented by both residential and commercial development. Theref ore, there are many natural fragments of varying sizes within proximity of one another that share climate and natural history. Further, these fragments house population s of deer ticks as well as a number of other vertebrate species that are potential hosts f or these ticks. Albany County also has 5 Number of Reported Cases of Lyme Disease, United St 24000 26000 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Year Cases (Thousands) experienced an increase in the number of Lyme disea se cases in recent years (Figure 2) although there are few details about the dynamics o f the disease in the region. In this study, I tested the dilution hypothesis by collecting deer ticks from forested fragments of varying size and assaying them for the presence of B. burgdorferi bacteria. In addition to fragment sizes, I also examined the roles of fine-scale vegetative structure, larger-scale landscape type and local mammalian com munities on the transmission cycle of Lyme disease.

Number of Lyme disease cases in 3 countie s in New York State (CDC, 2001). 1.1. Lyme disease spread and public health Based on the number of cases emerging and the poten tial medical consequences to humans, Daniels and Falco (1989) described Lyme dis ease as the most important \"new\" infectious disease besides AIDS. In 2000, the Cent er for Disease Control reported that the number of cases of the disease has continued to grow throughout the United States from 1982-2000, and the greatest numbers of cases a re reported in the northeast, mid- Atlantic and north-central regions. Specifically, New York State had the largest number of cases each year from 1991-2000 (CDC, 2002). Whi te et al. (1991) documented the spread of the disease in New York State (1977-1989) and found that incidences of Lyme disease grew in endemic counties and the number of counties where the deer-tick was documented grew from 4 to 22. The disease is manifested in three separate stages, each with varying symptoms. An erythema migrans or bulls-eye rash often characteri zes the first stage. However, this only 7 occurs in 60% to 80% of patients (Longworth, 1990), so it is not a reliable indicator of the infection. Diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that headache, fatigue, fever, chills and many other cold-like symptoms often char acterize the first stage. In Stage II, symptoms progress to cardiac disease such as atriov entricular blockage and ventricular dysfunction, and meningitis and cranial nerve palsies (Longworth, 1990). The third stage is most often c haracterized by relapsing and remitting arthritis in large joints, the knee being the most commonly affected (Longworth, 1990). Stage II and III symptoms are d ifficult to diagnose, because the symptoms they present are also symptoms of many oth er diseases. The diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that the symptoms m ay occur many years after a tick bite. Given the difficulty of diagnosis, prevention of in itial human infection remains the best control option. Therefore, examining the ecological interactions that influence the transmission of the disease to humans should be a r esearch priority. 1.2. Life cycle of deer tick In the Northeast, I. scapularis (deer tick) is the primary vector of the B. burgdorferi bacteria. These ticks have a two-year life cycle i n which they progress from larvae to nymphs and finally to adults (Figure 3). Adult fem ale deer ticks lay their eggs on the ground in the summer (May, June and July) and the l arvae hatch from these eggs in late summer early fall. The larvae begin to seek a host for their first blood meal. They are not host-specific and will feed on a variety of small m ammal and other vertebrate hosts. Any of these hosts could possibly be infected with B. burgdorferi and therefore could infect a 8 feeding tick with the bacterium. After the larvae feed, they return to the leaf litter where they molt into nymphs. Nymphs overwinter in the leaf litter and emerge in the late spring/early summer. The nymphs are larger than the larvae and quest higher in the vegetation in search of new hosts. If infected as larvae, nymphs could at this point transmit the Borrelia bacteria to their new hosts. On the other hand, those not infe cted as larvae, could become infected by taking a bloodmeal from infected nymphal hosts. Once the nymphs have fed they drop to the ground, and once again return to the le af litter to molt into adults. This is about a three-month process, and the adults emerge from the litter in the fall, then immediately begin questing for their final blood me al (Sonenshine, 1991). However, adults are larger and stronger and are able quest t o heights of about 1 meter. The adults' ability to quest to greater heights is a key factor contributing to the fact that adults usually feed on white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ). Based on this life cycle, mammalian hosts, includin g humans, are at greatest risk of contracting Lyme disease during the months of May t o July or October to November when nymphs and adults are most active. However, M ay to July is the greatest threat because this is when humans are most active and nym phs, which are more difficult for humans to detect, are questing for blood meals. 9 Figure 3. Life cycle of deer tick (CAES website, 20 03) 1.3. Albany Pine Bush ecosystem The Albany Pine Bush ecosystem is located in easter n New York between the cities of Schenectady and Albany, and consists of inland pine barrens interspersed with deciduous forest and wetland communities (USFWS, 1997). This unique ecosystem is a result of the glacial history of the region. Following the W isconsin Glaciation, what is now the Hudson-Mohawk confluence formed glacial Lake Albany (USFWS, 1997). The rivers that emptied into the Lake deposited large amounts of glacial sand in a large delta located on the western edge of modern day Albany. The lake eventually dried up, leaving behind fine sandy sediment, which was shaped into aeolian dunes that are now held in place by plants characteristic of eastern pine barrens (Natu re Conservancy, 2003). The dominant pitch pine ) and scrub habitats, which were historically fire-dependent, are sandy and wel l drained. The pine barrens vegetation is well adapted to such conditions and is mostly do minated by dwarf chestnut oak forests that species such as red maples ( Because these hardwood forests are common in reside ntial neighborhoods as well as larger natural fragments, I focused my surveys on t his habitat, avoiding the brushier or more open habitats characteristic of much of the pr eserve. This inland pine barrens, a globally rare ecosystem , is decreasing in size due to habitat fragmentation resulting from commercial and residen tial development. However, the Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission currently prot ects 2940 acres of land with more protection planned (Nature Conservancy, 2002). 1.4. Habitat fragmentation in the Albany Pine Bush Habitat fragmentation, the breaking up of extensive habitats into smaller more isolated patches (Saunders et al., 1989), is of great concer n to many reserve managers and conservation biologists. A growing body of literat ure has documented the ecological impacts that result from habitat fragmentation and how it affects ecosystem function and population dynamics. These studies have show that habitat fragmentation influences species differently, and may create favorable conditions for some species an d unfavorable conditions for others. For example, Nupp and Swihart (1998) found that fra gmentation could create woodlots that offer poor habitat for chipmunks but offer a h abitat where Peromyscus can thrive. 11 Urban or suburban fragmentation may also increase t he risk of predation for small mammals by domestic cats however, gardens can creat e habitat for others (Baker et al, 2003). Other studies have found that the quantity and type of habitats within the landscape play a major role in the shaping of populations within t he patch. For example, Barko et al. (2003), found greater abundances of white-footed mi ce surrounded by high percentages of urban area than those surrounded by upland decid uous forest. Variables such as percentage of barren ground and proximity to buildi ngs have also been found to be related to small mammal species richness (Dickman, 1987). Habitat fragmentation in rural settings appears to impact mammalian communities differently than habitat fragmentation in urban set tings. In rural settings, many fragments do not act as habitat islands in that they do not p revent dispersal across the landscape (Rosenblatt et al, 1999), while urban fragmentation may create habitats that prevent emigration and lead to high small mammal species ab undances (Barko et al, 2003). The Albany Pine Bush is a highly fragmented ecosys tem and its patches are undoubtedly influenced by fragmentation. Many of the remnant f ragments are highly fragmented and are directly adjacent to or even surrounded by resi dential developments. Because this ecosystem is in an urban setting, I would expect th at small mammals in some of smaller fragments would be subject to reduced dispersal abi lity and would therefore have greater population densities in these fragments. However, due to conservation of the large tracts 12 of land in the Albany Pine Bush, mammals in larger fragments would not be subject to these pressures. Small mammals are also subject to the pressures of domestic cat predation and may also benefit from gardens. Furth er, Peromyscus may benefit from some habitats created in the Albany Pine Bush. Recently, the dilution theory has been offered to e xplain how habitat fragmentation influences the transmission of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease (Ostfeld and Keesing, 2000). This theory is based on the well-d escribed species-area relationship (McArthur and Wilson, 1967) in which larger islands (or habitat fragments) have greater species diversity (here small mammal host species). This relationship becomes relevant to the dilution theory in that P. leucopus , an ecological generalist, are thought to survive better than other small mammals in habitat fragment s (Rosenblatt et al., 1999). As a result, in large fragments there would be a greater diversity of potential tick hosts, all of which are less efficient in transmitting B. burgdorferi than P. leucopus , thus diluting the potential for the spread of Lyme disease (Figure 4; LoGiudice et al, 2003). Small mammals and fragment size are not the only fa ctors related to tick density and possibly infection rates. Adler et al. (1992) found that as much as 58% of th e variations of larval deer tick burdens and 23% of nymphal burd ens on Peromyscus could be attributed to the structure of the vegetation in th e habitat. Further, larvae were found in greater abundance in more densely wooded sites (Adl er et al, 1992). Protection from direct sunlight and wind movements could also have an impact on tick abundances. Ticks are susceptible to desiccation while they are questing, when they lose water through both their cuticle and spiracles (Randolph and Storey, 1999). Gray (1999) found 13 that Ixodes ticks survive only where there is sufficient vegeta tion cover to maintain relative humidity at 80% throughout the driest time s of the year. As a result, they select microhabitats with the least temperature fluctuatio ns and the highest relative humidity (Sonenshine, 1991). Habitat Fragmentation (Patch Size) Decline in Host Species Diversity Greater Proportion of Competent Hosts Increase Tick Infection Rates Figure 4. Flow chart outlining predicted interactio ns involved in dilution hypothesis. 1.5. Study objectives The primary objective of this project was to determ ine the factors that influence I. scapularis densities and their B. burgdorferi infection rates in the Albany Pine Bush as a test of the dilution hypothesis. While the dilutio n hypothesis has been supported by computer modeling (Schmidt and Ostfeld, 2001; LoGiu dice et al, 2003), there has been only one field test, which sampled relatively few s ites (n=17 fragments, Allan et al, 2003) and did not sample small mammals. If the dilution effect is to be regarded as a widespread phenomenon deserving of consideration in conservation and development planning, both its assumptions and major prediction s must hold up to field tests. 14 First, I tested three assumptions of the dilution h ypothesis: (1) Peromyscus, the most competent hosts, live in fragments of all sizes, (2 ) as the area of a fragment decreases the small mammal species richness also decreases, and ( 3) as species richness decreases, Peromyscus make up a larger proportion of the total small mam mal population. Second, I tested the prediction of the dilution hyp othesis that the sites with the greatest area, and therefore diversity of small mammals woul d have the lowest B. burgdorferi infection rates in both nymphal and adult ticks. Third, as an alternative to the dilution effect, I examined the influence of vegetation characteristics on tick densities and B. burgdorferi infection rates. 2. Methods and materials 2.1. Selection of study sites The Albany Pine Bush is a suitable habitat to test the dilution hypothesis because it is highly fragmented. The habitat, which is approxima tely 2600 ha (6000 acres) in size, includes the 1300 ha (3000 acres) Albany Pine Bush Preserve, and a number of privately owned fragments (Figure 5). 15 Figure 5: Study sites and land-use within the Alban y Pine Bush Ecosystem Twenty-two sites were selected within the Albany Pi ne Bush based on the following criteria: an even distribution of fragment sizes, s imilar vegetation types and sites surrounded or bisected by suburban development (DeW an, 2002). Five of the larger fragments had sites at both their edge and interior . At most sites, a 120-meter by 120- meter plot was established. Each plot was subdivid ed into four equal quadrants (60 by 60 m) that were labeled northeast, northwest, southeas t, and southwest quadrants. In smaller fragments, where it was not possible to form a plot that was 120 meters by 120 meters, one 3600 square meter (60m x 60m or 120m x 30 m) pl ot was established. The fragments in which these plots were established ran ge in size from 2.86 to 427.38 hectares and had perimeter to area ratios of betwee n 0.0056 and 0.0495 (Table I). 16 Fragment size and perimeter was determined using Ar cGis (ESRI) and Albany County Orthoimagery photos from 2001 (NYS GIS Website). In early 2003, I added 5 additional small sites in response to an article published by Allan et al (2003), who found that the nymphal infection prevalence and nymphal abundances in sites of less than 2 hectares were significantly greater than those in sites that were greater than 2 hectares (2003). The areas of the 5 new sites ranged from 0.57 to 6. 23 hectares. 17 Table I. Characteristics of fragments. P/A ratio is the perimeter (m)/area (ha).

Tick sampling Ticks were collected by drag sampling in spring/ear ly summer and fall, targeting both nymphal and adult I. scapularis . The dragging was done with a 1 x 1 m cloth with dowels sewn into each end to provide weight (Figure 6). In the spring, the drags were made of felt, and canvas was used in the fall. Fel t, a textured material is used to collect nymphs, which are smaller and weaker than adults, a nd need more texture to grasp the drag. Adults are strong climbers and need no assis tance in attaching to the cloth, so canvas is used. Figure 6. Drag sampling for nymphal ticks in Albany Pine Bush site number 9. The cloth was dragged along the ground and low vege tation (Figure 6) to collect nymphs and larvae and along the tops of shrubbery and high er vegetation to collect adults. Larvae are known to quest only within the leaf litt er, nymphs quest higher on upright plants, and adults quest to about a height of 1 met er (Mejilon and Jaenson, 1997). Ticks 19 were collected 3 times: in late spring/early summer of 2002, the fall of 2002, and in the late spring/early summer of 2003. Collection periods consisted of 30 minutes of dragg ing within each quadrant (NE, NW, SE, and SW) of each plot. Therefore, in each seaso n a total of two hours was spent within each large plot collecting ticks and a total of 30 minutes in small plots with only one quadrant (Table I). Drags were checked for tic ks at 5 to 10 meter intervals (Schulze et al, 2001) and ticks were immediately placed in t ubes labeled with the site and quadrant. Collected ticks were stored alive at 40 \u00b0C until they were processed at which time they were killed by submerging in 80% ethanol. Tick identification was carried out in a lab using a dissecting microscope and a tick identification key (Durden and Keirans, 1996). The number of individuals of each species, their sex (adults) and their life stage we re recorded for each quadrant. Although other species were collected, all analyses were car ried out with deer ticks. Each tick was placed in an individual microcentrifuge tube and gi ven an identification code. 2.3. Detection of presence of Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria in ticks A number of techniques have been used to determine if the B. burgdorferi is present within a tick including Direct and Indirect Immunof luorescent Assays (DFA & IFA) (Barbour et al, 1983 and Arberer and Duray, 1991) a nd Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) (Persing et al, 1990). A PCR-based method was utilized in this study. This process amplified a specified DNA product, if prese nt, that is present in the B. burgdorferi genome. 20 2.3.1. DNA extraction DNA was extracted through the use of Chelex 100 mol ecular grade resin (BioRad, 200- 400 mesh, sodium form) (Guttman et al, 1996). Indi vidual ticks were placed in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes and ground using pipette tips or st erile applicator sticks. A 5% Chelex solution was then added in the following amounts: 3 00 \u00b5l for adult females, 250 \u00b5l for adult males and 150 \u00b5l for nymphs. The tubes were then placed in a shaking incubator at 56\u00baC overnight. Each tube was then vortexed for 30 seconds and placed at 96\u00baC for 15 minutes, vortexed again for 30 seconds, and then ce ntrifuged for 5 minutes at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was then removed and placed i n a separate 2.0 ml centrifuge tube. The DNA was stored at -20\u00baC until the PCR reaction was completed. 2.3.2. PCR reaction The primers utilized for this reaction were al, 1990). Both the forward and reverse primers were synthesized Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (Coral ville, IA). These primers produce a 200 base pair product that is Borrelia- specific. A master mix was prepared using the following amounts per sample: 5\u00b5l of 10x sample buf fer, 2, 4\u00b5l of 10mM DNTPs, 1\u00b5l of both the forward and reverse pri mer, 32\u00b5l of distilled water and 0.2 \u00b5l of Taq polymerase. The master mix was then distributed to 0.5 \u00b5l strip-tubes and 5 \u00b5l of the extracted DNA sample was added to each tu be. The tubes were then placed in the PCR thermocycler and the PCR reaction was carri ed out under conditions outlined in Table II. Once the process was completed the sample s were stored at 4 C until ready to be run on the Agarose gel. 21 Table II. PCR reaction conditions for samples run with fla 1 and 3 primers.

Agarose gel electrophoresis To visualize the results of the PCR, DNA samples we re run on a 2%-Agarose gel. A 1- kb Plus DNA ladder (5\u00b5l) was added to the first lan e of each gel, and 5\u00b5l of the DNA samples combined with 1.5 \u00b5l of tracking dye sample buffer (6X) were added to each the remaining wells. Positive and negative samples were also run (Figure 7). The positive control, a B. burgdorferi lysate, was obtained from C. Thill, NYS Department of Health (Stony Brook, New York). Samples were run on the R GX-100, a RAGE (Rapid Agarose Gel Electrophoresis) system by Cascade Biologics. Voltage was set at 275 and gels were run for 5-10 minutes; upon completion a digital pho to of the gel was taken and examined. The samples were found to be positive if a band was present at 200 base pairs (Figure 7). 22 Figure 7. Photo of Agarose gel. Lane 1 is a 1 Kb ladder, lane 2 is the negative control, lanes 3, 4, and 6 are positive samples, land 5 is a negative sample and lane 7 is the positive control. From the ticks collected, I tested 733 ticks for pr esence of the Lyme disease-causing bacteria ( B. burgdorferi ). This included 320 adults (155 female, 165 male) and 413 nymphs, were tested for the using this PCR-based te st. The goal of sub-sampling was to test 20 ticks from each site (5 from each quadrant) . At sites where fewer than 20 ticks were collected, all were tested. 2.4. Vegetation sampling To characterize the components of the micro-habitat that are most important to ticks I quantified leaf litter, where ticks lay their eggs and over winter as nymphs and adults, as well as the vertical and spatial structure of the v egetation that ticks climb when questing. Sampling of vegetation structure was carried out wi thin each quadrant of each plot. Data were collected along 4 transects across each 3600m 2 quadrant from the quadrant edge located at 7.5 meters, 22.5 meters, 37.5 meters and 52.5 meters. Along each transect, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 200 bp 23 vegetation was studied at 5 points, determined usin g a random numbers table. At each point the following data were collected: identity a nd size (diameter at breast height or DBH) of the nearest tree, the estimated percentage of ground cover, estimated percentage of canopy cover, litter depth and the presence or a bsence of cover at specific height levels. DBH was measured with a diameter tape to the neares t 0.5 cm. Ground cover was estimated by placing a quarter meter square quadrat at ground level at each sample point. Ground cover (<1m) and canopy cover were classified into one of four 1=0- 25%, 2= 26-50%, 3=51-75% and was also estimated using a densitometer (Geographic Resource Solutions, Arcata , CA). The depth of the litter was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using a meter stick. Finally, the presence or absence of vegetation was noted at the heights of 0-15 cm, 15 cm-1 m, and greater than 1 m. These heights represent the different heights climbed by questing larval, nymphal and adult Ixodes. 2.5. Small mammal surveys All small mammal data were collected by DeWan (2002 ) using track tubes to record the presence and activity of small mammals through a re cording of their footprints. These activity indices have been shown to be closely rela ted to species abundance as measured by live trapping (Glennon et al, 2002). Track tube surveys were conducted using 20m by 20m grid array, in June and August of 2001 at sites 1-21. Track tubes made of metal rain gutter, inkpads and contact paper, were set out on uniform grids (Table I). Traps were baited with peanuts and tracks were recorded 2 and 4 days after deployment. Data were 24 summarized as species present and relative occupanc y rates per species per site, a surrogate of small mammal density (Glennon et al, 2 002). This data was examined by site as a whole and, when possible, independently f or each 3600 m 2 quadrant. 2.6. Landscape-level analysis The GPS coordinates for each of the 27 study sites were mapped using ArcView GIS 8 (ESRI). These were compared with land-use classes (agricultural, commercial, industrial, forest, open, residential, railroad, road and water ) digitized at a resolution of 20 m by D. Bogan and C. Holzworth. As a measure of the surrou nding landscape, R. Kays quantified the proportion of each land-use class present withi n a 500-meter radius of the center of each site. 2.7. Data analysis Data available for statistical analysis vary by sea son depending upon the number of sites studied (Table III). For example, vegetation data were taken at each of the 27 sites but in fall and spring 2002 ticks were collected only at s ites 1-22. Therefore, vegetation for sites 23-27 can be compared only to the spring 2003 ticks collected and infection rates. Small mammal data were only available for 21 of the 22 or iginal sites and were used in combination with only spring and fall 2002 tick den sities and infection rates. Because the small mammal data were surveyed in the summer o f 2001, larvae that would have fed on these small mammals were nymphs in the spring of 2002 and adults in the fall of 2002. Extending this comparison to any subsequent tick collections would be suspect, as populations of small mammals fluctuate greatly from year to year. 25 Raw data were queried and summarized using programs written in relational database software (Microsoft Visual FoxPro). All statistical tests were performed using SPSS 10.0 and SYSTAT 9.0. Most statistical evaluations were d one both at the site level and at the quadrant level to determine if any differences occu rred at larger versus smaller scales. This fine scale is important to consider because en vironmental conditions over relatively small areas have been shown to affect I. scapularis densities (Daniels et al, 2000). Site- level data were summarized by combining the data fr om each of the quadrants at each site (1-4 fragments). At the quadrant-level, the d ata from each quadrant were examined separately per site. Linear regressions were used to test the assumption s of the dilution hypothesis. I examined the influence of vegetative microhabitat f eatures on tick infection rates with Principle Components Analysis (PCA) and Linear Regr essions. PCA is a multivariate analysis that uses correlations among variables to ordinate the variables based upon the two most influential factors (the ones that explain the most variance). This allowed me to compare a number of variables that are not measured in the same units. Two PCA's were completed, one at the fragment level and one at the quadrant level. The following variables were used in the analysis: conifer, litte r depth, layers of understory, understory and canopy cover, and basal area. The two factors f ound to explain the most variance in vegetation were then ordinated by fragment size, de nsity of infected ticks (spring 2002 and 2003 nymphs and fall 2002 adults) and proportio n of residential or commercial land area within a 500-meter buffer. The factor explain ing the most variation within these loadings was then regressed against tick infection rates. 26 Landscape-level features were analyzed using linear regressions. Regressions were done on the density of infected ticks and the proportion of residential and commercial use combined. 27 Table III. Data collected per site at each sampling period.

Results Over the 3 collection seasons a total of 5,825 deer ticks were collected (Table IV). The larger number of adults probably reflects their rel ative ease of capture compared to younger stages. Six dog ticks (Dermacenter variabilis ) and one D. albipictus (winter tick) were collected. Nymphal densities in the spring of 2002 ranged from 0 to 50.69 per hectare with a mean of 13.51. Adult densities in t he fall of 2002 ranged from 0 to 310.42 ticks per hectare with a mean of 81.0. The density of nymphs in the spring of 2003 ranged from 0 to 36.11 nymphs per hectare with a me an of 11.78 (Table V). Overall B. burgdorferi infection rates were 22% for nymphs (23% in 2002, 2 2% in 2003), and 56% for adults (54% females and 57% males). Wi thin a site, proportions of infected nymphs ranged from 0 to 1.00 while that of adults r anged from 0.2 to 0.85 (Table V). Table IV. Total ticks collected across three sampli ng seasons.

Small mammal species-area relationship In her survey of small mammals, DeWan (2002) found from 2-7 species per fragment with 8 total species detected in the region. Linea r regression of ln(species richness) and ln(Area) was significant with a positive relationsh ip between the area of the patches and the richness of small mammals within the patch (Fig ure 8). Peromyscus were found in all 21 of the fragments sampled. Although rarely obser only in the interior of large fragments (DeWan, 2002). 30 Figure 8. Species-area relationship for small mamma l species richness detected in Summer 2002 (data from DeWan, 2002) (Linear slope i s significantly different from zero df 1,19 F=5.529 p=.030). 3.2. Peromyscus and fragment size Peromyscus mice were found in all sites, and were generally t he most abundant small mammal (Figure 9). However, in smaller fragments, t he relative abundance of other small mammal species increased. The relationship between Peromyscus and size of fragment was not significant (Figure 9). 31 Ln(Area) 7 6 5 4 3 2 1Relative abundance 2.0 1.5 1.0 .5 Other Species Peromyscus Figure 9: Area-abundance relationships for Peromyscus (open boxes) and for all other small mammal species combined (closed triangles) at site level (tests for non-zero slope: Peromyscus df 1, 19 , F=4.897, p=.039). Relative Abundance is track tube occupancy rates over 4 days per site (Table III). 3.3. Infection rate and small mammal species richness Linear regressions of the Density of Infected Nymph s (DIN) from the spring of 2002 on small mammal species richness were not significant at the site level (df 1, 17 , F = 1.319, p = 0.267) or at the quadrant level (df 1, 48 , F = 0.171, p = 0.681). The linear regressions of the Density of Infected Adults (DIA) from the fall 2002 on small mammal species richness also are not significant at the site level (df 1, 16 , F=0.067, p=0.799) or at the 2=.024 32 3.4. Infection rates in a multivariate context The failure of the dilution hypothesis to explain m y results suggests that other factors are more important in determining Borrelia infection rates of ticks. To explore this, two Principle Components Analyses (PCA) were done to ex plore combinations of measured vegetative microhabitat variables, landscape variab les and their relationships with infected tick densities. The first PCA (Figure 10) was run at the fragment level and shows that Factor 1 explains more variance (43.6%) in vegetation variables than does Factor 2 (25.9%). In this PCA, litter depth, conif er, basal area and canopy cover show most of their variation with Factor 1, while layers of understory and understory cover show most variation with Factor 2. When Factors 1 and 2 are ordinated by fragment size , tick infection rates and proportion of commercial/residential area surrounding sites (F igure 11), other relationships also become apparent. For example, large fragments all appear above zero on the y-axis while small fragments are mostly less than zero. Across all collection seasons, most fragments with low density of infected ticks are less than ze ro on the y-axis. In other words, aspects of vegetation Factor 2 may play a role in determini ng the infection rates of ticks. Factor 2 also appears to have some relationship with the d ifferences found amongst sites with varying proportions of commercial/residential land surrounding them. Although Factor 2 explains less variance, it is more suited to explai n differences in infection rates in ticks. As a result, Factor 2 was regressed with the densit y of infected ticks for each season. A significant relationship was found with the density of infected ticks from the fall 2002 (Figure 12), all others were not significant. 33 The second PCA, which was completed at the quadrant level (Figure 13), displayed very similar relationships between the vegetation variab les as found in the first PCA. On this scale, Factor 1 explains more variation in these ve getation variables (32.6%) than Factor 2 (23.0%). As with the fragment level, vegetation factors were ordinated by fragment size and tick infection rates (Figure 14). The rel ationships are very similar to those found at the fragment level; however, as is expected a gr eater amount of variation was found at the smaller scale. Factor 1 has a greater influence on delineating dif ferences in tick infection rates. Therefore, Factor 1 was regressed against tick infe ction rates from all three seasons. Adult density of infected adults had a significant relationship with Factor 1 (Figure 15); however the R 2 value was very low. 34 Figure 10: Factor loadings plot for PCA at the site level.

Vegetation variables and infection rates Although the Density of Infected Ticks (DIN and DIA ) did not have a significant relationship with small mammal species richness or small mammal species abundances, both were significantly related to several measurem ents of vegetation structure and composition. These relationships vary across sca les for nymphal and adult ticks. At the quadrant level, DIN (spring 2002) was significantly related to litter depth and layers of vegetation (Figures 16, 17), while DIA (fall 2002) was significantly related to canopy cover and understory cover (Figures 18, 19). At th e fragment level, DIN (spring 2002) was significantly related to the presence of conife rs as a dominant tree in the fragment (Figure 20) while DIA (fall 2002) were related to p ercent of canopy cover (Figure 21). 39 Spring 2002 DIN was positively related to litter de pth (at quadrant level) and presence of conifers as dominant vegetation (at site level) and negatively related to layers of vegetation (quadrant).

A significant negative relation ship value was found between the density of infected nymphs from spring 2002 and the amount of surrounding commercial/residential land, but with a low R 2 (Figure 22).

Discussion The nymphal infection rates within the Albany Pine Bush (22 and 23%) are comparable to those found in the Northeastern United States. Schwartz et al (1997) found 26% nymphal infection rates while des Vignes et al (200 0) suggest that a range of 15-30% is common for the Northeastern United States. Further , it appears that this overall rate may hold relatively constant over several years. Staff from the New York State Department of Health (White, unpublished data) found approximate 25% nymphal infection and 50% adult infection rate from samples collected in 2000 at different sites in the Albany Pine Bush, similar to my results of 22 and 23% for nymph s and 56% for adults. It is important to note that although overall infection r ates are similar, there is tremendous fluctuation in infection rates on a smaller scale a nd it is at this scale that my data appears to explain more of the variation. 4.1. Small mammal species-area relationship The positive small mammal species-area relationship for the 21 fragments in the Albany Pine Bush ecosystem supports the first assumption o f the dilution hypothesis. Therefore, although these fragments are not as isolated as oce anic islands (MacArthur and Wilson 1967), they still correspond to an archipelago of s mall mammal habitat islands, with a positive species-area correlation. Thus, larger fr agments contain a greater diversity of host species for ticks. This relationship is most obvious in smaller fragments (<10 ha), with little relationship obvious for larger fragmen ts. This relationship might have been stronger if not for the presence of species that do well in residential areas, which are in smaller fragments (e.g., flying squirrels) (DeWan, 2002). Thus, while there was a 45 significant species-area relationship in this subur ban area, it was not as strong as found in rural sites where only Peromyscus survived in the smallest fragments (Rosenblatt, 19 99). The second assumption, that Peromyscus are present in all fragments, was also met. Thus, the most competent Lyme disease reservoir is found in fragments of all sizes. If the B. burgdorferi bacteria and I. scapularis are also present within the fragment, it is likely that there is an active transmission cycle. The third assumption is that relative abundances of small mammals other than Peromyscus would also decrease as the size of the fragment de creased. My results do not support this assumption, in fact, they suggest the opposite to be true; larger fragments tended to have higher relative densities of Peromyscus while relative abundance of other small mammal species decreased with area. In other words, higher species richness did not lead to a lower probability of encountering Peromyscus in my study. Other studies have also found Peromyscus at very high densities in sites less than 2 ha in s ize (Krohne and Hoch, 1999; Nupp and Swihart, 1996), which is a lso in direct contrast to my results. My results may differ from these studies because th eir studies were completed in rural fragments while mine was completed in suburban frag ments. In this study, these suburban habitats produce habitat that are suitable for not only Peromyscus , but also a number of other small mammals such as grey squirrel s that tend to thrive in suburban habitat. 46 Only small mammals were examined in this study and the relative abundances of white- tailed deer, predators, such as coyotes ( were not factored into this study. Although each of these species could a ct as alternative hosts, they occur in very low densities, except for white-tailed deer, a nd therefore have limited abilities to act as \"dilution\" agents (LoGiudice et al, 2003). White -tailed deer play an important role the transmission cycle of Lyme disease that was not exa mined in this study. The density of white-tailed deer, the preferred host of adult deer ticks (Wilson et al, 1988), has been found to be positively related to the adult tick de nsities (Rand et al, 2003). 4.2. Deer tick infection rates and richness of small mammals Theoretically, the dilution hypothesis predicts tha t the density of infected nymphs and density of infected adults increases as the small m ammal species richness declines however, no field studies have attempted examine th is aspect of the dilution hypothesis. This prediction was not supported by my data; I fou nd no relationships between richness and the density of infected adults or nymphs at eit her scale of analysis. This suggests that factors other than small mammals may play a larger role in determining tick densities and infection rates. For example, larval and nymphal bu rdens may depend less on host densities than physical habitat features such as he rbaceous and woody vegetation (Adler et al, 1992). 4.3. Infected tick densities and vegetation variables Fragment size may affect several variables includin g vegetation structure and composition. The native Pine Bush vegetation, char acteristic of the larger fragments, has 47 an open canopy with large trees interspersed in a m atrix of shrubs and herbaceous vegetation. Smaller fragments tend to support deci duous tree species typical of the Northeastern USA that have invaded in absence of fi res, and which create a closed canopy with less dense understory. It is interestin g that these smallest fragments support relatively low densities of both Peromyscus and ticks. Several measures of vegetation were significantly c orrelated with densities of infected ticks; although it appears that the nymphs and adul ts vary in their responses to these variables according to their natural history. Nymp hal infection rates were more correlated with factors such as litter depth and pr esence of conifers as dominant trees, while adult rates were only correlated with percent of canopy coverage. Adler et al (1992) also found larval and nymphal deer tick burd ens on Peromyscus to be attributed to the structure of the vegetation in the habitat. It is also important to note that more relationship s between infection rates and vegetation variables were found at the quadrant-level than wer e found at the site level. At the quadrant level, relationships were found between ti ck B. burgdorferi infections and understory cover, canopy cover, litter depth and la yers of vegetation while, at the site level, only canopy cover and type of tree canopy we re related to tick infection rates. Fine- scale variables may be better predictors of deer ti ck densities and infection rates as they may have a more direct impact on deer ticks and the ir hosts. Litter depth is important to the life cycle of the tick because throughout their lives they return to the litter to molt into the next life sta ge or to overwinter, therefore it is not surprising that deep leaf litter increases nymphal tick density. Canopy cover may 48 increase the density of infected adults by helping to maintain a high relative humidity. Sonenshine (1991) found that deer ticks select micr ohabitats with the least temperature fluctuations and the highest relative humidity. Ho wever, the relationship between conifers and density of infected nymphs is harder t o explain; with no obvious connections to their natural history, I suspect this is related to some other factor that I did not measure. 4.4. Tick infection rates and landscape-level variables A number of studies have used spatial analysis to s tudy large-scale influences on deer tick distribution and abundance (Bunnell et al, 200 3; Kitron et al, 1991) as well as to predict Lyme disease risk (Glass et al, 1995). In t hese studies, variables such as distance to water, distance to forest edge, and soil type we re found to be good indicators of tick abundances. However, none of these studies have exa mined spatial variables in the context of B. burgdorferi infection rates. In this study, landscape-level variables appeared t o play a limited role in shaping the interactions that influence tick infection rates. T here was a slight negative relationship between the density of infected nymphs (spring 2002 ) and the proportion of combined commercial and residential area surrounding the sit e. However, this relationship has a low R 2 value and does not hold up in the fall of 2002 or the spring of 2003. Furthermore, this relationship was probably the result of an ind irect effect caused by the vegetation structure changes that are brought about by fragmen ting the natural landscape. For example, increasing residential and commercial land -use is related to an increase 49 percentage of canopy cover in the Albany Pine Bush (Figure 23), which, in turn, was related to adult tick infection rates (Figure 18, 2 1) . 4.5. Conclusions Although some of the assumptions of the dilution hy pothesis were supported, the dilution hypothesis is not an adequate predictor of deer tic k infection rates in the Albany Pine Bush. There were Peromyscus present in all fragments, and there was a greater diversity of small mammals in larger fragments. However, the Peromyscus were not present in greater abundances than other small mammals in larg e fragments and the deer tick B. burgdorferi infection rates were not related to fragment size o r small mammal diversity. Instead, small-scale vegetation variables such as c anopy cover, dominant tree type and litter type appear to be affecting the density of i nfected ticks. However, these did not explain a large amount of the variance, suggesting that there are additional factors determining infection rate and they may be somewhat complex (Figure 24). As with many other so-called emergent diseases, Lym e disease is associated with land- use change. Land-use change also impacts vegetatio n variables and therefore should also be a priority basic understanding of the ecological background of Lyme disease. 50 Habitat Fragmentation (Patch Size) Decline in Host Species Diversity Greater Proportion of Competent Hosts Increase Tick Infection Rates Tick Habitat Carnivores Structure of Vegetation Host Species Composition Tick Density Tick Dispersal Figure 24: Proposed flow chart outlining the inter actions that may be influencing deer tick infection rates in the Albany Pine Bush. Research and management of infectious diseases has begun to include ecological perspectives, such as the framework for my study. However, public health research is strongly driven by political considerations. For e xample, the study of Lyme disease takes place in the context of numerous policies and proce dures at both the state and federal levels. In the next chapter, I examine some of the relationships between science and public policy in the context of vector-borne diseas es . 51 Chapter 2: Review of Vector-borne Disease Policies 1. Introduction Vector-borne diseases, which are diseases transmitt ed to animals and humans by blood- feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes and ticks (CD C), have played a large role in the history of the United States and the World. The ro le became apparent in 1877 when it was discovered that mosquitoes transmit filariasis to humans. Greater concern arose when it was found that malaria, yellow fever and de ngue fever were also transmitted in this way (Gubler, 1998). Millions of humans have d ied as a result of these and other vector-borne diseases. Unfortunately, these discov eries were followed by the realization that other insects could transmit diseases. The dis covery of each disease and its carriers occurred independently, and as a result policies of ten focused on the disease of the day. Policies were reactive and often included such meth ods as quarantines and reporting of infections to responsible public health agencies af ter the fact (Plotkin et al, 1997). Today the list of vector-borne diseases has expande d to include ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, Lyme disease, West Nile virus and many more. Human efforts to control these diseases have had a tremendous impact on the number of death s that occur each year. In addition, many of the diseases that were thought to be those of the past are reemerging as threats. As a result, policies to address vector-borne disea se are becoming more and more important, with a growing need for research into th e factors that have led to the emergence or reemergence of these diseases so that their spread can be prevented. Past policies have been reactive and not proactive; they focus on how to handle a patient once 52 they have acquired a disease and not on finding the source of the disease and determining how to reduce the likelihood of contraction. This chapter will begin by defining vector-borne di seases and explaining why they are important. This will be followed by a review of the criticisms of policies that have arisen over the years. Then I will then give an overview o f current policies on vector-borne diseases in New York State and at the federal level . Each will be reviewed to examine their effectiveness in dealing with vector-borne di seases and to determine if they are addressing past deficiencies. The chapter will con clude with a look to the future and suggestions of ways to improve policies. The major focus of this analysis will be to determine if vector-borne diseases are being addres sed better at the state level (using New York State as an example) or at the federal lev el. 1.1. Vector-Borne diseases Vector-borne diseases are transmitted to humans fr om blood-feeding arthropods such as ticks and mosquitoes. For example, when a tick feed s on a human, the tick can transfer the Lyme disease causing bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi , to the human. Many other diseases such as West Nile Virus, Rocky Mountain sp otted fever, and the Plague are transmitted to humans in similar way (Table VI). Vector-borne diseases have proven to be of great co ncern to human health throughout history and in the present day. Vector-borne diseas es have caused a tremendous number of deaths; the plague alone is responsible for the death of between one-half and one-third of the human population in Europe in the 14 th to 16 th centuries. The plague, although no 53 longer prevalent, is still present throughout the w orld with 1000-3000 cases reported each year (Keeling and Gilligan, 2000). Recently, Lyme d isease has become the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, with 12, 500 cases reported from 1993 to 1997 (NRC, 2000). Table VI: Selected vector-borne diseases and their vectors (NIAID, 2002) Mosquitoes Ticks Fleas Malaria Babesiosis Plague Dengue Fever Ehrlichiosis West Nile Fever Lyme Disease Viral Encephalitis Relapsing Fever Colorado Tick Fever Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever The fact that diseases could be transmitted to huma ns from insects was discovered in 1877 and since this discovery humans have dealt wit h these diseases in many ways. Some of the diseases have been controlled for short periods of time. For example, between 1954 and 1975 malaria was controlled in the Americas and yellow fever was controlled in Western Africa between 1950 and 1970 (Gubler, 1998). Although some of these diseases have been held in check for a number of years they are still of concern. Across the world some of the diseases that humans h ave controlled are reemerging and there are also a number of newly emerging diseases that are threats to human populations. 54 For example, the plague was reduced to a mere 200 c ases per year worldwide but has recently increased to nearly 3000 cases per year in 1998, most of which are in Africa (Gubler, 1998). Scientists and researchers have done a great deal o f research to determine why diseases of the past are reemerging and new diseases are spring ing up. One factor examined is the impact of human alteration of ecosystems on the tra nsmission of vector-borne diseases. For example, Gubler found that a large number of di seases are associated with urbanization, deforestation and agricultural practi ces (Table VII). The Center for Disease Control suggests that incursion into rural areas fo r residential building, land-clearing, dam building, and related activities, which bring h umans into closer contact with vectors, may also have an impact on disease transmission (CD C, 2001). Further, there are beliefs that non-human influences such as the meteorologica l phenomenon of El Nin /uniF01Bo and La Nin /uniF01Ba can play a role in the resurgence or emergence of diseases (Stevens, 1998). Another emerging concern is the threat of global warming an d the potential impacts it may be have on the dispersal of vectors. Global warming could shift the geographic range of disease vectors, increase their reproduction rates or even shorten incubation periods of pathogens (Patz et al., 1996). 55 Table VII. Emergent/Resurgent vector-borne disease s related to changing land-use (Gubler, 1998).

How do they addr ess such diseases? Are the policies governing vector-borne diseases still reactive or h ave they become more proactive? Have the policies adapted to deal with these new threats ? If not, how can they be adapted to deal with a changing disease environment? 56 2. Criticisms of Policy Approaches to Vector-Borne Dis eases In the past, public policies on vector-borne diseas es were successful in eliminating the threat of major infectious diseases such as the pla gue or polio. As a result of their effectiveness, these policies have drawn little cri ticism. However, a number of recent criticisms of United States policy on infectious di seases have arisen because past successes have led to a decline in focus on infecti ous diseases. Further, science continues to shed light on the causes and transmission of dis eases as well as the impacts of methods employed in their control. For example, the publica tion of Silent Spring , by Rachel Carson, in the 1962 made people more aware of the t hreats of the excessive use of insecticides, which were often employed as a primar y means of eliminating disease vectors. Carson explained that using these insectic ides could have major impacts on the health of wildlife and humans and that the prolific use of insecticides could increase the resistance of mosquitoes. Science has also made man y strides in identifying the factors that influence disease transmission, but policies h ave not been able to incorporate all of the complexities of these discoveries. 2.1. Historic Outcomes Health officials in the United States have been suc cessful in decreasing the threat of infectious diseases within the past century (see Fi gure 19). However, improved diagnosis and treatment have led to complacency in the form o f neglect of vaccinations, abuse and overuse of antibiotics, and the deterioration of pu blic health infrastructure (Lederberg, 1996). For example, the continuous, improper use of antibiotics only acts to kill the weaker bacteria strains while allowing hardy strain s to flourish (Morse, 1995). Further, 57 the long-term declines in infectious diseases have influenced recent public health policy decisions to reduce resources for surveillance, pre vention and control of vector-borne diseases (Gubler, 1998). Many feel that this compl acency and concurrent decrease in resources has led to the increase in death rates fr om infectious diseases over the last 10- 20 years. From 1980 to 1992 alone, the increase wa s 58% (Figure 25), and we see a renewed interest in efforts to understand infectiou s diseases. With respect to managing vectors, there are also co ncerns that too much focus has been put on the use of insecticides and larvicides. Spi elman points out that this emphasis on chemically treating vectors could make humans more vulnerable to outbreaks due to the fact that insects become immune to insecticides, wh ereas human immunity to the vector- borne diseases decreases without exposure (1999). I f vectors become resistant to pesticides, the possibilities for dealing with outb reaks are greatly reduced. As a result, there will be a continuous need to create new insec ticides and new concerns about how these sprays may influence human health. The quest ion then becomes will we be able to keep up with the evolution of mosquitoes, ticks and other vectors? Many of the programs to deal with infection have fo cused on eradicating diseases completely in the United States. Some argue that t his approach requires overly extensive, costly and often invasive tactics. For example, wo rldwide efforts to eradicate malaria called for the application of residual insecticide in at least 80% of homes two to three times a year (Spielman et al, 1993). This type of approach is costly and there are also concerns over the impact of these insecticides on h uman health. Porter et al., also point 58 out that this type of short-term approach drives po licies to deal with a specific problem instead of allowing for the creation of a more comp rehensive approach (1999). In other words, more emphasis needs to be placed on the syst em that handles infectious diseases than on individual outbreaks. Figure 25. Trends in deaths caused by infectious di seases in the US 1900-1904 (from CDC \"Preventing Emerging Infectious Diseases: A Str ategy for the 21 st Century\"). 2.2. Need for a comprehensive approach A more comprehensive approach to infectious disease s would focus more on a health outcome approach (Porter et al, 1999)). Under a h ealth outcomes approach, the likely outcomes of control are considered and are then cle arly linked with planning and evaluation measures. For example, when outbreaks oc cur politicians find money to deal with the situation and health personnel handle the outbreak and then it is forgotten about. Instead, a health outcome approach would examine th e outbreak, how it was managed, 59 what were the health outcomes and how can the syste m be improved (Plant and Rushworth, 1997). If a comprehensive program for dealing with infecti ous diseases were in place, there would be fewer problems such as the fragmented syst em for allocating grant money and other funding (Porter et al, 1999). Today, researc hers seeking funding to deal with a specific disease must face competition from other r esearchers that may be working on a different disease. As a result, the \"disease of th e day\" may get more attention or funding than one that has been a persistent problem. For e xample, in the past two years, the reemergence of the West Nile Virus has brought a lo t of attention throughout the country. The US Senate even introduced a bill (S.3105) to gi ve funding to states and communities to create mosquito control programs aimed at only t he vector of West Nile Virus. As a result, funds are diverted from here to there depen ding on what disease is currently on the agenda, and does not allow for an \"integrated, long -term agenda for population health\" (Porter et al, 1999). 2.3. Coordination of efforts There is also a need for a greater coordination of efforts between groups from different scientific fields. Vectors, hosts, bacteria and v iruses have highly complicated interactions with one another as well as their phys ical environment. In order to get a grasp on these complex interactions and translate t hem into effective policy, it is important to bring together individuals from a numb er of fields, and groups that do not normally coordinate their efforts must be brought t ogether to coordinate information and data collected (Epstein, 1995 and Reid, 1995). Pote ntial participants include chemists, 60 biologists, geologists, meteorologists, physicians, physicists, economists, engineers, attorneys, planners, epidemiologists, sociologists, biostatisticians, public administrators and many more (Davis et al, 1993). However, the coo rdination of groups on this scale is not likely to happen without some sort of intervent ion or leadership from a stable, well- defined entity with access to the needed resources. In the meantime, there must be an effort to make po licies that create a forum for discussion and sharing of data and resources. For example, the Centers for Disease Control already have substantial resources and woul d be a logical group to organize such a system of cooperation. CDC has worked to harbor communication by publishing Emerging Infectious Diseases , a peer-reviewed journal. The journal allows a lar ge number of individuals from varying fields to keep u p to date on current research and also offers researchers a forum for communication. Anot her possible way to bring together a number of individuals from varying backgrounds is t o partner agencies with academia. Such a partnership would benefit both practitioners and academics, as it would offer academics insight into the applied research that wo uld enhance the quality of professional education (Davis et al, 1993). 2.4. Understanding the complexity of interactions One of the most widespread criticisms regarding vec tor-borne disease policies is that they do not consider the wide range of factors that that can play a role in the transmission of diseases. Success in controlling or eliminating en vironmentally mediated infectious diseases often depends on the ability to understand the environmental variables that influence the transmission of the disease (Spielman , 1999). Vector-borne diseases are 61 transmitted by organisms that are much smaller than humans and therefore small-scale, microclimatic variables can have an influence on th e life cycle of the insects and in turn their ability to transmit diseases. Further, anoth er set of variables that deal with reservoirs species, which are species that carry th e diseases and transmit them to insects, must be considered. In other words, a large number of interactions lead to the transmission of diseases, so a tremendous number of variables must be considered when trying to pin down the key factors in an outbreak. Skilled individuals from a number of fields are nec essary to thoroughly examine the complexities of such interactions, so agencies need to recruit and retain professionals with the skills needed to understand these cross-di sciplinary complexities (Davis et al, 1993). Unfortunately, the lack of qualified person nel is one of the major concerns in controlling infectious diseases. For example, in t he field of epidemiology there are very few experts and they are mostly older individuals ( Morse, 1995). As a result, it is imperative that new staffs are trained and given ha nds-on experience in dealing with vector-borne diseases and infections. There are also broad-scale variables that must be c onsidered because they influence small-scale variables. Most of these large-scale v ariables result from human influences, which most often result in increasing prevalence of particular diseases or by reducing immune defenses against the diseases (Reid, 1995). For example, emerging infections often arise in areas undergoing ecological or demog raphic change (Epstein, 1995). In Honduras, a group of individuals with little immuni ty to malaria migrated to an area 62 where infected mosquitoes were present. In this po pulation the incidence of malaria increased from 20,000-90,000 between 1987 and 1993 (Reid, 1995). Urbanization, deforestation and agricultural practices can also p lay a role in the transmission of infectious diseases. There has also been great con cern that climate change could be influencing the transmission of disease; some model s suggest that warmer temperatures could cause the migration of malaria and dengue fev er carrying mosquitoes from Central America to the United States (Reid, 1995). Most policies do not consider these large-scale imp acts on disease transmission; however the impacts they can have on transmission points to a need for their consideration. One example, of a possible way to include these issues is exemplified in Agenda 21 of the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. The Agenda points out that health issues should be included in sustainable planning development (von Schirnding, 2 002). It also calls for cooperative planning by government, non-governmental organizati ons, and local communities, which would allow health authorities to effect planning a t national levels. Similar steps must be taken at all levels in order to deal with large-sca le, indirect influences on infectious diseases. 3. Current policies and agencies Currently, a number of policies address vector-born e diseases at both the state and federal levels. However, none of the policies were specifi cally created to deal with vector-borne diseases, which are considered under the policies t hat were created to handle the broader categories of infectious or communicable diseases . These policies have grown out of the fragmented history of vector-borne diseases, wh ich includes the discovery of new 63 diseases, methods for handling them and the creatio n of new agencies and groups to with specialties in these areas. 3.1. New York State policy on vector-borne diseases Since the early 1800's, New York State has created policies and an agency structure to deal with infectious diseases and more specifically vector-borne diseases. Most of the policies that were created focused on preventing th e spread and transmission of diseases once they have been diagnosed. For example, many of these policies regulate physicians and hospitals, how they deal with infections in the ir facilities, and how they report them. Although, these policies seem very specific and foc used on very specific goals they do offer insight into the State's efforts. 3.1.1. New York State Department of Health The New York State Department of Health, which was created by Article 2 of New York State Public Health Law, is the primary agency resp onsible for the control of disease (NY CLS Pub Health 201, 2002). According to this policy, the primary responsibilities of the Department are to supervise the reporting and c ontrol of disease, promote education and control of disease, conduct laboratory examinat ions for the diagnosis and control of disease, and most notably they must also \"develop p rograms for the control of ticks, insects and arthropods which act as vectors of dise ase affecting man.\" The last requirement states that the Department of Health is held responsible for dealing with vector-borne diseases and their control. However, the focus is on control of insects and arthropods, which are the vectors, and not specific ally upon the disease agents. This gives some insight into the Department's initial at titude towards vector-borne diseases. 64 3.1.2. NYCRR Title 10 NYCRR Title 10 is a Public Health Policy that cover s the reporting and handling of communicable diseases. The first issue that it cov ers is the requirements of physicians in regards to reporting of cases and keeping of record s. Section 2.10 states that every physician must report the name, age and address of all persons confirmed or suspected of having communicable disease to a health officer wit hin 24 hours. Further, they must report any outbreak or any unusual disease outbreak to the NYS Department of Health. Reports may be made by phone, fax or email but shou ld also be put in writing. There is a specific list of the diseases that physicians are r equired to report (Appendix A) and of the 63 diseases listed 11 (17%) of them are vector-born e diseases (Table VIII). Title 10, section 2.5 also requires that specimens be sent to laboratories for examination if a patient is suspected of having a specific set of di seases (see Appendix B). Out of this list of 47 diseases, 9 (19%) are considered to be vector -borne diseases. Therefore, although vector-borne diseases are not a direct focus of pol icy they account for a large number of the diseases of concern. Table VIII. Reportable vector-borne diseases in New York State. Babesiosis Lyme Disease Rocky Mtn. Spotted Fever Tu laremia Ehrlichiosis Malaria Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Yello w Fever Encephalitis Plague Typhoid Under section 2.27, physicians must ensure that peo ple with highly communicable diseases are isolated from others. Further, it is their obligation to give instructions 65 regarding the prevention of disease and advise othe r members of precautions that must be taken. Also, the person attending to the patient m ust be given instructions on how to properly dispose of any secretions or excretions th at may cause the transmission of the disease. Title 10 also offers regulations on the movement of patients with highly infectious diseases. Section 2.33 states that a person with a highly communicable disease cannot be transported from one district to another without th e proper approval from health officials in the district the patient will be moved to and th e district where they will be moved from. However, such approval is not necessary if they are just being moved from one hospital to another for treatment purposes. The next major set of regulations under Title 10 (S ection 405.11) deals with hospitals and how they should handle or prevent possible outbreak s of communicable diseases. The policy states that hospitals should maintain a sani tary environment to prevent the transmission of deadly diseases to staff or patient s. Further, the hospital should create a hospital-wide program led by a professional to \"pre vent, control, investigate and report any infections.\" The program should include the co llection of data on the diagnosis of individuals with nosocomial infections (those obtai ned while in the hospital) and communicable diseases. Each hospital must also hav e written policies, which are integrated with their quality assurance program, ou tlining how they will report and investigate communicable diseases acquired within o r outside the hospital. Further, if problems are a found upon review the corrective act ion is required by the hospital. 66 Finally, section 83.16 deals with infection control within shared health facilities. For example, shared facilities are required to provide disposable covers for exam tables and dental chair head rests. The covers must be change d after each patient is examined. However, if infectious diseases are diagnosed or su spected physicians within these shared health facilities are also required to report to th eir health officer and the Department of Health. Each of these policies focuses on what to do after an individual has contracted disease. Although these are highly necessary policies they a re all reactive; they do not proactively attempt to find the underlying causes of the diseas es themselves nor do they attempt to find ways to prevent human contact with them outsid e of hospitals. They do not consider any surveillance, education or research on infectio us diseases. In the United States the task of surveillance and c ontrol rests with each state and the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) has taken responsibility these tasks. The Department conducts research, sampling, surveillanc e, and is responsible for educating the public on infectious diseases. Because the res ponsibility lies with the state, attention given to infectious disease varies according to loc al needs and resources (Morse, 1995). In many cases the NYSDOH has inadequate funding, an d even promised funding is often late in arriving. Therefore, unless they can secure outside funding from agencies such as the National Institute of Health and the National S cience Foundation they may have to rely on outdated equipment and limited staff. For example, in NYS there are only 4 67 individuals responsible for the collection and surv eillance of tick populations across New York State (personal observation). As a result, th ey must travel great distances and can maintain only a small number of study sites across the state. They are also responsible for the tick identification service and they receiv e thousands of samples per year from doctors or individuals. In order to maintain a stro ng surveillance program that examines outbreaks as they occur and rapidly assesses health outcomes, a larger number of individuals and funding must be involved. Efforts must be made to create policies that addres s the lack of manpower available to states. Although there is no magic number of indiv iduals that would make surveillance adequate, considerations of manpower must be taken into account when creating policies. If responsibilities are increased so should the num ber of individuals and the funding available to the states to hire these individuals. The United Health Foundation has ranked New York St ate very low in disease prevention. The Foundation does an annual ranking of each state based on percentage of residents dying from a number of causes such as inf ectious diseases, heart disease or cancer, infant mortality and traffic and occupation al fatalities (Smith, 2002). New York State ranks 32 nd out of 50 states overall, but in the category of i nfectious diseases New York is ranked 50 th with 70.9 deaths per 100,000 individuals. This i s obviously a cause for concern. 68 Although New York State does have a number of polic ies in place to deal with vector- borne diseases, most of these policies focus on wha t to do once an individual has already contracted a disease. Prevention of the spread of disease is covered thoroughly but there is very little mention of how to prevent diseases f rom arising in the first place. The Department of Health does attempt to deal with this type of issue but, from my experience, they appear to be understaffed and ofte n dependent upon major grants for their funding. These sources of funding are not c onsistent; they fluctuate according to the disease of greatest concern at the time. As a result, sustained long-term studies are often not completed. This could later diminish the State's ability to deal with diseases that re-emerge. 4. National policies and agencies 4.1. Centers for Disease Control On the national level the primary agency responsibl e for dealing with infectious diseases is the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC w as originally created as the MCWA (Malaria Control in War Areas) during World War II. The program was a part of the Public Health Service and its primary goal was to a ssist with the threat of malaria to the war effort and they mainly focused on areas around military bases and industrial plants essential for the war efforts. The group brought together doctors, engineers and entomologists to assess malaria threats. However, the primary focus of this program was on the control of mosquitoes by drainage projects a nd the uses of larvicides and insecticides such as Paris Green, diesel oil, and D DT. The group's responsibilities were expanded to include yellow fever, dengue fever and typhoid. However, as the war began to near its conclusion the group tried to find ways in which the group could continue 69 operations after the war. As a result, it created a center that would allow the staff to use their acquired expertise to eliminate communicable diseases across the country. Thus, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) was born and b egan operations on July 1, 1946 (Parascandola, 1996). Today, the Center for Disease Control has continued to expand its focus since its creation. The current mission of the CDC is to \"promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and dis ability\" (CDC Website, 2002). The group seeks to attain this goal through: monitoring health, detecting and investigate h ealth problems, conducting research to enhance prevention, develop and advocate sound public health policies, implement prevention strategies, promote healthy behavio rs, foster safe and healthful environments, and provide leadership and train ing. Unlike many policies this mission supports a much m ore proactive approach to dealing with diseases. Instead of just determining what to do once a person has contracted a disease the CDC focused on prevention, teaching peo ple how avoid contact with a disease, and conducting research and education for prevention. This is a great stepping- stone for policies that are more proactive. The Centers for Disease Control has 12 centers that deal with different Centers each focusing on different aspects of human health. The Center that is of greatest importance to the vector-borne diseases discussion is the Nati onal Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID) as its main focus is on the \"prevention of i llness, disability, and death caused by infectious diseases in the United States and around the world\" (NCID Website, 2002). The NCID is further divided in to a number of divis ions including one that specifically 70 focuses on vector-borne diseases. The Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (DVBID) was established in Lagan, Utah in the 1950' s to deal with arboviral encephalitis. However, at the time it was consider ed the Disease Ecology Section of the CDC and it was not until 1989 that the Division was given its current name. The name was changed to reflect the broadened responsibiliti es of the Division, which now included the plague, Lyme disease and other zoonoti c bacterial infections (CDC Website, 2002). Following the overall goals of the CDC, the Divisio n of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (DVBID) attempts to focus on all aspects o f vector-borne diseases including diagnosis, prevention, and education. The DVBID's mission focuses on surveillance, research, defining etiology, ecology & pathogenesis (to help with diagnosis, surveillance, prevention and control), diagnostic reference and e pidemiological consultation and finally the provision of technical expertise. The NCID recently published a new strategy for deal ing with infectious diseases entitled \"Preventing Emerging Infectious Diseases: A Strate gy for the 21 st Century.\" This plan focuses on the nine specific infectious disease pro blems as well as groups of people who are most at risk. One of the categories of focus i s vector-borne and zoonotic disease. This is an important step as the CDC recognizes the threat presented by these diseases. They outline an approach to dealing with these thre ats and the major components of their plan include surveillance and response, applied res earch, infrastructure and training, and prevention and control. 71 The Center for Disease Control also has a Division of Public Health Surveillance, which plays a key role in the tracking of diseases. This division is responsible for publishing the weekly Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report an d they offer an annual report entitled Summary of Notifiable Diseases, United Sta tes. These reports offer information on the number of cases and deaths that result from the diseases listed on the Nationally Notifiable Diseases List (See Appendix C). Data ar e compiled from those collected by individual states. However, the states are not man dated to report this information; states are the only government bodies that currently manda te the reporting of diseases. States create their own lists, which are often based on th e Nationally Notifiable Diseases List (DPHSI Website, 2003). Since its creation the Center for Disease Control h as focused on vector-borne diseases. As a result, it has emerged as an authority on deal ing with such diseases. The CDC originally combined the efforts of individuals from a number of fields, and it continues to enlist this type of coordinated efforts. 4.2. National Institutes of Health The National Institutes of Health also holds some r esponsibility for studying and addressing infectious diseases. The primary goal o f the NIH is to \"uncover knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone\" The a ttempt to attain this goal through conducting their own research, funding and supporti ng research by others, fostering communication of medical information and training o f researchers (NIH website, 2003). The NIH consists of 27 different institutes, each o f which focuses on a different aspect of 72 human health. The National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and more specifically the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), are of importance to vector-borne diseases studies. The D MID conduct their own research and fund research in the area of emerging infectious di seases and drug development. As a result, this group plays a major role in the field of research and the group could be instrumental in providing decision makers with the scientific information needed to create informed policy. 4.3. Executive orders and national policies In 1996, White House adopted new national public he alth policy to deal with emerging and reemerging infectious diseases (Lederberg, 1996 ). The policy was named NSTC-7 after the National Science and Technology Council ( NSTC) whose reports the policy was based on. In NSTC-7 it is stated that the current international system of surveillance, prevention of infectious diseases is inadequate and in need of improvement in surveillance, prevention and response capabilities. The policy attempts to integrate the work of the CDC and the NIH to provide funding or s upport to improve lab capabilities for detection and response, training for healthcare providers and researchers. The policy also enlists the assistance or cooperation of the D epartment of Defense, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the National Securit y Council, Office of Science and Technology Policy. The benefits of this policy are evident in that it recognizes the current shortcomings of policies and infrastructure and the need for coordi nation in dealing with infectious disease. This policy creates a level of coordinatio n between agencies that not present and 73 attempts to maintain this coordination through the creation of a standing task force. The Task Force of the National Science and Technology C ouncil was established to provide continued strategic planning and coordination on is sues involving infectious diseases. More recently, President Clinton signed the Public Health Threats and Emergency Act of 2000 (42 USCS 247d). This policy set up a process to create new standards for state and local health departments to determine how well they are measuring up. The Act also authorizes funding for improvements in training, el ectronic information networks, emergency response and laboratory capacity (Boulard , 2001). This act recognizes the fact that many state and local health departments d o not have the capabilities to deal with the demanding responsibilities of dealing with infe ctious diseases and offers ways for them to improve. The Act authorized a total of the $500 million in funding for fiscal year 2001 and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal y ears 2002-2006. This Act is important as it presents a longer-term (5-year) com mitment to dealing with infectious diseases. Further, it does not focus on a specific disease but instead in focuses on building capacity and ability to research and respo nd to infectious disease concerns. The federal government appears to have a more stabl e means of dealing with vector- borne diseases. The CDC has a large organizational structure and more funding for their Centers, which are each focused on a different aspe ct of human health, including a division focused solely on vector-borne diseases. As a result, they possess the means to maintain focused studies and surveillance on a rang e of vector-borne diseases on an on- going basis. For example, the DVBID was created in the 1950's their continued 74 existence enables the continuous study of vector-bo rne diseases. New York State has a similar department however, the there are a limited number of employees and additional employees focused on research are often hired throu gh grants and contracts. For example, the primary lab responsible for testing sa mples for West Nile virus in New York State maintains only 4 NYSDOH employees and ap proximately 30 contract or grant-funded employees that focus on research and s urveillance efforts. Funding the majority of research efforts with funds that are no t guaranteed and are focused on the disease of the day may lead to instability and hind ers the ability to maintain long-term studies. 5. Discussion There are a wide range of policies and agencies tha t have some responsibility for dealing with vector-borne diseases, and there has been a gr eat deal of fragmentation of efforts in dealing with these diseases. However, in recent ye ars, the emergence of new diseases and reemergence of old ones has forced policy maker s to look more critically at their approach to these diseases. There have been concer ted efforts to create a more coordinated, long-term approach to controlling dise ases but there are still a number of things that could be improved upon in the policy ar ena. These include continuing to change the focus of policies from individual diseas es to the infectious diseases as a whole and from a reactive approach to a more proactive ap proach. Further, more focus could be placed on coordinating groups of varying background s and competencies to deal with the complex interactions that influence vector-borne di seases. 75 Groups such as the CDC and the NIH have begun to ta ke a more proactive approach through new initiatives and the funding of scientif ic research. For example, there seems to be move away from the focus on the use of insect icides and towards a more ecologically sound approach. This is evident in th e approach suggested in the Senate bill 3105, which offers funds to help states create mosq uito control programs. The bill calls for a greater focus on surveillance, education, pub lic outreach, laboratory support, and community-based control plans in the creation of We st Nile Virus control plans. This bill also calls for coordination with the Centers for Di sease Control and Prevention, which has created a much more broad approach to infectiou s diseases through their new \"Plan for the 21 st Century.\" As a result, the passage of this bill c ould be a big step towards creating a more integrated approach to infectious d iseases. However, the bill is yet to pass and it is important to note that it still focuses o n an individual disease. Currently, the federal government and the Centers f or Disease Control are addressing the vector-borne diseases much more comprehensively tha n New York State. They have more sustained resources and are shifting to a heal th outcomes approach more quickly. States should work to follow the model set by the C DC. However, states will need a tremendous amount of help from the federal governme nt to change to such an approach. As a result, I believe that the Congress should wor k to create legislation to assist states in catching up. States should be required to have a p ermanent group or division that focuses only on vector-borne diseases. If all states wer e organized in a similar way it would be easier for them to communicate with one another as well as with the CDC. It would be much easier determine who is responsible for dealin g with vector-borne diseases as the 76 responsibility would not be fragmented between numb ers of groups. Further, the groups could communicate or meet with one another and the CDC to discuss their findings, discuss future research, and coordinate efforts. T his could prevent the duplication of efforts and could lead to quicker dissemination of information. In order for such a structure to be created, states need money to reorg anize, improve infrastructure and labs, and hire more qualified staff. There must be a com mitment by states and the federal government to focus on becoming organized and prepa red for any emerging or re- emerging disease. They must work together to bring together all of their knowledge and experience to work towards the same goals. In conclusion, there have been many major strides i n dealing with infectious diseases and vector-borne diseases in particular. However, the federal government and the Centers for Disease Control appear more stable and well-funded than some state Departments of Health. As a result, concerted efforts must be mad e to get states up to par; states need funding for the basics such as labs, equipment and staff. By combining the efforts of state and federal agencies the overall capacity to handle vector-borne diseases will be greatly improved. 77 Works Cited Adler, H., S.R. Telford III, M.L. Wilson, and A.
