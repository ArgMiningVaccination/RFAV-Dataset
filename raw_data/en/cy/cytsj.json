Although accounts are separately maintained for each fund in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into f und types. The following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies: A. Fund Accounting The State utilizes Fund Accounting to account for and report on its financial activities. A fund, which is established for a specific purpose in accordance with the law, is a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenues, and expenditure s or expenses. Funds are grouped into three broad categories as follows: GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS GENERAL FUND A self-balancing set of account s used to account for all financial resources except those required to be accounted for in another fund. SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS A self-balancing set of account s used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources (other than expendable trus ts) that are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts used to account for other government financial resources except those requir ed to be accounted for in the General Fund or designated as Special Revenue Funds. PROPRIETARY FUNDS ENTERPRISE FUNDS A self-balancing set of acc ounts used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprises. INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS A self-balancing set of a ccounts used to account for the financing of goods and services provided by one department to other state departments of governments. PERMANENT AND FIDUCIARY FUNDS PERMANENT FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts used to account primarily for activity related to grants made to the State fo r schools and public institutions. FIDUCIARY FUNDS A self-balancing set of accounts used to account for assets held by the State in a trustee capacity or as an agent fo r individuals, private organizations and other governments. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2010 230 Note 1. - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) B. Basis of Accounting The Annual Financial Report is prepared for funds on a cash basis of accounting in accordance with State law. Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues and ex penditures are recognized when recorded in the State's central accounting system, the Arizona Financial Informat ion System (AFIS). No allowance has been made to revenues or expenditures for unrecorded accounts receivabl e, accounts payable, defe rred revenue or any other balance sheet item. Disbursements of appropriated monies, including related operating transfers, are reported as expenditures. The audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are published annually in the State's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). C. Reporting Entity The accompanying General Fund cash basis financial st atements include transactions of the following funds and accounts: General Fund - General Operations Department of Revenue Excise and Transaction Privilege Tax Fund Department of Revenue Temporary Transaction Privilege and Use Tax Fund Disproportionate Share Fund Budget Stabilization Fund School Accountability Account (Proposition 301) D. Budgets and Appropriations Accounting The State follows these procedures in establishing the budgetary data reflected in the financial statements: 1. Annually the Governor submits to the Legislat ure a proposed operating and capital outlay budget for the fiscal year commencing the following July 1. This document includes proposed expenditures and the means of financing them. Some agency budgets are approv ed for two fiscal years at a time on a biennial cycle. 2. Public hearings are then conducted during legislative sessions. 3. Prior to July 1, the budget is enacted through passage and approval of bills containing appropriations. 4. Appropriation accounting is then employed as a management tool to monitor the appropriated monies. Typically, the commitment for continuing appropriations is r eported as a reservation of Fund Balance. However, this practice was amended for Fiscal Year 2009 (Laws 2008, Chapter 291, section 13) and for Fiscal Year 2010 (Laws 2009, Chapter 7, section 30). According to the l egislation, any continuing appropriations that remained at the end of the fiscal year were to be included in the closi ng balance as if they lapsed or reverted. See Note 3, section C for additional information about this change in accounting policy. E. Rounding Differences The information shown in the detail statements has been rounded to the nearest dollar and therefore, minor differences may be found when adding the columns down or the rows across. The rounding differences are inconsequential. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2010 231 Note 2. - Description of Financial Statements A. The accompanying financial statements include a bal ance sheet and statements of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance for the General Fund. T he comparative balance sheet for the General Fund displays additional detail in arriving at the amount for to tal assets and liabilities. The separate line items are composed of Cash With the State Treasurer (which may include cash and cash equivalents), Cash Not With the State Treasurer, and various receivable and payable items. This presentation will provide additional transparency of the financial statements and highlight the difference between Cash and Fund Balance. B. The Statement of Expenditures - Appropriation to Actual, Budgetary (Legal) Basis is presented for all appropriations. The Capital Outlay Statement of Expendi tures - Appropriation to Actual includes all capital appropriations for the General Fund and the Capital Outlay Stabilization Fund. C. Administrative Adjustments are shown as Note 9 to the financial statements. D. The General Fund is presented prominently in the A nnual Financial Report (AFR) due to its significance. The Statements of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance is presented for all other funds accounted for on the AFIS. The statements include begi nning and ending balances for the current fiscal year as well as appropriated and non-appropriated activity in each fund. See Note 5 for additional detail on these Statements. Note 3. - Statement of Expenditures - Budgetary to Actual - Description of Selected Columns A. Supplemental Appropriations and Adjustments The column titled Supplemental Appropriations, Mid-Year Reversions and Adjustments shown on the Statement of Expenditures - Appropriations to Actual includes the following: Supplemental and Special Appropriations are either the additional spending authority (appropriation) granted by the Legislature after the general appropriations act is approved or other Session Law appropriations granted by the Legislature to a State agency or departm ent for a specific program or purpose. Transfers and adjustments are the movements of m onies or spending authority between funds, departments, programs and within programs in accordanc e with the Arizona Revised Statutes. Mid-year reversions (when applicable) are the returni ng of spending authority (appropriation) originally granted to a State agency or department through the appropriation process prior to the completion of the granted spending period. B. Lapsed Appropriations In accordance with A.R.S. \u00a7 35-190, except as otherwise provided by law, all appropriations lapse after the close of the fiscal year. The unused spending authority (appropriation) which was originally granted to a State agency or department through the appropriation process expires. The te rm \"reversion\" is sometimes used in reference to these lapsed appropriations. The amount of lapsed appropriations from the General Fund for FY10 is $119,365,484 from General Operations and $26,472 from Capital Outlay. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2010 232 Note 3. - Statement of Expenditures - Budgetary to Actual - Description of Selected Columns (Continued) C. Continuing Appropriations A continuing appropriation is a spending authority that, once established, is automatica lly renewed without further legislative action, period after period, until altered or revoked. In the State of Ariz ona, continuing appropriations are primarily for construction or other pr ojects that take longer than one year to complete. Laws 2009, Chapter 7, section 30 (House Bill 2008, 3 rd Special Session) states that \"any moni es appropriated from the state general fund that are exempted from lapsing pur suant to section 35-190, Arizona Revi sed Statutes, and that remain unexpended and unencumbered at the close of fiscal year 2009-2010 s hall be included in the closing balance as if the appropriations had lapsed or otherwise reverted to the state general fund.\" Therefore, the General Fund Comparative Balance Sheet - Appropria tion (Budget) to Actual reflects no re serve for continuing appropriations at the close of the fiscal year end, but will be re-est ablished and available for expenditures as a continuing appropriation at the beginning of the next fiscal year. T he detailed Statement of Expenditures Appropriation to Actual reflects what are considered continuing appropriations in the subs equent year. This helps preserve comparability and consistency within the statements. Accordingly, the tota l General Fund reserved for continuing appropriations would have been $38,035,223 comprised of $28,093,116 from General Operations and $9,942,107 from Capital Outlay. When added to the General Fund amount restricted for the School Accountability Act, $7,379,624, the total amount of continuing appropriati ons (restricted and reserved) would have been $45,414,847. Note 4. - Other Financing Sources A. Treasurer's Warrant Notes (TWNs). A.R.S. \u00a7 35-185. 01 states that TWNs may be issued if no monies are available for payment of warrants or electronic funds transfer vouchers of the Department of Administration presented to the State Treasurer. A.R.S. \u00a7 35-185.02 addresses the procedures to be used in the issuance and redemption of TWNs. In FY10, the State Treasurer issued TWNs totaling $94,648,355,383 and the General Fund paid $3,885,751 in interest and fees on the TWNs. While the TWNs are considered General Fund, inclusion of those revenues and expenditures would distort the General Government amounts for normal operations, therefore this activity is being shown as \"Ot her Financing Sources (Uses).\" The ending FY10 Cash with the State Treasurer for t he General Fund was $39,675 (in thousands). This is different from the operating cash which is what the Stat e Treasurer uses to determine if sufficient monies are available to pay warrants. The State Treasurer may use a combination of General Fund cash, plus agency funds that are not allowed to be invested with the Stat e Treasurer, plus funds that can be invested with the State Treasurer but are not currently earning interest to determine the oper ating cash available for payments of warrants. When that combinati on no longer provides monies for obli gations, the State Treasurer begins issuing TWNs. B. Budget Stabilization Fund. A.R. S. \u00a7 35-144 established the Budget Stab ilization Fund (BSF) in 1990. The BSF is sometimes referred to as the rainy day fund. The purpose of the BSF is to normalize (over time) the fluctuations of the State's high and lo w growth rates. The amount of cash transferred to or from the BSF and the General Fund - General Operations is established by statutory formula. No operating expenditures may occur in the BSF. Interest earned on pooled investment s with the State Treasurer is the basic revenue source of the BSF. The beginning FY10 balance for the BSF was $2.767 million. The Arizona Legislature authorized the remaining balance to be transferred to the General Fund. Accordingly, the ending FY10 balance for the BSF was $0. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2010 233 Note 4. - Other Financing Sources (Continued) C. Lease Purchase Finance Agreement. The State of Arizona undertook the sale and simultaneous lease back of various state properties through the issuance of Certificates of Partici pation into the public debt market as authorized by Laws 2009, 3 rd Special Session, Chapter 6, Secti on 32. The legislation authorized net available proceeds of not more than $735,419,300 be depos ited into the State General Fund by June 30, 2010. A transfer in to the General Fund of $735,419,300 took place on J anuary 26, 2010. Subsequently, Laws 2010, 6th Special Session, Chapter 4, Section 2 authorized $300,000,000 of net available proceeds to be deposited in the State General Fund by September 30, 2010 from the sale and simultaneous lease back of additional state owned facilities. A transfer to the General Fund of $300,000,000 took place on June 30, 2010. D. Lottery Bond Proceeds. In accordance with Laws 2010, 6 th Special Session, Chapter 4, section 1, Title 5 of the Arizona Revised Statutes was amended to include chapt er 5.1. This amendment authorized the sale of the State Lottery bonds with the first $450,000,000 of pr oceeds to be deposited into the State General Fund. This transfer into the General Fund took pl ace on June 15, 2010 in the amount of $450,000,000. Note 5. - Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance A.R.S. \u00a7 35-131.E, requires the AFR to include all appr opriated and non-appropriated monies. The General Fund is presented prominently in the AFR due to its significance. In accordance with the revised statut e, the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance presents appropriated and non-appropriated activity for all other funds accounted for on the AFIS as well as beginning and ending balances for each fund. As required, this report includes non-appropriated acti vity in the same detail as the G eneral Fund. The Statement includes appropriated activity when applicable for each fund, but summarized within a single line item labeled \"Appropriated Activity.\" During the course of the report compilation, a number of funds with negative balances we re noted. No analysis of the accounts that comprise the negative balances was conducted as to the cause or the resolution. On the Fund Balance Report, the various balance sheet accounts culmi nating in the negative balance are listed only for those funds. The following funds were noted with negative balances: OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS: Treasurer's Note Redemption (AAA 1029) Federal Grant Fund - Department of Environmental Quality (EVA 2000) Department of Health Services (HSA 2000) Inter-governmental and Interagency Service Agr eement Fund - Attorney General (AGA 2500) Criminal Justice Enhancement F und - State Treasurer (TRA 3702) Estate and Unclaimed Property Fund - Department of Revenue (RVA 1520) Special Program Payroll Trust Fund - Arizona Historical Society (HIA 3159) SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS: Arizona Breeders' Award Fund - Department of Racing (RCA 2206) INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS: Motor Pool Revolving Fund - Arizona Department of Administration (ADA 4204) State Surplus Materials Revolving Fund (ADA 4214) ENTERPRISE FUNDS: Arizona Highways Magazine Fund (DTA 2031) STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2010 234 Note 5. - Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance (Continued) FIDUCIARY FUNDS: ASRS Administrative Investment Expenses Account - Arizona State Retirement System (RTA 1407) LGIP - COP Investment Held for Tr ustee - State Treasurer (TRA 3168) Administrative Fund - State Treasurer (TRA 3736) Local Transportation Assistance F und - State Treasurer (TRA 3747) County Assistance Fund - State Treasurer (TRA 3751) Developmental Disabilities Fund - Depar tment of Economic Security (DEA 3146) Racing Commission Bond Deposit Fund - Ar izona Department of Racing (RCA 3720) Registrar of Contractors Cash Bond Fund - Registrar of Contractors (RGA 3721) Contractors Prompt Pay Complaint Fund - Registrar of Contractors (RGA 3725) Big Game Permit Fund - Arizona Game and Fish Department (GFA 3712) For management reporting purposes, certain accrual adjustment s are recorded in the AFIS. This activity is consistent with the statutory or legal basis upon whic h the AFR is prepared and has not been modified. Current year adjustments to prior year accruals, such as refunds of prior year's expenditures or adjustments to long-term debts or receivables, are reflected in the Fund Balanc e report as an adjustment to the beginning fund balance. Additionally, other entries are current year transac tions and are shown as GAAP Revenue and GAAP Expenditure Offsets. Revenue offsets are frequently the result of adjustments to amount s recorded as due to other funds. Expenditure offsets are most commonly related to depr eciation and adjustment of fixed assets. GAAP Revenue and GAAP Expenditure Offsets are recorded in the F und Balance Report in their respective revenue and expenditure columns. Furthermore, a number of funds have year-end cash balances on the AFIS, but other balance sheet accounts off-set the cash resulting in a net fund balance of zero. This occurs most commonly with the Credit Card Clearing Fund. Fund activity in the Fund Balance Report is shown on the statewide fund level. Some funds have activity with more than one agency and the report separates the activity within t he fund by agency. Funds with activity in more than one section are listed in both sections and cross-referenc ed. For comparison purposes and consistency with the Statement of Expenditures - Appropriati on to Actual, the Department of Econom ic Security Federal Grant Fund has not been combined on a statewide level. Deta il is provided for each separate grant type. Note 6. - American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) wa s passed by the U.S. Congr ess in 2009 to distribute funds in order to spur economic ac tivity, invest in long-term growth , and increase accountability and transparency in government spending. In accordance with the requirements set forth by the U. S. Office of Management and Budget, the State of Arizona has reported expenditures of ARRA monies received by the State. This information can be viewed on the website at www.reco very.gov or on the Arizona specific website at www.AZRecovery.gov. The ARRA revenues and expenditures are included in the Fund Balance Report of the AFR. However, much more detail exists on the AZRecovery.gov website. Note 7. - Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments Hospitals that treat significant populat ions of indigent patients are eligible to participate in the Disproportionate Share Hospital Program which provides special funding to those hospitals. In the State of Arizona, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System receives the special funding, and then reimburses Arizona State Hospitals for their expenses. The State had budgeted that $69 milli on would be received as reimbursement in FY10. Approximately $18 million was received during FY10. An additional $27 million was anticipated to be received by June 30, 2010, but it was not. Since the Annual Financial R eport is on the cash basis presentation, this $27 million transfer was not recorded in FY10. STATE OF ARIZONA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2010 235 Note 8. - Combining Financial Statements The following schedules provide additional detail related to the combination of fund information for financial statement presentation.
