When I got there, I was really broken, both physically and mentally. When I went after 2 weeks Panchakarnma, I felt soooo good. And the term \"blissful health\" took on meaning. The massages and treatments were incredible. Everyone who works here wants to make sure that I am happy. And they are so professional and passionate about what they do. And very loving and empathetic. The food was fantastic and so lovingly prepared and served. I loved my room and the rooftop, where I often was sitting very relaxed after the treatments. I felt so safe and secure. My previous yoga experience was turned upside down by Sanjay and I started something new. Ultimately, these 2 weeks were the start of a process of change in my thinking and acting. Both in terms of my physical health and my mental, spiritual development. Regardless of whether you want to do Panchakama, an intensive yoga retreat or any other treatment, you are in good and very professional hands in Moksha-Ayurveda. I will definitely come back on my next visit to Nepal.Dear Alex, Thank you for visiting and experiencing our Classical Panchakarma Treatments.

Holly Doc Padma. massage therapists Sabina, Sadina.... Administrators Nirajan and Kriss.. I love you all guys ! and will remember my first (hope not last) experience at Moksha forever!Visited January 2020Written February 21, 2020 - Blissful HealthI have a long-standing interest in Ayurvedic studies and treatment; I deeply appreciate the \"regular influence over dramatic crisis-driven intervention\" perspective. An important part of the wellness system is periodic panchakarma, an intense 28-day journey to restore your whole person to your original self (physical, energetic, spiritual, mental, emotional). I have previously completed full panchakarma in northern India (28-days) and small periods in Kerala (5 to 14 days); so, I have some perspective for comparison. Moksha Ayurveda and Panchakarma Center is an amazing place! The treatments are authentic to the historic model and the facilities are a great holding space to do the work you come to do. The staff, however, is what makes this Center a profoundly healing womb. To a person, they are knowledgeable, compassionate, and deeply caring. They are clearly family to each other and support you in your journey of restoration. For a single treatment, a short-term stay, or full panchakarma, Moksha Ayurveda has my highest recommendation. I am so very grateful for their nurture and support.Visited September 2019Traveled soloWritten September 23, 2019 - Amazing massage and beautiful serviceOur accomodation recommended this place for a massage and we were able to book last minute for two 90 massages. They greeted us with herbal tea and spoke to us about any problems we may have that they need to work on in the massage. They were very friendly, thorough and professional with some beautiful spiritual advice. Overall it was a great experience, lovely people and the massage left us feeling very relaxed. I would definitely come back here again and highly recommend to anyone!Visited April 2018Traveled with friendsWritten April 23, 2018 These reviews are the subjective opinion of Tripadvisor members and not of TripAdvisor LLC.

Before my visit, I had very superficial knowledge about Panchakarma treatment and I had never practiced yoga. I came with my wife to support her and of course Panchakarma treatment and a vegetarian strict diet were a challenge for me. However I was able to pass through all Panchakarma treatment course because of the sincere support, responsiveness and professionalism of Mr. Sanjay and his staff. Thanks to them. My health has improved significantly and at the end of the procedures I became healthier and powerfully in both physically and spiritually. Daily yoga exercises became clear and easier. Please don't think that this Moksha center is a luxury spa resort. This is not so and everything looks very ascetic and simple. however the room was spacious with a shower and toilet, with daily cleaning and linen changes. The center is very private and designed for a minimum number of visitors. Therefore, there is an individual approach to each visitor from yoga classes to procedures and food. Moksha center is located in 18 minutes to walk to the lalitpur historical center Potan square which is very convenient. Upon completion of the course of ponchakarma, I did not even want to leave this center, despite the fact that many procedures required moral preparation and sometime follow with a strict diet. however, when you understand that all this is for the benefit of you and your health, it becomes less important. Therefore, I can sincerely recommend taking a Panchakarma course at the Moksha center to everyone, regardless of your age and physical condition.

Mar 2023 Solo I came to Moksha to give my health and body a loving treatment - and that is what i recived plus so much more in just 1 week - it felt like 2 weeks because i recived so many treatments and i will defently recommend this place for anyone looking to give your health a boost and some loving care. Before coming i had signs of diabetes and now this signs are gone. I stil need to take care of my health - but i feel doing a panchakarma 1-2 times a year is the best thing you can gift and invest in your self for your current and futare health. Everything was more than i could have hoped for - yoga was supprisingly good combined with talks - yoga in life - pranayama and yogic cleansing which i learned to love for the good effect. Massage treatments was really good and many times i was touched by there care in every smal details from a heathed massage bed - which is the first time i have experienced and to a overwelming flowerbath after a deep singing bowl healing. They keept supprising me with diffrent treatments - some wich i tryed for the first time! You can feel they are into giving you a quality experience - even the food is sometimes a piece of art. I felt very much at home and i had a lovely company from another girl staying there. I dont think i can praise and recommend this place enough but i allready have family and friends wanting to come and i will look forward to coming back one day and hopefully for 2-3 weeks since doing this is really the best thing you can do not only for your health and body - but also your soul - mind. I feel renewed in every cell of my body and i can live for a long time from this positive and good energy! Thank you so much to everyone on moksha for doing their very best!
