According to Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), this number has grown significantly in the past two decades, affecting children in the United States 50% more than it did in 1997 [[2]](https://www.foodallergy.org/life-with-food-allergies/food-allergy-101/facts-and-statistics). Food allergies are not only on the rise, but individuals who encounter serious reactions from certain foods (such as nuts, milk or shellfish) have an increased risk of anaphylactic shock, a severe allergic reaction that may result in death [[2]](https://www.foodallergy.org/life-with-food-allergies/food-allergy-101/facts-and-statistics). Researchers at the University of Michigan have recently developed a nasal spray vaccine which may prevent or reduce such allergy symptoms from occurring. Under the supervision of Dr. Jessica O'Konek at the university's Mary H. Weiser Food Allergy Center, these researchers conducted a study that sensitized mice to peanuts in order to test the vaccine on the mice's immune systems [[3]](https://www.foodallergy.org/about/media-press-room/nasal-mist-vaccine-suppresses-peanut-allergy-in-mice). Over the course of two months, fifty percent of the mice were given a placebo, while the other half received the vaccine. Upon assessment of their symptoms after 3 doses, the mice that received the vaccine had a significant reduction in levels of itchiness, inability to breathe and swelling of their faces, as compared to their placebo-using counterparts [[3]](https://www.foodallergy.org/about/media-press-room/nasal-mist-vaccine-suppresses-peanut-allergy-in-mice). The vaccine that was used for the study consisted of peanut protein and nano-emulsion, which is a mixture of water and oil, and has currently been tested only on mice sensitized to peanuts. Researchers at the university argue that the reason for using nano-emulsion was because the substance has demonstrated immense strength in combating infections within the immune system [[3]](https://www.foodallergy.org/about/media-press-room/nasal-mist-vaccine-suppresses-peanut-allergy-in-mice). With this discovery, researchers are continuing to develop the vaccine in order to be more inclusive of more food allergens, as well as for making it available to the human population. Further testing is still being conducted at the university to study the long-term effects of the treatment, with hopes that they are able to control the way cells in the immune system respond to an allergen. At this time, the only FDA-approved treatment for an allergic reaction to food is to avoid the allergen itself and be aware of the ingredients listed on food packaging. Fortunately, individuals that may suffer from allergic reactions due to the negligence of product manufacturers' labeling their ingredients are protected under the Food Allergy Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004. Additionally, under the Obama Administration, the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act was passed, which encouraged states around the country to acquire mandated Epi-pens for students in case of an allergic reaction [[4]](https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergy). While this new treatment is still early in the process of becoming accessible to humans, it is one of the first treatments to have shown sufficient results of allergen suppression in mice. Researchers believe that if the study begins to show long-term results in these mice, a possible vaccine may be up for experimentation in human clinical trials. Maybe soon, the idea of eating foods that we are allergic to won't sound so nuts at all.
