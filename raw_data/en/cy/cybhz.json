Holistic healthcare was common in Poland, where Dr. Socha was born and in the Chicagoland melting pot community where he moved as a 7-year-old and enjoyed growing up. After injuring his lower back while lifting weights, he went the standard medical route, taking pain medication and muscle relaxants. Two months later, instead of resolving his symptoms, he developed more! Frustrated, he went to see a chiropractor and learned how chiropractic could improve his injury \u2014 and his life. At that moment he decided to dedicate himself to helping others find the same benefits. He applies his wellness philosophy while prioritizing wellness and relationships with close family and friends. Every morning he wakes up excited to share what chiropractic has to offer to all. Dr. Socha was a Dean's List graduate of University of Illinois at Chicago where he earned a BS in finance with a minor in accounting. After switching career paths, he earned his Doctorate of Chiropractic from National University of Health Sciences. He specializes in sports injury and performance and enjoys seeing his patients' game dramatically improve. He's also an expert in kinesio taping, Graston, muscle release techniques and certified acupuncture. "}
