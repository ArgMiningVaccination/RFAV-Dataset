To relieve anxiety and foster connection, ISH and the Greater Houston Healing Collaborative have activated our network of trained facilitators to lead virtual mind-body skills groups and workshops for self-care and community support. What Are Mind-Body Skills Groups? Mind-Body Skills Groups offer a safe space for social connection while teaching evidence-based skills that reduce stress and anxiety and support immunity, resiliency, and overall health and wellbeing. These groups allow us to connect deeply with one another, become more aware of ourselves physically and emotionally, and learn to manage and improve our own health. Mind-Body Skills include breathing, movement, meditation, guided imagery, autogenic training, and explorative drawing and writing to help us express ourselves fully, and offer tools to alleviate anxiety and awaken vitality in body, mind, and spirit. The facilitators leading these groups have been trained by the Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM), a world-renowned trauma relief organization that for almost thirty years has been implementing this resiliency building group model for communities across the globe. Please understand that these are educational support groups, not clinical therapy. For those with mental health conditions, we recommend a licensed psychotherapist.
