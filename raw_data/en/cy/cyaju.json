The communion includes laying on of hands, an ancient rite for the sick. Finally, congregants gather in the church's new Wellness Center, where they discuss topics like nutrition and cancer. Most of the congregants are women. Whether for social or biological reasons or both, said the Rev. Diane Lacey Winley, the center's coordinator and a board member of New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation, ''women find it easier to use prayer and meditation to find energy, strength and healing.'' But women aren't alone in exploring the connection between spirituality and health, nor are clergy members the only professionals who talk of healing and religion in one breath. Just as more and more churches and synagogues offer liturgies to promote well-being, some 60 American medical schools now offer courses on health, religion and ''spirituality.'' Both the religious and medical establishments are aware of polls showing that most Americans think that faith and prayer benefit health and that doctors should discuss the connection. This hybridization of science and spirituality combines two of the baby boomers' greatest enthusiasms. As their huge generation ages, their increasing health concerns, from menopause to breast cancer, seem almost as likely to elicit a spiritual quest as a search for the best specialist. There is no denying that religion can ''heal,'' in that it can greatly comfort the sick. But despite the testimony provided by polls and best-selling books, tapes, courses and other healing industry products, spirituality's effect on health remains a more hotly debated issue in science than in the rest of society. The simplest and best-documented evidence of religion's salubrious effects concerns longevity. California's Alameda County Study and the National Health Interview Survey, which was financed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have tracked the health of thousands of randomly selected people, the first for decades and the second for eight years. These well-respected studies show that, even when allowing for individual differences, like medical problems or smoking, subjects who attend services weekly -- the most common gauge of religiousness -- live longer than those who do not. In the national health survey, frequent ''attenders'' died, on average, at age 83; those who never went to services died at age 75. In the Alameda study, the relative risk of mortality for male attenders was 10 percent lower than for other men; for female attenders, however, the risk was 34 percent lower than for other women. By many measures -- frequency of prayer, attendance at services, value placed on spirituality -- women are more religious than men. Whether their greater fervor confers extra health benefits remains in question. The National Health Interview Survey, for example, did not reveal a significant gender gap. But in the Alameda study, according to William Strawbridge, an epidemiologist and the Alameda project's director, religion was found to be nearly as good for women's health as not smoking. That religious men and women tend to live longer does not require supernatural explanations. Not surprisingly, people who frequent churches and synagogues are likelier to avoid risky behavior like drug abuse and promiscuity. But, Dr. Strawbridge said, compared with people who do not go to services, even less straitlaced attenders are likelier to ''clean up their acts'' by quitting smoking, say, or by drinking less alcohol. Explaining the connection between longevity and religion, Dr. Strawbridge pointed to ''the difference between hanging out with the church choir or the Grateful Dead.'' Drawing a parallel to marriage's well-established contribution to well-being, Robert Hummer, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin, who has analyzed the National Health Interview Survey, said religious involvement could influence not only health habits, but also relationships and the ability to cope with stress. ''The general idea isn't that religion works instant cures or insures that anyone who walks into a church will live to be 85,'' he said, ''but that it's linked with many factors that benefit health over a lifetime.'' One Wednesday evening, about 80 people, some clearly frail, gathered for a healing service at Ansche Chesed, a synagogue on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Like the prayers and reflections, some simple songs gently acknowledged that, as Debbie Friedman, a composer and singer of Jewish spiritual music, said, ''We all have to live with pain as well as joy.'' By the service's end, urban professionals had shed their reserve to sway together and sing. Religion's potential health benefits are not limited to those who attend churches or synagogues. Herbert Benson, the director of the Mind-Body Medical Institute at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, which is affiliated with the Harvard Medical School, said spirituality promoted health in two straightforward ways. Research has shown that belief in the effectiveness of a placebo, or sugar pill, can relieve illness. Therefore, Dr. Benson reasons, ''so can faith in the healing power of God -- or nature, relationships or whatever resource the individual chooses.'' And some spiritual practices, he said, have measurable metabolic effects. Whether produced by Zen breathing, Jewish davening (prayer) or reciting the Roman Catholic rosary, the quiet state that Dr. Benson calls the ''relaxation response'' can lower heart and respiration rates and slow brain waves. When performed daily, he said, this response acts as an antidote to the ''fight or flight'' response implicated in the stress-related ailments that motivate most visits to doctors and are resistant to drugs and surgery. The patient who combines standard medical treatment with this self-care, he said, ''has all the bases covered.'' Studies conducted by Duke University's Center for the Study of Religion, Spirituality and Health in Durham, N.C., indicate that deeply religious people are less likely to suffer from diastolic hypertension (high blood pressure when the heart muscle is relaxed) and depression, and tend to have lower levels of a protein called interleuken 6, which implies a strong immune system. ''Religion offers powerful ways to cope with major life stresses, particularly health problems and experiences of loss,'' said Harold Koenig, a psychiatrist who is the center's director. THE idea that religion benefits health has its critics. Earlier this year, the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet published a report co-written by Richard Sloan, the director of the Behavioral Medicine Program at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. After reviewing hundreds of studies, he concluded, ''There's no compelling evidence that religion affects physical health.'' It's not that religion could not do so, said Dr. Sloan, a psychologist. But with the exception of a few studies, like the Alameda survey, he said, ''the vast majority'' are flawed. Among his objections are poor matches between religious and control groups, as when nuns are compared with members of the general population. Including spirituality in medical practice also raises ethical concerns. First, Dr. Sloan said, there is the problem of ''blaming the victim,'' or the patient who fares poorly. Then, too, ''prescribing religion isn't the same as prescribing a low-fat diet,'' he said, adding: ''There's lots of evidence that marriage is good for health, but doctors don't tell their single patients to wed. That area of life is too personal and private.'' Even researchers who are convinced that religion promotes health often express reservations about studies that try to ascertain whether sick people who are unaware that others are praying for them do better than those who are not being prayed for at all. As a scientist, Dr. Koenig said, ''I steer clear of that area.'' As a Christian, he finds the idea of a God who favors those who have others praying for them hard to reconcile with the image of a ''Good Shepherd who will look for that one lost sheep.'' Sometimes religion aggravates health problems. Alice Domar, a psychologist and the director of the Center for Women's Health at the Mind-Body Medical Institute in Boston, has found that very devout patients, particularly Catholics, Jews and women raised with a punitive image of God, find it harder to cope with infertility. ''They're likelier to regard it as their own fault -- even as punishment.'' she said. In a process called ''cognitive restructuring,'' staff members help patients substitute destructive thoughts about infertility with constructive attitudes. When a woman who had suffered recurrent miscarriages said God was punishing her, Dr. Domar replied, ''So, God kills babies?'' The shocked patient said, ''Oh, no, God would never do that!'' Only after logic replaced her fear could the woman see infertility as a physiological problem. A few good surveys now indicate that religion fosters health. But as illustrated by the efforts to establish the effects of smoking or aspirin, Dr. Strawbridge said, ''Numerous studies must replicate an effect before medicine regards it as proved.'' Meanwhile, many compassionate religious and medical professionals continue to draw from both spirituality and science in their efforts to heal. The Rev. Barbara H. Nielsen, an Episcopalian minister and fellow at the Mind-Body Medical Institute, has found that some patients who believe their prayers go unanswered appreciate learning what she calls ''a new way to pray'': one asks for what one wants, accepts what will be and, finally, meditates. Then, Ms. Nielsen said, ''one can listen for the real answer to prayers.'' She recalled how a Catholic infertility patient who used this method began to see that the identity of Mary wasn't limited to maternity, but, like her own, included work, marriage and good character. ''This woman got the message that she's a fine person from Mary,'' Ms. Nielsen "}
