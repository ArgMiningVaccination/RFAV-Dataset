I have experienced success in getting better and back to my activities through various manual therapies and was drawn to massage therapy. What I like about massage specifically is the hands-on time and the ability to affect real change in the quality of life for my clients. After taking a few years off after high school to travel, volunteer, and work in customer service (mainly in the coffee industry), I went on to study Registered Massage therapy at Langara College and acquired my RMT designation in 2019. My treatment style involves a variety of techniques with a focus on Swedish, trigger point therapy, active/assisted stretching, and a desire to help clients understand how home care can empower them in their healing process and work towards their goals. In my own athletic endeavours, I have played various sports including hockey and soccer at a high level and currently pursue long distance trail and road running competitively. When not at work, I can be found either running the North Shore trails, on my road bike, or exploring one of Vancouver's many third-wave coffee shops.

[ Read More ](#/staff_member/57/bio) Growing up on the North Shore, I participated in many sports and active hobbies. From soccer and volleyball to running and hiking. Throughout my life I have had several different injuries and have had the opportunity to experience many different forms of rehabilitation. I have found that every modality benefited me and helped with my rehabilitation in different ways. Being able to experience the benefits of manual and active therapies for myself has encouraged a passion in me to pursue a career in this area. I was drawn to massage therapy and its ability to help heal through the combination of relaxation and therapeutic treatments. I graduated in 2019 from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor's of Kinesiology. I worked as a Kinesiologist for two years before I began my journey at the Vancouver College of Massage Therapy in January 2021. I graduated from VCMT in August of 2022 and after completing my registration exams, I became a Registered Massage Therapist in November 2022. During the past few years I have had the privilege to work in several different therapeutic environments such as physiotherapy, massage therapy, active rehab and chiropractic care. But I have felt drawn to the area of Massage Therapy in the way that it allows a focused and hands-on relationship between patient and therapist and the ability to encourage a holistic approach to rehabilitation. I enjoy being able to incorporate my active rehab background into my massage treatments. As an RMT, my treatments include a variety of techniques such as Swedish-relaxation massage, myofascial & neuromuscular techniques, stretching and active rehabilitation. When I am not treating patients, you can find me running, hiking the North Shore mountains, playing soccer or reading a good book. I look forward to being able to apply my skills to help you achieve your health goals. Alysha Connor Growing up on the North Shore, I participated in many sports and active hobbies. From soccer and ... [ Read More ](#/staff_member/62/bio) I fell in love with acupuncture on a search for a natural approach to heal myself. Having been raised in a household where nutrition and physical activity were a high priority, these areas were always addressed first on the path to feeling better. Upon delving deeper into my Traditional Chinese Medicine studies, I discovered that the practice upholds a strong focus on how one's diet and lifestyle choices can treat and prevent illness along with the use of specifically placed tiny needles. I am a lifelong learner and graduate of the University of Alberta with a Bachelor of Science degree where I majored in biological sciences and minored in nutrition. Following my undergraduate degree, I continued my studies to achieve a Diploma of Acupuncture with distinction at MacEwan University. My experience in community healthcare, capacity for empathy, and interest in the pharmaceutical effects of natural health products was cultivated to a higher degree being employed as a pharmaceutical assistant for the duration of my post-secondary education. I practiced acupuncture in St. Albert, Alberta for two years before moving to the West Coast. My move to Vancouver was driven by an opportunity to continue my studies in Traditional Chinese herbs. Upon completing the required examinations to become a registered herbalist in BC, I am eager to put my herbal knowledge to use as a complement to my acupuncture practice. My goal in the case of every patient is to achieve affordable, effective relief and natural resolution of your health concerns. I believe that my acupuncture needles have their greatest effect on the body when you can tap into your parasympathetic nervous system to rest, digest and heal, hence my deliberate gentle needling technique. I am well-versed in treating a wide variety of ailments including musculoskeletal pain, digestive concerns, facial rejuvenation and mental wellness. Over the years of searching for relief from my own condition, I have developed a particularly strong interest in treating women's health, fertility, birth preparation, and endocrine imbalances with acupuncture, herbal remedies, and lifestyle advice. In my time away from the clinic, you can find me running or road biking on the North Shore, playing soccer, or road tripping to ski, hike and backpack. My passion for education has led me to begin instructing future acupuncturists in Burnaby part-time. I love to cook health-consciously, feed loved ones and have consumed a pescetarian diet for the past decade. I am always itching to explore new ceremony, food, dress, celebration, architecture and an unfamiliar history in a place that is new to me. Animals of all shapes and sizes are my greatest weakness! I thank you for choosing and trusting me to be a part of your wellness journey. Isabel I fell in love with acupuncture on a search for a natural approach to heal myself. Having been ra... [ Read More ](#/staff_member/64/bio) From a very young age, I knew I wanted to be in the health field. My Mom was disabled as a teenager; however, she never let it stop her from doing what she wanted to do - curling, tennis and hiking - even though it resulted in some degree of pain. Her life demonstrated that disabilities can be overcome with strength and humour and I have taken her example to heart. I chose chiropractic as a profession as it is both a science and an art, which has allowed me to utilize both my intellect and my creative side. I graduated from Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in 1983, opening a practice both in North Vancouver with Dr. Russ Manson and my own practice in Whistler which I ran from 1983-1988. Long hours and the stress of commuting took its toll on my hands and I decided to take a well deserved rest. Dr. James Leigh took over my practice at this time and \"while resting,\" nature took its course and our first child, Riva was born. One year later, I sold my practice to Dr. Leigh and continued to work from home and in due course, Alia, our second daughter was born to complete our family. I continued with my studies in Applied Kinesiology, Body Integration, and Cranial Osteopathy as well as attaining my 4 year Homeopathic Diploma, studying with Murray Feldman and another 2 year certificate with Louis Klein. I am eternally grateful for my homeopathic knowledge and especially for the gift of \"listening.\" In early 2001, I went back to work with Dr. James Leigh and was instrumental in developing the North Shore Wellness Center, which most of the North Shore community identifies me with. However, Dr. Leigh sold his practice and moved to Victoria in the summer of 2004, and this changed the direction that NSWC was heading. This precipitated this very recent change to the \"Foundation for Integrated Health,\" a new concept clinic based on the work of Dr. John Brimhall, of Mesa, Arizona. In Feb, 2005, I took the opportunity to certify in this work and was the first to do so in BC. Each human being heals themselves by first increasing their level of conscious awareness, and then acting on this knowledge. My vision has always been to create an integrated health clinic that recognizes the healing potential of each individual, and to gather a group of the most skilled alternative healers available to marshal this deep healing ability. Using the best of what \"science\" has to offer, and marrying this with new ideas and new technologies especially in the field of \"energy medicine\", I believe that we have accomplished much towards this goal. I will continue to push the frontiers of the \"new medicine\" that I believe is the medicine of the future. I call the North Shore my home - I was born here and have spent all my life on the North Shore. Bill, Riva, Alia and I love to ski, sail, bike tour, camp and swim which indulges our love of adventure traveling. When I am not reading \"technical\" books, I love to read fantasy series, especially Arthurian legends. We all welcome you to the clinic, if you are new here, and welcome you back if you haven't seen me for a while. Thank you for allowing us to be part of your \"journey.\" From a very young age, I knew I wanted to be in the health field. My Mom was disabled as a teena... [ Read More ](#/staff_member/2/bio) I was born in Prince George and raised in Kitimat, British Columbia. I graduated in 2009 with a BSc. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Northern British Columbia. Prior to graduation I studied briefly in Sweden and was gifted the experience to play soccer for the cities of Sura and T\u00f6reboda, Sweden. Following my studies, I travelled through Europe with my close friend before returning to Canada where I ultimately obtained my doctorate of Chiropractic from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in 2014. I am a passionate chiropractor who has been dedicated to helping patients achieve optimal health and wellness for over a decade. I'm a board-certified chiropractor and have also completed advanced training in sports medicine and rehabilitation. My passion for chiropractic care began in my post graduate schooling when I experienced sport injuries that needed to be dealt with in a timely manner. Rather than waiting out the natural history of an injury and taking medications I decided to try an alternative approach. The transformative effects of chiropractic care on my injuries over my soccer career were enlightening. The fire was sparked, I could not wait to help others with their injuries. From treatments to preventions, I chose to pursue my career in chiropractic care. Throughout my career, I've been committed to providing compassionate, personalized care to my patients. I believe that chiropractic care is an essential component of overall health and wellness and work closely with each patient to develop a customized treatment plan that addresses their unique needs and concerns. My expertise in sports medicine and rehabilitation has also made me a sought-after practitioner among athletes and active individuals. In my spare time, I enjoy soccer, hockey, paddle boarding, and spending time with my family and friends. My commitment to my patients and my profession is a true testament to my love for what I do.

[ Read More ](#/staff_member/69/bio) Dr. Aleem Remtulla, B.Sc., D.C Chiropractor, Concussion Management I was born and raised in North Vancouver and grew up playing and loving many sports, especially hockey. This interest in sports always pushed me to become a more improved athlete through conditioning and rehabilitation to keep my body in optimal condition. With my educational interests mainly in science, I moved up North to Prince George, BC to obtain my Bachelors of Science Degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC). While studying at UNBC, I continued to participate in many sports such as hockey, volleyball, badminton, squash, and tennis, which I still actively partake in today. This reserved my interest in the science of the human body. As a focused student I began to think about my future prospects; however, was still unsure as to which occupation could combine my passion for overall health and wellness. In 2008, my final year and semester at UNBC, I participated in an exchange program in Sweden and immediately after this time I backpacked through Europe with a friend. On my journey through parts of Europe, I saw many different health clinics which were directed more towards a hands-on approach rather than a medicinal approach. This proved to be the go-to form of health care in those regions. Here is where I decided that this was the form of care that I wanted to be a part of. After returning home, I graduated from UNBC and immediately began researching the field of Chiropractic. I started by volunteering at clinics and applied to the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto (CMCC). After graduating from CMCC in June 2014, I am very happy to be back in North Vancouver where my family lives and where I always wanted to establish myself. As a Chiropractor, I am thoroughly excited to continue learning and putting my knowledge to use in helping patients obtain the optimal health that each individual deserves. I am grateful to be a part of the Foundation for Integrated Health team and look forward to helping you reach your personal health goals, whether it is due to pain, injuries, sports related recovery and conditioning, or overall functionality.

[ Read More ](#/staff_member/3/bio) I was born in Atlantic Canada and moved to British Columbia with my family as a teen. My first memory of recognizing massage as a healing practice was as a child watching my mother massage my Grandmother's feet to sooth her when she was sick. Even at a young age, I could grasp the comfort that this care provided. After graduating from West Coast College for Massage Therapy in 2016, curiosity compelled me to understand the link between how people move throughout the day and how they feel. I was intrigued by how the nuances of movement manifested in the body. My practice began in 2017, at Broadway Physiotherapy and Wellness. Here, I gained experience working with all manner of injuries. However, I had a keen interest in gaining more experience in the perinatal realm. In 2018, Elizabeth Martin, Doula and RMT, hired me at Amethyst Healing on Vancouver Island. From her, I was encouraged to learn unique ways to assess and treat the female pelvis, including visceral manipulation for the uterus and bladder. I used my skills to facilitate support for women's issues involving pelvic pain and conditions connected to inflammation and scar tissue. I returned to Vancouver to continue my practice at Therapy Health Studio, broadening my caseload to encompass perinatal, urban athletes, health care professionals, trades people, children, teens, seniors and desk workers. In 2022, I partnered with friend and colleague, Elizabeth Israel to open Paper Crane Massage Therapy. It was gratifying to help build a foundation for the clinic and watch the business grow. My practice is further supported by courses involving breast massage, myofascial release, craniosacral and visceral manipulation. I am thrilled to join the team at Foundation for Integrated Health, seeking a simplified life and an optimal work-life balance. Situated a short walk away from work, I eagerly anticipate becoming a part of the Lower Lonsdale community. With gratitude I look forward to becoming a part of a comprehensive health care team, dedicated to supporting our patient's well-being. I use a patient centered, gentle approach to Massage Therapy. By encouraging mindful awareness, I guide patients to re-establish a mind-body connection. During my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities including foraging, skateboarding, crafting, cycling, ocean swimming, snowboarding, sewing and observing the phases of the moon.
