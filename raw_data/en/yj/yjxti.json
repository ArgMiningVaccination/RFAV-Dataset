However, on the issue of health care reform, Republicans are losing this group. While the major veterans service organizations (e.g., American Legion, VFW, DAV, PVA) have refrained from endorsing the entire Clinton reform proposal, they embrace its approach to veterans health care because it is the only plan to comprehensively address veterans health care. For example, the American Legion has stated that the Clinton proposal contains 70- 80% of its proposal for Veterans Health Administration reform. Additionally, the National Commander of the Legion has stated that he tells veterans that only Clinton has addressed the concerns of veterans. You may want to raise this issue at this weekend's GOP health care retreat. Republicans could reclaim their constituency by publicly stating that they are aware of the concerns of veterans and will keep them in mind as health care reform legislation is drafted. It could also be helpful to outline some of the problems and questions surrounding the Administration's proposal (some listed below). THE CLINTON PLAN Under the Clinton proposal each Veterans Administration Medical Center would be an alliance. Veterans would be able to choose between the VA plan (the Clinton basic benefits package) and plans from other alliances. Service-connected veterans choosing the VA plan would not be required to pay co-payments. The Administration proposal also would allow VA hospitals to contract with third parties to provide services for other plans. PROBLEMS WITH THE CLINTON PLAN * The VA, as currently constituted and with its emphasis on in-patient care, will have trouble competing with other alliances. * The Administration does not seem to have adequately planned for the expense of up-grading VA facilities and services in order for VA to compete with other alliances. * Planned Reductions in Force for the Department of Veterans Affairs will probably hinder the VA's ability to compete in the health care market. * If the VA cannot attract enough veterans, will it be kept open? The veterans groups want it to be. However, CBO estimates that VA will lose 25% of its patients if the President's plan is enacted.

Universal health insurance coverage Restraint of runaway health care costs Preservation of quality, choice, and jobs HOW DOES IT WORK? Universal access will be achieved through the following reforms: Standard benefit package, clarified by National Benefits Commission Tax deduction only for standard package Equity in the tax code --all Americans will receive the deduction Insurance market reform --eliminate risk selection Voluntary Health Insurance Purchasing Cooperatives for individuals and small businesses Federal vouchers for those who still cannot afford coverage, but are Medicaid or Medicare ineligible. All Americans will be covered by the year 2000 Individual mandate to acquire health insurance coverage Additional savings will be achieved through the following reforms: Administrative streamlining Medical liability reform Antitrust reform Medicaid restructuring Other reforms: Greater emphasis on preventive care Improved access for those in medically underserved regions State flexibility to experiment with innovative forms of health care reform HOW IS THE PROPOSAL FINANCED? Immediate funding will come from specific cuts in Medicaid and Medicare program. Additional funding from savings realized from reforms in this bill, as certified annually by CBO. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 20 of 179,.. :..:\u00b7.: THE KEALTK EQUITY AND ACCESS REFORM ACT (HEART) (S. 1770, H. R. 3704) Gen9ral Ar;rnroitc~ The Health Equity and Access Reform Act of 1993 (HEAR1) Is the product of three years of study of the nation's health care system by the Senate Republican Health Care Task Force. The Task Force concluded that 1) th~ U. S. health system works and 2) it does not need radlcal revision, but does need comprehensive reform. , The objectives of the HEART proposal are to: 1) ensure coverage of affordable health insurance for all Americans; 2) bring down the Increase In health care costs; and 3) preserve the choice and quality that distinguishes the American health care system. HEART guarantees universal coverage by the year 2005 by: 1) making health coverage more affordable through reform of the Insurance Industry, 2) helping low-lncorna Americans purchase coverage through a Federal voucher program and 3) requiring Individuals to purchase health \u00b7 insurance coverage. The bill relies on changes in the tax treatment of health insurance to encourage lndlvidual responsiblllty and consumer awareness of price and quality. HEART also contains administrative simplifications, antitrust reforms, rnedlcal malpractice reforms, fraud and abuse prevention and quality assurance Initiatives . It Is financed on a \"pay as you save\" principle and is deficit neutral. , Access To Coverag~ -All Individuals (citizens and legal aliens) will be required to purchase Insurance by the year 2005 through their employer or through a voluntary health insurance purchasing cooperative. The mandate is phased in based on an indlvldual's ability to purchase the standard plan and is tled to the realization of savings in current government health programs (primarily Medicare and Medicaid). Individuals refusing to purchase coverage would be llable for a penalty equal to the average annual premium of the local area plus 20% when entering the system, e.g., through emergency rooms. -Beginning in 1997, non-Medicaid eligibles with incomes below 90% of tha Federal Poverty Level (FPL) ($12,902/famlly of four) will be given vouchers to buy insurance through purchasing groups. Voucher assistance wlll expand annually from 90% of the FPL In 1994 up to 240% of the FPL by the year 2005. The vouchers wlll be financed as savings become available from reductions in the rate of growth In Medicare and Medicaid. -Individuals, small businesies, the self-employed and the unemploy9d would have access to health insurance through voluntary purchasing groups. Small employers ( < 100) must offer, but are not reguired to pay for, a standard benefit package or alternative catastrophic insurance state-certified as a Qualified Health Plan (QHP). Employees of small businesses may choose not to join any of the employer-offered plans but, Instead, may purchase coverage from another QHP. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 21 of 179. .;.,_ r'?\u00b7. rr.ust offer both a standard and cats.strophic benefit package to all employees. The large employer may form a purchasing group with other employers, purchase coverage from a QHP, or self\u00b7lnsura as long as the employer's plan is Federally-certified and offers the standard benefit package and complies with Insurance reforms, malpractice reforms, solvency requirements, reporting requirements and consumer protections. -M&dlcare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients will have access to ca.re through the existing programs but will have the option to enroll In managed care plans. Stru9tural Reformso to tha He9tth Cara Dellyery System;_ -States would divide the state into one or more geographic areas called Health Care Coverage Area (HCCAs) In which one or more purchasing groups may compete for members. A HCCA must include at least 250,000 residents. A HCCA may also be formed to cover more than one state. It is not required that a purchasing cooperative be established In every HCCA; a single not.for-profit organization may be a purchasing cooperative for more than one HCCA and/ or cross state boundaries. ~ States would be required to establish voluntary h1alth lnsurmnce purchasing cooperatives through which small businesses (<100), the self-employed and Individuals can obtain coverage. The cooperatives will be state-chartered and operated as non-profit. They will collect premiums from employers and pay claims to qualified health plans. Each cooperatlve's Boa.rd of Directors Is elected from the membership of employers, employees of small employers and individuals residing In the HCCA. Cooperatives cannot set payment rates to providers, assume financial risk or perform certification or enforcement functions. -Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), certified by states as meeting Federal benefit and National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAlC) insurance practice standards, must: design and implement enrollment processes; meet premium collectlon and collection criteria; guarantee ellgibility to all applicants; prohibit discrimination based on Illness or pre-existing conditions; guarantee renewal to all participants; base premiums on community rates and rating limitations of age, famlly size, and administrative costs); ensure delivery of services throughout the entire HCCA in which they are offered; offer a standard package or catastrophic/Medical Savings Account package or both; comply with administrative reforms; comply with medical malpractice reforms; meet quality assurance and financial solvency standards; comply with data collection and information sharing requirements; participate In State-based risk-adjustment programs; 2 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 22 of 179. ~ . Evaluations. HEART s.lso establishes a Medical Research Trust Fund to guarantee adequate funding for research. Ti!X Coda Chsnges: All purchasers (employers, employees, Individuals) of qualified health plans wilt receive favorable tax treatment for the cost of the coverage up to the \"applicable dollar llmlt\" (AOL), defined as the average cost of the lowest-priced one-half of certified plans in a HCCA. Deductibility of the plan for the employer Is limited to the ADL cap; premiums in excess of the cap will be taxable to the employee as income. For self-employed Individuals, 100% deductibility of a qualified health plan is extended permanently. Role of the States: States are given broad authority and flexibility to establish their own health care systems, except that a single payer system is specifically prohibited. Any state- specific health care system must be budget neutral to the Federal government, and offer coverage for an equivalent standard benefit package. States must assume the foll owing res ponslbllities: establish HCCA areas: certify qualified health plans; establish operating procedures for voluntary purchasing cooperatives; establish risk-adjustment programs for each HCCA; develop binding arbitration processes for medical malpractice suits; specify enrollment periods for qualified health plans; and establish a state program for Insurance reform and certify compliance with Federal guidellnes. States are granted limited waivers to ERISA (see health Insurance reform) and assured of simplified waiver procedures enabling enrollment of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries Into managed care plans. HEART preempts state mandated benefit and anti-managed care laws. Health Insurance Reform: Purchasing groups for small employers ( < 100) ruJ.Q large (self-Insured) employers must comply with National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) standards for Insurance reform (see Qualified Health Plans, p. 3). ERISA protections are modified In that self-Insured employers must also meet HEART's requirements for benefit plan solvency, quality assurance, data collection, and mediation of malpractice claims. Medicare: Medicare is retained as current law. However, HEART directs the HHS Secretary to develop a legislative proposal within 1 year to \" provide for an appropriate methodology ... to make payments to qualified health plans for the enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries\". The blll also contains provisions providing opportunity for Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in quallfled health plans and/or remain enrolled In a qualified health plan upon becoming Medlcare-ellglble. The annual rate of growth In Medicare expenditures is reduced from 12% to 7% by 2005. 4 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 23 of 179Medicaid: Medica id Is retained as current law. State maintenance of effort for coverage of ellglble populations In 1994 is required. The bill limits ',ht:i rate of growth in Medicaid to 6% annua lly over the years 1997 2000 and 5% annuall y for 2001 and beyond. Per-capita caps, bc..sed on historical costs, are placed on payments to states for acute care Medica id services. With certain limltatlons (enrollment percentages), HEART allows states to move Medicaid recipients into managed care plans without going through the federal waiver process. other changes to Medicaid Include a phase-out of dispropori_lonate share payments to hospitals (DSH) beginning in 1996 at a rate of a 20% reduction In payments annually. Quality Assurance Reform\u00a7; HEART establishes sever al new entities for the purposes of administrative simplifications and for the reporting , collecting, analyzing and distributing health care-related data. Among those are a Hee.Ith Insurance Coverage Data Bank, the Health Care Data Exchange System, a National Health Informatics Cor':\"'.mission, an lnteragency Health Care Data Panel, and a Health Care Fraud and Abuse Data Collection program. These new organizations are given authority to develop regulations and procedures for the reporting of health care-related data from providers, employers, purchasing groups and quallf!ed health plans. The data will translate into consumer Information on provider performance and procedure outcome measures and practice gulde!ines for providers. Expanded criminal and civil penalties of medical fraud and abuse are established to deter fraudulent claim billing and eliminate waste. HEART also establishes strict privacy and confident!al!y standards. Malpractice Reform; To lower health care costs, HEART Includes provisions requiring mediation and alternative dispute resolution In malpractice suits prior to usual lltl\u00a3;c..',;0n procedures. Non-economic damo.ges are capped at $250,000 and attorney contingency fees are limited to 25% of the award. Malpractice reforms apply to product liablllty suits on drugs and devices, including investlgational drugs that are part of an FDA-approved clinical trial and deemed \"safe and effective\". No punitive damages are permitted on FDA-approved products If they are used correctly. Anti-Trust Reforma: HEART provides for antitrust reforms, Including 11safe harbors\" for medical providers to share expensive equipment. Hospital mergers are permitted under certain circumstances based on the number of beds and occupancy rates. HEART provides for expedited review of anti-trust waiver requests. A new HHS/Federal Trade Commission/Department of Justice Office of Health Care Competition Policy will establish competition guidelines for approved providers, health care plans and purchasing groups. 5 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 24 of 179Cost CQntalnment Machan!smSj HEART relies on capping the deduct ibility of health plans and on competition in the market place to rein In health care cost increases . There are no global budgets, budget targets, caps on premiums or caps on reimbursement ~tes to providers or on products. Financing: Savings are realized from: 1) means-testing ~edicare Part B premiums (the 75% Fed.::re.l share of the premium will be \"recaptured\" for Individuals with Incomes over $90,000, $115,000 for couples): 2) phasing out payments to hospitals for bad debt and uncompensated care (disproportionate share payments); 3) reductions in capita.I and 4) graduate medical education payments to hospltals; 5) Increases In co-payments for laboratory services, home health care and outpatient hospltal services for Medicare beneficiaries; 6) enrolling Medicaid recipients In managed care plans; and 7) capping Medi caid payments to stc.~.ss for acute care services. It Is assumed that savings in Medicare and Medicaid fully fund the low Income voucher program. To protect against cost overruns, the HEART voucher program for the !ow-income proceeds only after OMB certifies the savings are occurring as scheduled. In the event the savings occur faster than anticipated, the phase-in will be accelerated; if there Is a shortfall, the phase\u00b7ln will be extended.

ENHANCE SECURITY FOR THOSE PRESENTLY INSURED BY MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE PORTABLE AND PERMANENT: Workers and families presently insured will be guaranteed continued medical insurance coverage by allowing those who leave jobs where insurance coverage was provided to continue their present coverage for an 18-month grace period (or until such individuals can qualify for other coverage) by paying the full premium directly. People who are no longer with their spouses but were previously covered under their spouses' plans or people who have recently become legally independent and are no longer covered by their families' plans will be allowed to continue their current health insurance arrangements for the same grace period by paying their pro rata share of the premium. In addition, all policies would be guaranteed renewable, and premiums could not be raised based on the occurrence of illness. Insurance companies would not be able to cancel a policy except when the policy holder fails to pay the premiums or when the insurance company ceases to sell health insurance in the policy holder's state. II. EXPAND FAMILY HEALTH INSURANCE CHOICES TO PROMOTE COMPETITION AND CONTROL COSTS: As under present law, employer contributions for the purchase of medical insurance coverage will be excluded from employee income; however, to continue this exclusion employers must offer employees at least the following three options: A) Continuation of existing health insurance arrangements; _ B) HMO coverage or any other health care arrangement --such as a voluntary purchasing group, a preferred provider organization, or managed care --where the employer pays the current employer-paid share of health insurance costs to the alternate plan chosen by the employee; and C) Establishment of a Medical Savings Account program where the employer would contribute to the program the amount currently being spent by the employer on the employees's existing health insurance arrangement. A new Medical Savings Account program would be established through enabling legislation allowing current employer and employee contributions to go first toward the purchase of a $3,000 deductible catastrophic insurance policy, which would be chosen by the employee from among plans offered by private insurers and paid for by the employer and employee in the same ratio as conventional insurance is now purchased, with remaining amounts currently spent on conventional insurance coverage going into a Medical Savings Account. Such a catastrophic policy will cover expenses such as physician services, hospital care, diagnostic tests, and other major medical expenses once the policy holder meets the $3,000 annual deductible. Tax-free withdrawals from the Medical Savings Account could be made to pay for qualifying out-of-pocket medical expenses which apply toward the insurance policy's deductible. If the funds in the This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 27 of 179(-... Medical Savings Account are not spent so that as new deposits are made, the sum grows beyond the $3,000 deductible, the employee can withdraw the excess and treat it as mcome. The individual employee would contract with the HMO or Medical Savings Plan and pay those costs in excess of the employer's current contribution for the purchase of health insurance coverage. Employees will have a 2-month period each year (an \"open season\") to choose a new option for the following year. Should the cost of the HMO or Medical Savings Account program be less than the employer currently pays for conventional insurance, the employee can keep the difference . Each employer shall determine whether the employer /s contribution into the alternate plan shall be based on the average cost of providing coverage for its employees under the current plan or the actual cost per individual employee. Whichever method the employer selects shall apply to any employee leaving the employer's current plan and selecting an alternative plan. In addition, whichever method the employer chooses shall be used in determining the cost of coverage that employees leaving the employment of the company must pay to continue bridge coverage during the grace period or until other coverage can be obtained. ID. PROVIDE EQUAL TAX TREATMENT FOR THE SELF-EMPLOYED AND UNINSURED: Self-employed workers, who currently are permitted to deduct 25 percent of their expenses for medical insurance coverage will now be allowed to exclude from income a percentage of their medical insurance coverage costs equal to the national average that employers contribute. Those individuals without employer-provided health insurance coverage will be accorded similar tax treatment. This percentage will be recalculated annually and will ensure that anyone without employer-based health insurance coverage will be treated equitably. The exclusion will be phased in over five years up from 25 percent to the national average for the employer's payment. The tax exclusion will apply to the purchase of conventional health insurance, HMO coverage, Medical Savings Account contributions, or any other prepaid medical plan. IV. ALLOW SMALL BUSINESSES TO POOLTHEffi HEALTH INSURANCE PURCHASES: Regulatory and legal impediments that restrict the ability of small businesses and other organizations (churches, local civic clubs, etc.) to group together voluntarily to allow their employees or members to pool their health insurance purchases will be removed. V. ASSIST INDIVIDUALS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS IN PURCHASING HEALTH INSURANCE: Individuals uninsured due to pre-existing conditions that preclude affordable insurance cannot be denied coverage but will be expected to pay premiums up to 150 percent of the average premium paid by those of the same age, sex, and geographic area. The federal government will pay that amount of the premium which exceeds 150 percent of the average, but only if the entire cost of the coverage exceeds 7.5 percent of the individual's or family's income. This assistance shall be given for the purchase of a high-deductible catastrophic policy and private insurers shall bid for the policy in a risk pool. Such a catastrophic policy will cover expenses such as physician services, hospital care, diagnostic tests, and other major medical expenses once the policy holder meets the $3,000 annual deductible. The subsidy for pre-existing conditions does not cover premiums that are higher due to current behavior that is risky or unhealthy . Page 2 -: .... , --~-\u00b7-\u00b7 ~ f- This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 28 of 179VI. ENCOURAGE RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR BY THE FINANCIALLY CAPABLE: Financially capable individuals (those with incomes above 200 percent of the poverty level-- $13,864 for individuals and $27,848/or afamily of four) who choose not to purchase at least a catastrophic insurance policy that covers physician services, hospital care, diagnostic tests, and other major medical services with a deductible no higher than 20 percent of their adjusted gross income or $3,000, whichever is higher, will not be eligible to receive federal premium assistance based on any pre-existing condition after the first year of enactment of this legislation. In addition, such an individual who incurs medical expenses will be the \"payer of first resort.\" Only after he has exhausted all his assets will the government or any institution receiving federal funds provide assistance . Any amounts not recovered from such an individual will be garnished from the individuals wages on a pro-rata basis for a seven-yea r-period. VII. PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LOW-INCOME WORKERS IN PURCHASING HEALTH INSURANCE: 85 percent of Americans currently have health insurance coverage . By providing equal tax treatment to those who purchase their own insurance coverage without employer-provided assistance, by having the federal government partially subsidize the cost of insurance coverage for high-risk individuals, by providing incentives for financially capable individuals to obtain health insurance coverage now, and by making all health insurance policies portable and guaranteed renewable, we will ensure that most of the remaining 15 percent will have health insurance coverage. In addition, this proposal will not displace Community Health Centers, the Indian Health Service, the VA Health system, or CHAMPUS. To achieve total coverage, a credit will be available to families and individuals not eligible for Medicaid and having income below 100 percent of the poverty level. This will allow them to fully fund the cost of a catastrophic insurance policy covering physician services, hospital care, diagnostic test, and other major medical services with an annual deductible equal to the higher of 20 percent of adjusted gross income or $3,000 and a preventive package for immunizations, routine physicals, pap smears, mammograms, prostate exams, and other basic preventive care. This credit will be reduced as family income rises and will be eliminated at 200 percent of the poverty level. This credit will be phased in over five years. Those receiving a partial credit who refuse to purchase at least a catastrophic policy will not be eligible to receive federal premium assistance based on any pre-existing condition after the first year of enactment of this legislation . In addition, if such an individual incurs medical expenses, he shall be the \"payer of first resort.\" Only after he has exhausted all his assets will assistance be provided. Any amounts not recovered from such an individual will be 'garnished from the individuals wages on a pro-rata basis for a seven-year period. VIII. REWARD PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLES: Insurance companies may charge different rates based on the willingness of the insured family or individual to use preventive medicine, including vaccines and physical exams. Insurance companies can charge lower rates to those who restrict their use of health harming substances and live healthy lifestyles . Individuals with moderate incomes who receive federal assistance will be required to pay more if they are overweight, smoke, drink excessively, or engage in other activities that are harmful to their Page 3 V. ~~ : .... - .. T ~ This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 29 of 179health. These extra payments will be based on the differentials that develop in the private insurance market. IX. REFORM MEDICAID AND EXPAND CHOICES IN MEDICARE: A) Medicaid payments to states will be made on a per capita basis. That is, states will receive an annual payment, indexed for medical inflation, from the federal government equal to the average federal cost per Medicaid enrollee on a state-by-state basis. The payment will vary by major risk categories. States will then be allowed the flexibility to design their own systems which could: 1) continue the existing Medicaid coverage; 2) enroll recipients into a private Health Maintenance Organization or other health care arrangements; or 3) establish a Medical Savings Account plan to cover the recipient's medical expenses, where, except for qualified medical expenses, no amount can be withdrawn from the Medical Savings Account which takes the account below the annual catastrophic deductible amount. Also, states would be permitted to develop other innovations and requirements, including use of copayments. B) Those currently covered by Medicare could keep their present coverage or receive annual government assistance up to the expected cost of their annual Medicare coverage for the individual retiree to enroll in a private Health Maintenance Organization or other health care arrangement or buy a Medical Savings Account. Those choosing to opt out of the current Medicare system who are able to purchase coverage for less than the expected cost of their current Medicare coverage will be permitted to keep one-half of the difference. Upon becoming eligible for Medicare (currently at age 65), individuals would have one year to decide whether or not to stay in the current Medicare system. This decision is final. Under the Medical Savings Account option, the expected Medicare annual expenditure would be paid on an annual basis and would be used to purchase the retiree's catastrophic coverage from a private vendor, with the remaining funds going into the retiree's personal Medical Savings Account. Additional Medical Savings Accounf contributions or out-of- pocket expenses could be made by the retiree or anyone else on the retiree's behalf The Medical Savings Account would also be established and maintained with a private vendor. X. ENHANCE EFFICIENCY THROUGH PAPERWORK REDUCTION: A) Medicaid, Medicare, and all other federal entities involved in the funding or delivery of health care shall standardize their health care forms and must reduce their total health care paperwork burden by 50 percent within two years of enactment of this legislation . The paperwork burden must be reduced by another 50 percent over the following three years, achieving a total paperwork reduction of 75 percent over a 5-year period. Page 4 .. \u00b7~ . This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 30 of 179B) State agencies involved in the funding or delivery of health care, like federal entities, shall standardize their health care forms. Also like federal entities, within five years of enactment, states must reduce their total health care paperwork burden by 75 percent in order to remain eligible for federal health assistance. C) A private commission will be established to develop, within 12 months from enactment, standardized forms to be used by private health care providers and private insurers. In order to receive federal reimbursement, private health care providers and private insurers must use these standardized forms. This commission shall be comprised solely of private health care providers and private insurers. XI. PROVIDE MEANINGFUL MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM: A) Similar to the system in the United Kingdom where the \"loser pays\" court costs, any claim of negligence not \"substantially justified\" or improperly advanced will result in an automatic judgement against the plaintiff rendering the plaintiff liable for the costs incurred by the health care provider in defending himself, including any losses as a result of being away from his practice defending himself. B) The liability of any malpractice defendant will be limited to the proportion of damages attributable to such defendant's conduct. C) A health care provider can negotiate limits on medical liability with the buyer of health care in return for lower fees. D) Non-economic damages cannot exceed $250,000 adjusted annually for inflation. E) Lawyer's contingency fees will be capped at 25 percent. F) Malpractice awards will be reduced for any collateral source payments to which the claimant is entitled, and the claimant will be required to accept periodic payment as opposed to lump sum on awards in excess of $100,000 adjusted annually for inflation. G) No malpractice action can be initiated more than two years from the date the alleged malpractice was discovered or should have been discovered, and no more than four years after the date of the occurrence. H) No punitive damages will be awarded against manufacturers of a drug or medical device if such drug or medical device has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective. XII. PROMOTE EFFICIENCY IN THE HEALTH CARE MARKET BY REMOVING ANTITRUST BARRIERS: By limiting certain antitrust impediments that restrict cooperative efforts, communities and providers will be given an opportunity to coordinate the delivery of health care and enter into joint ventures that promote greater efficiencies, and expand access.

PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE REFORMS: COSTS: The taxpayer costs of the three new health care benefits contained in this proposal --the universal health insurance tax exclusion; the high-risk insurance pool subsidy; and the low-income worker tax credit for insurance purchase --will be put into effect under the following conditions : A) None of the benefits shall take effect until savings accrued by the reforms contained in this plan have actually occurred. B) Phase-in priorities based on achieved savings shall be as follows: 1) high-risk insurance pool subsidy. 2) universal health insurance tax exclusion will be phased up in annual 10 percentage point increments to 75 percent. 3) low-income worker tax credit for insurance purchase will be phased in first for families in poverty, then singles in poverty, and lastly, for families and singles above the poverty level.

This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 32 of 179and the risk classes they fall into. States would then be given the flexibility to institute the reforms outlined in section IX. The payment to states would grow each year by the increase in the medical price inflation index.

The resulting Medicaid savings are as follows: Medicaid Savings from Lower Medical Inflation 1994 1995 $.3 Savings (in billions of$) 1996 1997 $.9 $2.0 1998 1999 TOTAL $3.8 n.a.* $7 Third, with the introduction of a high-risk individual subsidy and a universal tax exclusion, many Medicaid recipients will be brought under private plans.

Phil G,ramm (Tex.) unveiled yet another Repub- lican alte.>;:\u00b7,1ative to President Clinton's health care re- form r,.iroposals, one Gramm said would rely almost en- tirr.J1y on market forces to cut costs and expand cover- age. As outlined by Gramm in a breakfast meeting with reporters, the plan would require employers to offer health care options to their workers, assure coverage of people with preexisting health conditions, continue cov- erage for workers who change jobs and provide some assistance for the working poor. It bears little, if ai;iy._ resemblance to Clinton's J;!lan and...@_fers significantly from an alternative outlined last week by a group of Senate Republicans led by Sen. John H. Chafee (R.L). lii\"'Keeping government intervention to a minimum, it more parallels a plan proposed by House u icans. Gramm descn t e choice etween Clinton's plan and his own as \"collectivized medicine\" versus \"bringing price competition into the health care market.\" Gramm would provide no new benefits until sa\\ings were as- sured. While it appears to have little chance of passage, Gramm's a is like! to shar en the debate b res- entm a clear conservative a \u00b7ve to what many see as a ra ua y evolvin consensus between Clinton and Chafee, w o as signed up 22 colleagues as cospon-sors on his prooosal. Gramm said he has not yet tried to gef\"cosponsors for his proposal, although he said he is working with about 20 Republican senators on the plan. The president will unveil his broad reform proposal to a joint session of Congress today at 9 p.m. Gramm's proposal would reguire employers to offer workers at least three health care options, including continuation of current coverage, transfer to other plans including health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or creation of \u00b7\u00b7medical savings accounts\" on behalf of individual employees. The deposits in those accounts would come ?rom money that employers would otherwise have paid for health insurance. Em-ployees who chose such accounts would have to be pro- vided a catastrophic-illness insurance policy. Self-employed workers or those without employer- provided insurance would receive tax breaks equivalent to the national average of employer-paid benefits. Med- icaid and Medicare would be continued but with the option of enrolling beneficiaries in HMOs or medical savings accounts. Pools would be set up to cover high- risk workers, with some government subsidy for poorer workers, and credits for catastrophic coverage would be provided for those not cowred by other aspects of the bill. Gramm, who is also chairman of the Republican sen-atorial campaign committee, said Clinton's plan, if adopted without change, would \"bankrUpt\" the country and doom the Democrats. \"People would be hunting Democrats with dogs by the end of the century,\" he said.

WHAT IT DOES The Consumer Choice Plan Provides the securitv of universal health care coverage for all Americans. guaranteeing them access to insurance that is portable, and available regardless of pre-existing conditions. It would take effect on January 1, 1997. Provides individuals and families with a maximum choice of health insurance plans with a wide variety of benefits and costs, including the ability to keep the employer- sponsored benefits they have now .. That's more choice than most Americans have now. Individuals and families are provided with the resources to _purchase the health insurance plan that best fits their needs with tax credits in place of the current employee tax exclusion for health care expenses. People whose health expenses consume a larger percentage of their incomes would get a bigger tax credit. Controls rising health care costs by empowering consumers with choice and individual responsibility and infusing real competition between insurance companies for the consumer's health care dollar. Further reduces rising health care expenses with real reform of medical malpractice laws, including capping awards for noneconomic damages. Creates Medical Savings Accounts. or MSAs, which can be used to pay medical bills or to pay for extra benefits .

S. Senators and Representatives. The FEHBP's annual cost increases have averaged a third less than other private health insurance programs. What it does NOT do The plan has no new, job-killing mandates on employers to provide and pay for health insurance for their employees. Employers must only give their employees the option of retaining their current benefits, or \"cashing out\" their benefits and joining another plan. The plan requires no new taxes. The Consumer Choice and Health Security Act does not wipe out existing health insurance policies. unlike the Clinton plan, which would outlaw nearlv everv health insurance plan now in existence. Under the Consumer Choice Act, people who are happy with their employer-sponsored coverage can keep it. The plan places no price controls or \"premium caps\" on insurance plans that could reduce the quality of coverage and even result in the rationing of health care. The plan creates no new national health board or government bureaucracies . There is no government coercion to purchase benefits not wanted or needed. beyond a minimum catastrophic insurance requirement. HOW IT WORKS Insurance Reforms to Guarantee Access The Consumer Choice and Health Security Act provides for guaranteed issue of health insurance policies. Insurers could not exclude coverage of any preexisting medical condition of any applicant who switches from one insurance plan to another or of any currently uninsured person who buys insurance. Insurers cannot cancel or refuse to renew coverage of a health insurance policy except for non-payment of premiums or fraud or misrepresentation. Insurers could not offer bonuses to brokers for selling insurance to ''healthy\" people or avoiding the sale of policies to 2 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 38 of 179people with preexisting conditions. or engaging in any other discriminatory sale~ practices. Health insurance underwriting would be limited. allowing insurers to vary premiums only on the basis of age, sex and geography. However, because of the imponance of prevention and healthy lifestyles. the legislation would allow insurers to give incentive discounts to promote healthy behavior. prevent or delay the onset of illness, or provide for screening or early detection of illness. Cenain state laws penaining to mandated benefits and services, anti-managed care laws. and mandated cost-sharing would be preempted. Tax Credits Individual tax credits would replace the current tax exclusion for company-sponsored health plans. Tax credits, which would become available on January 1, 1997. would be structured to give all Americans a basic level of tax relief on all of their health expenses, with greater tax relief targeted to those individuals and families who, because of illness or below average incomes, face proponionately higher health expense relative to their income. The credits would be structured as follows: Health Insurance Premiums and Unreimbursed Medical Expenses as a Percent of Gross Income Below 10 percent 10 to 20 percent 20 percent or more Percent Reimbursed 25 percent 50 percent -75 percent At a minimum, for every $100 which is spent on health insurance premiums, or contributed to a Medical Savings Account (MSA), or spent on ANY out-of-pocket medical expenses, the individual or family would pay $25 less in taxes. The greater the ratio of health costs to income, the greater the tax benefits. Low-wage persons with higher percentage health costs would receive greater benefits. The tax credit would be as much as $75 per $100 spent on health care, and would be refundable as explained below. The credits are refundable, meaning that if the value of the credit is more than an individual's or family's tax liability. the government would pay the difference. Much like the treatment of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), employers would reduce their tax 3 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 39 of 179. t~\u00b7-liability and provide the tax credit as additional income in the employees' paycheck. so they could purchase insurance. Family Security Benefit Requirements Society should not have to pay the price for irresponsible individuals who refuse to purchase insurance and then expect us to pick up the tab when they become seriously ill or injured. Every individual and family would be required to have minimum health insurance coverage to cover medically necessary \"acute medical care,\" including: Physician services Inpatient, outpatient, and emergency hospital services and appropriate alternatives to hospitalization Inpatient and outpatient prescription drugs A maximum deductible amount of 51,(X)() for an individual and 52,(X)() for a family and an out-of-pocket limit of 55.000. These amounts would be indexed to inflation in future years. For Medical Savings Accounts, or ~SAs, the Consumer Choice plan would provide the same basic 25% tax credit for deposits. Each household would be permitted to have one MSA and to make an annual deposit no greater than the sum of $3,(X)() plus $500 for each dependent. The funds in an MSA could be used to pay medical bills not covered by their insurance plans, and to pay health insurance premiums. Transitional Rules: In order to provide individuals and families with secure. ponable benefits, insurers and employers who currently provide health insurance coverage would be required to offer policyholders the option of converting their existing coverage to an individual or family plan. Employers would also be required to -add the value of the coverage they now offer to their workers' wages. Thus, workers could take their coverage with them when they changed jobs or could use the money to buy a different plan that better suited their needs. Employer Provisions Individuals and families could still purchase health insurance through their employers. This would not be their only option, since they would be able to receive the same tax relief if they purchased coverage on their own or through other groups such as unions. churches, farm bureaus, business coalitions, professional associations, or through some other group -similar to the choices that more than 10 million Federal employees. retirees and their families have today . '\u00b7 . . This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 40 of 179o To ensure that indi\\iduals and families are able to make regular premium payments on their health insurance, employers \\V Ould be responsible for withholding premiums from their employees ' paychecks and sending these premiums to the employees' chosen insurer. Employers would also be responsible for adjusting their workers' tax withholding to reflect the new tax credits. Thus. taxpayers would not need to wait until they filed their tax returns to claim back the new tax credits. \u00b7 Individuals who fail to enroll in private health insurance plans would be ineligible to claim the personal exemption on their federal income taxes. Employers would adjust their withholding to reflect this increased income tax liability. Financing the Consumer Choice Plan o Because the Consumer Choice tax credit is more generous than the tax deductions and exclusions that it would replace. it will result in a net revenue loss to the federal government of S 133 billion between 1997 and 1999. To offset this revenue loss, the bill calls for savings in the Medicare and ~edicaid programs of $139 billion over five years. Federal Medicaid payments to states for acute care would be distributed on a per capita basis beginning in fiscal year (FY) 1995. The capitated amounts would be set at 20 percent above the FY 93 level in FY 95. In subsequent years, the capitated payment would rise by one percent above the consumer price index (CPI). Total federal Medicaid acute care payments to a state for FY 95 could not exceed the payment for FY 93 plus 20 percent. In subsequent years, the total federal acute care payment to any state could not exceed the previous year's payment plus CPI plus 2.5 percent. This will produce a five-year savings of $72 billion. States would be given broad latitude in how they deliver acute medical care services to their Medicaid population. Medicare savings will be achieved by eliminating payments to \"disproportionate share\" hospitals, reducing payments to hospitals for indirect medical education costs, continuing the transition to a prospective payment system (PPS) for outpatient services, and by updating PPS payments on January 1 of each year, rather than on October 1. Further savings would be achieved by placing a 20-percent coinsurance requirement on laboratory and home health services. These changes will save the Medicare program $67 billion over five years. Comparison of Savings Achieved The President's health plan and the Consumer Choice plan Program Consumer Choice President Medicare $67 Billion $152 Billion Medicaid $72 Billion $225 Billion 5 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 41 of 179.. . -Cutting Costs through Malpractice, Paperwork Reforms The Consumer Choice plan would place a S250.000 limit on noneconomic damages. provide for periodic payment of malpractice awards that exceed S 100.000, and limit the liability of a defendant for noneconomic and punitive damages to their percentage of fault. as determined by the trier of fact. It would also cap attorney fees. provide for offsets from collateral sources, and set forth rules for any health care malpractice claims filed in state or federal court or resolved through arbitration. The Secretary of Health and Human Services would have the power to require all health care providers to submit claims to health insurance companies in accordance with standards developed by the Secretary, if providers are not voluntarily complying with the standards. The Secretary is also directed to adopt standards relating to data elements for use in paper-and electronic-claims processing of health insurance claims, uniform claims forms and uniform electronic transmission of data. Helping the Disadvantaged The Medicaid Disproportionate Share program -now used to reimburse providers to help defray the cost of uncompensated care -would be converted into grants to states for health insurance coverage, health promotion and disease prevention. The program would target assistance to individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid, who have incomes less than 150 percent of poverty. and whose unreimbursed payments for health insurance premiums and medical care. net of federal tax credits, exceed 5 percent of their adjusted gross income. Consumer Protections .T The Federal government will continue to police insurance programs to protect consumers from being defrauded. Federal criminal penalties are established against health care providers and insurers who knowingly defraud persons in connection with a health care transaction. Anti-Trust Provisions The bill will create \"safe harbors\" from federal anti-trust laws for: certain groups of providers; medical self-regulatory entities that do not operate for financial gain: certain joint ventures for high technology and costly equipment and services: and certain hospital mergers. It directs the Attorney General to create additional \"safe harbors\" for health care 6 ._ This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 42 of 179 JOmt ventures that would increase access to health care, enhance health care quality. establish cost efficiencies from which consumers would benefit, and otherwise make health care services more effective, affordable and efficient. The Attorney General also is required to establish a program throu,gh which cenain providers may obtain cenificates exempting from anti-trust laws activities relating to the provision of health care services. Long-Term Care Amounts withdrawn from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans for long-term care insurance are excluded from income. The bill also provides that certain exchanges of life insurance policies for long-term care insurance policies are not taxable. It also exempts from taxation any amount paid or advanced from a life insurance contract to a terminally or chronically ill individual who is confined to a hospice or nursing home. 7 .

It guarantees access to high quality, affordable health care for all Americans. It does not rely on heavy-handed government controls, but favors the establishment of new ground rules for fair and effective competition among private health plans. ft does not include global budgets or price controls, nor does it compel employers to pay the health plan premiums of their employees. \"\" The bill changes the health care market's ground rules to encourage providers and insurance companies to form health partnerships which will be publicly accountable for costs and quality. Regional purchasing cooperatives will give individuals and small businesses the benefits of greater buying power. A national board will establish a standardized. comprehensive set of benefits . Tax deductible status will only be available for health plans <known as Accountable Health Plans or AHPs) that offer these standard benefits. comply with insurance reforms and disclose information on medical outcomes, cost effectiveness and consumer satisfaction. These changes will give every American the same leverage and choices that are now available only to America's largest companies. Health Plan Reform--lnsurance companies and health care providers will combine to form Accountable Health Plans . These AHPs must have open enrollment and will not be allowed to exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions or to use \"experience rating\" to charge higher rates for individuals who have a history of higher medical expenses. Access to Coverage--lndividuals and small businesses will be able to afford health . coverage by joining Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives CHPPCs), which will offer group rates with low administrative costs. Consumers who purchase through HPPCs will be able to choose from a menu of all qualified health plans in the area. Large businesses. which already have economies of scale and the ability to adequately spread risk, will be able to contract directly with AHPs. Improving lncentives--Health plans will have incentives to promote preventive care, eliminate unnecessary tests and ineffective treatments and reduce administrative costs. Since they will be required to report on the health outcomes of their enrollees, health plans will be driven to improve the quality of the care they provide. Access for Low-Income Individuals-A new federal program will pay health plan premiums for all people below 100% of the poverty level. Individuals and families between 100% and 200% of the poverty level will receive a sliding scale subsidy toward the purchase of a health plan. States will no longer have to finance Medicaid but will gradually assume responsibility for long-term care for the poor. Tax Fairness-Employers will be allowed to deduct the cost of the most efficient health plans, but not the costs of excess benefits of higher priced plans. Limiting employer deductibility in this way will promote cost-conscious purchasing and will provide revenue to finance 100% deductibility for all individuals and the self-employed. Access in Underserved Areas-A wide array of resources will be made available through new and existing programs to assist underserved areas in recruitment and retention of providers, development of provider networks. integration of public health clinics and coordination with urban \u00b7safety net\" hospitals. Cost Savings--Malpractice reforms, electronic claims processing and administrative simplification will greatly improve the efficiency of the health care system.

In fact. Senator Durenberger's support for using market forces to rein in health care costs and improve quality actually dates to his pre-Senate days -as public affairs officer for a Fortune 500 company. a community activist. and a trustee of what is now Minneapolis Childrens' Medical Center. It was in the early-to-mid-1970' s that Twin Cities employers began to see the potential to influence the pricing and delivery of health care through the marketplace . Senator Durenberger was part of that discussion, representing his employer, the H.B. Fuller Company . He also served as chairman of Public Service Options CPSO) - a joint venture involving the Citizens League and Upper Midwest Council. PSO was established to explore alternative ways of purchasing and delivering public services -particularly using competition and consumer choice. An important influence on Senator Durenberger and others in defining and mobilizing market forces in the Twin Cities was Dr. Paul Ellwood. a physician who founded his own health policy group. lnterStudy . Dr. Ellwood later founded th~ \"Jackson Hole Group,\" a collection of health policy leaders from around the country who met at Ellwood's home in Wyoming. As a leading supporter for health market reforms in the Congr~ss. Senator Durenberger was a participant in those discussions. Senator Duren berger' s firm grounding in the principles that !)OW define \"managed competition\" can also be seen in his speeches to health policy audiences dating back to his early days in the Senate. He was a vocal critic of Carter Administration proposals to contain health care costs through price regulation. And he introduced his own proposal -the Health Incentives Reform Act of 1979 -to encourage the same kind of competition and consumer choice he had seen begin to take hold in the Twin Cities. In October of 1980. Senator Durenberger challenged his fellow hospital trustees in Minnesota to become part of the solution . In his speech to the East/West Metro Hospital Trustee Council. he also began defining a governmental role in promoting the use of market forces in health care by warning that \"meaningful competition may just be our last defense against regulation . The kinds of activity we see here Cin the Twin Cities) need to be explored and expanded upon in other areas of the country. The legislation I introduced last year ... will facilitate the emergence of competition on a broader scale by encouraging multiple choice by employers. requiring equal employer contributions to health benefits.\" This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 47 of 179Less than a year later, Senator Durenberger outlined \"A Framework for Health System Reform\" in a speech to the National Health Council in Washington. He identified what he called \"eight guiding principles for change\" -principles that are evident in several of the major managed competition proposals being debated. He began what would become a decade-long crusade for market forces against the regulatory impulse -by pointing out that \"choice gives individual consumers the opportunity to select a product or service that best meets their needs. The most successful provider of that good or service will be the one that best responds to consumer desires .... (ButJ these very basic elements of a competitive market do not exist in health care. The ultimate consumer of health services -the patient -is usually insulated from the cost of care by a private or government insurance plan. When patients do share in the cost of their health care, they find there's nothing to shop around for - no choices. How many employees have a choice of health plans? .... Not many. \"And, without consumer choice to stimulate providers to be responsive and efficient, we really can't expect doctors and hospitals to change their behavior. More regulation won't cure the ills of our health system. But neither will the status quo. We simply must introduce the basic elements of choice and competition into health care.\" By March of 1985, this vision of a new health care marketplace had evolved to the point that Senator Durenberger was able to tell a public affairs conference at Brown University in Providence: \"Under my ideal world, the worker becomes a smarter shopper, and pays for what he gets. The elderly and disabled have a Medicare system better tailored to their needs. The poor have financing to give them access to health plans. The individual tries harder to stay well. Health care providers have moved to a price-oriented marketplace. Consumers have choice, and you can bet they choose what's best for them. That includes buying the best quality health care for their dollar.\" As ranking member of the Senate Finance Medicar~ Subcommittee, Durenberger authored significant physician payment reform legislation (resource-based relative value scales or RBRVS). And as chairman of the Finance Health Subcommittee, he authored important hospital payment reforms (diagnostic related groups or DRGs), as well as the establishment of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and the Medicare catastrophic legislation. The last few years have seen a great deal of progress toward Duren berger' s goal. The Bentsen-Durenberger insurance reforms passed the Senate by a vote of 97-0 last year before being stopped in the House. And the Health Insurance Purchasing Cooperative Bill introduced last year by Durenberger and Senator Jeff Bingaman CD-NM) would have allowed states to design purchasing cooperatives for small business with Federal assistance - a precursor of today's managed competition consensus.

This is not an ideological matter. The desire to solve the first problem comes from a simple humanitar- ian impulse-it's \\nong that any American should live in fear of not receiving decent medical care, or of being financially ruined by sickness. The desire to solYe the sec- ond problem comes from an economic worry: the mar- ket, because of the nature of health care as a product, and the unique third-party method of payment, has become distorted and wastes an increasing amount of economic resources. So what to do? There are several options available: put government in control of the entire industry to ensure equal universal coverage and complete market control, incl\u00b5ding price controls and rationing (the Old Demo- -crat option); reform the market to ensure greater effi- (1t::;~.ciency and provide incentives to give everyone the opportunity to buy a decent health care pla:n (the New .....__..Democrat approach, embodied best in Representative Jim Cooper's proposal);-reform the market, mandate universal coverage, have government price controls if you netci Lhem and have government oversee the entire process (the Clinton plan); or split the difference still further between Clinton and Cooper (the liberal Repub- lican plan touted by Senator John Chafee). There are also various conservative proposals, including Phil Gramm's, which rely entirely on the free market, but this does so little to address either problem that it's hardly worth taking seriously. Our conviction is that health care should be made available to every American citizen; but we also believe that the last thirty years' c::;:-::\u00b7ipnr~ ~: government overreaching, the complexity of the prob- lem and the law of unintended consequences all point to the superiority of the New Democrat approach. Cooper's plan bears a family resemblance to Clinton's when it comes to controlling spending. Both aim to rein in rising expenses by restructuring the health care mar- ket in a way that sensitizes individuals and employers to costs that are now largely invisible to them. They do this through variants on the idea of managed competition; the plans give small purchasers of insurance buying power by banding them together in statewide coopera- .tives. These alliances, as they are called in the Clinton 'version, require insurance companies and health plans to pro\\'ide information on resulL~. But where Cooper relies purely on managed competition devices, such as the so-called tax cap, which reduces expenditures by lim- iting the deductibility of employer-provided plans, Clin- ton loses faith in his market principles and turns to external controls: global budgets, enforced by limits on price increases for insurance. Vlhen it comes to the question of extending coverage, the plans diverge entirely. Clinton relie:; 0n mandates: employers have to pay 80 percent of the cost of a basic benefits package, while employees contribute 20 per- cent. The government guarantees small employers that they won't have to pay more than a fixed percentage of their payroll costs for health insurance. It also offers sub- sidies to the unemployed and requires them to obtain coverage through the alliances. Cooper, in contrast, has no mandate on employers or indi,iduals: instead, he offers subsidies to individuals who can't afforJ coverage. His plan proposes a total subsidy for workers at or below the poverty line. The subsidy would decline along the income scale, up to 200 percent of the poverty line, at which point it would disappear altogether. The result is that Cooper's plan promises universal \"access\" to care rather than the cradle-to-grave guarantee of Clinton's. Most of its critics identify the Jack of universal cover- age as a devastating fault in the Cooper plan. But in our view, it's a central_ strength. Cooper shares with Clinton a desire to extend insurance to the 37 million Ameri- cans who currently lack it He too wants govern- ment to regulate the insurance industry in order to remove the barriers that make it impossible for many people to obtain coverage, and leave millions more in fear of losing it. He too thinks government has an obligation to help the poor and near-poor pay for health care. Beyond that, however, Cooper regards medical coverage as a matter of personal responsibility, not a new entitlement. This distinction is ''hat makes Cooper's proposal the true New Democrat alternative, and marks Clinton's as a more traditionally liberal one. The New Democrat says that once goYernment removes the barriers that prevent its citizens from taking care oft11emselves, it's up to indi- viduals to act on t11eir own behalf. A more circumscribed view of government's proper role echoes throughout Cooper's plan. Cooper tries to encourage good behavior with incentives such as the tax cap, rather than compelling it by force of law. The result is a system far less bureaucratic and complex than Clin- DECEMBER 6, 1993 THE NEW REPUBLIC 7 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 51 of mise places no mandate L':l employers or indi\\'iduals. And unlike Clinton, he does not deploy a backup ::;;r::'.\u00b7::tus of price controls, should managed competit ion fail to \\,\u00b7ork its magic. If people still wish, in full knowledge of what they are doing, and with greater market efficiency, to dernte more of their paychecks to health care, Cooper lets tl:l \u00b7:i. It is not certain that Cooper would rlo a better job tL~-. :=:;,-,,on in controlling costs. But he is 11i!ling to face more directly the fact of limits to our resources and choices. Clinton spells out a generous basic benefits package that insurers must offer for a legally controlled price, and plans to make it e\\'en more generous in the future. He has includec1. sops for unions and for both large and small employers. There will be no sacrifices in \"quality.\" Gains in efficiency-along with a small tax increase-will pay for it all. Cooper recognizes that \\;'e can't have more and more for Jess and less. His plan would defer the issue of the basic benefits package to the national health care board that his bill would create. It would be up to the board to determine \\\\'hat procedures are \"medically appropriate.\" This is probably necessary as political cover; Cooper is no more incli:-ied to crow [{,),about rationing than Clinton. But Cooper seems to \";\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7:'understand that the only way to get a handle on the explosion in costs is to declare that basic insurance can- not pay for treatments that are not cost-effecti\\'e. What you lose, of course, is the historic watershed of completely guaranteed coverage, which is the major social (and political) attraction of a mandate-based scheme. But whether they are applied to businesses or individuals, mandates are fraught with problems. A requirement that employers provide insurance is sure to cost some jobs. It also ignores the social reality that fewer and fewer Amt>rican workers are tied. to a single com- pany; because mandates of all kinds are a hassle and an expense, employers are increasingly using part-time workers and subcontracting for their labor needs. A health care mandate accelerates this trend even as it clings to the old system. An individual m;:.:1date such z.s the one that forms the basis of the liberal Republican alternative sponsored by Chafee is easier to justify on the same grounds that states require drivers to obtain auto insurance: Those who don't get coverage are free riders, passing costs to everyone else on the road. But an individ- ual health care mandate must be accompanied by the ~eans for everyone to fulfill it. Otherwise, the govern- ment is in effect outlawing poverty. And even with a gen- erous subsidy, an individual mandate is nearly impossible to enforce. People who show up in emergency rooms without insurance still have to be treated. Clinton's plan actually reli~,; on a mixed mandate; as such, it combines some problems of each; it chills job cre- ation, entails massive regulatory power for state-based alliances and applies an unenforceable requirement to 8 THE NEW REl'UllLIC DECEMBER 6, 1993 i11di,\u00b7iclu:1k Of ,1 Cuoper-t; scheme. Tli;ll number is largely a function of hO\\\\. generously the b,-,\\._ ernrnent decides to subsidize lo\\1'-\\1-;1ge workers. At the lel'el Cooper's subsidies are now set: a family of four with an income ofs21,000 would get a subsidy of about s2,000 (toward the purchase of insurance that now costs an a\\'er- age of about s4,000). We'd prefer a more generous pack- age, but under current fiscal conditions, the initial goal should be to remove the structurally uninsured-the \\\\\u00b7orking poor and those between jobs-from the ran ks of the uncovered. After that, the government could attack a smaller and better-defined uninsured population with targeted incentiws. If, for nample, ~::;\u00b7gc r:c:rr:bcrs of young people still failed to 01-.11in '.'nlirit>~. tht>v might be reached through deferred loan repayments. The single biggest problem wiL~ Cooper's bi!! is that, like Chafee's, it may encourage the dumping of low-wage workers onto the public system. If ,he government pro- vides a substantial subsidy, employers will feel less pres- sure to maintain coverage- especially if government actually requires individuals to obtain insurance. This is not necessarily a bad thing; evolution toward a system where individuals rather than businesses shop for health care probably makes sense in the long run. But it is a political problem. As the changeover occurs, mo,e and more An1ericans will be insured with the aid of a govern- ment subsidy. If it happens quickly, this means tax increases to cover the expense. This is an implication the Republican supporters of Chafee's proposal don't seem to have noticed yet. But then, being Republicans, they haven't even stipulated how they intend to pay for the generous subsidies (up to 250 percent of poverty) in their plan. A good place to start is Clinton's proposed seventy-five-cenFa-pack cigarette tax, which Cooper and Chafee should endorse as sound policy in any case. If the re\\enue isn't needed to pay _for the uninsured, the money can go toward reducing the deficit. No plan is likely to pass next year without the support of the blocks of votes represented by Clinton, Chafee and Cooper. We'd like to see a compromise based on the Cooper version because we think its market-based mech- anisms v.ill work best to co\\\u00b7er the uninsured and control costs without creating a bureaucratic nightmare. But Cooper's plan wins our support because of an additional virtue, which is connected to the others: restraint. This is a quality appropriate to the enactment of the first major social program since the mixed successes of the War on Poverty and the Great Society. Those examples should encourage liberals not to remake the errors that led to the general distrust of government action, but rather to learn from them in order to win back the public confi- dence that old-style liberalism lost. Unlike the Clinton plan, Cooper's doesn't envision wholesale remaking of !-resent arrangements. It builds on the system we already have; it's a real step forward, but one that is based on New Democrat pragmatism, rather tl1an Old Democrat ambition. \\\\le think it's the place to :;tan.

Jim Cooper is the latest darling of health care reform. according to much or Washington. The Business Roundtable en\u00b7 dorsed much of his plan. The nation's gov\u00b7 ernors are reported leaning his way. Even Ross Perot invited him to lunch. But while the desperate search for an alternative to President Clinton's health reform plan is understandable, everyone should think twice before embracing Mr. Cooper's proposal. \"Clinton Heavy\" may be terrible, but \"Clinton Lite\" is not a whole lot belier. Rep. Cooper\"s bill owes~ts popularity to the absence of many of the Clinton plan's worst features-employer mandates, price controls, mandatory purd1asing alliances, etc. It even avoids the individual mandate popular in some .. conservative \u00b7 !\u00b7eforms. However. a closer look at Rep. Cooper's proposal reveals its own litany of horrors. Like its Clinton progenitor, the Cooper plan is based on the untested concept of \"managed competition.\" As Alain En\u00b7 thoven, one or the leading proponents or managed competition admits, managed competition is not \"a free market system.\" He is certainly correct about that. It is pos\u00b7 sible to have either managed health care or to have open competition in health care \u00b7\u00b7ices. It is not possible to have both. ...__,;placed Faith Advocates of managed competition-in\u00b7 eluding both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Cooper- want government regulation to sullsti- tute for market processes. They lack confidence in the ability of health care consumers to make their own decisions. Even more than the PRICING HEALTH CARE Clinton plan. Rep. Cooper's bill is designed to funnel Americans into health mainte- nance organizations. He accomplishes this by limiting the tax deductibility of em- ployer-provided insurance to the lowest\u00b7 cost plan available. Rep. Cooper and other advocates or managed competition have a tremendous faith in the ability of managed care to con- trol health care costs. However. a 1992 re- port lly A. Foster l:liggins Cu. indicated that half of employers who switched from non-managed care plans to Hl\\!Os said their HMO rates were as high or higher than their previous rates. Likewise, a Con- gressional Budget Office report found that shifting Medicare patients to Hl\\IOs \"had Cooper Plan, Clinton Lite little or no effect on hospital use and costs.\" In addition, a recent RAND Corp. study indicates that managed care providers were as likely as fee-for-service providers to perform unnecessary proce- dures. By pushing Americans into managed care, the Cooper bill holds the potential to severely disrupt the traditional doctor-pa- tient relationship. Managed competition changes insurers, in Mr. Enthoven's words, from \"financial intermediaries with expertise in underwriting risks\" into \u00b7\u00b7health care delivery systems ... organiz- ing, managing and purchasing medical care.\" In short, advocates of managed compe- tition believe physicians should be respon-notice improved access to coverage under proposed insurance reforms, overall pre- miums could increase substantially. A study by the American Society of Actuar\u00b7 ies found that claims costs of guaranteed- issue policies averaged 38'7c higher. This confirms earlier studies by Community Mutual Insurance of Ohio and Tillinghast Corp. that showed premiums increasing by 25% to 35'7c. under guaranteed issue. Even the liberal advocacy group Families USA Foundation estimates that 50% of small groups would experience a rate in- crease if guaranteed issue is adopted. The net result would be to force many small businesses to cln;p their current in- surance coverage. While some currently uninsured workers would move into the in- The Cooper health care bill-like the Clinton plan-- is based on the mistaken belief that government can man\u00b7 age a marketplace better than consumers themselves. sible to insurers. rather than to the pa- tient. Thus. the patient's choice of physi- cian should be limited to give the insurer increased bargaining power with the doc- tor. And insurers must have increasing control over physicians' choice of treat- ment, so that insurers can \"apply quality assurance or review of appropriateness.\" Managed care plans are notorious for sec- ond-guessing physicians and limiting ac- cess to some types of treatment. As Swiss medical philosopher Ernest Truffer has notecl, the increasing interjec- tion of third parties between doctor and patient .. amounts to a rejection of the 111erl- irnl ethic-which is to care for a patient ac- cording to the latter's specific [medical I requirements-in favor of a veterinary ethic, which consists in caring for the sick animal not in accordance with its specific medical needs. but according to the re- quirements uf its master and owner, the person responsible for meeting any costs incurred ... A second major problem with the Cooper plan is its requirement that insur- ers must accept all applicants, regardless of whether they are in perfect health or on their death beds. That includes those with active illnesses, such as cancer or AIDS. The goal for such a requirement, known as \u00b7\u00b7guaranteed issue.\u00b7\u00b7 is to increase access to insurance tur individuals with pre-exist- ing medical conditions. But at what cost? Studies indicate that while employers with high\u00b7risk employees would certainly surance market, others, who now have in- surance, would be forced out. Thus the Cooper bill could actually increase the number of uninsured. These problems are compounded by the ability of people to \"game\" the system. The reason that healthy people purchase health insurance is the fear that they may lack such insurance if they become sick. However, if health insurance becomes available reg-anlless of health status, much of the incentive to pay for insurance while healthy is removed. Since the Cooper bill does not require people to purchase in- surance, it would become a rational choice to do without health insurance until the need arises. Automobile insurance provides a good analogy. If it were possible to purchase auto insurance after an accident occurred, would people he likely to purchase insur- ance before the accident? Rep. Cooper would also require modi- fied \u00b7\u00b7community rating\u00b7\u00b7 of insurance pre- miums. Insurers would be prohibited from basing premiums on an individual's health. Healthy people and sick people would pay the same tor insmance. But insurance is a business of risk allo- cation, in which the insurer receives pay- ment in exchange for agreeing to cover the expense of certain risks. The cost and scope of coverage is determined by mor- bidity /mortality statistical analysis. To the degree that insurers are prevented from basing their contracts on such actu-aria! values, other policyholders will be forced to absorb the additional costs. Thus, in order to provide coverage for a person with AIDS. a person without AIDS must pay a higher premium. Moreover, the additional costs are highly regressive, forcing the highest mar- ginal costs on those least able to afford the increase. For example, if community rat- ing causes the premiums for a family pol- icy to increase by Sl.000, that's a ss; sur- charge for a family earning only S20,000 a year, but only a 1% surcharge for a family earning $100,000. We should also recognize that commu- nity rating relieves individuals of the re- sponsibility for unhealthy lifestyles. There is no question that individuals who smoke; drink, use drugs. practice unsafe sex. have poor diets, and fail to exercise have far higher health costs than individuals with healthy lifestyles. In fact, the top IO causes of death in the U.S. are all lifestyle related. By spreading the cost over the entire pop- ulation, community rating and guaranteed issue \"socialize\" the costs in the truest sense or the word. Lobbyists vs. Consumers Unlike President Clinton's bill. Rep. Cooper's does not spell out the services to be covered under the minimum standard benefits package, leaving that task up to an independent commission. This is ap\u00b7 parently an attempt to insulate decisions on what benefits to include trum politiral pressure. But based on history ancl human nature, inclusion in the mandattd lltne\u00b7 fits package is much more likely tu he based on the relative lobbying strength uf various providers than on a rational view of medical necessity. Whate1\u00b7er benefits are mandated will increase the t'ost of in- surance. And consumers will be depril'ed of the ability to make individual choices regarding the benefits they wish tu pur\u00b7 chase. Ultimately, the Cooper !Jill-like the Clinton plan-is based on the mistaken he- lief that government can manag\u00b7e a mar- ketplace better than consumers tht>m- selves. The talk on Capitol Hill is that health care reform will ultimately be a compn>- mise between rhe Clinton and Cooper bills. A compromise between a bad plan ancl a not-quite-as-bad plan cannot possibly lw good for the American people. Mr. T1111mr \\\\'11shi11g/OI/.

By HILARY STOCT written by Rep. Jim Cooper m .. Tenn. l gained new attention this week when the Business Roundtable supported it 3.S a \"starting point\" for congressional deliberations on health care. To many people. the Cooper bill has become the leading alternative to Presi\u00b7 dent Clinton's health plan. the rallying symbol for those who consider the White House proposal to be too rich. too reguia\u00b7 tory and too bureaucratic. But to others, including the administration. the Cooper plan is too timid and too vague. Here is how the two bills compare on the major issues: Coverage. The Clinton bill would guar\u00b7 antee health coverage for all Americans. The Cooper bill wouldn't. although its authors argue it would remove so many obstacles that nearly everyone could ob\u00b7 tain health insurance. Under the White House plan. all em\u00b7 ployers would be required to pay, on behalf of each full-time worker, at least 80% of the cost of the average price of a federally de\u00b7 fined health-benefits package. Lesser con\u00b7 tributions would be required for part-time workers. Poor and unemployed people would get government subsidies to help pay for coverage. The Cooper bill would require all em\u00b7 ployers to offer their employees a health plan. but it wouldn't require them to pay for it. It would provide subsidies to help low-income people buy health insur\u00b7 ance. Both the Clinton and Cooper proposals would outlaw a number of insurance prac- tices that make it difficult for people to obtain coverage. They would forbid insur\u00b7 ance firms from denying coverage to people with so-called \"pre-existing\" medi\u00b7 cal conditions. from raising premiums on the sick and from dropping high-risk peo\u00b7 pie from health policies. Benefits. The Clinton bill would es- tablish a national benefits package for every American -including coverage for hospitalization. physician visits. prescrip\u00b7 tion drugs and a range of preventive services like childhood immunizations. The Cooper bill also provides for a stan\u00b7 dard benefits package. but the details would be determined later by a federal commission. and would be subject to con\u00b7 gressional approval. Guidelines in the Coo\u00b7 per legislation say the package would have to cover preventive care. prescription drugs and medically appropriate services and procedures. Mr. Cooper said this week he is willing to specify an interim benefits package in the bill. Purchasing Pools. Both plans would unite businesses and consumers in insur- ance-buying pools. The pools would collect premiums from individuals and businesses to pay for various plans providing the standard benefits package. Individuals then would select from among the plans. The idea behind the pools is to spread insurance risk and increase the negotiat- ing power of consumers in the health-care market. But there are big differences between the Clinton and the Cooper plans. The Clinton bill would require all em-ployers with fewer than 5.000 workers to join the \u00b7\u00b7health <.tlliances\" in their re- gions. The alliances would be set up and super;ised by the states. They would monitor the quality of health plans. and would impose ceilings on health\u00b7insurance premiums. The Cooper bill would set up regional. nonprofit. state-chartered \"health-plan purchasing cooperatives.\" Only busi\u00b7 nesses with fewer than 100 employees would be required to join the cooperatives, which wouldn't have as many powers as the Clinton health alliances. Cost Containment. Both bills seek to stimulate competition in the health indus\u00b7 try in order to hold down prices. But the Clinton plan also would place legal ceilings on premiums for the standard benefits package. Both would offer incen\u00b7 tives to encourage enrollment in health\u00b7 maintenance organizations and other pre\u00b7 paid networks of doctors and hospitals. Taxation of Health Benefits. Ten years after enactment of the Clinton bill, em\u00b7 ployees would have to pay taxes on any health benefits they receive that aren \u00b7 t in the standard benefits package -unless they were receiving these extra benefits as of Jan. 1. 1993. Employers could continue to deduct all their health-benefits costs. The Cooper bill would limit employer deductions to the cost of the lowest-price \"accountable health plan\" in each region. For workers. health benefits would con\u00b7 tinue to be tax free. The Cooper plan also would allow individuals to deduct any portion of their health benefits that they pay themselves. Both plans would allow self-employed people to deduct 100% of the cost of their health coverage. Financing. The Clinton plan would raise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products. It would cap spending on Medi\u00b7 care and Medicaid. the two big govern\u00b7 ment health programs. and use the savings to help finance universal coverage. It also would assess a 1% payroll charge on large corporations that opt not to join the regional alliances. The Cooper plan would use revenues raised from limiting employer deductions for health benefits to finance subsidies for low-income people. Subsidies. The Clinton plan would sub\u00b7 sidize health premiums for people whose income is less than 150% of the poverty level. and for businesses with fewer than 75 workers and wages that average under S24.000. It also would have the federal government absorb 80% of the health-in\u00b7 surance costs of people who retire before age 65. The Cooper plan would subsidize health premiums for people who earn less than 200% of the poverty level. Medicare. Both plans would leave it virtually alone. Sponsorship. The Clinton plan is spon\u00b7 sored almost entirely by Democrats. with the exception of Sen. James Jeffords (R . Vt.l. The Cooper plan has bipartisan sponsorship, consisting mostly of conser\u00b7 vative Democrats and moderate Republi\u00b7 cans. While Mr. Cooper has gotten most of the publicity, the legislation's other chief sponsor in the house is Rep. Fred Grandy IR .. Iowa}.

For more than a year he has shed a national reform plan that, some respects, resembles Cana-s system because it relies on :es and a greater government e in health care. effords says taxes are a better asure of a household 's or an em-?er's ability to pay for health in-ance, and would therefore be a I er deal for small businesses and sumers in Vermont compared to :it they would pay in insurance rniums. for businesses, especially those inesses that have relatively low-tried people, it would be a lot aper for them,\"\u00b7 Jeffords said in interview in his Washington ate office. \"And unfortunately 1ave a lot of those in.Vermont .\" oy. Howard B. Dean, like Sen-Republicans, opposes raising ~s for health care, even if they laced insurance premiums . TJ argues that thP HousP phm pushed by Speaker.Ralph G. Wright and Democratic Leader Sean P. Campbell of Rockingham, would put Vermont's taxes out of whack with its neighbors and .deter people with higher incomes who start busi-\u00b7nesses and create jobs. Dean also says a tax-based plan would never pass the Republican-controlled Vermont Senate and would be less acceptable to the U.S. Congress , which must change a.fed-eral law if Vermont wants to get an early start on health care reform. A tax-based health care system may be fairer, Dean says, but it is useless unless it can pass and get all Vermonters insured by next January. \"Being the right thing to do is dif-ferent than doing something that isn't going to pass,\" said Dean'~ spoke~man, Glenn 'right and haven't gotten anywhere with it then you haven't done the right thing.\"\u00b7 Dean's own health reform pro-posal wquld require all employers to pay at least half of the insurance premium for their workers. An ex-panded Medicaid program would ease the cost for families and em-ployers, and subsidies would help the uninsured . For a married em-ployee earning $20,000, the em-ployer share would be at least $2,034 and the worker's share would be no more than $2,034. Both the employer and the work-er would fare better under even the highest tax rates mentioned so far for Vermont -about 8 percent on employer payroll and 3.5 percent on household income. For the same married employee, the business would pay $1,600 and the worker would pay $700 under the tax-based plan, which shifts costs to wealthier individuals and em-ployers paying higher wages. Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., lit into Dean and his proposal Thurs-day. Sanders compared the gover-nor to former president Ronald Re-agan and his zeal to protect wealthy people from higher taxes. Sanders said health care, like ed-ucation, should be is a right guar-anteed by the state and financed in a progressive way. \"What the governor has done is adopted the Republican position of making sure that the money is raised from working people, low-income people and not from the very wealthy,\" Sanders said in an interview. \"Nothing new about that. I see this every single day right here in the Congress from con-servative Republicans .\" \"That is exactly what the gover-nor's so-called health care reform is all about,\" Sanders continued. \"It raises taxes on working people and the poor and protects the interests of the wealthy. And somehow when we do that, when we're very nice to the rich they will trickle down on us and provide us with jobs and all kinds of benefits? It's a fraud. Re-aganomics has not worked.\" Interestingly enough, Sanders and Jeffords have a few things in common on health care. Jeffords' own reform proposal would replace insurance premiums with a 4 per-cent federal tax on employer payroll and a 2 percent tax on employee in- come, with an additional income tax that would apply to the wealthi-est Americans. The federal government would distribute money to states, which would run their own health care systems in ways that encourage competition among networks of doc-tors and hospitals that resemble health maintenance organizations . Jeffords said he was comfortable with his position favoring taxes, even though it runs counter to Re-. publican philosophy . When more Vermonters look at the bottom line, he said, they will find the tax-based system more acceptable, in spite of Dean's concerns about the state's ~r~ income tax rates. \"If you've got more cash i,n _tour pocket, it's going to cost you \u00b7less ... then you're not going to be un-happy,\" Jeffords sai<'I. Jeffords noted that the Vermont Retail Association, representing more than 700 small businesses , has endorsed a health care plan similar to his own - a state-run health care system financed with taxes on employer payroll and household income. Although he at one time consid-ered payroll taxes, Clinton and many others in Washington now say it would be unrealistic to expect Congress to raise taxes, even if they were to replace insurance premi-ums. Jeffords is nevertheless the only Republican in Congress to support Clinton's health bill, saying it would allow Vermont the flexibility to continue with its own health care reform initiative This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 57 of 179' I ~t:;.t:j-~-1~~4 19. 1993 Cops and -It May 'HJke a National Police Force to Moni~or the Qinton Health Plan Here are 1 W. ol. the ponn, peuaJ-tiet and enforcement authorities p;opmed iD the Health Security Act dat the president leDt to Caigress: AD American dtir,ens not speci6cally ex-. empted be teqUired to relister \u00b7unre.

Players and Payers By Michael Graetz and James Tobin The President and First Lady have achieved re- markable consensus on a truly revolutionary principle: all Ameri\u00b7 cans must be entitled to adequate medical services without re- gard to ability 10 pay or risk or ill health. Now it's up to Congress to embody that principle in law, a histor- ic opportunity comparable to the en- actments or Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965. Unfortunately, excessive solicitude for existing institutions and interests, and the difficulties or reconciling them with the Clintons' fundamental princi- ples, have made their proposal a bu- reaucratic and legalistic morass. The issue is much more basic than what is now preoccupying Washing- ton: whether the reforms would mod- estly raise the Federal deficit in the short term, as the Congressional Budget Office said this week, and whether federally mandated insur- ance premiums should be \"on budg- et.\" The biggest flaw in the Adminis- 1rat10T1 proposal is the requirement that employers pay the premiums - a mandate whose awkwardness and un- f a1rness stand out starkly ma system dedicated to universal coverage. Employer-based medical insurance 1s a historical accident -one that no one would choose now if given a clean slate. During World War II, trade unions and employers circumvented Fl'deral wage ceilings by offering medical fnnge benefits. Their popu- larity and generosity boomed after the war. as Congress sheltered them with\u00b7 out hm11 from income and Social Secu- rity taxes. The fact 1ha1 employers write the checks for medical care does not mean 1ha1 1hey bear the full costs. They can generally shift some costs to workers m reduced take-home pay and some 10 customers in higher prices. The sure losers are taxpayers who have 10 make up 1he revenue lost 10 1he 1ax sheller. :\\1uch of the Administration's 1,342\u00b7 page proposal is devoted to expedients intended 10 m1t1ga1e the difficulties and anomalies of employer mandates .

C'meritus professor of economics at Yale. won the Nobel Pr1:C' 1n Economic Science 1n 1981. It's a hopeless task. Some families have no employed members. Some have two or more. Many employees work part time. Some have more than one job. Americans frequently change jobs,. employers, work locations, places -even states -of residence. Responsibilities for paying a fam- ily's premiums would frequently be divided among several sources -var- ious employers, governments and the family itself -in proportions varying month to month. Keeping track of these liabilities would surely involve extensive paperwork and administra- tive hassle, contrary to Mrs. Clinton's claim that an employer mandate elim- inates the need to track individuals. Nor would the new system be equi- table. Equity demands that public sub- sidies, direct or via employers, be a larger share of premiums and of in- come the poorer the family. Equity also requires that families' subsidies be the same if their incomes are the same. But in the Clinton plan, subsi- dies depend more on the size of em- ployers' payrolls than on families' ability to pay. The system is also full of bad incentives -for example, not to hire workers with dependents. It's individuals who get sick and need medical services. It's individuals and families whose ability to pay is the HEALTH CARE SECOND OPINIONS An occasional series. natural criterion of equity. It's individ- uals who must be guaranteed cover- age. So it is it's individuals who must be required to have insurance . Let employers help pay the premiums if they wish, but count those payments as taxable income. Treat the self-em- ployed exactly the same as employees. Let people choose where they will buy insurance. One option should be a kind of Medicare for those under 65; call it perhaps Fedmed. Fedmed would offer the basic uni- versal medical insurance package at premiums that in total would cover the costs. Let private health plans offer the same package, provided they do not pick and choose members or charge higher premiums .for risky cases. As in the Clinton plan, it would probably be necessary to collect mon- ey from plans that happen to have low- risk clienteles and distribute them to plans with high-risk members . With these provisions , Fedmed would be protected against becoming Abandon the employer mandate. the last-resort insurer of bad hsks. As in Medicare itself (which would continue as at present), people could choose their own physicians and oth\u00b7 er providers . Like Medicare, Fedmed would have low administrative costs and would wield enough clout to limit payments to providers. Like Medi- care, Fedmed would let people change employment status, residence or family situation without losing cov- erage. But it need not be a monopoly . Federal subsi<lies to individuals would take the forin-Of refundable tax credits, \"vouchers\" payable to Fedmed or other Jn'.surers. For low- income families the subsidies would cover the whole premium of the basic package; most other families would receive vouchers at least as valuable to them as the current tax exemption for employer-provided insurance. A family of four in the 28 percent tax bracket with a \u00b7$4,300 insurance package would receive vouchers of $1,204 -28 percent of the premium. No family would face an out-of-pocket cost of more than 8 or 10 percent of their income for the basic package. This plan would not require new broad-based taxes or new burdens on employers. One source of financing would be redirecting the Clintons' proposed subsidies to employers and low-income people, estimated at $100 billion in 1999 (somewhat more by the Congressional Budget Office). Elimi- nating the tax shelter for employer- paid premiums would contribute $125 billion, and our plan would replace Medicaid acute care for those under 65 ($75 billion more). Robert Reischauer of the C.B.0. destroyed a semantic attraction of employer mandates when he testified that federally required purchases of insurance should be included in the budget. Their popularity is waning among businesses and in Congress, where support appears to be growing for the plans of Representative Jim Cooper and Senator John Chafee; un- fortunately, these plans do not assure universal coverage in this century. Our proposal is not a radical recon- struction. It builds on the best of existing institutions. A victory for it would be a victory for the basic prin- ciples that the Clintons have so elo- quently set forth. 0 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 62 of 179;N\u00b0r\u00b7 ~ ' ' ' ' ~\u00b7 ', . ~' ' tJ j !Ill I ,.

Medicare those who are well-insured today fear los-. 1ng their coverage or suffering devastating cutbacks. Nearly everyone has heard about James Mc- Gann-the plaindff 1n a notorious unsucccssfu] law- suit-who saw his employer reduce his lifetime health coverage limit from $I million to $5.000 the year after he leaTned he had AIDS, or kno-ws some- one who has. lost health coverage. The current failing health care financing apparatus in the UniLed States has resulted from a series of in- crementa] policy decisions that ha~ had little or nothing to do with the development of a coherent na- tional health care system. Employer-provided health co\\erage received an important stimulus from the ex- e-mptjon of such fringe benefits from the wage and price <.'Ontrols of the J 940s. This exemption al:\\owed emp1o}ers to ray lheir employees additional fringe benefi~ when they wen\u00b7 barred from increasing cash wages. An enduring furlher boost was provided by the in- come and Social Security tax exemptions for recipi- ents of employer-provided hea1Lh insurance. These exemptions became more valuable due to the inco:me tax bracket creep and Social Security tax rate in- creases of recent dec..arles.

By the same token, union negotiators have found 1t easier to negotiate increases In health benefits than greater cash wages for t.heir members. The Employee Retiremem Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which w4is concerned principally with protecting employees' pension benefits~ made em- ployers' se1f-insurance of their employees' benefits particularly desirable through a little-no- ticed and undebaLed provision that insulated em- ployer self-1nsuranc:t> plans from state premium taxes and regulations. Recent court int.erpretarions of this \"preemption\"~ provision have broadly extended self\u00b7 insuring emplO)et-s' protections to permit m\"ny self- insurers to a\\'o1d contributing to state health instff- ance reform programs. One additional unfo1\u00b7cseen consequence of the ERISA incentives for employer self-insurance is that employers and their employ- ees--rathcr than insurance companies- -havc borne a greater share of the buTd(\"n of escalating health care cost~. More than one half of the increase in em- ployees' average real wages during the period from 1974 to 1989 took the form of increases in the costs of hea h h benefits. While uneven and often unfair in their cfft>cL.,, lhese various tax and otheT inceutives for cmp~oyer health coverage have enjoyed a degree of success. Today, emp\\oyers provide hea'th insurance to about 60 pcrc:ent of the U.S. population and contribute more than $200 hilUon toward health insurance cov- erage employees suiy mot .;;-n;:rradditionai-15:0-bitltoiYror\u00b7---- their coverage and tftat of their families. The income and Social Security tax revenue that the governme11t loses due to compensation taking this form rather than cash wages has been estimated to amount to about $65 billion this year. But the days when this nation could rely on volun- tary employer provision of health insur~nce as the bac:kb~ne of health care finance are now past. The ~-latton o~~ealth care costs-coupled with increas- mg JOb mob1hty and insecurity and the efforts of i11- ~urers and employers alike to reduce costs by select- ing people with Jow risks or efoninat1ng coverage for people. when they become unhealth)'-has made health msurance coverage a major financial concern for vinuaJl}1 aU Americans.

Often uninsured or underinsured patients have to turn to coMly emergency rooms for routine medical care and forego preventh\u00b7e care altogether. Hospitals rur- insuted patients {and their insurers) pay hospital.s more to cover the costs of both Lh.e uninsured and underinsured. In the cunent voluntary. employer-based financ- ing system, health insurance tax incentives must be large enough to encourage employers to provide heaJth insurance they would oot otherwise buy. or else they are simply a waste of government larg~sse Lotally without merit. But whenever they actually en- courage such purchase~ at the margin, t1U.')' aho 1-e- w;ud people for conduct they would have undertaken in .any event.

Moreover, the existence of the medical safety net--porous as it is-demands mandatory health in- surance coverage. Otherwise people who experience remote risks,, but expensive costs, of bad heallh will be paid for not through their own insurance, but in- stead through the insurance of others, government- subsidizcd or financed emerE,rency room care, or-at least after declarations of bank.ruJ>lcy--the publ\\.c fisc (via Medicaid or otherwise). Mandated universal basic health insurance coverage has the potential not only tD reduce opportunities for adverse selection and cost-and Tisk-shifting. but also to reduce adminis\u00b7 trati,e costs through a universally accepted health in\u00b7 ~ranee card and simplified billing. (Perhaps as in Germany, we could exempt those with high incomes from mandated coverage, jf we could effectively monitor bankruptcy and Medicaid fraud, but. con- cerns about the burden of a health insurance man~ date on the rich surely do not explain the resistance to mandated coverage.

However, neither the wisdom nor the inevitabi1ity of a mandate has been accepted by many of the .key players in the health care reform debate.

A mandate, after aH, is no burden to those who are al- re.ady complying with it. Of course, the decision by some politic.at actors to rely on a purely voluntary health insurance sy1;t.em may be based on an abiding philosophical n:jection of mandated health coverage. This, however, seems un- 11kdy (or at least somewhat hypocritical), since none of these players is clamoring for the repeat of mandatory hospital insurance under Part A of Medicare. Why an Employer Mandate Vfou ld Be a Big Mistake Many key political acton seem to have accepted the view that a mandate is necessarv to make healLh care reform work, but ha\\'e chosen t'o mandate employers to provide health insurance coverage for Lhe]r em- ployees. This group ind11des President Clinton, the Pepper Commission, Lhe chairman of the House Committee on Wa)\"\" and Means. and many other House and Senate Democrats who ha,1e either explic- )dy endorsed an employer mandate or emhrn<.'Cd its cousin, a p1ay-or-pay system, which mandates em- ployer co,\u00b7erage either directly or thTough a payroH tax.

This means that an employer ma.ndate would ratse the costs of hiring and retaining workers most for smal1 businesses and thus would almost cenainiy be accompanied by some new subsidies for small or mar- ginal businesses--additional charges on the Treasury that seem unlikely either to be weH-targeted or et)Ul- table, For example. subsidies based so1e1y on the size of a business-whether in terms of numbers of em- ployees, assets,. or receipts-would not disting1.iish those able to afford the additiona~ costs of employer- mandated heall.h co\\erage from those Jess able. Ad- ding a requirement that a buslneu demonstrate need would increase administrative costs and probably re- quire a bureaucracr for-adjudication. Subsidies ha~cd on the average wage levels of employees, wlnch would be more generous for businesses with lower av- erage wages, might be somewhat beuer 1argeted on the whole--inasmuch as a mandate to buy a standard health insurance package for each employee can be viewed as in effect an increase 1n the required mini- mum wage-but precisely because it would use aver- ages, \u00b7would still be inefficient and inequitable.

The fundamental problem is that we are not de- signing a hea1th care delivery or financing system from scratch. but rather are trying to make su~tan\u00ad tial improvements in what we have now and t.o do so in a manner that does not either transfer unwar- ranted windfalls lO people or firms or impose undue or inequirable burdens on them.

Recognizing this lO be a trdns1uonal issue, however. demands that we address explidtly the quest1ons of where we are heading and where we want to end up. The enactment of employer mandates in this roand of health care reform would make it far more likely that we will forever have a health insurance de- livery system tied lo employment, rcLLher tha~ ~ sys- tem in which one's hea\\th insurance coverage 1s mde- pendent of where or for w~~m on: wo~ks. If thelr work.\u00b7 1ng lives, as of I 1~if we-ar~~-aOOttMlisc11gagi1g heaJlh cover:tgtlrom job lock or job changes, moving in the direction of an employer mandate seems a very bad pTescriplion, indeed. As l indicated earlier, the pt\"OVision of health insur- an~e by employers largely resuJted from wage alld prtce control rules and tax incentives; today, only the latter remain jmportant. The current t.ax system >ub-- sidizes employer~provided health insurance and greatly favors it over coverage tha~ people purchase for themselves. If health insurance is provided by an employer. the costs-inc1uding those borne by the empJoyec, if the employer has a so-called cafeteria plao-can be exduded from both income and Social Security taxes. By contrast, health insurance that in- dividuals or families purchase fo1\u00b7 themselves almosl always must be paid for with after-tax dol- lars----ex.cepl for coverage purchased by the self-em- ployed, who have been allowed to deduct 25 percent of the costs ofheeihh insui-ance(and, under the Clin- ton proposal, would be permitted to deduct J 00 per- cent). The tax system serves therefore as a po\u00b7wenul inducement for employers to pn>vide health jnsur- ance direcdy to their employees~ rather than paying ca5b wages and leu1ng the employees purchll!e their own health insurance. \u00b7rhe current tax benefil is. of course, wonh more to people in higher tax brack- ets-those with greater income-and, among e1n- ployce; with equal wages, to thvse who receive greater health benefits from their employers. 'J 'hus., the :subsjdy cannot be defended on the grounds of equity. In addition, many critics of the cu1Tent tax exclu- cSion contend that by both lower1ng .and hiding the ac- lual -costs of health insurance, it contributes substa n- tially to rising health coses.

ID c<>nsidet-ing the effect of the tax exclusion mittee on Ways and Means, recently made in another on health care costs, it is critical to distinguish the context; purchase of insurance from the purchase of health care. It may be that by lowering the costs of more ex--pensive health insurance plans, the tax favoritism somewhat reduces the likelihood that employees will choose less expensive managed care insurance plans offered hy their employers. It is dear, however* that the freedom that fee-for-service plans offer their en~ roUees to choose their own doctors also plays a major rok in the American public's resistance to health maintenance organizations.

These figures. approximate though they may be~ certainly suggest that within the existing system there is enough money to fund a standard package of insur- ance co\"erage for all Americans, including an equita- ble and e\\en generous system of tax credits. This means that with enough reshuff1ing of existing ex- penditures, additional government tinandng may not be necessaTy. In any case, :it is essential to make much more effective use of the revenues that current subs(. dies cost the government. The politica1 trick-and no one should underestimate how great a trick. it is-is to manage a transition from the system We DOW have to the system of individua Uy-based universaJ coverage l have proposed. The re\\renue costs of tl1e current tax exclusion aione would finance tax credits equal to about half the cost of a rcru;onahle pack.age of health inruraace benefits for aU those fami1i('s that are now enjoying the benefits of the exdusion-and the deduct.ion <:ur- rently available for medical expenses might also he repealed in the new system of universal health insur- ance coverage. As recent anaJyses of the t.axa1jon of Social Security benefits or Part B Medicare (physi- cians services) subsidies for high-in(ome people have demonstrated, il is important in designing an equi ta- ble universally available government subsidy that the subsidy be indudable in the taxable incomes of recipi- ents in order to avoid giving greater net benefils to high-income people.

Over time, such credits might even substitute for the subsidies now provided for the voluntary physician coverage (Part B) of Medicare. These tax credits or vouchers should be l:ransfcra- b\\e to employers, insurers, health insurance purchas- ing cooperatives. or heabh pro\\ider networks for the purchase of health coverage. In order to reduce windfalls to lhose employers who are now prov1ding health coverage for their employees, for some per1od of trcmsition employers could be required to maintain their curr-ent effort~. Such a maintenance-of-effort requirement should be structured i11 a manner that allows, or e\"\u00b7en encourages, employers to substitute cash wages. for health in~rance this sort could prove quite difficult to enforce; the potential denial of otherwise available tax deductions could be used to ~Ip induce compli\u00b7 ance. Similarly, the potential denial of tax deductions or Lax credits. or the imposition of a special excise tax, could be used as tools for enforcing the individ- ual mandate t<> oblain health coverage. In order to ensure universal health insuraJlce cov- erage, the system of tax credits or vouchers should be designed lo finance fully the purchase of a standard package of health insurance benefits for people at the poverty level and to decline gradualJy with increases in family income. lt is essential that this be a gradual reduction, both to ensure the financial capacities of families only slightly above the poverty leYel (those. for example. with incomes of up to 200 percent of the poverty Hne) and to min1miie increases in marginal ux rates due t.o the phas.\\ng-down of the credits or vouchers as incomes rise. To guarantee the uni ve nra. l- ity of this fmancing program, and to avoid the politi- cal pitfaJls of limiting the a vallability of its benefits to those who meel some means test while at the same time unduly increasing the tax burdens of those who currently enjoy empioyer-provided heah\u00b7.h 1ruur.i.nce, some minimum amounc of credit should be made available to an individuals (equa. say, to one-ftfth or one-quart.er of the cost of a standard health insurance package}.

The transfe1-s of tax credits or vouchers would be straightforward if cooperatives were to purchase health coverage on the basis of per-capita charges, hut these credits or \\touchers could also be used to fma11ce insurance coverage prov1ding fee-for~rvice reimbursements of doctors or hospitals . ll1is system of finance would function equally weB wherever the lelels or individual co-payments or deductibles for medkt:11 care were set and whether or not balance- biHing were pennitted. '\\!\\'hat is more, although this may not be .so readily apparent, a lax credit or ''oucher mechanism as out- single-payer system similar fo Canadas. The amounts of the tax credits or vouchers would de- fine the federal government's s.hare in financing cov- erage for individuals and families and could do so in a progressive manner. The balance of the health insur- ance costs for individua1s and families could be col~ lected from them by the federal government or state governments through existing tax systems or other- wise.

INDIVIDUALS A recently developed alrernarive to an employer mandate or a government-run '--\"' system is to require individuals to purchase their own coverage for themselves and rheir families, wirh subsidies for the poor. While such an \"individual mandate\" for healrh insurance would be unprecedented, iris an established practice for srates ro require drivers ro carry auro insurance. ADVANTAGES The principal advanrage of an individual mandate is hat ir would provide uni- versal coverage without rhe disadvantages of either rhe government or business- mandate plans. DISADVANTAGES There are several disadvantages to this approach. Individual purchase of insur- ance is administratively more expensive than group purchases, our country has never attempted such a plan before, and that enforcement would be difficult. It is also unclear whether employers who now provide coverage would drop it if individuals were required to purchase plans on their own, which could require even r.iore gov- ernment subsidies to ensure that coverage is affordable to all. One alternative roan individual mandate that some advocate is to give poor and moderate income people subsidies ro buy insurance if they want it, bur nor require rhem ro do so. The main question to ask abour this alrernative is whether the subsidies are adequate to enable people to purchase today's expensive health insurance ,\u00b7 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 79 of 179This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 80 of 179:~1ilif ?;0;:{;>f:~o? :' C R I T I CA L H 0 I~ ~\u00b7. \u00b7~ 1 H I N s u RAN c E .. F 0 R A \u00b7r_ ANDATE DEBATE any believe that requiring employers cover workers would be the kast \\Tuptive approach, since most nericrzns already receive coverage jobs. Nerzrly ~a-thirds the unde-r-65 popularion had 1ployment-based health coverage in 91. And the vast mrzjority of the insured are connected to the work- ce, too. Ill 1991, 84percent of the imured were either workers them- .,es or living in a family in which neone worked full-time with no rir J. of unemployment. The np-...,-ce Benefit Research lmtitute imated thar requiring businesses :th JO or more employees to provide verage to employees who worked 19 \u00b7more hours per week in 1990 would 'Ve reduced the number of uninsured m 36.3 million to 14.4 million. Requiring employers to cover their orkforce is not a new idea - ~publican Presidmt Richard Nixon ;t proposed it in 1971 as an alrerna- e to governmentji11a11ced 11ario11al \u00b7alth imurance. Over the last two \u00b7ades the idea has been championed those across the political spectrum, 1m Senator Edward M Kennedy, Mass., to the American Medical ociation. But the proposal has never ipted, at kast in part because employer mandate for healrh insur- \u00b7e has disadvantages as well as \u00b7antages. Here are the major pros 6 THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR The chief advantage of requiring employers to provide health coverage to workers and dependents is that it would significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans. Only 16 percent of the uninsured lived in families in which no one works. Many believe that another advantage of an employer mandate is that it could help \"level the playing field\" bmYeen businesses that currently do and do not offer insurance. In ou\u00b7r system, most people who need care usually get ir, although often in more expensive and inappropriate settings, like hospital emergency rooms. And the cost of care for uninsured, panicularly hospital care, is often passed along to those wirh insurance in the form of higher prices. Another politically amactive feature to many in Washington is that an employer mandate does not impose major new financial obligations on the strapped federal treasury. Ir also avoids the need for the resulting difficult choice berv.een raising taxes or adding to the federal deficit. For this reason, politicians and organizations support requiring employer-based health insurance because its considered the most \"politically doable\" of the various options for extending coverage to the uninsured. This is in many ways a false advantage, since all Americans end up paying for everyone's health care, whether through taxes, lower wages, or higher prices for products. Nevertheless, in today's political en~ironment, some elected officials see the employer mandate as an alternative to raising taxes. An employer mandate builds on rhe current system, which means less intru- sive changes for individuals and businesses than most orher proposals .- nor an insignificant consideration given that health spending accounts for one of every seven dollars spent in our economy and_any changes will have a significant ripple effect not only on jobs, but on the way every American lives his or her life. Requiring employers to provide health insurance also follows a long tra- dition of government-mandated employee benefits, starting with the mini- mum wage and more recently including family leave and advance notifica- tion of plant closings. ,. '- ( , ' This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 81 of 179THE ARGUMENT AGAINST The primary argumcnr against an employer mandate is simple: it will impose new costs on businesses that could result in bankruptcies. a.c worst, and lost jobs, higher prices, and lower wages at best. While the Clinton plan would provide federal subsidies to cushion the blow for small firms and those who employ large numbers of low-wage workers, critics believe that the new costs could still be significant. . Even if a new health sys.tern docs successfully curb the growth of rnedical costs, mandating health insurance is asking much more of employers than any ocher mandate ever attempted. Critics believe that mandating health insurance will have a negative impact on many businesses and their workers, at lea.st in the short run. {In the long run, some say, job losses in some industries could be offset by new jobs cre- ated in the health sector, such as for home health aides). Even with promised subsidies for small businesses and larger enterprises with large numbers oflow-wage workers (such as courier firms or cleaning services), many businesses will seek to pass along the new costs, either in the form of higher prices to customers, or, more likely, in the form of lower wages and fewer hours for existing workers, and fewer new workers hired. Ironically, critics say, the workers most vulnerable to losing wages or jobs because of a health insurance mandate are those who earn low wages and are currently uninsured -the very individuals the mandate is intended to help. That is because not only is the cost of health insurance disproportion- ately larger the lower wages are, but because employers cannot shift costs back to workers in the form of lower wages if they are already earning a gov- ernment-mandated minimum. \u00b7 Opponents also point out that mandates arc administracively complex to enforce. The government will need information from businesses nor only to ensure char chey are obeying the mandate, bur to determine who is eligible for special subsidies. There arc operational complexities, too, such as decid- ing how to cover children in rwo-worker families, or what to do abouc a spouse who works part-time. Writes Brookings Institution Economise Henry Aaron, a supporter of mandates, \"Employment-based insurance is cumbersome and inefficient in a world in which not everyone works, family units often contain rwo or more employees of different companies, divorce and cohabitation are common, and workers change jobs or move in and out of the labor force frequently. These realities needlessly inflate adminiscracive coses.\" Finally, note opponents, employer mandates can't completely solve the uninsured problem because a significant portion of the uninsured are not attached to the workforce. Even Hawaii, which has had an employer man- dace since 197 4, still had ahouc five percenr of its rcsidenrs uninsured in 1987, prompring formation of a new government program which has since reduced the number of uninsured to just under four percenr. :-\u00b7 '\u00b7 ,., i.

Should We Require Universal Coverage? There are many who believe universal coverage is not necessary. Many believe significant increases in coverage can be made through changes in the insurance market and providing government subsidies for low-income individuals. 2. How Can Universal Coverage Be\u00b7-~Achieved? The approaches to achieving universal coverage include a single-payer system, an employer mandate, an individual mandate, or some combination of these. 3. Who Should Pay for Universal Coverage? Individuals and/or employers? 4. Who Should Receive Subsidies? If there is some form of mandate, low-income individuals and/or small businesses will need subsidies to make insurance affordable. Subsidies could take several forms: tax credits, liability caps, vouchers, or premium discounts. Income range for individual subsidies and definition of small business eligible for subsidies need to be determined.

Although some policymakers use the urms. interchangeably, universal cover- age is not the same as universal acce:s.s, which seeks to make health iii.surance available far purchase by every American, but does n~t en.sun: that everyone can afford it or is covered. WHAT IS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE? Wllether a reformed health system has as its goal universal coverage or universal access is the answer to a key societal question: is health care a right or a privilege? If we as a society decide tha<: health care is as much a right as a high school education, then we should guarantee a basic level of health insurance much as we guarantee :i. basic level of schooling. If, on the other hand, we decide health care is more like :i. college education, something everyone who wants it should be :i.ble to obtain - with financial aid if they can't otherwise afford it -we may wish to op~ for univer- sal access. It must be noted that universal access is nor currently avail:i.ble in our health care system. Many people; even working people, are not offered insurance as part of their jobs and cannot afford the premiums for private coverage. Many other. people are \"uninsurable\" and cannot purchase coverage at any price, because they have a \"pre-existing\" medical condition such as cancer or diabetes. Virtually every reform plan introduced in the Congress includes, at a minimum, requiring insurance com- panies to sell policies ro all Americans, regardless of their health starus, and provid- ing the poor with vouchers, tax.credits, or other forms of aid to make insurance more affordable. WHY IS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IMPORTANT? Proponents of universal coverage note that ic is important not just to chose who lack insurance, but also to those who are currently covered. That's because most people who need medical care do ultimately gee it, even if they can't pay. Sometimes that care is &om a public clinic or hospi_cal, paid for with tax dollars. More often care for the uninsured is financed by what's known as \"cost shifting,\" the practice of :i. hospital or doctor charging insured patients more to make up for those who can't pay. Cose-shifting can be from the government to private payers, as when Medicaid and Medicare pay less than care actually costs. It occurs from insurance co~panies to businesses, as premiums rise to cover the cost of care for the uninsured. Cost- shifting even goes on from businesses to their workers, .through requiring that they pay a larger percentage of their insurance premiums, higher deductibles and co- payments and even lower wages . . But if the uninsured do sometimes get medical care, people may ask, then why do they need insurance? Because srudies have shown convincingly that the care pro- vided to the uninsured is often too lace, inappropriate, and more expensive both to them and to society than -che care provided to chose with health insurance. Because the uninsured get fewer preventive and primary care services than those with insur- ance, illnesses are often discovered and/or treated at a more advanced stage, thus costing more. The uninsured are also more likely to use hospital emergency rooms co obtain care, which is both more expensive and more impersonal than care obtained from a private physician.

The most common reason the uninsured don't have coverage, they say, is that they simply can't afford it. While affordabilicy is a subjective measure, health coverage for an. average family today costs more than $5,000 a year, nearly a seventh of the median family income of $36,812.

State Solutions Should there be a national system or should states be responsible for health care reform within their own borders? State-based health care reform would likely create 50-plus 1 health care systems. This would cause headaches for Multi-state employers. Should States be permitted to \"opt out\" of a national system? Giving States flexibility to design a system different from a national system could undermine the \"universality\" of the national system. 2. Implementation/Regulation of National System If a national health care system is created, States could play a variety of roles in implementing pieces of the national system and play an on-going role in regulating and monitoring compliance within the system. States fear they will be asked to play a large role but not be given the tools necessary to regulate the system, as well as being expected to achieve unrealistic goals. States worry about being responsible for making up the difference if cost containment goals are not met. 3. Financing What is the role for States? Currently, States contribute about 43 percent of the expenditures for the Medicaid program. Should States be forced to continue such spending through \"maintenance of effort\" requirements, or be relieved of responsibility? Some proposals divide certain programs financed jointly by the Federal government and the States and create separate programs financed by one or the other. For example, one proposal has the Federal government paying for Medicaid acute care and the states paying for Medicaid long-term care. , ... ,.

THOl\\1PSON Governor State of Wisconsin The Honorable John H. Chafee United States Senate 567 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear John: Thank you for inviting me to attend the Senate Republicans' retreat on the issue of health care reform. Unfortunately, my schedule makes it impossible for me to attend. I would like to take this opportunity however, to point out a number of my major concerns with the President's proposal. *The employer mandates included in the bill will cost jobs. *Mandatory alliances will restrict choice and impose an unnecessary layer of centralized bureaucracy. *Global budgets with unrealistic targets will lead to rationing and to a complex bureaucracy to administer them. *The maintenance of effort provisions in the bill penalize states that efficiently manage their health care costs. States like Wisconsin, whose costs are increasing at less than the national average, despite the broadest possible coverage, would have to pay an additional amount to subsidize those states who have been less efficient and less generous. While your bill provides states with significant flexibility in some areas, I remain very concerned with the provision that caps federal Medicaid payments without a corresponding cap at the state level. This provision is a cost shift to states. Room 115 East. State Capitol. P.O. Box 7863, Madison, Wisconsin 53707 (608) 266-1212 FAX (608) 267-8983 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 107 of 179In Wisconsin, we have significant experience in using managed care for Medicaid participants and have proven that quality of care can be better in managed care than in a traditional fee-for-service setting. Wisconsin has successfully integrated Medicaid recipients into managed care delivery systems serving the general population. The slow phase-in enrollment for the Medicaid population into the qualified health plans and the exemptions from managed care for special needs populations included in your bill are, therefore, not only unnecessary but could hinder state progress in this area. The Cooper bill has also been receiving a great deal of attention lately. As you know, the bill would eliminate the acute care Medicaid program and replace it with a fedearally funded program. States would then have to assume responsibility for full funding of Medicaid long term care. This is unacceptable to Governors. As you know, at the National Governors' Association Winter Meeting, Governors, in a bipartisan manner, adopted a health care reform policy, A Call to Action, which outlines those provisions which Governors would like to see enacted this year. I have attached a copy of our policy. Please feel free to consider it a framework for your discussion. Again, I am sorry that I will not be able to join you, and I wish you great success in your efforts. I look forward to our continued work together. TO MY~ SON Gove;n~~ P -- Enclosure cc: Governor Campbell Senator Dole ~ Congressman Gingrich This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 108 of 179NAJIONAL GOVERNORS ' ASSCD:IATION I I I CARE REFORM: A CALL TO ACTION 7.1 Preamble The nation's Governors are committed to comprehensive health reform that calls for a federal framework with significant state flexibility, and they will work with Congrea and the administration to develop such a system. At the same time, however, the growing demand for atfordable quality health care, coupled with the immediate budgetary pressures caused by the Medicaid program, requires immediate action. Virtually every Governor has some health reform initiative in progress. These include comprehensive state-bued reform initiatives, programs that assist small busineues in securing affordable health insurance, programs that expand health care coverage to a greater number of uninsured poor, and programs that implement managed care networks for Medicaid beneficiaries. None of these state initiatives are incompatible with national reform; instead, they continue to build a strong policy foundation for reform at the federal level. 7.2 Federal Barriers to State Health Reform Ju states have moved ahead, their su~ has been limited by barriers resulting from current federal statutes. The nation's Gmemors call upon the administration and Congrea to immediately remove those federal barriers. 7.2.1 Medicaid. By far, Medicaid represents the largest health care expenditure for states. On average, only spending for elementary and secondary education constitutes a larger ponion of state budgets. Governors believe that irrespective of any national health reform strategy, Medicaid costs must be brought under control. Should Congrea move to limit or cap the federal contribution to Medicaid, a move the Gmemors adamantly oppose, the Governors believe these changes and other relief will become even more urgenL The Gmemors recommend the following changes that will a>ntribute to oontrolling those costs. 7.2.1.1 MaJlllled Care Wah-ers. There is a national trend in health care service delivery toward systems of care. These systems or networks have been shown to provide cost~tnc:ient care while ensuring that the patient has a reliable place from which to seek primary care and to which specialty care can be directed. Although the private sector is moving aggreaiYely toward these networks, the Medicaid program oontinues to require states, in virtually all cases, to apply for a waiver from fee-for-service care in order to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries in such networks. And while the Bush and Qinton administrations have taken significant steps toward simplifying the applica- tion and renewal process, states still must apply for renewals every two years. Moreover, states have been unable to sustain networks where there is a predominance of Medicaid beneficiaries because, under current law, states are permitted only one nonrenewable three-year waiver to have beneficiaries served in a health maintenance organization (HMO) where more than 75 percent of the enrol- lees in the HMO are Medicaid beneficiaries. lb.is requirement should be repealed. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 109 of 179If the nation is serious about controlling health care costs, it is essential to give states the opportunity to establish networks in Medicaid (including fully and partiallycapitated systems) through the regular plan amendment process. Governors recognize the special significance of consumer protections and assurance of solvency in establishing these systems of care and support federal guidance through the regulatory process. 7.2.1.2 Comprehensive Waivers. States have begun to look seriously at comprehensive systems of health care where the artificial categorical barriers of Medicaid are removed and where they can establish statewide networks of care for Medicaid beneficiaries . Unfortunately, there are no provisions in the Social Security Act that can be used to establish such programs on an ongoing basis. Currently, states have been developing these more comprehensive networks through the research and demonstration provisions of the Social Security Act (Section 1115a). Section 1115a, however, was designed for research purposes and has some important limitations. States must demonstrate , through the application pro~. that they are testing an innovation. The law requires an evaluation that, in some cases, requires control groups. Projects approved under the 1115a process are approved for a limited time period, usually three to five years at the discretion of the administration , and require special statutory changes to go beyond the demonstration period. Finally, these projects must be cost neutral over the life of the project. Section 1115a is ~ntial to ensure the testing of alternative health and social policies. However , the current statute falls short by requiring statutory changes if a state wants to continue its successful effort. In short, once a state has proven that its research project works, it cannot continue without congressional action. Governors support changes to the Social Security Act so that a state may apply through the executive branch of government for renewable waivers of their innovations. This waiver process should be consistent with the streamlined approaches used by the Clinton administration and states should have to reapply for these waivers no less than every five years. 7.2.1.3 Boren Amendment. The Boren Amendment to the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act was passed in the early 1980s to give states greater flexibility in establishing reimbursement rates for hospitals and nursing homes and to encourage health care cost containment. Instead, it has led to havoc in the administration of Medicaid programs . Court decisions have interpreted the Boren Amendment to embody a restrictive and unrealistic set of requirements in setting reimbursement rates, and have in effect given judges the power to establish reimbursement rates levels and criteria. Because of these decisions, states remain frustrated in their ability to bring some discipline to their budgets and have been thwarted in their attempts to achieve the original purpose of the amendment. The nation's Governors believe that any coherent approach to national health reform must address the issue of the Boren Amendment. They believe that a statutory change to this amendment is an important tool necessary to bring Medicaid institutional costs under control. Therefore, the Governors urge the administration and Congress to adopt these or other changes to the Boren Amendment that will give states the relief they need. Statutory and Regulatory Changes. The Governors agree that standards for establishing ade- quate reimbursement rates for hospitals, nursing facilities, and intermediate care facilities for persons with mental retardation (ICF/MRs) must be designed to promote access to care for Medicaid patients, quality of services, ~t containment, and efficient service delivery. The Governors support a strategy that would replace the current cost-efficiency-based standard in the Boren Amendment with provisions that establish 'safe harbor' standards where a state meeting any of these \"safe harbor\" provisions would satisfy the statute. Standards might include the following. The payment rate is equal to the Medicare-based upper payment limit The payment rate is no less than the rate agreed to by the facility for comparable services paid for by another payer (e.g. payment rates for Medicaid patients would not have to be higher than rates paid by any large managed care plans or large business). Regarding nursing facilities, the aggregate number of participating licensed and certified nursing home beds in the state (plus resources devoted to home or community -based care for the elderly) is at least equal to a specified percentage of the population age 65 or over. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 110 of 179 The reimbursement rate is sufficient to cover at least 80 percent of the allowable costs of all facilities in the class in the state in the aggregate, or is sufficient to cover the allowable costs of 50 percent of all facilities in the class in the state. The reimbursement rate is equal to a benchmark rate plus inflation no less than the rate of inflation for the overall economy according to a general index (national or state), such as the consumer price index (CPI) or the gross domestic product (GDP-IPD). The benchmark rate would be the approved rate as of the date of enactment of the statute or the current rate approved by the Health Care Financing Administration . This standard is satisfied by a rate methodology currently in effect and approved by HCFA that contains a provision for infla- tion adjustments. The Governors also believe that the procedural requirements in the current Boren Amendment must be streamlined. Finally, the Governors support strategies that would reduce or eliminate the costs of prolonged and costly litigation. 7.2.2 Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Although the Governors are extremely sensitive to the concerns of large multistate employers , the fact remains that one of the greatest barriers to state reform initiatives is the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). ERISA preempts all self-insured health plans from state regulations and subjects those plans only to federal authority. As a result of judicial interpretations of ERISA, states are prohibited from: establishing minimum guaranteed benefits packages for all employers; developing standard data collection systems applicable to all state health plans; developing uniform administrative processes, including standardized claim forms; establishing all payer rate-setting systems; establishing a statewide employer mandate; imposing premium taxes on self-insured plans; and imposing provider taxes where the tax is interpreted as a form of discrimination on self-insured plans. 7.2.2.1 ERISA Flexibility. Governors call on the administration and Congress to modify the ERISA statute to give states the flexibility they need to move ahead on health reform. This may be done either by establishing the flexibility directly in statute or through the establishment of waiver authority . The flexibility could include a requirement that the state demonstrate broad-based support for the change, such as by passage of state legislation . States must be assured, however, that the flexibility is stable and not time limited. 7 .3 A Call to Action The nation's Governors call upon President Clinton and Congress to pass health care legislation this year that includes, at a minimum, the following. 7.3.1 Insurance Reform. We support minimum federal standards that result in portability of coverage; guaranteed renewability of policies; limitations on both medical underwriting and preexisting condi- tions exclusions; and modified community rating that limits the variation in rates that different individuals and groups are charged. 7.3.2 State-Organized Purchasing Cooperatives. Through purchasing cooperatives, affordable insurance products will be made available . States and the federal government must work together to ensure that states have flexibility in establishing and operating these cooperatives. 7.3.3 Core Benefits and Access. In order to ensure portability of coverage, Governors believe that there must be a core benefits package that is comparable to those that are now provided by the most efficient and cost-effective health maintenance organizations. The cornerstone of this package must be primary and preventive care. All employers must make the core benefits package available to those employees who wish to purchase it. While Governors do not agree on whether employers should be required to pay for any portion of the premium, Governors agree that coverage should be available. 7.3.4 Tax Deductibility of Health Care Premiums. Health insurance premiums should be tax deductible to the value of the core benefits package regardless of who pays the premium. Governors do not support This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 111 of 179limiting health benefits; however, policies that afford benefits above the limit should be subject to taxation. The Governors do suppon tax changes that would correct the inequities now suffered by self-employed individuals. These individuals would be eligiole to purchase fully deductible health insurance within the federal limit. 7.3.S Low-Income SubsldJes. Low-income families and individuals will require subsidies in order for them to afford health care. Governors suppon a streamlined eligibility process for these subsidies, and believe that the subsidies must be sufficient to make this goal a reality. Governors also look forward to a system of subsidies that provides low-income families and individuals with a core benefits package that Governors believe will be a more effective method for providing care than the current Medicaid program. This program could be financed panially through revenues resulting from limits on tax deductibility. 7.3.6 Changes to the Current Medicaid System. Governors strongly believe that some critical changes to the Medicaid program must be made now to improve the cost efficiency of the program. Specifically: 7.3.7 7.3.8 7.3.9 7.3.10 7.3.11 States should have the ability to move their Medicaid populations into managed care settings through a plan amendment rather than through a waiver. During the phase-in of the new low-income subsidy program, states must have the flexibility to establish new programs that expand eligibility to a larger indigent population . This flexibility would require additional waiver authority under Medicaid. In addition, states have been unable to control the costs of reimbursement rates to institu- tional health care providers as a result of judicial interpretation of the Boren Amendment. States must be given legislative and regulatory relief from these interpretations in order to get better control of these costs. Medical Malpractice and Uabillty Rerorm. Another important step in developing a rational health care system is the modification of current medical malpractice and liability statutes. We believe that minimum standards should be set by the federal government. Alternative dispute resolution is among the strategies that should be explored to reduce the amount of litigation in this area. Relier rrom Antitrust Statutes. More and more Americans are receiving their care through health delivery networks. Establishing these networks requires new approaches to cooperation among providers and businesses that heretofore have been competitors. The current antitrust statutes must be revised to accommodate this new health care environment. Relief from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ERISA must be modified to give states the flexibility they need to move ahead on state reform. At a minimum, Congress should enact ERISA waiver authority for states that meet certain criteria for health care reform. Federally Organized Outcome and Quality Standards. If meaningful choices are ever to be made in health care, research must be supponed to develop outcomes and quality standards for use by providers and consumers alike. Also, information systems must be developed that include price and quality information for all providers and consumers of health care services in a given geographic area. Admlnlstratl~ Slmpllftcatlons. The administrative complexity of the current system must be reduced. At a minimum, we must adopt a single national claims form and electronic billing. We believe that these provisions should be included in any reform strategy. As Governors, we do not vary in our suppon of these changes, and we urge Congress and the President to act as quickly as possible. Time limiJed (effective February 1<}94-February J<)96).

Employee Exclusion. Employer-paid health coverage is excluded from the income of employees. This exclusion is the second largest federal tax expenditure. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this expenditure to be $287 billion over 5 years. \u00b7 2. Employer Deduction. Employers can deduct the cost of employee health coverage. 3. Self-Employed Individuals. A self-employed individual can deduct up to 25% of his or her health insurance premiums. This provision expired on December 31, 1993, but is expected to be extended and increased as part of health reform. 4. Individual Deduction. Individuals who itemize deductions can deduct non-reimbursed medical expenses including health insurance premiums that exceed 7.5% of the individuals adjusted gross income. MAJOR POLICY ISSUES The fundamental issue for consideration of any health care reform plan is the extent to which the present law tax incentives for employer-provided health care benefits should be retained. The exclusion from gross income provided under present law for employer-provided health insurance is criticized as contributing to the over utilization of health care. The over utilization of health care leads to rising costs. Alternatively, many argue that an individual taxpayer-based system involving for example, a refundable tax credit for low income individuals combined with an expanded deduction for higher income individuals is a better way to expand coverage and control costs. \u00b7 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 117 of 179MAJOR SENATE REPUBLICAN BILLS '?':';.

Eighty-three percent of nonelderly Americans and 99 percent of elderly Ameri- cans (aged 65 and over) were covered by either public or private health insurance in 1992, according to EBRI tabulations of the March 1993 Current Population Survey (CPS). The March 1993 CPS is the most recent data available on the number and characteristics of uninsured Americans. In 1992, 17.4 percent of the nonelderly population-or 38.5 million people-were not covered by private health insurance and did not receive publicly financed health assistance. This compares with 36.3 million in 1991 (16.6 percent), 35.7 million in 1990 ( 16.5 percent), 34.4 million in 1989 ( 16.1 percent), and 33.6 million in 1988 (15.9 percent). The most important determinant of health insurance coverage is employment. Nearly two-thirds of the nonelderly (62.5 percent) have employment-based coverage. Workers were much more likely to be covered by employment-based health plans than nonworkers (71 percent, compared with 40 percent). A primary reason for the increase in the number of uninsured between 1991 and 1992 is a decline in employment-based coverage among individuals (and their families) working for small firms. Forty-two percent of the additional 2.2 million individuals without coverage between 1991and1992 were in families in which the family head worked for an employer with fewer than 25 employees . The number of children who were uninsured in 1992 was 9.8 million, or 14.8 percent of all children. This compares with 9.5 million and 14. 7 percent in 1991. The increase in the number and proportion of uninsured children was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of children with Medicaid. In 12 states and the District of Columbia, more than 20 percent of the population was uninsured in 1992 (table 3). These states and their uninsured rates were Nevada (26.6 percent), Oklahoma (25.8 percent), Louisiana (25. 7 percent), Texas (25.7 percent), the District of Columbia (25.5 percent), Florida (24.2 percent), Arkansas (23.5 percent), Mississippi (22.7 percent), New Mexico (22.5 percent), Georgia (22.4 percent), California (22.2 percent), South Carolina (20.8 percent) and Alabama (20. l percent). : EBR! 1111 II II LI II II II II II II II Ill II This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 120 of 179SELECTED FIGURES OF CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNINSURED (From EBRI Analysis of March 1993 Current Population Survey) Non-Elderly Elderly -83% have health insurance -of that, 15\u00b0/o had public health insurance 96% are covered by Medicare -of that, 35% have individually purchased Medigap supplemental insurance and another 33% have employer provided Medigap insurance. -In 1991 -16.6% of the non-elderly (or 36.3 million people) were not covered by insurance -In 1992 -17.4% of the non-elderly (or 38.5 million people) were not covered by insurance (A primary reason for the increase in the number of the uninsured is a decline in coverage by small firms) -92% in families with income over $50,000 have health insurance -52o/o in families with income below poverty line have public insurance 50% Medicaid 2% Medicare, CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA -Of the 4.2 million increase of uninsured between 1989 and 1992 19% were in families headed by worker in firm of less than 25 21% were in families headed by worker in firm between 25 to 99 14% were in families headed by worker in firm between 100 to 499 21% were in families headed by worker in firm over 500 25% were in families headed by non-worker -Of the Uninsured 56.7% are working adults 17 .8% are non-working adults 25.4% are children This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 121 of 179-Of the Uninsured 60o/o are families headed by full-year workers with no unemployment 52% are families headed by full-time workers 8% are families headed by full-year, part-time workers -Only 13% of individuals in families headed by a full-time, full-year worker are not covered by insurance. -But they represent the largest segment (52%) of the uninsured. -1/2 of all uninsured workers were either self-employed or working in firms with fewer than 25 employees. -In 1992 -88% of the uninsured were in families with an AGI of less than $20,000 -53% of the uninsured were in families with income under $20,000 -35% of the uninsured were in families with income under $5,000 -6% of the uninsured were in families with income over $50,000 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 122 of 179Health Care Fact Sheet EXPENDITURES 1980 1993* 2000* National Total ($8) $ 250 $ 903 $ 1,613u Percent of GDP u 9.2 14.6 18.9 Per Capita Amount ('91 $) u $1,761 $3,217 $4,503 National Total (AAC%) 10.4 1993* 2000* Hospital 41% 40% 40% Physician 17 19 20 Nursing Home 8 8 7 Drugs 9 8 7 Other 25 25 25 Payor Distribution 1980 1993* 2000* Private Health Insurance 29% 30% 28% Patient Out-of-pocket 24 19 17 Federal Government 29 32 36 Other Government/Private 18 19 19 ~BQVID~BS Physicians Active Physicians (1995*) 634,600 Group Practices (GPs) (1991) 16,576 Physicians in GPs (1991) 184,358 Physician Income AAC (1982-91) 6.4% Malpractice Premiums (1982/1991) $5,800/$14,900 Hospitals Total Average Margin % with (-) Margins Comm.

JOYCE THOMAS L. RHODES March 2, 1994 MEMORANDUM TO REPUBLICAN LEADERS FROM: WILLIAM KRISTOL SUBJECT: HEALTH CARE: THE PRINCIPLES Of CONSERVATIVE REFORM I I l ' I J (! Tomorrow in Annapolis, Senator Chafee will convene a retreat designed to bring clarity and unity to the Republican position on health care reform. We wish him well. But before his confer- ees get too absorbed in the details of compromise among provisions of competing larger\"plans,\" we think they should keep in mind two overarching substantive and political truths. I First, notwithstanding the inevitable insider's fixation on the shifting fortunes of Clinton-Cooper- Chafee-Michel-Nickles-Gramm-and-so-on , there are now --and always have been --only two meaningful positions on health care. One holds that the American health care system is funda-mentally crippled and defective, and must be replaced by something .newly designed and administered in Washington. The other holds that problems in the health care system can be solved directly, without undoing American medicine's basic delivery structures, and withfut threatening the incalculable benefits those structures now provide. Radical overhaul on the e hand, or conservative reform (in the best and broadest sense of that phrase) on the other. e choice is that simple and that stark. And the proper and principled Republican option is obviou_ ). How the Tide is Turning. The second truth about health care is this: public opinion and ~e momentum of the current political situation increasingly favor conservative reform. Popilc_Jr support for the Clinton health care scheme is evaporating; everyone knows that. Last week ~s CBS News poll showed a 46-39 percent plurality of respondents disapproving of the presid~~t !s handling of health care; a similar plurality said the Clinton plan is \"not fair\" to \"people like me.\" Indeed, most strikingly, the CBS poll now ranks health care as the president's worst issue. In short, health care, a centerpiece of the Administration's political strategy, is fast becoming an albatross for the president-- and an opportunity for Republicans . It's im portent that Republicans understand why this is so. The answer is not that the Clinton plan's legislative details have alarmed certain business and interest groups, or that the plan's This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 156 of 179PLEASE DELIVE~ \"l1itti nghi 11 B3/B1/94 2 budget numbers don't add up. The answer is that the American people are.not persuaded --and, indeed, are increasingly doubtful --that any radical overhaul of the health care system is either safe or necessary. A Time/CN N/Yankelovich poll of two weeks ago asked whether the state of our health care system was a \"crisis,\" or a \"problem, but not a crisis.\" By a clear maio1\u00b7ty, 51 to 43 percent, their choice was \"problem.\" (And 5 percent said there was \"not a health c re problem\" at all!) Even universal coverage, the ques,tion that has made some Republicans pa c-ularly nervous, turns out to be something less than an unambigous popular favorite. True, 49 percent of Time respondents say government should guarantee it. But a full 41 percent al re day say only access should be guaranteed --which insurance reform and a low-income voucller would go far to provide --and this result comes before Americans have been offered any cllqr explanation of the federal regulation, monitoring, and administration that mandated univer.~ol coverage would require. ! \u00b7 t Radicalism in Retreat. Read carefully, the health care news out of Washington these days is a picture of radical overhaul in retreat. A long series of Democrats told the Washington Post last week that their constituents were nervous to the point of opposition about sweeping govern\\-ment redirection of health care. Freshman Rep. Torn Barlow of Kentucky told the Post that hi's voters \"know we've got to do something, but they don't want to toke a giant leap into a national program.\" Senator David Boren reported much the same thing from Oklahoma: \"They're not saying it's not a problem. They're not saying: Don't do anything. But they're saying: Be cqu-tious. Be real cautious.\" Rep. Jim Slattery of Kansas told Congress Dai/ythis week that \"there isn't overwhelming political support for Clinton\" --or for Cooper. And Dan Rostenkowski, acknowledging that he is viewed by some Democrats as \"the skunk at the party\" for his reali,n, told USA Today last week that he would advise the President to sign a package of meanin ul conservative reforms this year--and declare victory. Clinton-Cooper Plan stalwarts hate such talk. But there is now more and more of it, and it meqns thatthere is an opportunity to advance a serious legislative alternative to a radical, governmeait-planned overhaul of health care. Now is the time to lay out a set of bipartisan, consensus~\u00ad posals to address the real problems of health insurance and financing. Republicans have noJli- in~ to gain from any further delay in developing the basis for a principled bipartisan comprc(-mrse. If it is hope for winning with a purely \"Republican\" health care bill that's holding things up, it is time that hope yielded to reality. As long as Democrats control Congress, no strictly Republica p bill will pass, and Republicans should not begrudge the president his signing ceremony --so long as the legislation he signs is not pernicious . If it is fear of public reaction against conserva- tive reform that gives Hill Republicans pause, thatfear is misguided and unnecessary; the public supports such reform and opposes the radical alternative, as many (if not most) Congressio~al Democrats have already concluded in private. And if some Republicans (in Annapolis or else-where) are inclined to pursue bipartisan compromise along radical ratherthan conservative lines, they should be strongly discouraged . Health care is not an issue on which Republicis should snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. For the use of SenatorChafee's Annapolis conferees, we provide an outline below of biparti n legislation to achieve principled conservative health care reform. i- ' This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 157 of 179PLEASE DELIVER TO: Jc'<nes ~iJiitt ir\u00b7:;i:d l B3/81/94 3 ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF SENSIBLE HEALTH REFORM -,- HEALTH INSURANCE SHOULD BE RENEWABLE AND PORTABLE _ & . \u00b7Individual and group health plans should be made renewable without premium increases 'dye to pre-existing conditions of those already c_overed by a policy. I \u00b7 t \u00b7Individuals who already have health insurance should, if they change iobs or move, be permit ted to enroll in similar plans without facing premium increases due to health status. \u00b7Individuals who work at small companies should be allowed to continue their insurance cover age for a transitional period after they leave their iob; existing CO BRA leg is lotion shouldt be extended to cover businesses with fewer than 50 employees . HEALTH INSURANCE SHOULD BE MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE \u00b7Individuals and the self-em ployed should be able to deduct the full cost of their health insur- once from their personal incometax-- the same tax advantage enjoyed by those who now get health coverage from theirem ployer. \u00b7Employers should be able to offer medical savings accounts --essentially tax-free medical !is --in coniunction with a catastrophic health care plan. \u00b7Small businesses should be allowed to pool togetherto buy group insurancefortheiremplo ees withoutfacing cumbersome federal and state regulations and mandates. \u00b7Individuals should be able to obtain health insurance through nonbusiness organizations -.-such as churches, unions, or fraternal organizations.

Similar results could be obtained by designing a tax-creditforthis group of Americans.

I This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 158 of 179B3/f31/94 t 4 CONSERVATIVE REFORM VS. RADICAL REORGANIZATION Republicans must be aware that the sensible and eminently achievable reforms described above are always at risk of being hiiocked and transformed into intrusive government plans to control the notion's hea Ith core . That resu It must be avoided. The merit of these ideas is that they respond, in a measured way, to genuine concerns about the current system . But equally impor . - tant, they attempt to make our health care system simpler, giving Americans more control over their insurance and greater flexibility over the treatment decisions they make about their own health core. =- Of course, even President Clinton hos tried to disguise his pion as a set of six simple principles, rare!:' nrknowledging the vast and intricate regulatory regime it would establish. That's why we believe that any serious ottem pt at basic health care reform shou Id meet two straightforwlrd tests: first, no reform should undo our present system or force Americans to abandon thewo, they now purchase health insurance and receive medical services. Second, whatever changes ore introduced, they should not establish any new govern-A m~nt~u.nction or use governmentauthorityto limitthe amount of medical core ovoilabfeJ to 1nd1v1duols. ~ ; ~ e If Republicans hew to these two principles while pursuing straightforward, targeted health care reform, they will quickly see how many of the most importantcurrentCongressional enthusiams lead in the wrong direction. Employer mandates and ;:rice controls --the pillars of the Clinton plan --would establish on assortment of new governmental powers to control the most basic features of our health care system. Mandatory health alliances, central to both the Clinton and Cooper plans, would pre- vent small employers from making their own insurance orran -gements and would install a cen- tralized, monopolistic, and bureaucratic regime to allocate health care. A standard benefits package, common to Clinton, Cooper, and some Republican plons, \u00b7would give political appointees (and the interest groups that lobby them) control over what kind of health core be e- fits Americans ore entitled to receive. The individual mandate to purchase health core, foun both the \u00b7 kles and Chofee bills, is an expansion offederal out orityoverprivote decisionm ing. The community roting system propose in severe pans, w 1c preven s insurers rom is- criminoting among clients on the basis of their medical history, would destroy the essential char- acter of insurance and prevent a company from offering price incentives to policy holders vfio toke positive steps to maintain their health. federal government control over the numb~,Qf medical students trained in various specialties, central to the Clinton and Cooper visions, WOl;JIH involve on unacceptable level of government management in our health core system. t \u00b7 l Such proposals have no place in sensible health care legislation. A WORD ABOUT TAX CAPS AND TAX EXCLUSIONS I There also exist other proposals that, while appealing in principle, raise questions of politics and prudence. Limiting tax-exempt health benefits is the most prominent example. Proposals to epd the tax-exempt status of employer-provided health benefits or cop the amount employers cpn deduct from their taxes hove been around for decodes. Such measures would sens1t1ze cqn- sumers to the true cost oftheir health care, creating more efficiency and generating cost-sov1rjgs int~. . This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 159 of 179PLEASE DELIVER TO: JaMes Uhiltinghill fB/61/94 5 But the practical consequences of such policies cannot be ignored. Both the Cooper and Chafee plans would ultimatelyforce employers to seek the lowest cost health plan in a\u00b7region in an effort t~oid the tax enaltyor, in the case of SenatorChafee's plan, would im ~ificanttax increase on arge numbers of Americans w o eci e to stic wit t e insurance plans they nfw rely on. Whatever public policy rationale could be offered for such measures, it is beyond disp te that they would have a tumultuous effect on the health insurance arrangements Americ s have made for themselves. We believe that advoc'otes of changing the tax exclusion rules g v- erning health care benefits might instead cons id er proposmg a tax cap on only the most extrav-a- gant em ployerfie alth plans --perhaps those costing 150 percent of the national average he~th package. ThiSStep, though small, would nevertheless introduce a degree of price sensitivitJto the system and, at one end of the spectrum, encourage some employers and their em ployc\u00bb:: ~:0 make health insurance decisions based on real costs. ( ~ t THE TRUE NATIONAL CONSENSUS Despite all the editorials, speechmaking, and political posturing, the current debate is not about coverage/ sys'- tem .\" Health care reform, to most Americans, means adding security, flexibility, and affordab11i \u00b7- ty to an insurance system that is now too often a source of anxiety. The best way to address that anxiety is through insurance portability, pre-existing conditions, tax equity, small business pool- ing, medical savings accounts, paperwork reduction, medical malpractice reform, and as~is\u00ad tance for low-income families. The consensus on these issues is so broad that it defies reaspn that Congress has not yet agreed on a basic package of reforms. 1 The greatest current obstacle to passage of such a package is the Administration's insistence~n establishing a notional health care entitlement, replete with government regulations, contr s, and penalties. Republicans should recognize the leadership opportunity that exists forth se willing to challenge the premise of the White House's proposal with an alternative vision of pr,n- cipled reform. Such measured steps will be criticized by more liberal Democrats as inadequcate, of course. So what?

JOYCE THO]\\{AS L. RHODES February 10, 1994 MEMORANDUM TO REPUBLICAN LEADERS FROM: WILLIAM KRISTOL ~ ~ \u00b7~ \u00a3--kJu; ----- THE FUTURE SUBJECT: Defeating the Coming Clinton-Cooper Compromise Attached is a third political strategy memorandum on the debate over health care reform. The good news is that the president's plan has been further wounded in recent weeks. The bad news is that the logic of the current situation points toward eventual Clinton-Cooper compromise legislation --legislation that would be bad for health care and for the nation. We argue in this memo that Republicans can help avert this outcome. We can do this, first, by intensifying our assault on the Clinton plan and its underlying premises, which are shared by the Cooper proposal. This assault will require a mobilization of public opinion across the coun- try. All polls tell us that the more people learn about the president's plan, the more likely they are to reject it. It is therefore essential that Republicans, business groups, and conservative organizations engage in media, direct mail, and other \"voter contact\" efforts now in order to expose the perils of the president's plan. The course of public opinion over the next several weeks is crucial to shaping a desirable legislative outcome. Second, the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill needs to complement these grassroots efforts to discredit both Clinton and Cooper by moving more aggressixely to advance a set of proposals that address America's health care problems. This set of principled, targeted reforms should not be simply another \"Republican alternative\"; rather it should be put forward explic- itly as the basis for future bipartisan compromise --a \"Moynihan-Dole\" bill, say --that serves as the fundamental alternative to Clinton-Cooper. Such a bill would build on past bipartisan efforts while forging a new path toward greater choice and control for individuals and the doc- tors who treat them. And it would have the added virtue of appealing to all who are increasing- ly doubtful about the president's bill, including those who, while retreating from Clinton, may have taken temporary refuge with Cooper. As in the past, we would be grateful for your thoughts about this assessment of the health care debate and the recommendations that accompany it. 1150 l 7TH STREET, NW, FIFTH FLOOR, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 (202) 293-4900 FAX: (202) 293-4901 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 161 of 179HEAL TH CARE: DEFEATING THE COMING CLINTON-COOPER COMPROMISE \"[Y]ou should realize our bills are very similar. The White House bill and my bill have a lot in common, and we're very proud of that. ... I want the White House to win.\" Rep. Jim Cooper (February 4, 1994) \"[l]n some ways I think that Jim Cooper is being extremely helpful to the process, extremely helpful to the process.\" Sen. Jay Rockefeller (February 4, 1994) \"[l]n broad outline the Clinton and Cooper proposals are more alike than either side at times finds it convenient to acknowledge.\" The Washington Post (February 7, 1994) Jim Cooper, Jay Rockefeller, and the Washington Post know something that many people in Washington (including, we fear, many Republicans) do not: that while the Clinton Administration's health care legis- lation may be in trouble, its project of reform by sweeping government dictat is, unfortunately, still alive. The new conventional Washington wisdom about health care has it that the Clinton plan is in trouble, its current momentum stalled and its future prospects threatened by the emergence of Representative Jim Cooper's 11moderate alternative.11 This week's Time goes so far as to suggest that Clinton's plan might be 11DOA.11 Evidence for this theory is deceptively obvious. The president has been on the defensive since before his State of the Union message, \\vhich included a veto threat he apparently deemed neces- sary to protect legislation he had introduced just two months earlier. That speech failed to move poll numbers as intended; public support for the plan remains below levels recorded early last fall. And there have been signs of White House fear and \\Veakness ever since. Concerned about potential political support for less radical reform than his, the President has offered surprising (if ultimately unsuccessful) concessions in a bid for support by the National Governors Association. His aides have responded somewhat hysterically to a series of critical television ads --and to an article in The New Republic that convincingly detailed their plan's likely ill effect on American medical services. Tuesday's Congressional Budget Office pronouncement raises further serious ques- tions about the plan's financing and budget effect. And last \\.veek saw a new rush of business objections to the Administration's health care proposal: tough Congressional testimony by the Chamber of Commerce, a declaration of opposition by the National Association of Manufacturers, and an outright endorsement of Cooper by the Business Roundtable. THE CLINTON-COOPER PHONY WAR. It's true that the Clinton health care legislation, as written, is made weaker by the fresh strength of the Cooper bill. And the harsh reaction to this development by the White House and its allies seems at first glance to support the notion that large ideas are at issue in a Clinton/Cooper tug of war. But large ideas are not in fact at issue; Clinton and Cooper are instead, as the Congressman correctly claims, 1'first cousins in this debate and ... hoping for a family reunion this year.11 Both Democratic proposals involve a radical federal regulatory rearrangement of the financing and delivery of American medical services. In this respect they constitute not two political positions on health care, but only one. Clinton's health plan is by no means 11dead on arrival.11 The fact that Clinton and Cooper now thoroughly dominate the Washington health care debate, and thus threaten permanently to circumscribe its acceptable parameters, should alarm Republicans. Neither bill is compatible with conservative principle, and Republicans therefore have no business cheering for either side of the Clinton/Cooper controversy --much less 11participating constructively11 in its resolution, despite the disingenuous advice we now receive from editorialists. Any conceivable Project for the Republican Future This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 162 of 179Clinton-Cooper compromise legislation would represent an unprecedented government e ncroachme1~t on the authority of individual c itizens to make basic decisions about their daily lives, in this case about their very health. Republicans ought not be reluctant to defend such individual rights and oppose a Clinton-Cooper compromise that threatens them. ' The health care debate is at a watershed. The Cooper bill is currently ascendant not' because \"managed competition\" has any broad-based, intrinsic appeal, but rather, we suspect, because its Congressional and business supporters see no other politicall y realistic vehicle with which to register their opposition to Clinton. Republicans must now make clear that Cooper is not a meaningful departure from the Clinton vision, and must make a principled case for the real a.lternative solution to America's health care prob- lems: sensible, straightfor ward reforms that vmuld make insurance more stable and affordable. Those reforms have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past; they can earn such support again this year. Unless \\Ve are prepared to oppose Clinton-C ooper vigorously and propose our own reforms intelligent- ly, the ultimate success of Clintonism, broadly understood, will be virtually certain. The White House can meet Jim Cooper well more than half way in the public and private compromise negotiations now underway, and the president will still be able to sign the terrible result into law. UNDERSTANDING THE COOPER BILL. Managed competition, the core of the Cooper bill, shares with the president's proposal the vision of a government-directed remaking of American health care delivery and financing. Though it comes in free-market guise, the Cooper bill would undo the medical system we now take for granted --just as radically and completely as would the Clinton plan. True, Cooper avoids a mandate that employers pay for their employees' health care. That has been its central attraction for business groups. But a closer examination of the bill reveals other ways in which employers would be drawn into a \\.veb of state-administered health care machinery. Firms with fewer than 100 employees (about 93 percent of all businesses), for example, would be required to register with regional Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives, forv.,1ard information about all their full-and part- time employees, and deduct from paychecks the cost of health care premiums, whether or not the firms were providing health care coverage. Each of these purchasing cooperatives would be required to make available \"accountable health plans\" that offer a standard set of benefits determined by a vote of Congress. Propon~nts of the Cooper bill point out, correctly, that under their plan consumers might still choose plans whose benefits exceed the government's established standards. But the Cooper bill is essentially designed to limit individual choice by pushing consumers into the lowest-priced health plan in their region . . Through the introduction of a tax deduction cap, both individuals and employers would be permitted to deduct only the cost of the lowest priced plan in their region. Anything beyond that would be subject to the top corporate rate. Businesses that today offer their employees generous health plans would effectively be forced either to accept the government's more austere benefit limits or face stiff economic penalties. This is a remarkably coercive use of the tax code. The federal government would first decide what type of health insurance should be in a employee's benefit package, and then, in effect, penalize all those who choose what the Cooper bill deems \"excess\" health coverage. Cost savings would presumably emerge from the competition among these minimum benefit plans to become the lowest bidder in any given region. The Cooper bill advances these measures in the name of cost containment. But they are tantamount to an arbitrary government restriction on how much money goes into the health system. To retain the tax deductible status of the health plan under which they work, doctors, nurses, and hospital administrators would be driven primarily by budget priorities. The ability of patients to obtain high qual- ity service and a full range of treatment options would invariably be compromised. Project for the Republican Future \u00b7. \u00b7.

Representative Cooper's candor on this point has been widely overlooked. \"My guess,\" he has said, \"is that fee-for-service medicine will be discouraged and mostly die out.\" Alain Enthoven, one of the authors of the rna(laged competition model, has made the same prediction: \"We doubt that [private-pr actice doctors] 'would generally be compatible with economic efficiency.\" Seeing a specialist when you like, seeking a second opinion, choosing your own family physician --all these things would be as rare under Cooper as under Clinton. Surviving health plans would be further hampered by the Cooper requirement that no plan charge enrollees different rates for any reason other than age. While ostensibly designed to guarantee access to health insurance, this Cooper version of \"community rating\" would effectively prevent a plan from offer- ing different premiums based on health status or medical history. Under Cooper's system, in other words, the individual who quits smoking or takes preventive health measures would be treated the same, for insurance purposes, as a smoker or someone with a debilitating disease. And both would like- ly wind up in the same \"lowest price\" accountable health plan. For the health consumer in America, life under the Cooper plan would look very much as it would under the president's: standardized medicine, impersonal systems of care, and hospitals and doctors judged by economic efficiency standards. \"Cost containment\" would become the mantra of American medicine, and all incentives in the system would be geared toward cutting corners and trimming ser- vice. Doctors operating in an accountable health plan would be required to report on procedures, treat- ments, outcomes, patient background, expenses and other \"necessary\" medical information; health plans would withhold payment to any doctor who does not provide such requested data. The number of specialists trained each year would be decided and alloted by a panel of government experts. Above everything, the Cooper system shares the president's fixation with a complex architecture of national health care bureaucracy that regulates, monitors, and coordinates virtually every aspect of the doctor-patient relationship. Like the president, Cooper would establish Health Cooperative Boards in each region. He would also create a Health Plan Standards Board to establish standards for every health plan; an Agency for Clinical Evaluations to oversee federal medical research; and a Benefits, Evaluation, and Data Standards Board to manage a national health data system. The entire structure would be gov- erned by a Health Care Standards Commission of five presidential appointees --_g.n independent agency that would function as a Supreme Court of Health. While steps may be taken to shield them, all these organizations would be subject to immense pressure from politicians, interests groups, and professional health industry lobbyists. Vital decisions about experimental drugs or even routine medical procedures would become political questions. The quality of treatment patients receive, the options available to them, and the advancement of medical practice would all become tertiary concerns. THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSIBILITY. The Clinton health care plan and its Cooper \"cousin\" are together a gigan- tic lefuvard social policy gamble by the Democrats, one that should be impossible to win given every- thing the United States has learned over the past 25 years about the failures of big-government liberal- ism. The White House had no right to expect anything but fierce opposition to the proposal --from American business, which has a legitimate and necessary interest in protecting itself from government, and from Republicans, who have a comparable but even more important interest in defending both pri- vate American relationships (like that between patient and doctor) and those non-governmental institu- tions that remain basically sound and successful (our health care system most definitely among them). But such an opposition has not emerged, not so far at least. And if it doesn't, soon, the Clinton gamble may well pay off --despite the fact that it pursues a misguided answer to a misconceived problem, and does so from premises a justly skeptical America has long since rejected. Project for the Republican Future This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 164 of 179For its part, the Republican Party in Congress has limited options. It can remain fractured, with various Members attached to various proposals, and hope for the best. But the best won't happen; Clinton- Cooper will pass, and the Republican Party v-.iill have been passively complicit in its passage. The Party might instead decide to play the inside legislati\\e game of Clinton-C ooper-Chafee, vv?rking the subcom- mittee hearings and the committee markups, and trying somehow to influence the fihal bill on the mar- gins. Clinton-C ooper passes that \\vay, too, and Republicans will be actively implicated . There are those Republicans prepared to argue that such a result involves no compromise of conviction. DavidDurenb erger, for example, Cooper's only Republican cosponsor in the Senate and a cosponsor also of the very similar Chafee bill, says that \"Republicans already have a winning strategy and that strat- egy is managed competition,\" \\vhich he calls consistent with \"Republican prin- ciples.\" Senator Ourenberger is wrong. Managed competition is not a Republican principle. It is mas- sive social regulation, precisely the kind of thing the Republican Party should exist to oppose, and for Republicans to acquiesce or participate in its enactment would bring us no credit, and much shame. The only honorable and realistically successful path for Republic ans, then, is that outlined by Senator Dole in his calm and intelligent State of the Union response, and restated last Wednesday in a speech by RNC chairman Haley Barbour: advancing specific solutions to the problems of health care coverage, affordability, and cost that most Americans agree exist while at the same time defending our medical system's unparalleled benefits --and making clear that those benefits are under attack by the White House. Republicans should not be deterred from this position, as some appear to have been in recent days, by press criticism and isolated polling statistics. The criticism comes from advocates of the Clinton-Cooper position. And public opinion, which political parties are formed to help shape and change, is already overwhelmingly hostile to any health care reform that would, as Clinton-Cooper will, limit the availability of medical services. Senator Dole and Chairman Barbour are making a correct argument in principle. And a winnable one. A STARK CHOICE. There is already widespread public nervousness over the Clinton-Cooper program. New York Representative Charles Schumer, for example, reflecting on his trip home during the last Hill recess, expressed this fear quite starkly to The New York Times: .\"How are we going to explain to a majority of my constituents, who have worked hard and invested in a [health] plan that they're not terri- bly unhappy with, that they should jump into the abyss of the unknown?\" He was talking about the Administration's legislation, of course, but the same question can and should be -asked of Cooper. And when it is, Cooper's supporters --many of whom have joined his bill for purely tactical, anti-Clinton purposes --will be eager for an alternative to the coming Clinton-Cooper compromise. It is the Republican Party's duty to speak for Charles Schumer's Brooklyn constituents and the silent majority of Americans who want reform but whose medical care would be badly damaged by the radi- cal experimentation of the Clinton-Cooper health care proposals. Republicans must reframe the health care debate and offer these Americans a clear choice: a crisis-driven Clinton-Cooper \"jump into the abyss,\" on the one hand, or real solutions to existing problems that give individual citizens, not govern- ment, more control over their health care. What is needed is not yet another \"Republican plan\"; instead, the Republican Hill leadership should put forward a proposal that can be the basis of effective bipartisan legislation. The political. damage recently sustained by the Clinton health care plan suggests that a Clinton-Cooper compromise will be forced on the White House sooner rather than later. It would be useful to get the principled alternative --a proposal that might eventually become the \"Moynihan-Dole\" bill, for example --on the table just as fast. This is a sound strategy for Republicans, and for the country. Project for the Republican Future This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 165 of 17915 RUSSELL SENATE OFFICE BUILDING WASHINGTON, 20510-2301 Republican February 28, 1994 1020 12 SOUTH SIXTH STREET MINNEAPOLIS. MN 55402 1612) 370-3382 I look forward to our retreat this week to discuss the Republican role in health reform. After 3 1/2 years of Thursday breakfast meetings, a substantial majority {19) of our Senate Republican task force has agreed on a direction for health reform which is also setting an example for others. This letter expresses concern about those Republican political strategists who call our work ''the kind of thing the Republican Party should exist to oppose.\" By linking managed competition to the Clinton plan, William Kristol implies that the 26 Republicans supporting the Cooper-Grandy bill in the House and the 19 Republican Senate cosponsors of the Chafee bill bring \"shame\" to the Republican party. We Republicans are not novices on these issues. Many of us have been working together on health reform since we defeated Carter's hospital cost containment bill in 1979. Senators Chafee, Dole, Packwood, Danforth, and Roth among others have a long track record of health legislation. Conservatives like Kristo! are correct on several points. They are right in observing that we need catastrophic coverage and better risk pooling mechanisms. Like everyone else, they recognize that we need basic insurance reform so that policies can be more equitably priced and available to working people. They are also right to say that in a number of local markets, experiments in voluntary pooling and greater efficiency in delivery systems have ameliorated price increases. However, in the Senate Republican task force we concluded that we can't wait for episodic and fragmentary reform at the state level while ignoring more comprehensive reform at the national level. Over 3 1/2 years, the task force has addressed the problems in the system and, most of all, the issues involved in change. For pragmatic, strategic, and policy reasons, we've chosen the principles embodied in HEART (Chafee-Dole). To Mr. Kristel's chagrin, that puts us in league with Cooper (Breaux-Durenberger) and with the system reform elements buried in the Clintons' 1300 page bill. Pragmatic Reasons for Reform Now: State-by-state reform is occurring and Democrats in every state are rising to the regulatory bait in their health care markets. From Lawton Chiles in Florida, to a host of candidates from Oregon to Minnesota to Vermont, state governments are plowing forward with government controls over health care systems. COMM ITTEE ASSIGNMENTS : FINANCE ENVIRONMENT ANO PUBLIC WORKS LABOR ANO HUMAN RESOURCES SPECIAL COMM ITTEE ON AGING This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 166 of 1792 Bob Dole's comments at the Finance Committee hearing last week illustrated the perverse effect of state-by-state regulation over local medical markets. If we do nothing at the national level, we risk a patchwork of conflicting and highly regulatory health systems with significant adverse effects on multlstate businesses, interstate health care networks, and local markets such as Utah and Minnesota that are impeded by profligate spenders In other states. ERISA preemption WILL NOT survive state pressures in the absence of federal reform. Strategic Reasons for Reform Now: President Clinton will compromise anything to get universal coverage. Why not take advantage of his singleminded goal? Republicans know that our federal entitlement programs and our tax policy are the real sources of medical inflatic ~' Pete Domenici's leadership on the Budget Committee has brought this issue to the forefront of : t: debate. We also know employer mandates won't achieve universal coverage. We have a rare opportunity to change the federal reimbursement systems that are threatening to break the federal treasury and penalize every effort at efficiency in local markets. Republicans believe . in making markets work-not replacing markets with government control. We must not bow to Clinton's call for universal coverage without ensuring coverage policy reform. Policy Reasons for Reform Now: From a policy perspective, we have an opportunity to reset the rules to make the medical markets work. That is where real long-lasting cost containment can be accomplished. For 40 years, national policy paid for anything and everything and sheltered private citizens from the economic consequences of their medical spending. We have created a monster of consumption. We need to change the signals for both the public programs and the private market to pay for results not services. When we do, it is imperative that the savings accrue to the consumers who are buying more wisely and to the efficient providers of care. Savings should not absorbed through taxes and transferred to less efficient markets. Good behavior must be rewarded not taxed. The problem for conservatives is that they can't seem to see the dysfunction in medical markets. Its true that we have the best health care services and technology in the world. But we don't have the best health care system. The problems extend beyond the small group market, although we agree these reforms will alleviate some of the inequities for small business buyers. A closer look at Kristol's analysis in his most recent memo, \"Defeating the Coming Clinton-Cooper Compromise\" illustrates my point. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 167 of 1793 Purchasing Groups By attacking alliances (also known as purchasing groups or cooperatives) as a \"web of state administered health care machinery,\" he misses a central tenet of functioning markets. Buyers must have information on which to make informed choices and sufficient market power to exercise those choices. Group buying can also result in administrative efficiency. EFFICIENCY, CHOICE, INFORMATION, and POWER conferred by member-controlled buying groups will make the medical market work better. That's the goal of purchasing cooperatives. Those goals will not be achieved by the Clinton alliances, but will be under the structures proposed in the Chafee and Cooper bills. Accountable Health Plans An accountable health plan fully integrates financial, managerial, and clinical aspects of health care. They must be accountable to their members for their cost and effectiveness as well as patient satisfaction. Insurance reform changes the way that insurance plans are priced and sold. An accountable health plan changes the insurance \"product.\" Conservatives have used scare tactics to imply that our intention is to drive out fee-for-service medicine. That decision will be made by consumers in the marketplace-not by politicians. Once people are able to select a health plan on the basis of price and quality, they MAY choose a fee-for-service plan or they may not. If fee-for-service cannot compete, it will be because people believe they get more value for their health care dollar in other systems of care. That is the essence of CHOICE not the elimination of it. Tax Policy Kristol also implies that choice will be limited by the imposition of a cap on the tax exclusion for health care expenditures. Such a limit, he argues, is a \"remarkably coercive use of the tax code.\" After 16 years of service on the Finance Committee, I find that characterization laughable. ALL tax policy is designed to create incentives for certain kinds of behavior BY taxpayers. As we all know, the mortgage interest deduction is designed to encourage and reward home ownership. This is one of thousands of such examples in the code. Our present tax policy fuels consumption by insulating people from the economic consequences of their medical spending. It rewards overspending and penalizes constraint. All the proposed tax caps do is limit the amount of spending consumers can do with tax free dollars. Nothing in this approach inhibits an individual from buying more health care than the tax cap shelters. You just can't do it with pretax dollars. Kristo! calls the tax cap an arbitrary restriction. Its no more arbitrary than the limits on the deductibility of business lunches. Businessmen can still eat (and presumably eat well). They just can't do it at our expense! This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 168 of 1794 Information Finally a word about the role of information in a functioning health care system. Markets don't always produce information, yet they cannot function without it. That is basic economics. Information is the tool of accountability. We cannot hold doctors, hospitals, health plans, or government accountable without information. When we have better information on medical outcomes, we will get better health care and make better choices. Government's role in reporting requirements and uniform data systems is not new nor does it presage government control. Air travelers can rely on safety and on-time data to use their personal dollars to choose an airline. This assists the private market rather than replaces it. Kristo! counts up the institutional arrangements in Cooper and Chafee, then bemoans them as too bureaucratic. If he looked more closely at our present HHS infrastructure, he would see that these bills streamline what we already have and facilitate the orderly analysis of information necessary ' for quality improvement. We can't support a 1990s health care system or. a 1960s infrastructure. Choice: , We all use the same vocabulary, but speak different languages. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the use of the word \"choice.\" Thematically, the conservatives have hammered home the point that managed competition deprives consumers of choice. Choice implies that we know what we're doing, getting and paying for. That simply is NOT the case in our present system. The purpose of system reform is to guarantee consumers that they can choose a health plan based on accurate information about its price and its quality -that is real choice. And, that is why it is not accurate to say that Americans have the best health care system in the world. Because it's only potentially the best. Republican Reform A recent New York Times poll found that people trust Democrats not Republicans to improve health care by a margin of 59 to 20. Clinton has squandered his political advantage because his plan is a complex tangle that the American people cannot understand. As Republicans we can take advantage of the desire for reform among Americans to reshape the debate and to work with like-minded colleagues on both sides of the aisle. But, Republicans can't do it by \"assaulting\" Clinton, Cooper, and, by implication, Chafee-Dole. Republicans cannot do it by blocking comprehensive reform, riding a limited insurance reform horse, and expecting the President and the people to embrace it. Without the support of the public and the support of the President, Republicans cannot win anything. The goal of our retreat is unity. Accusing some of us of bringing shame and dishonor on the party because we propose solutions based on a long tradition of Republican health reform activity is counterproductive. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 169 of 1795 I prefer that we invest in the debate on reform, arm ourselves with a good understanding of the present system and a vision of where we want the system to go in the future. Republicans must assure Americans that they understand the problem and are committed to genuine and meaningful reform. So far, we're losing 59-20. Chafee-Dole tries to get us back in the game. I look forward to getting the job done in this session of Congress.

JOYCE THOMAS L. RHODES December 2, 1993 MEMORANDUM TO: FROM: SUBJECT: REPUBLICAN LEADERS WILLIAM KRISTOL Defeating President Clinton's Health Care Proposal What follows is the first in what will be a series of political strategy memos prepared by The Project for the Republican Future. The topic of this memo is President Clinton's health care reform proposal, the single most ambitious item on the Administration's domestic policy agenda. These four pages are an attempt to describe a common political strategy for Republicans in response to the Clinton health care plan. By examining the president's own strategy and tactics, this memo suggests how Republicans might reframe the current health care debate, offer a serious alternative, and, in the process, defeat the president's plan outright. Nothing in these pages is intended to supplant the many thoughtful analyses of the Clinton health care plan already produced by Republicans and others, analyses which have done much to expose both its glaring weaknesses and immediate dangers. In fact, this memo borrows heavily from articles and papers prepared by conservative public policy think tanks, the Republican National Committee, House and Senate Republicans, and the dozens of superb critiques that have appeared in newspapers and magazines. Nor is this an attempt to prescribe legislative tactics for defeating the Clinton bill; for that we defer to our Republican leaders in the Congress. Instead, it is an effort to assess the current political climate sur- rounding the health care debate and to provide a winning Republican strategy that will serve the best interests of the country. The Project for the Republican Future was founded last month to help shape a Republican vision and advance an agenda for governing. It seeks to frame a new Republicanism by challenging not just the par- ticulars of big-government policies, but their very premises and purposes. In the coming months, we will prepare and circulate other memos on critical issues of politics and policy. We welcome your reactions to this memo so that we can further refine a Republican strategy, and we encourage your thoughts on future subjects for consideration. 1150 17TH STREET, NW, FIFTH FLOOR, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 (202) 293-4900 FAX: (202) 293-4901 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 172 of 179PROJECT FOR THE REPUBLICAN FUTURE: '----' A POLITICAL STRATEGY FOR HEALTH CARE I. THE CURRENT SITUATION Just after President Clinton introduced his health care plan in September, opinion polling reflected strong public support for it. That support has now sharply eroded. A late September Washington Post/ABC News poll, for example, had national respondents approving the plan by a 56 to 24 percent margin; the same poll in October had approval down to a 51 to 39 percent margin; and a mid-November Post/ABC poll now shows bare plurality support for the plan of 46 to 43 percent. To some extent, these results follow a predictable pattern of Clinton Administration policy initiatives, which have tended to open well on the strength of the president's personal advocacy, and then to falter as revealed details make plain his attachment to traditional, big government, tax-and-spend liberalism. Faced with force- ful objections in the past, the Administration has generally preferred to bargain and compromise with Congress so as to achieve any victory it can. But health care is not, in fact, just another Clinton domestic pol- icy initiative. And the conventional political strategies Republicans have used in the past are inadequate to the task of defeating the Clinton plan outright. That must be our goal. Simple Criticism is Insufficient. Simple, green-eyeshades criticism of the plan --on the grounds that its numbers don't add up (they don't), or that it costs too much (it does), or that it will kill jobs and disrupt the economy (it will) --is fine so far as it goes. But in the current climate, such opposition only wins concessions, not surrender. The president will lobby intensively for his plan. It will surely be the central theme of his State of the Union Address in January. Health care reform remains popular in principle. And the Democratic Party has the votes. After all, the president's \"tax fairness\" budget, despite unanimous Republican '--' opposition and rising public disapproval, did pass the Congress. Any Republican urge to negotiate a \"least bad\" compromise with the Democrats, and thereby gain momen- tary public credit for helping the president \"do something\" about health care, should also be resisted. Passage of the Clinton health care plan, in any form, would guarantee and likely make permanent an unprecedented federal intrusion into and disruption of the American economy --and the establishment of the largest federal entitlement program since Social Security. Its success would signal a rebirth of centralized welfare-state policy at the very moment we have begun rolling back that idea in other areas. And, not least, it would destroy the present breadth and quality of the American health care system, still the world's finest. On grounds of national policy alone, the plan should not be amended; it should be erased. But the Clinton proposal is also a serious political threat to the Republican Party. Republicans must therefore clearly understand the political strategy implicit in the Clinton plan --and then adopt an aggressive and uncompromising counterstrategy designed to delegitimize the proposal and defeat its partisan purpose. 11. THE CLINTON STRATEGY \"Health care will prove to be an enormously healthy project for Clinton ... and for the Democratic Party.11 So predicts Stanley Greenberg, the president's strategist and pollster. If a Clinton health care plan succeeds without principled Republican opposition, Mr. Greenberg will be right. Because the initiative's inevitably destructive effect on American medical services will not be practically apparent for several years --no Carter- like gas lines, in other words --its passage in the short run will do nothing to hurt (and everything to help) Democratic electoral prospects in 1996. But the long-term political effects of a successful Clinton health care bill will be even worse --much worse. It will relegitimize middle-class dependence for \"security\" on govern- ment spending and regulation. It will revive the reputation of the party that spends and regulates, the Democrats, as the generous protector of middle-class interests. And it will at the same time strike a punish- ing blow against Republican claims to defend the middle class by restraining government. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 173 of 1792 The 80-80 Split. The president intends to convince the American middle class to buy into this new govern-ment dependency by overcoming their skepticism with fear. Poll numbers explain his tactics. A large major-ity of Americans consistently reports that it believes our country's health care system, writ large, to be dys-functional; 79 percent of respondents to a Princeton Survey Research Associates/Newsweek poll in late September, for example, said the American health care system needed fundamental change or a complete rebuilding. Popular discomfort with American medicine as a \"system\" is Clinton's opportunity. But the same polls contain the key to Clinton's vulnerability, as well. The vast majority of Americans are pleased with the care this system now provides them personally; 80 percent of respondents to a late September Yankelovich/Time/CNN poll said they were \"somewhat\" or ''very\" satisfied with their own medical services. So the president advances a promise of \"universal\" health care coverage as a solution to the problem of the uninsured, but his plan must win the approval of a middle class most members of which are generally happy with the health care they have. He cannot plausibly claim that his plan will make the middle class even hap-pier with their present care. That argument, at least, is already lost. Respondents to a mid-November CBS/New York Times poll say, by a two-to-one margin, that the Clinton plan is more likely to degrade than enhance the quality of their own medical care, and by an almost six-to-one margin that their personal med-ical expenses are more likely to go up under Clinton than down. The Administration's only option, then, is singlemindedly to focus on the fears many middle-class Americans have about health care as an abstract \"system\" that might someday threaten them. The Administration's pub-lic pronouncements ignore all basic, practical questions about how their health plan will actually affect the quality and flexibility of American medical care. And its spokesmen encourage the notion that radical change involving a sacrifice of quality and free choice is necessary for health \"security.\" Ill. A REPUBLICAN COUNTERSTRATEGY The president makes his pitch to the 79 percent of Americans who are inclined to agree that \"the system\" isn't working, hoping to freeze health care debate on the level of grand generalization about structural defects. He is on the side of the angels rhetorically --denunciations of the status quo, easy moralism about his own alternative, rosy predictions of a utopian future in which security is absolutely guaranteed. Republicans can defeat him by shifting that debate toward specific, commonsense questions about the effect of Clinton's proposed reforms on individual American citizens and their families, the vast majority of whom, again, are content with the medical services they already enjoy. Republicans should ask: what will Bill Clinton's health care plan do to the relationship most Americans now have with their family doctor or pediatrician? What will it do to the quality of care they now receive? Such questions are the beginning of a genuine moral-political argument, based on human rather than bureaucratic needs. And they allow Republicans to trump Clinton's security strategy with an appeal to the enlightened self-interest of middle-class America. The Republican counterstrategy involves pursuing three distinct tasks: 1) deflating the exaggerated fears of systemic health care collapse that Democrats have encouraged; 2) clarifying and publicizing how the Clinton reform plan would alter and damage the quality and choice of medical treatment most Americans now take for granted; and 3) pointing out that incremental and meaningful solutions to problems of health security --solutions that do not require scrapping the current structure of American medicine and experimenting with something invented in Washington --are already available and politically within reach. Deflating Fear. Genuine, yet remediable problems do exist in the American system of medicine, but the rhetoric surrounding the president's health plan deliberately makes those problems sound apocalyptic. \"Fear itself' does not trouble the new New Dealers; indeed, they welcome it as a powerful tool of political persua-sion. Mrs. Clinton, in particular, routinely describes a nation of individual lives teetering on the brink, each only an illness or job switch away from financial ruin. The text of the president's Health Security Plan and vir- Project for the Republican Future This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 174 of 1793 tually all the public remarks on heath care made by his advisors are filled with images of a health care system spawning little else but frustration and tragedy. It is a brazen political strategy of fear-mongering, conducted on a scale not seen since the Chicken Little energy crisis speeches of President Carter. Fanning the flames of public unease is a purely political tactic for the Democrats, and it deserves to be exposed as such. For while public concern about health care is undoubtedly real, the president's deliberate campaign of fright seems designed less as a response to the public and more as a justification for his own far- reaching, grand reforms. Republicans should scrupulously avoid endorsing the president's depiction of a nation beset by fear over health care, which provides him cover for the war-time, centrally-planned, emer- gency-style measures that characterize his alarmist overhaul of our medical system. Republicans should instead painstakingly debunk that account, and remind the nation, point by point, that it currently enjoys the finest, most comprehensive, and most generous system of medical care in world history. Raising Questions About Medical Quality and Choice. The most devastating indictment of the president's proposal is that it threatens to destroy virtually everything about American health care that's worth preserv- ing. Under the plan's layers of regulation and oversight, even seeing a doctor whenever you like will be no easy matter: access to physicians will be carefully regulated by gatekeepers; referrals to specialists will be strongly discouraged; second opinions will be almost unheard of; and the availability of new drugs will be limited. So while there are now countless valid criticisms of the Clinton plan's various aspects, the most politically effective ones focus on how the proposal would fundamentally change the quality and kind of medical ser- vice that Americans cherish and expect. This means an assault on the Clinton plan's two central tenets: mandatory, monopolistic health alliances and government price controls. Hand in hand, these two corner- stones of the president's plan will establish a system of rationed medical care. Under Clinton's plan, the alliances will submit annual budgets to a national health board, thereby creating pressure to save money and trim service wherever possible. That means tightly regulated managed health care for most people, with an emphasis on efficiency over quality. Those who can afford huge premiums may be able to see a private fee-for-service doctor, though fee schedules will make it difficult for most inde- pendent physicians to stay in business. In time, the family doctor tradition will disappear. And avoiding this result by purchasing health insurance outside the alliances will be either impossible or criminal. The chief effect of price controls --the linchpin of the president's cost-containment theory --will be a rigid national system of pre-set budgets and medicine by accountants. There is no reason to believe that such a system won't follow the pattern that price controls have established in every other area: rationing, queuing, dimin- ished innovation, black markets, and the creation of a government 11health police\" to enforce the rules. Though the president and his surrogates deny all this, the basic building blocks of his proposal permit no other result. Republicans should insistently convey the message that mandatory health alliances and govern- ment price controls will destroy the character, quality, and inventiveness of American health care. Advocating Security Without Upheaval. The initial appeal of the president's proposal is its promise of life- long, universal security, defined in standard Democratic terms as a federal entitlement benefit. But this promise can also be restated as the plan's most glaring weakness: it mistakes federal spending and regulation for individual security. In exchange for his government-program security, Americans must accept a massive uprooting of the entire U.S. health care system, with disruptive and deleterious consequences. As both a political and policy matter, the best counter-strategy to Clinton's offer of security requires resisting '--the temptation to compete with the president in a contest of radical reforms. Allaying public concern about health security can be achieved by addressing a few basic problems directly --and without unravelling the current system. The easiest way to do that is by pursuing the short list of reforms for which there is already a Project for the Republican Future This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 175 of 1794 national consensus. Relatively simple changes to insurance regulation, for example, can eliminate the barri- ers to health insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions. The unemployed or people whose employers do not provide health insurance should be able to deduct the full cost of their premiums. The federal government could target its health spending to provide clinics in rural areas and inner cities where access to health care remains a problem~ Long-overdue reforms to medical malpractice law would help lower insurance rates across the board. And a simplified, uniform insurance form would reduce paperwork, another unnecessary irritant of the current system. All these small steps would make health insurance less costly and health care easier to obtain. Even where national health budgeting is concerned, there exist opportunities for significant reform that do not involve Great Society-scale upheaval. States might be permitted to operate Medicare and Medicaid pro- grams through managed care, for example, rather than through now-mandated fee-for-service plans --and thereby realize huge cost savings in their own budgets. (The Democratic governor of Tennessee recently applied for, and received, the necessary waiver of federal regulations to pursue just such a reform.) In fact, there are all sorts of cumbersome and costly health care mandates and regulations now imposed on states; they should be lifted to allow governors to allocate their federal programs in the most efficient way. The potential savings from Medicare and Medicaid --the engine of our escalating federal deficit --are enormou s. These are hardly revolutionary or even visionary proposals. In fact, variations of these reforms have been floating around the Congress for some time. Their simplicity and their lack of big-government \"sophistica- tion\" stand in stark contrast to the extensive controls, reorganizing, standardization, and rationing that are at the heart of president's Health Security Plan. IV. LAYING GROUNDWORK FOR THE FUTURE These may only be intermediate measures. A more ambitious agenda of free-market reforms remains open for the future: medical IRAs, tax credits and vouchers for insurance, and the like. But Republicans must recognize the policy and tactical risks involved in near-term advocacy of sweeping change, however \"right\" it might be in principle. The Clinton plan's radicalism depends almost entirely for its success on persuading the nation that American medicine is so broken that it must not just be fixed, but replaced --wholesale and immediately. And it would be a pity if the advancement of otherwise worthy Republican proposals gave unintended support to the Democrats' sky-is-falling rationale. The more modest Republican reforms discussed earlier would have the virtue of cooling the feverish atmos- phere --fostered largely and deliberately by the Administration --in which health care is currently discussed . And they offer a potentially much larger benefit to the Republican Party as a model of future conservative public policy: a practical vision of principled incrementalism. The character of Republican opposition to the president's health care plan, properly pursued, has broad implications. The party's goal, in health care and in other policy areas, should be to make the case for limited government while avoiding either simple-mind - ed bean-counting, on the one hand, or Democrat-like utopian overreach on the other. The target of Republican policy prescriptions must be the individual citizen, not some abstract \"system\" in need of ham- fisted government repair. If we can, in this way, provide a principled alternative to the paternalistic experi- mentalism that consistently underlies Democratic ideas of governance, Republicans will be poised to claim the moral high ground in this and future debates. The first step in that process must be the unqualified political defeat of the Clinton health care proposal. Its rejection by Congress and the public would be a monumental setback for the president, and an incon- testable piece of evidence that Democratic welfare-state liberalism remains firmly in retreat. Subsequent replacement of the Clinton scheme by a set of ever-more ambitious, free-market initiatives would make the coming year's health policy debate a watershed in the resurgence of a newly bold and principled Republican politics.

MN 55402 (812) 37D-3312 La8t month you received a memorandum from Wllllam Krlatol from the Project for the Republican Future on the subject of defeating Praaklent Clinton's Health Care Proposal.\" Krlstol proposes an unquallflecl political defeat of the Cllnton propoaal -a \"monumental setback for the preaident: After the fall, Republlcans would offer a short Hat of more modest\" reform of lnturance, malpractice and paperwortt. A more ambltloua Republican agenda (tax credits, medical IRAs, etc.) would be uved for the Mure. He dubs this \"principled lncrementallsm.\" I don't doubt the sincerity of hia effort. However, Krlatol offse neither a winning polltlcal strategy nor a policy position that serves the beat lntarasta of the United States We do have a crisis In health care In this country. The Cllnton Administration haa wrongly characterized the problem as a crisis of access. It la NOT an access problem, It la a COST problem. If coats continue to escalate at current rates, health care expenditures will break the bank and our own be8t efforts at accen. It la enentlal that we accompllah reform of the health care dallvery aystam In order to control costa. The ONLY way to do that 11 to change the lncentlwa for the dallvmy of care. The market\u00b7 based refonna embodied In the Managed Competition Act (S. 1579) and the Republican HEART propoeal (S. 1770) will accomplllh the neceaaary ayalam reform. Kristof perpetuatea the unfortunate tendency to polarize the health reform debate around terms like comprehensive VERSUS incremental. It la a fal18 dichotomy. The Cllnton propoaal la fatally flawed, NOT becauae It Is so-called comprehensive. It la flawed bacauae it burtea markets In a tangle of regulatlon and bureaucracy. What Krlatol offera la also flawed, but not because it la Incremental. His modest recommendatlona are necenary and are embodied In the managed competition proposala. They are flawed because they offer no viaion for the future. Managed competition doean't do It all, but It gives ua a sense of direction-a comprehensive vision that Includes ALL the neceaaary first stepa to get us there. Krlatol cautlona Republicans not to compete with the President in a contest for radlcal reforms. By this, I asaume he la warning us away from the mlddle ground embodied In S. 1770 and S. 1579. I would remind him that Senate Republicana are not neophytes on this laaue: o Many of the Senate authors have devoted much of their careers to health policy. o John Chafee haa lad the Republican Task on Health through years of meetings to lncraaatl our knowledge of these complicated issues.

We must keep In mind that AU. our efforts at health reform In the last decade have been bipartisan. Republican prtnclples are not sacrificed by working collaboratlvely with Democrats. My cosponsors on S. 1679-Senators Breaux and Uebennan-share our commitment to market-based reform. The efforts of John Chafee, Jim Cooper (D-TN) and Fred Grandy (R-IA) In the Hou to build a mainstream coalition that la bipartisan and bicameral exempllftes our commonalltlea. I urv you NOT to fall Into the trap of negativity and deni4a. that approach haa failed Republicans polftlcally In the past and wlll fall ua again In the tuture. As a party, we do not need health care aa an unresolved luue In 1998. I am not suggesting that we must embrace the aertously flawed Clfnton bill. I am strongly opposed to It In Its present form. But, I belleva that H we stand firm on the market-baaed prtnclples of managed competition, and stand side-by-side with Democrata who share those prtnclples, we can prevail. President Clinton can't do reform with the liberal left. He can't do It with Democrats only. He can't do It without a significant group of Republlcans. We can't do reform -Incremental or comprehensive -without the President. Lat's perauada him the MCA/HEART ia the reform. I belleva that then reforms are In the belt lnteresta of the country. I also believe they are in the beat lnt .. sta of the Republican party because they are grounded in limited government and sound markata. To Mr. Krtstol, I simply say that Republlcans already have a winning strategy and that strategy la managed competition. To my Republican colleagues who have signed onto the HEART bill, I say leta stick to our prlnclples. There Is too much to lose If we do not.
