Read on to learn 10 tips on how to get energy naturally in just 10 minutes.

Do a Few Yoga Moves If you think yoga is only good for flexibility, think again. Studies have also shown that it improves posture, helps build strength, reduces stress, helps with breathing, can slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure, and even fight fatigue. If you're feeling tired, yoga is one of the natural ways to boost energy. A few [quick poses that can restore energy naturally](https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/yoga-by-benefit/fatigue) that you can try include the child's pose, downward-facing dog, and upward salute. If you're interested in giving yoga a try and need to get a mat, don't pick up one made with toxic PVC. Instead, [check out this list of the best non-toxic and eco-friendly yoga mats](https://earthfriendlytips.com/say-namaste-to-the-best-non-toxic-and-eco-friendly-yoga-mat/) to find one that's safer and healthier for you and the planet.

Drink a Glass of Water You might already know that it's easy to mistake hunger signals for thirst, but did you also know that sometimes fatigue is a sign of dehydration? If you're feeling tired, a tall glass of water might be all you need to perk up again. I admit I sometimes have a hard time remembering to drink enough water. That's why I got [this water bottle with time markers](https://amzn.to/2LR6sqy) to make sure I'm hydrating enough throughout the day. Best of all? It's glass, so I don't have to worry about dealing with BPA or any other harmful chemicals from plastic.

Don't Skip Breakfast I know I'm guilty of skipping breakfast if I'm feeling rushed in the morning and need to get out the door in a hurry. However, studies show that people who eat breakfast are in a better mood and have more energy throughout the day. Of course, making sure you eat the RIGHT thing for breakfast is also important. Yes, that pastry looks and tastes good, but that sweetness will only make your blood sugar spike before plummeting back down and leaving you feeling even more tired than before. Instead, go for healthy and high-fiber foods, such as oatmeal, nut butter on whole grain bread, berries, or Greek yogurt.

I also admit no one is going to be signing me to a record label any time soon. But that's OK. I still run around the house singing the latest song stuck in my head. It turns out that singing is helping me in multiple ways. [Scientists say singing not only has a calming effect](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/advertising/todayshealthywoman/ct-ss-thw-health-benefits-of-singing-a-tune-20180314dto-story.html) and is a natural antidepressant, but it's also energizing. So if you're feeling tired in the morning, don't be afraid to belt out your favorite tune in the shower. Of course, if you don't want your coworkers giving you weird glances during the workday, you might want to leave your best performances for when you're driving to and from work 5. Grab a Handful of Almonds Sometimes you might be feeling lethargic because you're low on some key vitamins and minerals. If you have a slight magnesium deficiency, you could find it difficult to get up and get moving. The [Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center in Grand Forks, North Dakota](https://agresearchmag.ars.usda.gov/2004/may/energy), did a study that found that women who had magnesium deficiencies also had higher heart rates and needed more oxygen to complete physical tasks. This meant their bodies were working harder to do things, which depleted their energy faster. Women should be getting around 300 milligrams of magnesium a day, and men should be consuming around 350 milligrams. If you're feeling sluggish and want to make sure you're getting enough magnesium, almonds and peanuts are natural energy boosters. If you're looking to make your almond snack as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, consider [Almond Lane products](https://amzn.to/2Aunsyj). I like Almond Lane because the nuts are grown in California using sustainable growing practices and the company uses steam pasteurization instead of chemical pasteurization.

Go for a Quick Walk Even though it seems like moving around when you're tired is only going to make you more tired, the exact opposite is true. Increasing physical activity when you feel tired, especially by going for a walk, is one of the great natural ways to boost energy. When you take a walk, your heart starts pumping oxygen-rich blood to your muscles and brain, which increases your energy. Even something as simple as a 10-minute brisk walk will help. In fact, as a [study done at California State University by Robert Thayer, PhD](http://www.csulb.edu/~psych/deptinfo/faculty/thayer/APA2005WashingtonDC.rtf) shows, not only did a vigorous 10-minute walk immediately increase energy, but the effects also lasted up to two hours after the walk was over. When participants in the study continued the daily 10-minute walks for three weeks, their overall mood and energy levels were also lifted.

Think about it for a second. When you're around someone who's negative and grumpy, you also feel like all your energy is sapped and you're in the dumps. On the other hand, when you hang around happy and positive people, your energy levels can get a real lift. If you're feeling tired in the middle of the afternoon, give your upbeat friend a quick call and chat for a few minutes. 8. Have a Snack Your brain and body need fuel to get up and get moving, and they get this fuel from food. When your blood sugar level starts to drop because you haven't eaten in a while, you'll begin to feel distracted and fuzzy. That's when you need to grab a snack. Snacks that have protein and slow-burning carbs, such as granola with berries or banana slices with nut butter, are an excellent option. 9. Sniff a Cinnamon Stick Smell is an incredibly powerful sense that can actually influence brain activity. A quick sniff of a cinnamon stick can help reduce fatigue and make you feel more alert. If you don't have a cinnamon stick handy, look for a peppermint. The candy's sweet and minty scent are said to be another great fatigue fighter.
