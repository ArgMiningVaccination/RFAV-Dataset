The Educational Programs Committee (EPC) is charged with creating and reviewing educational content to produce high-quality CE for the AAEP. The committee is composed of AAEP membervolunteers from both small and large private practices as well as academia and industry. Membersinclude both general practitioners and specialists. The Denver program includes invited papers for the \"In-depth\" and \"How to\" sessions as well as sessions comprised of papers that independent authors submitted for consideration. Topic choices forthe invited \"In Depth\" and \"How To\" sessions are based on member feedback from the 2010 and 2015AAEP CE Needs Analysis surveys. Topic session leaders are selected by the Program Chair, and thenthese session leaders invite a slate of speakers to prepare the papers that become an \"In Depth\"overview or a series of related \"How To\" talks. Although invited, these papers undergo a rigorous peerreview process by the EPC. Papers submitted by independent authors are each assigned 3 reviewers from the EPC. The reviewers do not know the names of the paper authors. Content is scored using the criteria of Study Design, StudyQuality, Innovation and Impact, Practicality, and Manuscript Quality. This year 166 papers weresubmitted for the 57 available slots on the program. Non-scientic sessions addressing business, wellness, ethical, and industry concerns are also planned as the scientic program materializes. Speakers who are invited to participate in these sessions preparepapers that are also reviewed by members of the EPC for inclusion in the Proceedings. The peer review process for the AAEP Proceedings is rigorous. It requires an enormous effort by every one of the 50 members of the EPC to create the best possible program for the AAEP membership. Manyvolunteer hours were spent putting together the Denver program, so please thank them for all theirhard work creating this program for you. ii 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFrom Your President Dear AAEP Members & Guests: Welcome to Denver and the 65thAnnual Convention.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 vGeneral Instructions for Authors 66thAAEP Convention Las Vegas, Nevada December 5-9, 2020 To submit a paper, go to https://s3.goeshow.com/aaep/annual/2020/AAEP_paper_submission.cfm ALL papers must be submitted online by March 16, 2020, 3:00 p.m. ET. The AAEP Proceedings is protected by copyright, and information submitted and accepted becomes the prop-erty of AAEP. However, requests for copies or reprintswill be honored by AAEP only with the cooperative per-mission of the presenting author, who by his or herpresentation represents all authors. AAEP reserves theright not to accept any submission without further re-course. Presentations for the AAEP Convention will be selected directly from the review-ready submissions to the AAEP.Submissions may include case series with follow-up data, orthe results of experimental or observational studies as sci-entic papers, as well as \"How to\" and review papers. Selec-tion will be made by the Educational Programs Committee.The quality of the submission will determine the selection.Missing data or proposed, but not completed, procedures willexclude the submission from consideration. AAEP invitesinformation dealing with any subject germane to equinepractice, but special consideration will be given to submis-sions by practitioners and material with practical content ornew information. At least one author of a report describingdiagnosis, treatment, or the interpretation of medical infor-mation should be a veterinarian. All submissions should strictly adhere to the Instructions for Authors. Submissions will be ranked using the AAEPScoring Criteria (found at the end of this document) and thehighest-ranking papers will be selected for the available time. Authors are expected to acknowledge all sources of fund- ing or support for the work described and to disclose to theEducational Programs Committee any nancial interest (in-cluding ownership, employment, consultancy arrangements,or service as an ofcer or board member) they have withcompanies that manufacture or sell products that gureprominently in the paper or with companies that manufac-ture or sell competing products. Such an interest will notnecessarily influence the decision to accept or reject a sub-mission for the program, but must be included in the Ac-knowledgments section for the convention Proceedings. Guidelines: Failure to adhere to the following format will result in non- acceptance. It is the author's responsibility to convince the Edu-cational Programs Committee of the value of the submission, aswell as to portray to the reader the contents of the presentation.Specic instructions for Scientic papers, \"How to\" papers,Review papers, <250 word abstracts, and Business papers can be found in their respective sections. Format: 12 point, Times New Roman font Double-spaced 1\" margins Headings should include (but are not limited to) the following:1. Take Home Message 2. Introduction3. Materials and Methods4. Results5. Discussion6. Acknowledgments i. Declaration of Ethicsii. Conflicts of Interest 7. References Proceedings should be written in the third person. Avoid the use of the rst person and pronouns such as I, we, my,mine, us, our, ours. Example of First vs. Third Person: Rather than stating in the rst person: \"We concludedfrom our results that A plus B did not equal C\", use thethird person: \"The results of the study indicated that Aplus B did not equal C\". Title: The title should be 15 words or fewer, at the top and on the rstpage. Example: Upper Respiratory Dysfunction in Horses During High SpeedExercise Take Home Message: This should be a concise summary of the main conclusionand should be no longer than two or three sentences (ap-proximately 50 words). \"How to\" papers do not require a take-home message. Example:Local anesthetic injected into the cofn joint is not selec-tive for only this joint. Such injections will desensitizemuch of the navicular bone and its suspensory ligaments. Introduction: The rationale for the submission should be given brieflyand signicant published work acknowledged here. Theclinical signicance should also be included, as well as aclear statement of the objective or purpose of the submis-sion. The statement of objectives is usually found in thelast sentence of the Introduction. Materials and Methods: This section should describe experimental methodology inthe case of a didactic study or, in the case of a clinical study,should include a description of the population from whichthe animals were selected and how they were selected forinclusion in the report. vi 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSData obtained and how they were obtained must be de- scribed. A description of the statistical methods used tosummarize data, test hypotheses, and characterize thesignicance of results should also be included. Normalityof the data should be described, and statistical analysisshould be appropriate for the distribution of the data (para-metric or non-parametric). For weights and measures, met-ric units should be used. Dosages should be expressedentirely in metric units and with specic time intervals. Example: 22 mg/kg, q 12 h, IV (not 10mg/lb, BID, IV) Results: Actual results with numbers and data must be presented. When possible, quantify ndings (mean, median, proportion) and pres-ent them with appropriate estimates of measurement error oruncertainty (such as standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE)or condence interval) in addition to the results of hypothesis testing. If the data can be well represented with a graph or gure, these are encouraged if subsequent publication is not anticipated. If numbers and data are not presented dueto concerns regarding publication in a refereed journal,indications of relative differences between groups such asodds ratios, % change, and signicant differences must beincluded in the submission to be considered acceptable. Inthese instances, the authors should submit the data in theform of means, standard deviations, or other descriptionsof comparisons among groups in an appendix, which willnot be published and only used for review purposes. Discussion: Important ndings documented in the results of the study should be stated. Results should be related to other workwhich has been done and how the results differ or agree withpreviously published work and why any differences may haveoccurred should be discussed. The practical take home mes-sage for the equine practitioner should be clearly dened andstated in the summarizing nal statement. This statement maybe longer, but should be similar in content to the take homemessage at the beginning of the paper. The following items must be fully explained in the paper: the number of horses that have been worked on, how many will beaffected, and evidence that the procedure works and is safe. Recommended Nomenclature: Anatomy and anatomic planes should be described usingstandard research (e.g. Grayson- Jockey Club Research Foundation, AQHA Foundation) and technical support forwork performed. Authors are expected to disclose the na-ture of any nancial interests (including ownership, em-ployment, consultancy arrangements, or service as anofcer or board member) they have with companies thatmanufacture or sell products that gure prominently inthe submission or with companies that manufacture orsell competing products. Declaration of Ethics: A Declaration of Ethics statement should be included in thepaper under the Acknowledgements section. Authors mustdeclare if they have adhered to the Principles of VeterinaryMedical Ethics of the AVMA (https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Principles-of-Veterinary-Medical-Ethics-of- the-AVMA.aspx) 1. If your paper or presentation references the use of a com- pounded pharmaceutical, please be certain that you are fa-miliar with the FDA guidelines on the use of compoundedpharmaceuticals and that the product you reference is incompliance. See section below regarding papers using com-pounded medications or medical devices. 2. All submissions should cite levels of evidence-based med- icine. You should plan to include any ethical considerations as part of your oral presentation if your paper is accepted. Conflicts of Interest: Authors are expected to disclose the nature of any nan-cial interests they have with companies that manufactureor sell products that gure prominently in the submissionor with companies that manufacture or sell competingproducts. (This includes ownership, employment, consul-tancy arrangements, or service as an ofcer or board mem-ber.) A Conflict of Interest statement should be included inthe paper under the Acknowledgments section whether aconflict exists or not. Example of COI Statement Conflict of Interest: Dr. John Doe has no conflict of interest. Dr. Jane Doe has served as a paid technology analyst for theventure capitalists that initiated the formation of CompanyABC and served as a member of the Board of Directors ofCompany ABC from its inception until 2008.

Submitted papers that use compounded drugs or medical devices will be reviewed by at least two individuals with ex-pertise in this area selected by the CE Steering Committee.The individuals will then make a recommendation to the EPCabout the suitability of the submission for potential inclu-sion in the program. Standard of Care: The AAEP is sensitized to having people use the term \"Stan-dard of Care\" from the podium. If you plan to do this, pleaseinclude this in your abstract or written submitted material sothe EPC can conrm its agreement with your statement. 1. A diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clinical circum-stance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer is \"a newstandard of care, but not necessarily the only standard ofcare.\" (New England Journal of Medicine, 2004). 2. In legal terms, the level at which the average, prudent pro- vider in a given community would practice.

Deadline: ALL papers must be submitted online by March 16,2020, 3:00 p.m. E.T. ; under no circumstances will submis- sions received after the deadline be considered or reviewed.ALL deadlines must be adhered to in order to have the pub-lished Proceedings available at the meeting. Review Process: To respect the integrity of the Annual Convention programand ensure the fairness of the review process, AAEP hasadopted blind reviewing in which the identity of the authorsand reviewers are not known to each other. Papers will bereviewed, scored, and selected by the Educational ProgramsCommittee. Please follow the blinding guidelines below. Blinding Guidelines: The title page and/or front matter of the blinded version of a paper should contain no references to any author or tohis/her afliation. All unpublished works by an author of the submitted man- uscript should be blinded. When referring to an author's publication, the form of third person should be used. Any acknowledgments section should be removed from the blinded version. Also, please delete any notes that indicateafliation, conference presentations, grants, author or de-partmental websites, etc. Do not use author name or afliation in the names of the submitted les. Scoring Criteria: One goal of the Educational Programs Committee (EPC) in choosing submissions for the AAEP annual meeting is to com-bine the best available clinical research with clinical experienceand expertise to meet the needs of our patients. The AAEPScoring Criteria can be requested from cross@aaep.org.Pre-Press Approval: Authors will have nal approval at the page proof stage.Changes/updates in numbers, dosages or inappropriategrammar may be made within one week of receiving pageproofs. Final grammatical changes will be the decision of theeditors. Substantial changes or removal of any data will re-sult in forfeiture of complimentary registration and travel,and exclusion from the program. Reimbursement: Presenting authors will receive one complimentary registra-tion and a reimbursement of $550 to help support travel. Mentors for Authors: Paper submissions by private practitioners and rst-timeauthors are highly encouraged.

Review Paper: Guidelines for Authors 66thAAEP Convention Las Vegas, Nevada December 5-9, 2020 To submit a paper, go to https://s3.goeshow.com/aaep/annual/2020/AAEP_ paper_submission.cfm ALL papers must be submitted online by March 16, 2020, 3:00 p.m. ET. Review papers are presented for the purpose of updating the membership on a new subject or for gathering informationthat may be conflicting. The aim of the paper is to help themembership put the information in perspective, and to makejudgments on conflicting information. A review paper will notprincipally present original data; the goal is to clarify existingknowledge on a subject and help the membership better usethe information in their day-to-day practice. Review papers should generally be formatted as described in the \"Instructions for Authors of Manuscripts\" exceptwhere otherwise noted here. The paper should be titled \"Re-view of Some Subject.\" The content of review articles should be organized with headings and subheadings that provide alogical flow to the material presented. A \"Take Home Mes-sage\" is required for a Review Paper. The Introduction shoulddene the subject matter and put it in context, explainingwhy the review is necessary. The purpose of the review papershould be clearly stated in the Introduction. Agreement and disagreement within the subject matter should be identied along with the strengths and limitationsof the information sources. Reference should be made to theauthors who generally support the opinions stated. The au-thor's perspective, including his/her own interpretation ofthe information if it is different from previously publishedopinions, should be included. The end of the discussionshould contain a summary and the conclusion that the au-thor has drawn for the audience, based upon the revieweddata. As with a Scientic Paper, a \"Take Home Message\"should be provided by the author that summarizes the prac-tical application of the information for the practitioner. An appropriately complete reference list should be in- cluded.

The Title should begin with \"How to . . .\" and clearly iden- tify the technique or procedure that will be presented. A \"Take Home Message\" is not required for \"How to\" papers. The Introduction should include why you use the technique. If there is a problem with the traditional methods or the cur-rently used method can be improved, this should be explained. The Materials and Methods section should explain exactly how the technique is performed so that another veterinarianfamiliar with the subject area could follow your example. Youmay use a step-by-step method for the paper and thepresentation. The Results section should include a summary of what happens when you use this technique. You may use personalassertions or data to assert its value, but you must explainhow you determined that the technique works. In the Discussion section, you can give your personal views as to why you think the technique works. Discuss thepros and cons of your approach. Explain how the techniqueis helpful and why this should be important to your col-leagues.

The risk factorsthat predispose to its development in an individualhave only partially been identied but the disease isbecoming more prevalent and yet there is still littleinterest in advancing research efforts. It affectshorses of all ages, although the majority of cases arerst presented between 2 and 9 years of age. Sexappears to play no signicant role although therehave been suggestions that geldings are over-represented. Almost all breeds of horses, mules,donkeys, asses, and zebras are susceptible althoughthere is some suggestion of an increased prevalence in \"thin-skinned\" horses. The Quarter Horse andthe Lipizzaner are reported to be less susceptible.The disease has remarkable spectrum of morpho-logic appearance (Fig. 1). A genetic basis for the disease has been estab- lished. Several genetic lines have known predispo-sition but individuals within those lines may not getsarcoids at all while others may be severely affected.While this may supercially suggest that there issome heritable aspect of the disease it is very impor-tant to realize that there are other factors that needto be present for a particular animal to get thedisease. It is easy to propose that horses with sar- coids should not be used for breeding but the genetictendency to the disease probably exists in a farhigher number of horses than actually show overtsarcoid skin disease. The suggested autosomal-recessive gene responsible for imparting a suscepti-bility to the condition probably has an influence onthe number type and severity of lesions, and thetendency to recurrence and exacerbation in an indi-vidual. Realistically therefore we are not in anyposition at this time to advise that affected horsesshould not be used for breeding but it is reasonableto try to exert breeding pressure against the diseaseby avoiding the breeding of two badly affectedhorses. For many years, researchers have been trying to nd a cause for the disease but are still some wayfrom a denitive answer. The role of papillomaviruses remains uncertain\u2014no patent virus particle has yet been conclusively demonstrated but a veryhigh proportion of sarcoids have genetic materialthat is identical or very similar to that found inbovine papilloma viruses (BPV). The distributionof lesions and the epidemiology of sarcoids stronglysuggest that flies are a signicant factor in thespread both across an individual horse or betweenhorses 1(Fig. 2). How the fly and the \"virus\" /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 1IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY NOTESlinked has yet to be established and sarcoids also occur de novo where no cattle are present. The recent discovery of the BPV in flies around affected horses has been suggested to explain the develop-ment of de novo sarcoids but it is unlikely that it is as simple as this! The equine sarcoid is a broblastic tumor and the clinical behavior of the transformed cells is typical of Fig. 1. The equine sarcoid is unique in respect to its etiology and its epidemiology. It also occurs in several distinct forms and individual animals may have several or many lesions and these may be varied in appearance. A, An ulcerated Type B1 sarcoid. There is skin involvementbut limited/no root extension beyond a pathologically recognizable brocellular capsule. B, A mixed sarcoid with an early broadly based (Type 2)broblastic sarcoid within a wide area of occult sarcoid that is developing verrucous features. C, The whole medial thigh is inltrated with occultsarcoid. There are broblastic lesions distally and Type A and Type B nodules proximally overlying the saphenous vein. Fig. 2. A and B, Flies appear to feed preferentially on sarcoid lesions if they can. All types of sarcoid seem attractive feeding sites.The role of surface feeding and biting flies is probably complex and currently not understood. Transmission is probably much morelikely via surface feeding flies than those that feed on blood. Biting flies do not appear on sarcoid sites. Where multispecies of fliesattack a site on the horse, sarcoid could be present or could develop. 2 2019 as a form of brosarcoma or spindle-cellsarcoma. As a result, a wide variety of morpholog-ical pathological descriptions are applied to the dis-ease and it is quite likely that these are individuallycorrect in terms of the histological appearance.The term sarcoid was rst used by Jackson 2to depict its generally sarcomatous appearance. It is used to encompass a spectrum of broblastic neo-plasms. Furthermore, the verrucose (\"wart-like\")appearance of many manifest by ahyperkeratotic, exfoliative, and acanthotic nature,cannot be accounted for simply in terms of the be-havior of broblasts. Fibroblasts have no mecha-nism for the production of keratin and shouldtherefore have no influence on the behavior of theoverlying or adjacent epidermis. The role of thepapillomavirus DNA in the behavior of the overlyingand surrounding keratinocytes and in the conse-quent clinical appearance of the \"typical sarcoid\" isan interesting controversy. Some pathologists arenot prepared to make a diagnosis of sarcoid if thereare no epithelial changes or if there is no epitheliumon the biopsy specimen. Given that the sarcoid is aprimary tumor of broblasts this is somewhat sur-prising and it seems that the denition given byJackson 2in 1936 has been taken as the denitive description. However, he stated that the sarcoid had a variable dermal component, implying perhapsthat it need not have any at all. Furthermore, alltransmission experiments that have been performedidentify that the \"danger cell\" is indeed the bro-blast. It seems more likely now that the keratino-cytic responses are secondary to growth factorsexpressed in the broblasts by the viral genome andthis is a plausible and adequate explanation for theclinical appearance of the disease. It does not, how-ever, explain the variations in clinical phenotype ofthe tumors. The location of the typical sarcoid gives signicant clues on the true nature of the disease. The mostsusceptible regions of the body appear to be thin-skinned, hairless areas where sweating occurs.The common feature of these areas is of course thatflies can and do feed at these locations. This ex-plains why supercial sarcoids on the distal limband body trunk are much less common and whenthey do occur, they invariably follow skin injury;the size of the injury need not be clinically signi-cant and even fly bite sites and injection sites can bea focus of primary tumor development. The role ofwounds in the pathogenesis is an important newconcept in the understanding of the disease. If weaccept that flies are in some way involved in thepathogenesis of sarcoid then we need to establishhow this is the case. Does the fly transmit the\"papilloma virus\" as a vegetative virus or is thehypothesis that it is in fact the cells that are trans-located across the horse and between horses enoughto explain the distribution and epidemiology of thedisease? The latter appears to be a genuine possi- bility and it may explain, in part at least, why somehorses get many more than others and why someindividuals are never affected. Here it may be amatter of the relationship between the host and the\"imported transformed cell.\" Sarcoids commonly multiply on the individual horse; sometimes very rapidly while some others re-main relatively, or even completely, static for years (oreven for life). Interference, however caused, doescause signicant exacerbation in most (but not all)horses. One of the remarkable features of the equine sarcoid is the variation in morphology of the tu-mors. Six different types have been described. 3 The classication of the sarcoid is an important fea-ture because the various types have very differentimplications and therapeutic demands. However,most individual lesions have features that t morethan one classication. The options available arealso affected signicantly by the location, the extentand the duration of ten sarcoids. Histologically,the various types are very distinctive and mostpathologists recognize the primary features of bro-blast and blood vessel distribution and the second-ary changes in overlying epidermis when that ispresent. Clinically and pathologically, sarcoids present most of the features of a true neoplasm; indeed, theauthor believes that it is best regarded as a form ofskin cancer. Although this may not be strictly truein pathological terms it does at least suggest thatthe behavior of the tumor is unpredictable and thattreatment may be problematic. It is, however,clear that it is not a wart! Sarcoids generally (notonly the malignant form) have a high capacity forlocal tissue invasion into the surrounding skin andother tissues. This is particularly dangerous in theeyelid and this problem has been highlighted byKnottenbelt and Kelly. 4This local spread makes treatment very difcult and may explain why sar- coids have a bad reputation for recurrences and thedevelopment of new tumors following surgical exci-sion or other interference. In the immediate peri-orbital and palpebral skin, the invasion means thattreatment selection is very limited unless the sec-ondary consequences of palpebral scarring, loss offunction and deformity can be addressed or toler-ated. In many cases these result in loss of the eye. Six distinct clinical entities which are noticeably different can be recognized 5(Fig. 3 ). Although each of these forms is comm only identiable it is impor- tant to recognize that the \"less severe\" forms canrapidly progress to the more aggressive types, par-ticularly if they are traumatized. Furthermore, thespecic types may not be clearly identiable in everycase; the spectrum of morphological forms is a con-tinuum with almost innite variety (Fig. 4). It ishowever patently obvious that even the mildestforms are indeed sarcoid\u2014 in vitro cell cultures de- rived from these are typical and indistinguishable AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 3IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYfrom those taken from the more aggressive lesions. These factors suggest that both cell and host factorsare responsible in combination for the variety offorms. Occult Sarcoid Lesions show as hairless areas, often roughly circu-lar (Fig. 5). They usually contain one or more smallcutaneous nodules (2-5 mm diameter) or roughenedareas with a mild hyperkeratotic appearance butthese may or may not be present or obvious in everycase. An area of changed/altered, slightly thick-ened skin with thin hair coat and slight changes inhair pigment may be encountered and may be dif-cult to identify in winter-coated animals. The le-sions are characteristically slow growing; they mayprogress to \"warty\" verrucous growths or if injuredmay develop rapidly into broblastic lesions. Care-ful palpation of the affected sites will invariablyidentify a number (ranging from one to many) min-ute skin nodules which are invariably intradermal.For the most part at least one signicant dermal\"nodule\" will be palpable. The effects on the hairand the keratinocytes is probably a paracrine ef-fect resulting from abnormal possibly BPV-relatedmediators expressed by transformed broblasts.There may be coalescing lesions or in some cases theoccult changes may be very extensive. In sites suchas the face and the medial thigh these lesions maybe distributed over cutaneous veins. Cases have existed for over 15 years without treatment or acceleration; however, extensive devel-opment of verrucose sarcoid or conversion into bro-blastic type sarcoid, usually demand immediateattention. This can occur at any time with or with-out apparent insult. While the lesion remains as astatic/quiescent hairless patch showing no evidenceof growth in size or number of nodules, it may bewise not to interfere.The predilection sites include the skin around the mouth and eyes, the neck and other relativelyhairless areas of the body including the inside ofthe forearm, armpit, and thigh. However, the au-thor has encountered this type in almost everylocation. Differential diagnoses include the following: 1. Alopecia areata have a hyperkeratotic (wart-like) appearance and scaling over limited or widerareas of the body (Fig. 6). Extensive areas can beaffected and are often surrounded by an area ofslightly thickened/changed skin (possibly reflectinga surrounding area of early occult sarcoid) with al-tered, thin hair-growth pattern. Often, the earlylesions are circular in nature and then many of thosehave an \"occult\" halo around them. The presence ofan occult halo around a verrucose roughly circularlesion on the skin of a horse is pathognomonic forsarcoid. Often there is at least one focus of dermalor epidermal nodule formation and this can be takento indicate sarcoid also. Individual lesions may be sessile (flat-based) or pe- dunculated (with a narrow neck) giving a true wartlike appearance\u2014indeed this type is probably thesource of the name \"wart,\" which is commonly used inlay reference to sarcoid. The name is of course mis-leadingly benign for a potentially very dangerous andgenuinely neoplastic condition. The lesions are mostoften slow growing and not very aggressive untilinjured/insulted. However, small nodules may ap-pear at any stage or over any area of the affected skin. Fig. 3. A suggested classication of the common forms of the equine sarcoid, as previously described by Knottenbelt.5Classication really matters since therapy for each type will necessarily be different. Additionally, there are constraints in respect of treatment from location and extent/number of lesions and other factors listed in the later parts of this manuscript. 4 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYThese may develop a true broblastic character whether or not they are insulted or traumatized.Rubbing, biopsy, partial excision, or minor or majortrauma to the surface commonly results in a dramaticchange to broblastic sarcoid over variable areas of thelesion. Most often this type is seen on the face, body and groin/sheath, and ventral belly areas. The verrucose sarcoid can be mistaken for papil- lomatosis (true warts), chronic blistering, severechronic rubbing, or irritation (such as can be seen ina few cases of sweet itch) and for some forms of pemphigus, sarcoidosis, subcutaneous, spherical nodules of 5-20 mmdiameter but can be much larger (Fig. 7). Most oftenthis type can be found in the groin, sheath, or eyelidareas. The number of nodules varies widely\u2014single, Fig. 4. The equine sarcoid is almost certainly the most phenotypically diverse tumor in any species. Six different classically recognizable types occur with subtypes for several of them. The variation in type is only one of the constraints that apply totherapeutic options\u2014it is, however, one of the most important aspects of the diagnostic process. Each type has its own set ofdifferential diagnoses of course and co-morbidity with other diseases adds signicant complexity to the clinical process. A, An occultsarcoid on the thigh. B, An early aggressive sarcoid with verrucose and occult components. C, A verrucose lesion overlying a majorblood vessel. D, A nesting Type B2 nodular complex on the ear margin. E, A verrucose sarcoid developing in a scar site on the dorsalhock. F, A broblastic type 1B sarcoid on the fetlock. G, A mixed sarcoid on the face\u2014note the strong occult margin. H, Abroblastic Type 2 sarcoid in a very unusual location. No site is exempt from sarcoid although it is always related to the skin. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 5IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYfew, several or hundreds are common. The nodules usually lie under apparently normal skin and thenmay be freely movable. However, sometimes thereare dermal and deep attachments, which prevent in-dependent movement of the overlying skin and/ormovement of the tumor mass relative to deeper tissue.The overlying skin may become thin over larger nod- ules and when these ulcerate, they quickly becomemore aggressive broblastic type tumors. Coalescentnodules of both the major types (see below) are com-mon and often there are large numbers of interlinkednodules. Fig. 5. A and B, Typical examples of occult sarcoid. The cardinal features include a roughly circular shape, sparse hair coat density (or over alopecia), scaling and at least one nodule within the region (which may only be palpable and not visible). Fig. 6. The verrucose sarcoid has a warty appearance (A-D) and early lesions in particular may have an occult margin (\"halo\"; panelE). They can be extensive/coalescent and multiple lesions are common (F). 6 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYA similar aggressive iatrogenic or accidental or iatrogenicdamage. Nodular sarcoids are conveniently divided into 2 types: Type A These are devoid of clinically detectable dermal in- volvement; the skin moves freely over their surface(although in some cases the skin can be signicantlythinner than normal (simply as result of atrophy).Type A1 nodules also move freely over the underly-ing tissues. Type A2 nodules do not move freelyand have a bound-down character indicating thatthey have involvement with deeper tissues, and thelesion moves freely over the underlying subcutane-ous tissues. Pathologically, Type A1 nodules are often sur- rounded by a very loose connective tissue. Thismakes their treatment much simpler. This type ofsarcoid is probably the only one that can be surgi-cally removed without signicant risk\u2014althoughthe procedure of removal does require that no dam-age is caused to the actual body of the tumor duringremoval. They can also be treated by application ofan elastrator band. It is unwise to treat Type A2nodules with the same approach since the roots areinvasive and seldom easily incorporated in a surgi- cal wound or in a ligation band. Type B These lesions resemble Type A but they have a dis- cernible dermal involvement. The overlying skincannot be moved independently. Although the cap-sule may be loose more often there is a deeper in-volvement of the subcutis and so surgical treatmentis highly problematical. However, in many casesthe lesions can be satisfactorily incorporated in anelastrator band and often this will achieve a goodresult. However, more often a combination withsome cytotoxic agent is used. Nodular sarcoids can be melanoma, brosarcoma, evensome rare and para-sitic larvae migration nodules. For the most part,however, diagnosis is relatively easy and furtherinvestigations such as biopsy or ultrasonographycan be helpful where doubt exists. Fig. 7. The nodular sarcoid can have no dermal component and may be rooted or unrooted (bound down or not bound down). Many pathologists are uncomfortable with a diagnosis of sarcoid in this case since they consider that epidermal changes are a compulsoryfor a diagnosis of sarcoid. The bottom left picture, however, shows a case of a Type A nodule that was biopsied 3 weeks previously\u2014adiagnosis of \"broma\" was made at that time but a biopsy taken from the ulcerated site at the time of the picture was categoricallydiagnosed as sarcoid. Type B nodules involve the skin and may also be rooted to provide the Type B1 (unrooted\u2014not bound down)classication or the Type B2 broblastic sarcoid has a characteristic fleshy appearance and this type is commonly referred to as\"Angleberry\" (a rather romantic name that quitebelies the severity of the condition that should beused only for a visually similar type of skin tumor incattle) (Fig. 8). Both pedunculated and extensive sessile tumors with prominent ulceration and serum exudation are com-monly encountered. The latter may reflect single orrepeated insults to the \"lesser\" forms but may developspontaneously. They are common at sites of wounds(especially if other sarcoids are present elsewhere). Accidental wounds that fail to heal may contain signicant sarcoid components in the wound mar-gins and mixed with granulation tissue (Fig. 9).Surgical wounds are also liable to sarcoid develop-ment. Failure of a surgical wound to heal in ahorse with sarcoids elsewhere could be associatedwith sarcoid transformation at the site althoughthere are many other possible causes of the sameproblem. The broblastic proliferation at a woundsite can be very extensive but an interesting featureof sarcoid transformation at wound sites is that le-sions on the body trunk (that might normally expectto heal well by contraction) develop a verrucose sar-coid while those lesions that develop at the site oflimb wounds (where healing is notoriously slow and difcult and where exuberant granulation tissue de-velops) develop a broblastic lesion. While thereare exceptions to this rule, it is a signicant patho-physiological aspect. In spite of their aggressive appearance, broblas- tic sarcoids do not metastasize but can spread locallyin dermis by local invasion/extension. Repeated in-sult (accidental or iatrogenic) encourages local sub-dermal and dermal invasion. The other majorcomplication is the attraction that flies have to ul-cerated and bleeding sarcoids. This simply pro-vides a relatively direct and easy means of spread ofsarcoid to other sites on the body and possibly evento other horses. Predilection sites include the groin, eyelid, lower limbs and coronet, sites of skin wounds at any loca-tion and sites of any other types of sarcoid subjectedto trauma or insult. This type of sarcoid looks like exuberant granula- tion tissue, \"proud flesh,\" especially when it developsat the site of a wound and more particularly at thesite of limb wounds). Mixed (Verrucous, Nodular, and Fibroblastic) Sarcoid This type of sarcoid probably represents a progressive/transient state between the verrucous/occult types and Fig. 8. Fibroblastic sarcoids have a characteristic fleshy appearance that can vary from exudative to hemorrhagic and they are commonly secondarily infected. Where there is a pedicle (A and B) they are classied as Type 1 broblastic sarcoids. Withinthis group Type 1a have no root (top left) and Type 1b has an invasive root/foot that imparts a dumbbell form. C, The Type 2broblastic sarcoid is sessile\u2014there is no denable pedicle and these invariably have invasive roots that make surgical excisionboth difcult and potentially impossible unless a sufcient margin can be achieved. D, Fibroblastic sarcoid is a commondevelopment from other \"milder\" forms when these are interfered with either accidentally or intentionally (biopsy or partialexcision). 8 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYbroblastic/nodular types (Fig. 10). Variations in proportion of the several types of sarcoid is innite andcomplex mixtures of any or all of the above types(containing both verrucous and broblastic elements)are common in longstanding lesions or those subjectedto repeated minor trauma (such as rubbing by tackor harness). They become progressively more aggres-sive as more broblastic transformation takesplace\u2014a common consequence of biopsy or injury.The reality is that almost every sarcoid is actuallymixed with primary lesions and secondary changesbut this classication is reserved for lesions in whichno dominant type can be identied. The mixed sarcoid makes therapeutic decisions more complex and the clinician will immediatelyrecognize that several different areas may have tobe dealt with within the overall affected area.They are really easy to diagnose simply by visualinspection. However, some lesions may have el-ements of other skin pathology, and in particular melanoma or carcinoma within the region, andthen of course the diagnosis and treatment be-come necessarily more complicated. It is there-fore wise to always study the lesions as preciselyas you can\u2014it takes time admittedly, but that'swhat the client is paying for and that's what theyshould get! Malignant/Malevolent Sarcoid This is a poorly recognized, infrequent variation ofthe sarcoid 5,6with predilection sites in the jaw, face, elbow, and medial thigh areas in particular (Fig. 11). A particularly dangerous form occurs in the imme-diate area around the eye. A history of repeatedtrauma to other types of sarcoid (e.g., surgical inter-ference) is commonly described. Some cases haveno such history with spontaneous development oftypical multiple, locally invasive sarcoids. Others Fig. 9. Sarcoid transformation is a signicant cause of incipient wound healing failure and is easily mistaken for exuberant granulation tissue. Since the treatments are diametrically opposite for the two conditions it is vital that the diagnosis is correct.Interestingly, sarcoids that develop on limb and head wounds more commonly develop a broblastic type (each of the ve cases shownhere with limb wound healing failure has sarcoid rather than Proud Flesh). A, Multiple broblastic sarcoid developing at the sitesof small wire injuries. B, This horse sustained multiple injuries but only one developed a sarcoid. C, A severe horizontal wound onthe dorsal tarsus healed remarkably well apart from laterally and dorsally where broblastic sarcoid developed. D, A dramaticbroblastic sarcoid developed within 14 days of a small wound on the cannon of a pleasure horse mare. Diagnosis was conrmed ona biopsy of \"exuberant granulation tissue\" taken 6 days after the injury. The mare had no other sarcoids but was in close daily contactwith another badly affected horse. E, In contrast to the limbs, sarcoid transformation on the body trunk usually develops a verrucosesarcoid. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 Mixed sarcoids have no predominate type and more than one distinct morphological form that can be recognized as falling into one of the more dened types. These pictures illustrate some examples that could be classied as mixed sarcoid.A, A mixed axillary sarcoid with verrucose and broblastic aspects in roughly equal measure. B, A mixed sarcoid with nodular,verrucose, occult, and early broblastic parts. C, A mixed nesting nodular and verrucose complex giving it no predominate typeand classifying it as mixed. Fig. 11. The malignant form of sarcoid is a locally invasive, aggressive, and inltrative tumor. It is most common on the side of theface, the elbow, and the groin regions (including the pre-femoral flank fold). It does not metastasize so the term malignant has beenavoided. A 14-year-old Welsh cob stallion developed malignant sarcoid in all the characteristic places including the medial thigh (A),the elbow (B), the face (C), and the ear (D). 10 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYshow extensive inltration of lymphatics (cords of tumor are commonly palpable) with numerous ulcer-ative nodules and surface involvement as well aspossible extension to local lymph nodes. The malignant/malevolent form of sarcoid is particularly dangerous, not least because there isno current treatment for it. Its appearance is noteasily mistaken for other skin diseases butagain the presence of several different types ofsarcoid elsewhere on the body makes the diagnosisrelatively simple. It's treatment that is aproblem! Diagnosis How Can We Be Sure That a Particular SkinLesion Is, in Fact, a Sarcoid? Given that each dened sarcoid type has a genuine set of differential diagnoses that may have pro-foundly different implications both for the treatmentand the prognosis, it is important to have the capa-bility to conrm a diagnosis. An isolated single/individual lesion on a horse can be difcult todiagnose although with experience most can be rec-ognized. Fortunately, the large majority of affectedhorses have more than one lesion and many haveover 25-30. Multiple tumors with characteristicfeatures of the various types of sarcoid on an indi-vidual horse make the diagnosis simple\u2014there areno other diseases with the same range of clinicalfeatures and types. There is a danger of course inoverlooking the possibility of mixed diagnoses:comorbidity is a potential hazard for a casualveterinarian! A few cases are difcult nevertheless and then biopsy is sometimes required. Some vets are un-derstandably reluctant to interfere with a sarcoidand so may not elect to obtain a biopsy. The authorhas much sympathy with this approach because thisinterference may trigger a signicant (sometimes dra-matic) and uncontrollable expansion of the lesion.Particular difculty with diagnosis can arise whensarcoid is diffusely mixed with granulation tissue.Biopsy may be very misleading if only one of the twotissue types is recognized in the specimen. In mostcases, diagnosis does not require a biopsy and so treat-ment can be instituted immediately. In reality bi-opsy should not be fared unduly. If a diagnosiscannot be made with some degree of certainty fromclinical features alone, then a biopsy can be justied solong as there is plan to manage the conditions once itis established. There is no merit in biopsy when theresults of the biopsy are not going to influence what isdone. Summary In most cases the diagnosis is relatively simple be-cause most horses either have more than one lesionor have a lesion that cannot really be anything else.The reason classication is important is that thevarious forms of sarcoid require different clinicalapproaches; the type of sarcoid involved (an animal may have any mixture of types on it!) is only one ofthe constraints on treatment that challenge theclinician. Sarcoid Transformation at Wound Sites One of the most dangerous problems that occur with the sarcoid relates to those that develop at sites ofwounds (including surgical wounds). Accidentalwounds that fail to heal may contain signicantsarcoid components in the wound margins and ad-mixed with granulation tissue. Even a smallwound on the distal limb can become a very trouble-some sarcoid with a complete or partial failure ofthe wound to heal. While the clinical appearance ofproud flesh can be remarkably similar, treatmentsfor the two conditions are very different. Indeed,treatment that is suitable for proud flesh (cuttingback and grafting) serve only to make the sarcoideven more aggressive and even more impossible totreat effectively. Thus, wound management inall horses, and those with sarcoid skin tumors atother sites (and those with no sarcoids that aregenetically susceptible to the disease) are particu-larly important. The broblastic proliferation at a wound site can be very extensive but an interesting feature of sar-coid transformation at wound sites is that lesions onthe body trunk (that might normally expect to healwell by contraction) develop a verrucose sarcoidwhile those lesions that develop at the site of limbwounds (where healing is notoriously slow and dif-cult and where exuberant granulation tissue devel-ops) develop a broblastic lesion. While there areexceptions to this rule it is a signicant pathophys-iological aspect. The tendency to exacerbation and recurrence biopsy, treatment, or other interferencemeans that \"rst presentation\" diagnosis needs to beas accurate as possible. The development of mod-ern PCR methods to detect the smallest amounts ofgenetic material has recently been used to identifythe BPV genome in swabs simply taken from thesurface of a suspected sarcoid. This is certainlyhelpful, particularly in the differentiation of otherclinically similar conditions. Otherwise there islittle new in the diagnosis. Veterinarians continueto rely largely upon intuitive supposition or stan-dard biopsy techniques: the former may be unreli-able for less experienced clinicians and the lattermay be problematic unless a treatment method isavailable immediately. There remains a real need for a greater consensus among pathologists and this could provide real prog-ress in both diagnosis and treatment. 2. Treatment Options for Equine Sarcoid New Perspectives in Therapy Factors that must be considered by a clinician before embarking on any therapy are shown in the follow- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 11IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYing numbered list. The fact is, however, that in almost every case there are interlinking consider-ations that have to be taken into account. Unfor-tunately, if all of these aspects are considered fully,it is likely that no horse would be treated! Compro-mises have to be made almost inevitably and everycompromise decision has a consequence, and this isusually a negative consequence rather than a posi-tive one. 1.

Tumor Type and Behavior Some sarcoids are amenable to surgery while others are far less so. The clinical behavior also mattersparticularly because of the risks of interferenceand/or the risks of local malignancy. 2. Tumor Location Anatomic constraints will inevitably affect the choice of treatment. For example, removal of skinon the face is difcult and any treatment that scarsthe upper eyelid will be specically contraindicated. 3. Tumor Extent Large tumors are obviously going to be more difcult to treat than small ones\u2014size does matter. 4. Time Between Tumor Development and Presentation Typically, of cancer therapy, early treatment is much more effective than late treatment. The fail-ure of owners (and, unfortunately, all too often vet-erinarians) to address a relatively trivial matter in atimely fashion so that cases are presented late in thecourse when treatment is virtually impossible.However, sometimes the signs are either so benignor so subtle that even a caring owner may easilymiss them or at least attribute less signicance tothem. This can also be complicated by applicationof irrational and inappropriate \"treatments.\" 5. Cost of Treatment The cost of treatment is often of major concern to owners and the more so when the relative value ofthe horse is low. The size of the patient means thatall methods of treatment whether topical, surgical,or systemic are likely to be expensive. It might bebetter in some cases to encourage the expensiveoption because the lesser ones may carry a muchpoorer prognosis. Nevertheless, there are timeswhen a cheaper, less sophisticated method will work adequately; this will depend largely on the tumortype, its extent, location, and the skill and experi-ence of the veterinarian. 6. Owner and Patient Compliance In order to be successful a treatment needs to be used in the correct manner and where the applica-tion of the treatment is compromised either by theowners or the horse's lack of compliance the outlookwill inevitably be adversely affected. Painful treat-ments or those that require prolonged contact areoften not well tolerated. 7. Facilities and Expertise It is clear that horses treated by experienced veter- inarians under ideal conditions have a better over-all prognosis. Where sophisticated facilities exist,treatment options are necessarily wider and so amore focused option may be applied. For example,the prognosis with surgical excision may be im-proved by use of laser instruments or by concurrentchemotherapy. Radiation treatment is the goldstandard but it is only available in a few centers andin any case is also applicable only to small tumors insuitable sites. Interestingly, a few individual horses and some individual lesions on a horse show spontaneous fulland permanent self-cure and in the author's experi-ence, spontaneous full remission (self-cure) of everylesion on an affected horse usually means that thehorse will not develop further lesions. This is theone group of horses that can probably be assumed tobe totally resistant. It is likely that this responsehas some immunological basis and this might be avery interesting line of research. There is no ap-parent correlation between the number of lesionsand the likelihood of spontaneous regression/self-cure or indeed the tendency to develop multiple le-sions. The course of the condition is entirelyunpredictable and it is probably unwise to assumethat there are any invariable rules about the disor- der; even the most benign-looking small lesion can erupt into a potentially catastrophic mass in a shorttime. The value of small-interfering MRNA andtargeting methods for E5 gene expression appears tobe increasingly positive. Notwithstanding the self-cure cases, and the hope of some immunologic/genetic therapy in thefuture, treatment should follow as soon after diag-nosis as possible. Suspicious lesions can justiablybe treated immediately after biopsy using a suitableregimen. There are 10 or more recognized treat-ment methods for the disease and up to 40 different\"treatments\" that can be found on the Internet;most of the latter are reported to have a 100% re-sponse (remarkably some have a greater than 100%efcacy!). It is surprising then that these have notproven successful in eliminating the disease. Infact, most of the hearsay results and unsubstanti-ated reports are simply lies of one sort or another. 12 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYThe wide range of recognized treatments, however, suggests that no one treatment is invariably effec-tive. Indeed, with the possible exception of radia-tion (which is largely impractical for most cases)treatments are all inadequate in some respect. Further, what works for one veterinarian may not work for others and so each veterinarian needs to becareful about the treatment modality selected.It is imperative, however, that the best possibletreatment method is applied the rst time; this is abasic principle of cancer treatment. The selectionof an inadequate (compromise) treatment will usu-ally lead to later complications and possibly evenacrimony between the veterinarian and the owner.It may be better to leave the lesion untreatedthan to interfere with an inadequate methodthat has little or no chance of resolving thelesion. Failure to resolve the lesion results in a drop in the prognosis of around 40% for each failedattempt! Bearing in mind the rather poor progno-sis from which most lesions start, failure is bad andtwo failures is a disaster. Treatment options available for the sarcoid are shown below. Combinations of treatments are of-ten better than single approaches and again this is acommon approach in cancer therapy in all species. The concept of benign neglect in the management of sarcoid is based on the fact that up to 10% of casesmay resolve spontaneously 7and the strongly held belief that incomplete removal or incomplete treat- ment results in signicant exacerbation. It is alsowidely held that treatment for sarcoid is problematic in terms of logistic and welfare considerations.It is generally considered that it is probably better todo nothing than to risk doing harm. Reported treatment methods include the following: 1. Surgical Excision This is always an attractive option for accessible be-nign, well-dened tumors at convenient sites withgood surgical access. It is relatively simple and usesbasic principles of surgery and success rates can reachover 80% in some cases where enough case selection isapplied to maximize successful outcomes. Evidence suggests, however, that recurrence oc- curs in over 50% of cases subjected to surgicalexcision. 8,9The author has improved the overall success of surgical treatment with the use of a tech- nique for minimal contamination surgery (SMARTSURGERY a) resulting in an overall improvement from 42% to 63% success in selected cases that are either considered ideal surgical options or wheresurgery is the only option available (Fig. 12). Surgical tumor reduction is used in combination with other methods such as radiation and intratu- moral chemotherapy or immunotherapy to improvethe outlook and maximize successful treatment. 2. Cryonecrosis This has similar constraints to surgery and in manystudies the results are very similar. 10The destruc - tion of tissue tends to be indiscriminate and so dur- Fig. 12. Smart surgery is a technique that minimizes the seeding and contamination of the surgical site with tumor cells desqua- mated from the open surface or cut edges of a tumor and is very suitable in most circumstances for sarcoid removal. A and B, Thetumor is isolated from the surgical site by dressings and clamps. C, Sutures are preplaced along the proximal edge of the projectedexcision line and the tumor is then removed by laser or sharp incision between the line of sutures and the clamps. D, Effectively thewound site is closed before the incision is made. E, A dressing can then be applied if deemed necessary. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 13IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYing the procedure, surrounding normal tissues are almost inevitably damaged. Failure occurs wheneither the margins of the mass cannot be dened orthe true extent of the tumor cannot be dened, butthere are reports of its successful use in various sitesincluding the eyelid and mouth. The concept ofimmunological responses arising from \"cryoanti-gens\" acting at sites remote from the procedure wasraised by Lane. 11Success rates vary from 30% to over 90%. 3. Laser Excision The availability of CO2-YAG and diode laser units is increasing and there are clear advantages in its use but the selection of the cases is critical.12The ad - vantages of laser surgery lie in the bloodless surgicaleld, the ne control that is possible and the \"cau-tery\" of the incision edges. The drawback is theslow healing rate and the need for expensive surgi-cal equipment. 4. Ligation Since all tumors rely on blood supply for theirgrowth, ligation can be successful provided that themargins of the tumor are included in the consequentnecrosis. Provided that the entire tumor is isolatedfrom any blood supply, the success rate can be highbut it will clearly depend on the ability to includeevery part of the tumor. This can also be effectivelycombined with some forms of topical and intral-esional chemotherapy.5. Hyperthermia (Radiofrequency) Hoffman et al 13reported success rate in 3 cases subjected to repeated hyperthermia but there are few subsequent publications. The author has lim-ited experience with this method but there are re-ports of successful treatment of supercial verrucoseor occult sarcoids. Its effects are due to the in-creased sensitivity of neoplastic cells to tempera-tures of 42 \u00b0Ct o4 6\u00b0C, which can be lethal to neoplastic cells. The method is reasonably selec- tive in its effect and so it is a pity that it has not beenmore widely tested. 6. Chemotherapy (Direct and Chemical Cautery/ Antimitotic Effects) Topical and intralesional chemotherapy using anti-mitotic and cytotoxic chemicals have been used formany years in a variety of forms in the managementof sarcoid; often these methods are preferred onconvenience grounds alone and there are very manyreported substances ranging from herbal materialsand heavy metal salts to modern antimitotic and cy-totoxic chemicals various combinations. Topical or nitrate and topical AW5 (which isbased on a combination of heavy metal salts, naturaloils and 5-fluorouracil) have been used with some suc-cess 15,16(Fig. 13 ). Fig. 13. A, A chronic broblastic sarcoid treated successfully with topical AW5. It required 3 different courses of treatment. B, The lesion midway into the treatment period. C, Once the main lesion had sloughed, a further course was required to treat a focus of deeprecurrence. D, A further focal recurrence developed around 12 months later. This was treated in the same way. E, The lesionhealed well with no recurrence over 14 years. This treatment is easy, convenient, cheap, and convenient. 14 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY emulsion, and bleomycin solution. 17There are reports of the value of each of these on their own but no blinded comparative studies. Systemic antimitotic and cytotoxic drugs are used widely in other species but there seems to be littlebenet from their use in horses for management ofsarcoids and there are no reported studies using thesemethods. 7. Immunological Methods These methods rely upon the alteration of the im-munological relationship between the host and thetumor cells. Interestingly equine sarcoids sponta-neously disappear in some horses (possibly less than0.5% but in Sweden this proportion is reported to beover 15%. 7The mechanism for this is unknown but it certainly provides a direction for future research. Any method that can establish a normal rejectionmechanism will result in a dramatic and satisfac-tory resolution of the sarcoids from the whole bodysurface. Current oncologic research is focusing on altera- tion of the immune mechanisms to allow immuno-logic recognition of the abnormal cells or alterationof the tumor cells to make them more recognizable. Autogenous vaccines made from sarcoid cells is an entirely inappropriate approach. 6,16However, ef - forts at producing an effective vaccine are ongoing inseveral centers and there are preliminary reports ofsome successes. 18Attempts to produce a vaccine for the equine sarcoid similar to that used in human cervical cancer prevention have understandablyfailed since the tumor-virus relationship is very dif-ferent. A recent approach using liquid nitrogen fro-zen blocks of excised autologous tissue transplantedinto the subcutis of the neck has been reported to behighly effective. The author's experience of this isthat it is not an effective option and it is hard tovisualize that this is a logical approach. 8. Immunomodulatory Therapy Interestingly, around 75% of nodular and broblas-tic respond positively to (intra-tumoral) injection (BCG) are good! 4,19 The protocol for use appears to be important and repeated injections of a protein material are notwithout hazard. Bacillus calmete guerin therapy isfar less effective for occult and verrucose sarcoidsand any situated away from the periorbital region.Use of this method and on the distal limb is specif-ically contraindicated because of possible/probableexacerbation of the tumor. 9. Homeopathy These methods are consistently useless in themanagement of neoplastic disease; while they maydo no specic harm, it inevitably delays the applica-tion appropriate interventions. All sensible, in-formed scientic opinion and all trials conducted into the use of homeopathy have failed to show any-thing beyond a placebo effect. It is hard to see howa horse can demonstrate a placebo effect! Untilproper scientic proof of efcacy and a plausiblescientic explanation for the effects are produced itis probably dishonest to exploit the fear of cancer inowners simply to obtain nancial reward. 10. Radiation The use of ionizing radiation represents the goldstandard treatment for the equine sarcoid. Thetechniques have signicant advantages minimiz-ing scarring and distortion due to cicatrization in anarea where the function of the organs involved is ofvital importance. Radiation is used in two basic ways. a. Brachytherapy This technique is used primarily for the treatment ofsupercial sarcoids which are either situated in ar-eas which are not amenable to other modalities, orwhich have recurred after previous attempts to re-move them (by whatever means). Radiationsources are applied directly onto or into the mass.The most frequent methods for this include a num-ber of sources of beta and gamma radiation, whichare implanted into the tumor mass or are applieddirectly to the surface. In the former case (e.g.,iridium 192, gold198) gamma radiation is continuously emitted through the target tissue and the relative emissions and lengths of source can be adjusted.In the latter (e.g., strontium 90plaque) the radiation is applied in fractionated doses calculated to deliver the required \"lethal\" overall dose. Iridium192sources are expensive and require spe - cialized facilities for stabling and care over the pe-riod of treatment, which may be up to 10 days ormore. Strontium 90plaques are much easier/safer to handle but require fractionation and therefore repeated potential operator exposure. Radiation brachytherapy is largely restricted to ophthalmiconcology and it is most frequently applied by brachy-therapy in the treatment of squamous cell carci-noma, neurobroma, and nodular and broblasticsarcoid around the eye. The use of high-dose radiation brachytherapy is gaining increasing acceptance and availability (Fig.14). This has the singular advantage in havingzero operator exposure. High-emission sources areplaced into the target tissue via introducers and theradioactive sources are then inserted under com-puter control so that a very high dose is adminis-tered in a very short time. The disadvantages ofthe procedure are that the facilities required have tobe very specialized and the equipment is technicallydemanding and very expensive. In all, methods involving radiation scarring are minimal and the slower rate of resolution allowslocal tissues to adapt to changing cell types moreeasily. For this reason and because the procedure AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 15IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYcarries both cost and safety implications (no matter how it is applied), the technique is usually restrictedto small tumors in difcult sites such as the eyeand periorbital skin and over joints. There is theadded advantage that radiation can be used as a\"fail-safe\" technique\u2014previous less-expensive tech-niques, which have not succeeded, may still betreated by this method with good prospects of suc-cess. Radiation therapy carries a better overallprognosis than most other methods when tumor vol-ume is reduced with surgical debulking or chemo-therapy so that less radiation needs to be applied.As the clinical effects of radiation depend heavily onthe replication rate of the cells involved, tumorsgrowing fast are more responsive than old, longstanding tumors\u2014the effects of the treatment onsarcoid are not usually maximal until 12-14 monthsafter treatment has been completed. The effects of radiation often take up to 12 - 14 months to develop (Figs. 15 and 16) and some caseshave distressing periods of tissue sloughing duringthis time. b. Teletherapy (External-Beam Radiotherapy) There are few reports of the use of teletherapy forsarcoid or any other equine problems. 20This is performed far less frequently in equine medicine, mainly for logistic and capital cost reasons but facil-ities are being developed in the United States, theUnited Kingdom, France, and Germany and it isexpected that sarcoid will form a major part of the caseloads in these centers (Fig. 17). Novel Therapies for Equine Sarcoid These include the following: Electrochemotherapy: This process seeks to increase the intra-tumoral distribution of a che-motherapeutic drug such as cisplatin by deliver-ing electric current across the tumor. It has fewadvantages over slow-release chemotherapyand additionally requires repeated general anes-thesia. Nonetheless, some good results havebeen reported. Photodynamic therapy: Photodynamic therapy is currently being explored for some cutaneoustumors including sarcoid. Photo activatedchemicals such as aminolaevulinic acid andhyperacin, are introduced to the tumor (eithertopically or systemically via labelled antibody)and the lesion is then subjected to intense lightof an appropriate wavelength. This causesmassive mediator release and cell dam-age. There are few reports of the results ofthis but it is an attractive option. Autografting (with cryopreparation of the donor grafts): This is a recently revisited techniquethat was rst used in the 1940s (where it failedto bring convincing results) that involves the Fig. 14. High-dose radiation (HDR) is delivered under general anesthesia by a computer-driven instrument. The results are impressive as shown by the case here.

B, The outcome was exceptionally good but it took over 12 months to reach the state shown and there were some side effects on the cornea and lens. However, these were trivial to the horse and he was able to compete at the highest possible level. 16 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYsubcutaneous implantation of frozen cubes of tu- mor tissue derived from a sarcoid on thehorse. The results reported in one study areimpressive but involve very few cases. There isno apparent material difference in the new tech-nique so it is hard to understand what the im- proved outcome is due to! Some good reportsare made anecdotally. Mediator approaches: These are in their ear- liest stages of development and rely upon themechanisms to encourage an auto-rejection ofabnormal cells. So far interleukin (IL)-12 andIL-18 have been tested in limited numberswith encouraging results. The prospect of im-munological or cytokine-mediated recognitionof tumor cells is exciting but are both expen-sive and so far, unquantied. There may beunwanted effects from this approach also. Alterations of the keratinocyte function with ret- inoid topical medications. The realization thatthe keratinocyte-related changes in equine sar-coid introduced the concept of a two-phase treat-ment method. The rst involves the use of aretinoid cream to exfoliate the keratinocytes andrestore their normal function so that the fo-cus(es) of sarcoid could be identied and treatedby surgery, topical chemotherapy, cryosurgery,or radiation. Apart from the above, the time-honored range of treatment methods is available although many ofthese have been rened to the point where results Fig. 16. Radiation treatment can be successful as it has been in both these sarcoid cases\u2014it's whether it is worth the personal risks that is the major question. A, A very advanced case of broblastic sarcoid which had not responded to any previous surgery,cryosurgery, and chemotherapy. B, The outcome following LDR brachytherapy at 12 months was impressive. C, This case wasconsidered to be hopeless but LDR brachytherapy was used successfully with no further treatment being required for 6 years. D, Asecond nodular lesion developed at that time. This was removed surgically. Fig. 17. Radiotherapy may be delivered by a generator (linearaccelerator) in beams that are focused onto the tumor; this tele-therapy minimized the damage to adjacent tissue and enables afar higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor. (Pic-ture courtesy of Katie Snalune) AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 17IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYare considerably better. Judicious selection of the treatment should enable cure rates (for treatedlesions) of around 70% or more. Radiation methodsclearly provide the best outlook but they are veryexpensive in either teletherapy or interstitialbrachytherapy methods. There are also logisticproblems, and the facilities are becoming more dif-cult, not less so! Veterinarians who achieve highoutcome percentages should report their results sofurther progress can be made but it is clear thatwhat works for one veterinarian may not work foranother! We are all looking for a \"sure-re\" treat-ment for cancers but this is a long way off yet for theequine sarcoid. No case of sarcoid can be consid-ered to be free of the disease even following appar-ently successful treatment. Recurrences may takeup to 25 years to occur and the affected horse re-mains liable to further sarcoid development regard-less of the methods used to cure them (excepting ofcourse the self-curing cases which remain solidlyimmune). No matter how identical two lesions may appear to be, the response to treatment can be very differ-ent\u2014no two cases respond in an identical fashion toa single treatment method. There will be a nancial commitment at some point in the large majority of cases. There is a strong like-lihood that prolonged or repeated treatments will berequired. A number of new methods have been proposed including the use of the anti-herpes virus medica-tion, acyclovir. Although published results in onestudy have suggested a useful anti-neoplastic (orperhaps anti-BPV) effect. The current consensus isthat the bystander effect on the suicide gene fromthis drug is inadequate for mesenchymal-cell tu- mors. In the author's experience it is a very pooroption and should probably not be used. A recent publication by Knottenbelt et al 21re- ported the benet of a form of bleomycin. This material had amoderate efcacy when used on its own but whenused following either 5% 5-fluorouracil or the reti-noid tazarotene applied topically, the results wereimpressive. This was a pilot study only but thebleomycin had the singular advantage of overcom- ing the naturally occurring bleomycin hydrolaseenzyme and was completely pain and inflamma-tion free. The logistics of this method are, how-ever, demanding. Hemotherapy has a strong reputation in central America. This procedure involves the removal ofblood and its immediate intramuscular injection.It is hard to understand the rationality of this, letalone its reported efcacy. Homeopathic remedies are often used to treat sar- coids but remain universally useless (Fig. 18). It isunwise to conclude that none of these will ever treatcases because certain natural medicines includingaloe vera and tea tree oil have, been found to help afew cases. Blood root compounds with zinc chloride(Indian Mud) has been used widely and is reportedanecdotally to have efcacy in a limited number andtypes of sarcoid. Large numbers of salves and ointments supplements purporting to be \"immune stimu-lants\" with 100% efcacy are reported in the laymedia. Any material that will treat almost anydisease in almost any animal under any circum-stances must be viewed with some skepticism. Fig. 18. Examples of mismanaged sarcoids that have become irretrievable. Homeopathy and other baseless treatments do not work. 18 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYIt is also important to know that in some cases, application of remedies of various natural andhomeopathic types have resulted in considerableexacerbation of the tumors. This is probablymore a property of the fact that the tumors havebeen interfered with rather than any directlyharmful effect of the so-called remedy. Prognosis The prognosis is always very guarded and ownersshould be made aware of the possible serious com-plications, which can arise both from the diseaseitself and from the treatment. A diagnosis ofequine sarcoid has a very serious effect on the valueof the horse and the likely enjoyment that the ownerwill get out of it. Summary Whatever is said about the equine sarcoid in folk-lore and in the largely ill-informed lay press, itshould undoubtedly be regarded as a form of skincancer. It should therefore be treated with the re-spect deserving of any neoplastic state; early veter-inary consultation will help to ensure that thecondition is held in check and not allowed to runrampant through the skin of a horse. Whenever ahorse is found to have a sarcoid lesion, it needs to beput into the proper perspective. The condition isunpredictable and before a buyer purchases a horsethey should be sure of the insurance implicationsand the likelihood that treatment will be required.A single small lesion may remain identical until thehorse dies of old age but it could erupt at any time orit may herald the development of more lesions astime passes; the difculty is deciding which is which.There is no clinical indicator which helps to predictwhich lesions will take on an aggressive form andwhich will not. It is clear that the fewer lesionsthat are present at any one time, the fewer it will getand this may link to the feeding habits of flies duringsummer months. Horses should be as sarcoid freeas they can be over the summer months when fliesare a problem. The condition is more related tosurface feeding flies than to blood feeding flies sincethe latter do not ever visit open ulcerated sites. The prospects for successful treatment are far bet- ter if the lesions are small, early, and the horse isunder 4-5 years of age. None of the treatmentmethods are cheap and none of them are certain ofsuccess. Sarcoids around the face and on the legsare particularly dangerous in almost every aspect ofthe disease and owners should not be unduly sur-prised when any selected treatment fails to help, infact the treatment could make matters worse. Fur-thermore, there is no current method for treatingmicroscopic lesions\u2014treatment is only possible forlesions that are visible. It is hoped that eventuallythere will be a way to make the immune processesof the patient recognize the presence of abnormalcells and reject them\u2014this way every single cellcould be detected and destroyed; there would be nomore sarcoids. This is some way off yet\u2014if it were as simple as this there would be an answerto every cancer and disease in every species ofanimal. There is a desperate need for more effec-tive treatments and some form of prophylaxis ifthis disease is going to be eliminated from thehorse population to avoid the welfare and costimplications. The correct choice of treatment method is critical. The best possible method should be used for eachindividual lesion taking into account the type, ana-tomical location, duration, and previous treatmenthistory, and owners' resources. Each factor will in-fluence the decision but no method is universallyeffective. Resorting to homeopathic irrationality orother inappropriate interference is not what cancerdeserves. Unless and until there is a wider appre-ciation of what the disease is and how it can developinto an irretrievable situation, horses will continueto be destroyed. There is no doubt that many sarcoid lesions can be treated by one means or another. As always, thesuccesses are not the problem\u2014it's the failures.Failure of any treatment has to be viewed as apotential disaster since the prognosis for subsequenttreatments falls dramatically (by around 40%).Any claims for 100% effective treatment should beviewed with considerable skepticism: either thecases are so carefully selected or the results areinterpreted constructively. There is nothing more expensive than a cheap treat- ment that does not work except of course an expensivetreatment that does not work. A lack of researcheffort in equine oncology is possibly the most signi-cant single factor that constrains oncologic advances.In spite of the ease of access and diagnosis, cutaneousoncology still receives little research effort or clinicalinterest.

Introduction: Allergies and Urticaria The allergic skin diseases in the horse that are non- arthropod-bite related are atopic dermatitis (atopy),food allergy, and contact allergy. The history of thedermatitis is very important in determining whichof these three is most likely in any particular horse.A seasonal pruritus, especially affecting the face andtrunk, would be most consistent with atopic derma-titis to pruritus would atopic dermatitis as a reaction tomolds or barn dust, or a food allergy. Episodes ofpruritus that occur after topical treatments of sham-poos, dips, etc. would be consistent with a contactallergy. The au thor nds true food allergy in horses to be very rare; this may be a reflection of practicing in a primarily referral practice,whereas cases of food allergy (real or presumed)are often diagnosed by the owner and/or the localveterinarian. 2. Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis is probably more common thanreported. The pathogenesis in horses may be sim-ilar to that of dogs and humans\u2014mediated (at leastinitially) by IgE antibodies. It may be seasonal orin California, often year round. Urticaria, urticariawith pruritus, or pruritus alone are the three com-mon presentations, in that order. Pruritus mostcommonly affects the face and trunk. Seasonalsigns would be most consistent with allergy to pollens; year-round signs would be more consis-tent with an allergy to molds or barn dust. Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is based on clinical signs and the exclusion of other diagnoses (espe-cially Culicoides allergy). Horses may have a sec- ondary bacterial infection (pyoderma), typied byexcess scale, particularly in the shape of a circle(epidermal collarettes). Intradermal tests or se-rum allergy tests may be performed to identify al-lergens that may be used for hyposensitization(allergy shots). Horses with atopic dermatitis andrecurrent hives generally have a higher incidence ofpositive reactions than healthy horses, but the diag-nosis (as in other species) cannot solely be made onthe basis of the intradermal tests or serologic testingalone. 1-3The testing should be interpreted in light of the history of the disease and used to determinewhich allergens might be useful to use in hyposen-sitization, should the owners elect that route oftreatment. Medical therapy may include corticosteroids; prednisolone then taper) arethe most commonly used. Prednisolone seems to be better absorbed orally in horses than prednisone. 4 The injectable dexamethasone solution may be bioavailability is 60% to 70% ofthe /H114082019 21IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY carry various adverse effects, such as laminitis particularly in the overconditioned horse, and therisk-benet of using these drugs, particularly over along period of time, must be considered relative tothe general health of the horse. Antihistaminesare excit-ability in horses, although the author has seen thisin less than 5% of horses receiving these drugs.The commonly used antihistamine pyrilamine mal-eate (Tri-Hist Granules) has been shown to havepoor bioavailability when given orally in the horse,but detectable in the urine up to 1 week after asingle dose, which may present difculties withwithdrawal times. 5 Some clinicians have noted improvement when an essential fatty acid product is added to the feed;Platinum Performance ais one brand name that has been used successfully in some atopic horses as an adjunctive treatment. Urticaria, secondaryto atopic insome 6 Atopic dermatitis has been successfully managed with hyposensitization, with horses showing im-provement as early as 2 months into treatment. 6,7 However, a full 12 months of hyposensitizationshould be given before fully evaluating its effective-ness, and veterinarians should maintain consistentcommunication with the client to monitor the prog-ress of the treatment and to encourage the owner tocontinue with the injections for the full year. Whilein other domestic species it is thought that mostpatients will need to be maintained on the injectionsfor life, in the horse, this may not be true, as somehorses had the hyposensitization injections stoppedand did not relapse. 7In approximately 70-80% of atopic horses improve with hyposensiti- zation.8Other researchers have reported even bet - ter results, albeit in a noncontrolled report.9A preliminary study noted ultrastructural abnormali- ties in the stratum corneum of two atopic horses,similar to those of other species. This may indicatethat certain topical products may be helpful as ad-junctive treatments. 10 3. Food Allergies Substantiated food allergies that both resolve on ahypoallergenic diet and recur upon rechallenge arevery uncommon in the horse (or other herbivores). They are best diagnosed by limiting the diet to onefoodstuff for at least 4 weeks. Most authors preferoat hay or beet pulp. Products with barley shouldbe avoided due to a high predilection to inducefounder. If the lesions and pruritus resolve duringthis trial, after documenting recurrence upon re-challenge, various foodstuffs may be added weekly,one at a time, to determine the offending allergen.A recent study showed unreliable results using animmunoglobulin E-based test for food allergy in healthy ponies. 11 4. Contact Allergies These may be deduced via history, and if a liquidis involved, having lesions with gravity-induced\"drip signs.\" A complete history is very impor- tant, as owners may not always remember (or careto admit) home remedies they have applied to theskin. Treatment is discontinuing the offendingcontactant. In addition, corticosteroids, or pen-toxifylline (10 mg/kg, 2-3 /H11003/24 h) may be helpful. Remember that bedding, especially with woodchips, can be a contact allergen. 12 5. Urticaria Among all the species of domestic animals the horsehas the greatest prevalence of urticaria. It should bestressed that urticaria is not a specic diseaseentity. Rather, it is a skin lesion or reaction pat-tern that may have differing etiologies andpathogenesis. The characteristic lesion is a wheal: a flat-topped papule/nodule with steep walled sides. It is the resultof localized transient edema of the dermis. Manywheals have a slightly depressed center giving theman annular conguration. The onset of the lesions isacute to peracute with the wheals developing within afew minutes to a few hours. The size of the individualwheals can vary considerably. Allergic urticaria is thought to usually fall into one of the following categories: a. Atopic dermatitis b. Drug eruptions (often bizarre, gyrate forms)c. Arthropod bites or stingsd. Contact allergye. Food allergies (rare) Miscellaneous diseases that can cause urticaria: a. Dermatophytes (early lesions) purpura hemorrhagica) Physical urticarias are rare in the horse. The three most important categories include the following: a. Dermatographism: essentially a \"pressure\" urticaria b. Cold urticariac. Exercise-induced urticaria The diagnosis of urticaria is usually based on the acute onset of characteristic multiple lesions. If in doubtabout the character of the lesions, the most importantcriterion is that they pit on pressure. Of great impor-tance is trying to determine the cause of the urticaria via the medical history. Is this the rst episode?If not, how many episodes have occurred in the past 22 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYand are they seasonal? A complete drug history is mandatory, especially regarding medications thathave been given in the previous 2 weeks. In additionto drugs, an attempt should be made to associate theonset of urticaria to other events (especially in recur-rent/chronic cases) such as exercise, cold weather, etc.A recent article found an association between urti-caria, insect bite hypersensitivity, and recurrent air-way obstruction. 12 The possibility of dermatographism is easily checked by \"writing\" on the animal with a bluntinstrument (such as the tip of a hemostat) putting afair degree of pressure on the skin. A positive re-action would be the development of a line of urti-caria developing along the pressure line within 15minutes. Cold urticaria can be evaluated by plac-ing an ice cube on the skin for several minutes andchecking for the development of urticaria againwithin 15 minutes. Treatment of urticaria in the horse is thus based both on determining the underlying cause, andusing the same medications as noted for atopicdermatitis.

Histopathology of lesions fre- quently is reflective of a hypersensitivity response. 2 While there are a number of species of Culicoides , the two most commonly suspected of causing theallergic response are C. variipennis and C. nubeculosis . A number of studies have attempted to dene the nature of the hypersensitivity response. Onestudy 3found serum antibodies to Culicoides sali- vary glands in both healthy horses exposed to Culi- coides bites and in horses with insect \"dermal\" hypersensitivity. In contrast, no antibodies were detected in serum from native Icelandic horses which had not been Culicoides . Anti- salivary gland immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in both groups of horses, while immu- noglobulin E (IgE) antibodies were only detected inclinically affected horses. Another study found sig- AAEP /H114082019 cells in the dermis and epidermis of acute and chronic lesions than in skin biopsies from healthy horses.4Recently, another study conrmed the presence of certain subclasses of IgE and IgG antibodies to various salivary proteinextracts of C. nubeculosis in European horses. 5 Further evidence for a hypersensitivity response was demonstrated in a study in which intradermalinjection of a Culicoides antigen extract induced T lymphocyte and eosinophil accumulation in the skinof affected horses. 6Other studies have supported the immunologic nature of this disease.7-13 The hallmark of this disease is pruritus . While no sex predisposition has been noted, Icelandichorses may have a higher incidence of allergic reac-tions to the Culicoides insects than other breeds. The disease is quite uncommon in horses under oneyear of age, with an onset usually between 2 and 4years of age. Culicoides hypersensitivity may be seasonal at least during the rst few years in tem-perate climates. Diagnosis is primarily by clinicalsigns; commercially available Culicoides antigens are available in the United States a; their efcacy in both diagnosis and treatment is still being evalu- ated.14However, a recent study in Europe showed that intradermal testing and histamine release tests were more accurate than serologic testing for anti-bodies to salivary proteins of C. nubeculosus and C. sonorensis . 15 A recent study found an association between in- sect bite hypersensitivity and airway hyperactiv-ity, 16although this susceptibility of insect bite hypersensitivity-affected horses to develop equine asthma is likely not associated with IgE-mediatedimmune reactions but with other immunopatholog-ical mechanisms. 17 Therapy is aimed at insect control, especially: 1. Stabling horses at sunrise and sunset\u2014peak feeding hours. 2. Ultra-ne setting or screens placed in win- dows (60 squares to the square inch). 3. Fly control, especially keeping horses away from standing water and the use of perme-thrin repellant products on the animal. sprays, but44-65% permethrin spot-on formulations,marketed for dogs (and thus used off-label)have been used successfully as well. Spraysmust frequently be applied more often thanthe label recommends (i.e., daily, at least atrst). 4. Overhead or stall fans (drafts interfere with the insects' flight). 5. \"Dresses\" that physically obstruct the insects from reaching the skin. 6. Hyposensitization is controversial; success may vary with the presence of an adjuvant, orthe actual antigen used. 18,19One article was unable to nd benet after a year of hyposen-sitization for insect bite hypersensitivity in nonstabled horses.20 7. Prednisolone orally to manage the pruritus In a recent article, small netting (\"hole\" size of 0.1825 mm2) and possibly the use of fans were shown to be effective in reducing the number of Culicoides collected in various housing of horses.21 Also recently, experimental studies reported suc- cessful immunization of horses with insect bite hy-persensitivity against their own interleukin 5,resulting in a decrease in pruritus of 17 of 19 horsestreated. 22,23 Other flies such as stable (Stomoxys calcitrans ), horn (Haematobia sp.), horse (Tabanus sp.), deer (Chrysops sp.), and black flies (Simulium sp.) often cause a pruritic dermatitis in horses. Stomoxys calcitrans has been reported to cause an exudative dermatitis on the legs of adult horses.24Fly con - trol and good sanitation (stable flies lay eggs inrotting vegetation, and horn flies lay eggs in feces)are important control measures. Stable flies like sunlight, whereas horn flies prefer shade. Hornflies may produce a focal pattern of ventral mid- line dermatitis. Simulium spp. (black flies) occur in practically all parts of the world especially in regions with warmclimates. The flies are dark colored, vary in lengthfrom 1 to 5 mm, and have a rather characteristicappearance with the thorax humped over the head.They are thus often referred to as buffalo gnats.The flies are most active in the morning and lateafternoon causing considerable annoyance and irri-tation. The females suck blood and produce smallskin wounds that are quickly covered with dropletsof dried blood. The usual sites include the udder,scrotum, prepuce, inner surface of the thigh andupper forelimbs, throat, ears, ventral abdomen,chest, and natural body orices. It is likely thatvarious species of black fly have a favored site onwhich to feed. Black flies may produce a general- of ventral midline may be a prominent signwhen larger numbers of flies attack an animal.There may be considerable pruritus leading to exco-riation. It seems likely that a hypersensitivity re-action plays a role in the pathogenesis of the skinlesions. 25Generalized signs only occur when large numbers of flies attack an animal and are evident either immediately or within a few hours of theattack. Affected animals are weak and listless witha rapid pulse and respiration rate. The body tem-perature is normal or subnormal; elevation appear-ing only in cases that are advanced or terminal.Pregnant animals may abort. In severe casesdeath may occur within a few hours to several days. Horse and deer fly bites are usually swellings with a center of blood or hemorrhagic crust, whereas theswellings caused by mosquito bites lack the center ofblood or crust. 24 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYTreatment of the skin lesions is entirely symptom- atic. The affected areas should be gently cleansedto remove the crusts. If the skin lesions are con-ned to a small area, a topical corticosteroid prepa-ration may be applied twice daily. If large areas ofskin are involved or the pruritus is intense, a shortcourse of oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day /H110031 week, then 1 mg/kg q48h /H110032 weeks) is indicated. A ma- jor objective should be the prevention of further flybites. As simulids are primarily daytime biters, horses should be stabled during the day preferablyin screened stalls. Insect repellents should be ap-plied especially to sites of predilection. The use of parasitic wasps bhas been recom - mended as a way to control stable, horn, house, andother flies. It is important to remember the relationship of these various insects to the environments they fa-vor/require for breeding and when they feed: Horse flies, deer fliesVegetation and water Daytime feeders Horn flies Cattle Daytime feeders Stable flies Rotting vegetation Daytime feedersBlack flies Running water Morning and eveningCulicoides Standing water, manure/vegetationTwilight to dawn Mosquitoes Water Dusk to 2 hours past sunset Chorioptes mites are most frequently found on the lower limbs (pasterns, fetlocks) of draft-typebreeds. This predisposition seems to be inherent inthese breeds, not merely because of the long \"feath-ers\" present on the legs. Pruritus is the hallmarkof this disease, with secondary crusts and alopecia.The mites live on the skin, and are notalways as easy to nd with skin scrapings as the literaturewould suggest. Numerous scrapings may need tobe performed, and the clinician should not hesitate to treat the horse on a presumptive basis if theclinical signs are suspicious. Treatment is usuallyivermectin 0.2 mg/kg q14d for 6 weeks, topical limesulfur c1 cup to 1 gallon of water q48h for 6 weeks, or topical pronildspray.26-28A 500-mL bottle of pro - nil is sufcient to treat the legs of one horse; theclinician must spray to dampen haircoat and skinfrom elbow and stifles down, and treat affected casestwice at a 3-4 week interval (this can be expensive).Regardless of the treatment used, there is a highrisk of asymptomatic carriers thus all in-contacthorses should be treated at least once. The envi-ronment should be thoroughly cleaned as well, asthe mites have been reported to survive off thehorse. A recent study showed efcacy using a sin-gle dose of moxidectin 2% oral gel eat the manufac - turer's recommended therapeutic dose of 0.4 mg/kgbody Lice pruritus.30Typically this is a winter prob - lem caused by the close conning of a number ofhorses in less than ideal sanitary conditions. Asthe lice numbers increase, the pruritus increases aswell. Diagnosis is usually by nding the lice or thelice eggs (nits) on the horse. Sucking lice tend to bestationary, whereas biting lice tend to be mobile.D. equi has been reported as preferring the dorso- lateral trunk, whereas H. asini favors the mane, fetlocks, and tail. Topical lime sulfur, permethrinor pronil, or oral ivermectin should be effective;some clinicians feel that ivermectin is not as suc-cessful in the treatment of the biting lice. All in-contact horses should be treated. Trombiculidiasis (\"chiggers\") is an occasionally encountered parasitic skin disease of animals and hu-mans. There is a denite geographic distribution ofthe parasite. The etiologic agents are the larvalforms of Eutrombicula alfreddugesi (North America) orNeotrombicula autumnalis (Europe). The adult stage is a parasite of vegetation. The six-legged lar-val form requires a blood meal to complete the lifecycle. The larvae attach to the horse's skin, take ablood meal, and then fall off after 48-72 hours. Thedisease occurs in the late summer, fall and early win- ter, and is primarily associated with \"undeveloped\"pastures and elds of natural vegetation. The lesions occur on the face, sides of the neck and thorax, and the extremities. The lesions, 1-2 mmcrusts, can be palpated better than they can be seen.If these crusts are removed there is frequently asmall amount of underlying suppuration. The dis-ease in the horse is variably pruritic, with self-rubbing, stamping, and, rarely, head shaking re-ported. 31With diligent searching, the larvae which are bright orange or red in color and measure approx- imately 0.2 mm in diameter can usually be seen withthe naked eye in the center of some of the lesions.Frequently most of the larvae have dropped off by thetime the animal is presented for examination. Find-ing the minute brightly colored larvae is diagnostic.Treatments are similar to those for lice (with some ofthe same controversy of efcacy attached to the use ofivermectin). Oxyuriasis refers to the infection of horses with the nematode parasite Oxyuris equi (\"pinworms\"). The primary pathological effects of this nematodeare cutaneous rather than internal. The infectionis rather common and world-wise in distribution. The adults are free-living in the cecum and colon, apparently feeding only on fecal material. Followingfertilization, the females migrate to the rectum andthen through the anal sphincter to deposit ova in theperineal area. The eggs are \"cemented\" together inyellowish-white gelatinous masses. ova developrapidly and contain infective larvae within 3-5 days.Infection of horses occurs when ova containing infec-tive larvae are ingested. Further development takesplace in the large intestine and the parasites reachsexual maturity after 5 months. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 25IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYThe adult parasites are not usually a problem. However, the gelatinous material holding the clus-ters of eggs together is highly irritating and resultsin intense pruritus in the anal region. Affectedanimals are constantly rubbing at the base of theirtail in an effort to relieve the anal pruritus. Thehairs become broken leading to alopecia tail\" appearance). In severe caseserosions and ulcerations of the tail head develop.Oxyuriasis should be a consideration in the differ-ential diagnosis of a \"tail rubber.\" Horses withoxyuriasis rub only at the tail region; thus this di- agnosis should not be considered in horses rubbingatboth the tail and mane regions (which is more likely Culicoides hypersensitivity). A clear acetate (\"scotch\") tape impression smear of the perineal re-gion is used to demonstrate the ova; the sticky sideis placed down on a glass slide that has been coatedwith mineral oil. The ova are elongate, slightlyflattened on one side, provided with a plug at onepole and measure about 42 /H1100390 /H9262m. Pyrantel pamoate moxidectin have alsobeen used. 32,33 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

This is indeed far from thecase as they occur with some frequency in the internalorgans and they can become highly malignant in somecases. There is no evidence to suggest that the con-dition is in any way related to exposure to sunshine (asin humans). The Arabian breed is said to be moresusceptible than others but this may not be totallytrue. The equine melanoma has been classied and pathologically categorized by Valentine. 2This study of 57 cutaneous melanocytic tumors derived from 53horses 4 for melanocytic skin lesions: 1. Melanocytic nevus was diagnosed in 29 horses with an average age of 5 years; these weresolitary, supercial masses occurring in bothgrey and non-grey Surgical excisionwas generally curative. 2. Dermal melanoma was identied in 20 grey horses with an average age of 13 years. Eighthorses with an average age of 7 years had only1 or 2 discrete dermal melanomas. Metasta-ses occurred in 2 horses, and surgical excisionwas apparently curative in 4 cases.3. Dermal melanomatosis was diagnosed in 12 grey horses with an average age of 17 years; 6of these horses were fully evaluated and all hadinternal metastases. 4. Anaplastic malignant melanoma occurred in 2 aged non-grey horses; the tumors metastasizedwithin 1 year of diagnosis. The two extreme ends of the scale of the condition, melanocytic nevus and anaplastic melanoma, histologically sim-ilar but could be differentiated on the basis of theirclinical features. In practical terms then these twocould possibly be combined so that the condition canbe simplied into a totally benign nevus, a poten-tially dangerous benign tumor that progresses tomalignancy and a highly dangerous malignant tu-mor. Two tumors in this study with features ofboth is progressive and that ma-lignancy with metastasis is a likely outcome in asignicant number of horses. It appears to conrmthat the equine melanoma is a potentially very dan-gerous tumor type that starts out benign and easy totreat surgically and ends up in a difcult or impos-sible malignant state. Phillips and Lembcke /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: NOTESrmed that while almost every early melanoma had a benign pathological behavior, up to 66% will de-velop malignancy in time. The common forms of melanoma are encountered in the skin of the perineum; over 60% of melanomasoccur in the skin and over 50% of these are situatedin and around the perineum. 4Here they are an almost invariably found in grey horses over 10-12 years of age. Indeed, there are almost no greyhorses over this age that will not have at least somemelanomas and the majority have perineal lesions. The tumors are easily recognized. Usually they start as small, solid, spherical lumps in and underthe skin (Fig. 1). They may form chains and merg-ing masses of tumors and can vary dramatically insize. Similarly, individual tumors may grow at analarming rate while those adjacent may remainstatic. They seldom, if ever, regress spontaneously.The faster-growing lesions and those that are sub-jected to trauma of any type (including biopsy) mayulcerate and expose a black, tarry, soft, rather amor-phous tissue. The surface may bleed and exude ablack tarry jelly-like material and a few bleedheavily. Rarer forms of melanoma occur in the eyelids, iris, retina, mouth, parotid salivary glands and lymphnodes, penile skin, and internal organs, includingthe intestine, heart, and lungs (Figs. 1 and 2).Postmortem studies of equine melanoma conrm, however, that almost every organ can be affected butthat there is seldom any major clinical consequence.Melanoma occurring in non-grey horses tend to bemore dangerous than the more common form in greyhorses. Usually the former is single and isolatedwhile in grey horses they are usually present in large numbers (although single lesions can be en-countered) and may occur in clusters. The condi-tion in non-grey horses can be highly malignant(Fig. 2). The pathological description of the common form in grey horses is the subject of considerable contro-versy. Some pathologists consider that the com-mon benign form is best viewed as a melanosis (ormelanotic hamartoma) rather than a tumor. It issometimes thought of as a storage disease becauseas grey horses get older the hair becomes whiter andwhiter\u2014but melanomas become more common inolder horses. This implies that at least in somecases the melanin may not be incorporated into thehair shafts and so accumulations of melanin may bereasonably expected to occur. However, the dif-culty with this theory is that melanomas are farmore common where there is no hair at all and so itmay simply be that the melanocyte cells are natu-rally dividing in an abnormal fashion but that the Fig. 1. The common sites for primary melanoma development include the perianal region/perineum (A), the sheath of male horse (B and C), and the eyelid (D). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 29IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYcells themselves are normal (this is the denition of a hamartomaa). From a histopathological perspective melanoma in horses is a major problem as conrmed by Val-entine. 2There are few distinctive clinical or pathological features that suggest malignancy in an individual lesion. Additionally, malignancy isseemingly more often a part of a larger more ob-vious benign mass. This makes it hard to ndpathological evidence of malignancy in many tu-mors. Highly dangerous clones of cells can occurin very small tumors or as part of smaller tumorsor as part of larger tumor masses. The main clinical effects from the tumors are due to their space occupying nature but in sometissues locations they can have a serious func-tional consequence. Thus, a melanoma withinthe spinal cord could be extremely benign in itspathological character but the clinical conse-quences may be disastrous. Similarly, a m ela- noma in the subnodal interventricular septum of theheart may cardiac dysrhythmia\u2014evenresulting a complete third-degree heart block ordeath. Melanomas can result in an unacceptabledistortion of the local anatomy in various organswith perhaps the most common of these sites beingthe parotid region. In these cases, there may beenormous expansion of the tumor masses but de-spite this they seldom cause any signicant func-tional problems; respiratory obstructions andsecondary neurologic and functional effects do some- times occur but are rare. A melanoma in a leaflet ofthe mitral valve can cause a 5/5 heart murmur andconsequent circulatory compromise. Tumors thatdevelop in the spinal cord may be devastating whilemassive perineal melanomas can result in defeca-tion and urination problems or in mares they maycreate reproductive difculties both with matingand with parturition. Parotid Melanoma Parotid involvement (Fig. 2A) is a relatively common form of melanoma and in some cases the expansioncan be massive. However, there is seldom any ma-jor clinical consequence. Morbid examination ofthe masses will usually reveal that the tumor hasspread from the parotid lymph node to the parotidsalivary gland by direct extension but others may bedisseminated tumors derived from a malignant site.Parotid melanomas are seldom ulcerated unlessthey are interfered with by surgical biopsy. Melanosis and melanoma (as well as malignant melanoma) occur within the guttural pouch. Mostgrey horses will have at least some melanosis visibleon the mucosa of the guttural pouch (Figs. 2 and 3).Most often this will be found on the mucosa of thelateral compartment overlying the maxillary arteryor sometimes the other major arteries and veins Fig. 2. A, Parotid gland or lymph node involvement. B, The lips and the skin sites in general also develop signicant melanoma lesions. C, Melanomas also occur in non-grey horses from time to time. D, Cremello horses are very liable to an aggressive form ofthe disease. 30 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND the pouch. Interestingly, repeated endos- copy will often conrm that these do not remainstatic but may expand slowly or may regress signif-icantly over time; most develop more lesions herewith time. The clinical appearances of these earlylesions are like \"splashes of black paint.\" Theremay be larger or smaller areas involved. In anycase, they have a benign appearance and a singu-larly benign nature for the most part. The moreserious aggressive and sometimes malignant formsare much more obvious as spherical or unevenlyspherical shaped coalescent tumors. They usuallyhave a shiny surface and again are most often foundon the walls of blood vessels. Despite their size andapparent aggression, they seldom ulcerate but whenthey do they may bleed considerably leading to amisleading diagnosis of guttural pouch mycosis. The author commonly uses these lesions as an index of the rate of progression of the conditionbecause they are relatively protected and unlikely tobe signicantly affected by any other factors such asexternal or self trauma. Prior to any surgical in-tervention it is wise to examine guttural pouches sothat the presence of internal melanoma lesions canbe established prior to the surgery. Primary melanoma can also develop within the eye itself (Figs. 4 and 5). Tumors developing in theeye can be serious in that the expanding tumor(usually within the ciliary body or the iris) has ef-fects on vision and ultimately cause contact cornealedema and non-ulcerative keratopathy. The most common forms encountered in the horse are ciliary or iridal melanomas. They areoften located in the nasal quadrants at base ofthe iris; they often have a blue-black appearancerather than pure black (this may distinguish themfrom iris cysts and [cystic] granulae iridicae which characteristically have a very black or dark brownappearance) and a fluid lled center identied onultrasonography. The clinical effects are related to their space occu- pying nature rather than any malignancy. Indeed,primary iridal melanomas do not have an increasedtendency to malignancy as far as the author's expe-rience will allow such a statement! Retinal lesionsare very rare but there is no information of the effects these small aggregations might have on vi-sual acuity. 3. Malignant Melanoma The malignant forms are usually highly aggres-sive with rapid widespread dissemination of mili-ary tumors in all major organs and body cavities.Malignant abdominal melanoma (Fig. 6) has, inthe author's experience, resulted strangulatingand non-strangulating surgical colic. Massive peri-toneal and pleural effusions (often tainted withblood and containing obvious melanocytic cells) maybe encountered. Usually the abdominal dissemina-tion results in involvement of the major organs in-cluding the spleen, kidney, and liver in particular.Each of these may cause individual clinical signs.For example, renal involvement may cause hematu-ria (usually melanocytic cells are obviously presentin the cellular deposit from a urine sample). In-volvement of the spleen may cause peritoneal bleed-ing (but again the abnormal melanin producing cellswill be present). Within the chest cavity, malig-nant melanoma can have both space occupying andfunctionally limiting effects. In the author's expe-rience, massive accumulations can cause bilateralHorner's Syndrome if the tumors constrict or alterthe function of the cranial sympathetic trunk at thethoracic inlet. Recognition of the rare malignant form of mela- noma is important because of the implications ofinterference or attempts to surgically remove indi-vidual tumors. Ulcerated malignant tumors cansometimes be differentiated from their benign coun-terparts by the presence of yellow, pink, or greyareas of tissue. These probably represent areas ofamelanotic melanoma and these are, in the author'sexperience, always malignant. Otherwise, diagno-sis of malignancy relies on the help of a skilledpathologist. The reality is that little is knownabout the disease and so much of the advice that isgiven is based simply on anecdote and experience. Fig. 3. Melanoma masses in the left (A) and right (B) guttural pouches of a 12-year-old grey mare. There was signicant swell-ing of the parotid region. CT and ultrasound examination con-rmed that these melanomas both involved the parotid salivaryglands, as well as the pharyngeal and parotid lymph nodes. Fig. 4. Intraocular melanoma can be alarming but the clinical effects are variable. A, The lesion shown in the cremello horseremained static for many years and the horse showed no evidence ofany ocular compromise. Notice that it also developed two smalleyelid lesions (arrows). B, In contrast the grey showed persistentocular pain and corneal endothelial compromise as a result of impactbetween the tumor and the corneal endothelium. This horse ulti-mately developed a massive intraocular melanoma which suddenlybled heavily and required 65 /H114082019 31IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGY4. The differential diagnoses of melanoma include other cutaneous nodular diseases and other internalneoplasia. The clinical appearance is so distinctivethat in most cases conrmation by a ne-needleaspirate or biopsy is not necessary. Nevertheless,some melanomas can be mistaken for a sarcoid andvice versa. Sarcoids complicated by melanoma doalso occur from time to time. 5. Diagnosis Diagnosis of melanoma is relatively straightforwardwhen they are found in the skin in typical sites.It is not usually necessary to biopsy the lesions buta ne-needle aspirate will probably not have anydetrimental/exacerbating effects or increase therisk of dissemination. During this procedure, it isimportant that the ne needle is placed centrallyinto the tumor and that it is not moved aroundwithin the tumor more than necessary. It is notusually necessary to aspirate the tumor\u2014simply col-lecting the cells that accumulate in the needle isusually enough to establish the diagnosis although of course the structure of the tumor and its patho-logical behavior cannot be established in this way.The cells can be stained specically but direct exam-ination will usually identify the dark brown-blackmelanin-containing cells. Specic examination ofthe cells themselves is best left to an experiencedpathologist because identication of malignancyfrom these specimens is very difcult. It is equallyeasy to conrm the diagnosis from a biopsy of aportion of the tumor or an excisional biopsy of awhole lesion. Simply cutting the section or directobservation of the biopsy specimen will conrm thatthe tumor is a melanoma. Again, the classicationis a matter for a pathologist. Malignant forms maybe recognized clinically if the tumor is visible andulcerated but otherwise a pathologist is an impor-tant aid. Size of a mass is not correlated tomalignancy. 6. Management Melanoma is best regarded as untreatable but prog-ress is being made in the understanding of thedisease 2and new treatments and management pro - cesses are being developed by Phillips and Lemcke.3 Many cases are manageable by a variety of methodsbut until there is a much better understanding ofthe mechanisms that are involved in the develop-ment of the disorder, it is unlikely to cure them orprevent their occurrence. On the basis that all in-ternal melanoma must by denition derive from anexternal source and that over 80% of melanoma lesions will ultimately develop some degree of ma-lignancy, treatment options should always be con-sidered at the earliest opportunity. Removal ofsmall benign tumors is a safe and practical proposi-tion but of course since more tumors will develop intime, the process is likely to involve regular surgicalor other procedures\u2014possibly extending throughthe life of the horse. It is probably feasible to \"cre- Fig. 5. High-frequency ultrasonogram of an iridal melanoma that caused contact corneal edema on the inferior hemisphere of the cornea (wide arrow). The eye was non-painful for some months but a partial iridectomy was performed when the eye becameuncomfortable.

Benign Neglect By convention, most cases are managed by benignneglect\u2014they may not alter signicantly for manyyears but should be checked at regular intervals.Checking such cases should involve careful assess-ment of the parotid salivary gland and parotid andretropharyngeal lymph (often best checked byendoscopic examination of the guttural pouches).It is also useful to monitor the size by accuratemeasurement of one or more positively identiablelesion. Nonetheless, a few static tumors or a fewexpanding ones should not really be taken to indi-cate the behavior of all the others. It may takemany years before the condition is either cosmeti-cally/socially unacceptable or becomes functionallyimportant. Nevertheless, the balance of probability is that the tumors will get bigger, more difcult, and becomemore dangerous if they are left alone. A properdefensible answer is needed to give to owners who,following advice to leave them alone, later presenttheir horse in an untreatable state. This is the onlytumor in any species where we say \"leave themalone\" in spite of the fact that they start out small,benign, accessible, and easy and end up big, difcult,and malignant. Melanoma is progressive both in terms of size and number and pathological behavior (Fig. 7). Surgical Excision This is a realistic proposition provided that the tu-mor can be removed without signicant skin dam-age or consequent scarring. In some sites, such asthe eyelid or mouth, scrupulous reconstructivesurgery can mitigate complications arising from functional decits. Individual ulcerated or pedun-culated tumors are a good surgical proposition.Extensive penile and perineal melanomas have beenfrequently successfully removed by the author fromaged breeding stallions and mares without any sec-ondary consequences. Even extensive open surgi-cal wounds heal remarkably well. Laser surgicalexcision is a good option since it controls bleeding tosome extent and is very precise (Fig. 8). Prior to surgical intervention the guttural pouches should be examined carefully\u2014any tumors occur- ring internally must have derived from a malig-nant source elsewhere so the presence of lesions inthe guttural pouches or parotid salivary glands/ lymph nodes, will influence the prognosis for aparticular case. There is no evidence that surgi-cal interference results in exacerbation or trans-formation to malignancy. A benign tumor thatwill become malignant probably should be re-moved as soon as possible and a malignant tumorMUST be removed immediately to limit the extentof dissemination. Surgical removal carries thebest prognosis of all treatment options. Thevalue of this approach has recently been conrmedby an extensive study. 6 Surgical removal of tumors that have a function- ally limiting effect (such as in the eyelid or iris) isstrongly indicated. Surgical removal of parotid melanoma is in theory at least possible in a few cases but a detailed studyof the distribution and number of the masses mustbe obtained rst. Usually this would involve MRIor CT. 7Such surgery is challenging in almost ev - ery case. Fig. 7. Melanoma lesions have a progressive nature in almost every case. This applies to the number of lesions, their size and their pathological behavior. This horse is a good illustration of that. A, On presentation at age 4 years. B, Over 5 years the lesionsdeteriorated and new ones developed. A biopsy from 2 small lesions at the start showed a benign nature but the lesions in the rightpicture 5 years later showed malignant pathology in all the samples submitted following surgical removal to some degree. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 33IN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYCryosurgery Cryonecrosis of melanoma lesions is a fast but rarely effective method of treatment. Lesionsthat are ulcerated and that bleed signicantlycan be managed by careful and repeated cryo-surgery. On the eyelids, however, this is proba-bly not advisable because of the consequentscarring. Cimetidine Oral cimetidine therapy has been reported to besuccessful in some cases of melanoma. 8Cimeti -dine reportedly acts through its effects on T-Killer cells and was administered by mouth at 3.5 mg/kg(q12h) or 7.5 mg/kg (q24h). However, its value inspecic types of melanoma such as palpebral andocular melanoma is not reported independently. The reported efcacy from one paper has not been replicated by other subsequent studies and the gen- eral consensus now is that it is not an effectivetreatment and cannot be justied on current evi-dence. 9Treatment can possibly be justied for up to 6 weeks; if no change is detected by 3 weeks, there Fig. 8. Surgical removal of extensive perineal melanoma lesions can be a satisfying and logical approach and serves to prolong the life of the horse and improve its welfare. This procedure can be carried out in stages or using different treatment methods.Conventional sharp surgical excision is usually safe and practical but laser and cryosurgery can be used also to good effect.A, This 12-year-old Welsh cross mare developed multiple melanoma lesions over a period of 8-9 years. The horse was havingdefecation problems and the owner also noticed that the tumors had \"turned white/blue\". B, Sharp surgery was used to removethe bulk of the melanoma masses dorsal to the anus. The wounds were left open as far as possible. C, Two months later thehorse was reassessed and the surgical wound was healing well. A further laser surgery was then carried out to remove the restof the lesions. Assessment at 12 months showed no recurrence and no new lesions. D, Following the healing of the rst surgicalsite, the remaining melanoma lesions were removed by laser surgery. These sites healed slowly but the outcome was verysatisfying. Some 4 years later, a few more very small lesions were removed by laser again. 34 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYis probably little point in continuing. If, however, there is a response then the treatment should con- tinue until 3 weeks after there is no furtherimprovement. Cisplatin The value of cisplatin is also uncertain but the au-thor has had considerable success with treatment ofmelanomas using a cisplatin/sesame oil emulsioncontaining 1 mg/mL at 2-week intervals.There is no specic experience of its use on eyelidmelanoma. The emulsion appears to have no harmful or painful effects. 10Cisplatin combined with electro-permeabilization of the cells of the tu- mor (electrochemotherapy) could also be attempted.Slow release bio-degradable beads containing cispla- tin are also useful in some cases either solely or asan adjunctive measure to surgery (Fig. 9). Mitomycin C Mitomycin C does appear to have a specic anti-melanocytic effect and it can be a logical approach to Fig. 9. Combination therapy is often helpful. Normally this would involve surgical removal (laser or sharp) with some form of chemotherapy or even radiation. A, This 6-year-old cremello horse was presented with a slowly expanding darkly pigmented tumor onits tail. Biopsy conrmed a highly malignant melanosarcoma . B, It was removed by wide laser surgical excision. C, A series of cisplatin beads bwere inserted at 1-cm intervals around the margin prior to wound closure. D, The site was dressed using a tie-over stent to support the wound. The site healed well and the horse showed no local recurrence. However, 4 years later the horse presented with thoracic and abdominal melanoma. No other skin lesions were identied. The reasonable assumption was that thedissemination arose from the cutaneous mass that had not been removed quickly enough.

An emulsion form canhelp since the aqueous solutions are rapidly clearedfrom the injection sites. Melanoma Vaccines Recent developments in melanoma vaccines that in-duce an anti-tyrosinase response have been shownto have some positive effects in some cases. 8This vaccinecmust be used only by a boarded oncology specialist or internist. The reports of the use of this method in horses are preliminary at present butthere does appear to be some value in the process.It is the only option for disseminated melanoma. Radiation Radiotherapy has a surprisingly poor effect on mel-anoma tumors. High doses of gamma radiation de-livered via a linear iridium 192source had no material effect on several cases treated by the au- thor. Similarly, beta radiation appears to have nobenecial effect either.7. Note Melanoma occurring in non-grey horses has a more aggressive pathological behavior. Often these arenon-pigmented. 8. Prognosis The prognosis for life in an uncomplicated case of cu- taneous melanoma in a grey horse is usually good.Many affected horses live relatively normal lives and itis often simply the cosmetic and \"social\" appearance ofthe tumors that result in the animal being destroyed.However, when talking to clients it is wise to point outthat the disease is unpredictable. Even small tumorsin \"inconvenient\" sites could have a profound effect onthe animal; for example, a large melanoma in thethoracic inlet could cause recurrent choke or have neu-rological effects (or both). Spinal, ocular, cardiac, orbrain tumors (Figs. 10 and 11) may be catastrophicwhile others may cause clinical disease, e.g., colic orcardiac dysrhythmia or valvular compromise and re-duced athletic performance. These signs may not beimmediately attributable to the melanoma. In fact, Fig. 10. A, This 12-year-old grey mare presented with dullness, intermittent appetite, and ataxia with profound muscle wasting on the right gluteal region. A few melanoma lesions around the anus were identied; these showed a very high degree of malignancy.No other lesions were identied clinically but melanoma was thought to be a major differential diagnosis. B, Cerebrospinal fluidobtained from the lumbo-sacral region revealed black deposits and a brown fluid. Cytology conrmed malignant melanocytes.C and D, At necropsy, widespread tumor invasion of the cerebrum and brain stem and one focal area of involvement in the lumbarspinal canal were identied. It is possible that had the lesions around the tail been removed at a much earlier stage, this animalmight not have developed disseminated melanoma. 36 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: DERMATOLOGY AND LUMPOLOGYany clinical sign regardless of its organ system or severity could be the result of melanoma! It must beincluded on the differential diagnosis list of all greyhorses. Not all of these are treatable. In fact, inter-nal melanoma is best regarded as untreatable at pres-ent and so will inevitably threaten the life of the horse.Furthermore, up to 66% of cases will develop malig-nancy sooner or later and metastatic tumors will de-velop in a high proportion of these. The clinicaleffects of this dissemination may be limited but clearlycan be very dangerous even when the primary or sec-ondary tumors are small (Fig. 11). A few cases are highly malignant and it is currently impossible to predict which ones these are\u2014size isnot an indicator of malignancy. Generally, however,rapidly growing masses or those tumors with non-pigmented components (beige, grey, or pink) are bestviewed as dangerous. In these cases, which probablyrepresent less than 1% of affected horses, have a short,rapidly progressive course and this can usually beidentied clinically during repeated examinations oversome weeks; the course may however be fulminatingand lead to death within days. See Figures 10 and11. The equine melanoma remains a serious and chal- lenging condition for owners and veterinarians. 3Since almost all the primary lesions must arise in the skin, they should be visible and detectable withbasic clinical examination. The presence of inter-nal melanoma should be considered as a differentialdiagnosis for any clinical sign in any grey horse ofany age. Disseminated melanoma can occur in anyorgan but is rare within the lung parenchyma. The condition should not be belittled and treated as invariably benign; regular checks and careful sensible advice should be given to the owner. Sinceover 80% of grey horses (and a low but signicantnumber of non-grey horses) will get melanoma le-sions and since over 80% of these will ultimatelydevelop some degree of malignancy, early interven-tions are always valuable. Surgical tumor reduc-tion will probably result in fewer tumors and fewermalignancies. The development of a xenogeneic plasmid DNA encoding human tyrosinase vaccine ccarries signi - cant expectations since vaccinated horses show apositive immunologic response to the vaccine. 3,11 However, the clinical benet does appear to varymarkedly with some horses showing improvementand others being unaffected, in the author'sexperience.

Thesemares often have a history of being bred to provenfertile stallions, and have no identiable reproduc-tive pathology that would explain their inability toproduce embryos or became pregnant. Historically, oviduct pathology has not been con- sidered a major cause of infertility in mares. Inwomen, oviductal pathology is often the primarycause of subfertility, and evaluation of the oviductaltubes is a rst step for managing subfertility. 1 Several studies have explored the presence of ovi-ductal obstructions, and their clinical relevance, inhorses. 2-10Most recent research11revealed that collagenase masses were present in the oviducts ofboth young and old mares, and there was conflictingcorrelation with fertility. It has been postulatedthat oviductal masses may prevent sperm from ac-cessing the oviduct to fertilize the oocyte, or impedeembryo transit from the oviduct into the uterus. 2-11 Several methods to evaluate and remove sus- pected oviductal obstruction have been investigated in mares. the oviduct,15,16and antegrade hystero- scopic oviductal flushing.17Drawbacks to these ap- proaches include high cost, the need for specialequipment, surgical risks, and post-operative man-agement. In contrast, the protocol for deep-hornapplication of misoprostol provides a safe, inexpen-sive, and technically simple procedure that does notrequire special equipment. Prostaglandin E 2has diverse biological activities and many essential reproductive functions. Pros-taglandin E 2has been demonstrated to play a role in ovulation, parturition, and specic to the mare, isthe facilitation of the embryo's transport throughthe oviduct to the uterus. 18,19Synthesis of PGE2by early horse embryos20appears to induce relaxion of oviduct circular smooth muscle,18which has been demonstrated to selectively allow transport of theembryo, but not unfertilized oocytes through theoviduct to the uterus. 19-22 Challenges for the equine practitioner when ap- proaching suspected oviductal pathology or failure AAEP PROCEEDINGS 41FROM FERTILIZATION TO FOALING practical identica- tion of oviductal blockages/dysfunction and the bestpractical treatment to restore normal oviductalfunction. The authors have recently investigated 23 the effect of deep-horn application of misoprostol, asynthetic analogue of prostaglandin E 1(PGE1), on the oviductal papilla of barren mares. Circular smooth muscle of the oviduct of mares express PGE1 receptors, that suggest a role in relaxing the isthmicoviduct, potentially facilitating embryo transit sec-ondary to embryonic secretion promotes oviduct dilation and contractility that could result in the expulsion of oviductal masses andre-establishment of fertility after application ofPGE 2to oviducts of mares with unexplained infer - tility.15,16The deep-horn application allows the practitioner the ability to perform this procedure in the eld without the need for hysteroscopic or lapa-roscopic equipment. Misoprostol is a commercially available, low-cost PGE 1routinely used in women to initiate cervical relaxation and uterine contractility during la- bor.26-28Apparently, misoprostol is more effective in promoting myometrial contractility when com- pared to PGE228and is preferred to promote myome - trial contractility and induction of parturition forvaginal delivery in women. 30,31In mares, miso - prostol has shown to be effective for promoting cer-vical relaxation. 32,33 This paper describes a novel and practical ap- proach to restoring fertility of mares with suspectedoviduct pathology and subfertility. The proceduredescribed is the deep-horn application of misoprostolin aqueous suspension applied to the uterine horntip and oviductal papillae. The exact effect is un-known but this treatment may be facilitating anopening of the oviduct and resolution of \"blockage.\"This technique is practical, cost effective, providesminimal risk to the patient, and has demonstratedefcacy in the restoration of fertility to mares withsubfertility and failure to establish a pregnancy inthe absence of other pathologies. 2. Material and Methods Mares Signalment and descriptions of the 22 mares treated in the authors' rst study23are described in Table 1 , and 20 mares treated after this rst publication aredescribed in Table 2. All mares involved in theseexperiments had failed to conceive (no early preg-nancy diagnosed) after multiple inseminations us-ing semen from fertile stallions (each mare was bredwith at least 2 different stallions in previous cycles).None of the mares demonstrated clinical signs ofreproductive pathology (i.e., intrauterine fluid accu-mulation or other uterine or ovarian abnormalities)to which the conception failure was attributed.Treatment Protocols Initially, 22 mares of different breeds (4 Crioulos, 5 Mangalarga Marchadors, 1 Arab, 8 Quarter Horses,2 Brazilian jumping horses, and 2 Thoroughbreds)and ages (16.1 /H110065.7 years old) with reproductive history of unexplained conception failure weretreated by deep-horn application of misoprostol.All mares were bred using appropriate breedingmanagement and inseminated with fresh or cooledsemen from at least two different stallions of provengood fertility. In addition, a breeding soundnessexamination was performed on each mare prior totreatment. Transrectal palpation and ultrasono-graphic exams revealed no uterine or ovarianabnormalities. Treatment with misoprostol awas performed during diestrus, between the fth and the tenth day after ovulation. A tablet containing 200 mcgof misoprostol was crushed and dissolved in 3 mLof sterile water. The diluted solution was aspi-rated int oa5m L syringe for later application. Mares were prepared for treatment by restraint instocks and the rectum evacuated following trans-rectal ultrasound. The perineum was cleaned us-ing mild detergent, rinsed with clean water, anddried with paper towels. Deep-horn application of misoprostol was performed using a sterile flex-ible equine insemination catheter. bThe flexible catheter was inserted manually through the va- gina and cervix into the uterus. After that, theveterinary practitioner withdrew their hand fromthe vagina and through rectal palpation and ma-nipulation diverted the catheter to one horn (leftor right horn), and manipulated the tip of thepipette until it was palpable in the tip of theuterine horn. The syringe containing the dilutedsolution was attached to the catheter and the so-lution containing 200 mcg of misoprostol was in-fused into the uterine horn through the pipette. 23 After the rst application, the catheter was movedto the uterine body and then directed to the otheruterine horn to perform the procedure on the con-tralateral horn. Following administration of thesolution the pipette was withdrawn. One day after misoprostol treatment, mares re- ceived a prostaglandin injection (5 mg of dinoprosttromethamine c) to return to estrus and the subse - quent cycle was used regularly for breeding. Fol-lowing administration of misoprostol, no clinicalevidence of inciting a severe inflammatory reac-tion was noted. Transrectal palpation and ultra- sound exams were initiated 5 days after treatment.Mares were examined with transrectal palpationand ultrasounded daily and once a dominant follicle(/H1102235 mm) was detected and moderate endometrial edema was present, they were administered an in-tramuscular injection of 250 /H9262g of histrelin acetated to induce Articial insemination PROCEEDINGSFROM FOALING TO WEANINGspermatozoa) and the ovulation was conrmed on the subsequent day. Oxytocin treatment (10 IU,IM) or uterine lavage using lactated ringer's solu-tion were performed mares that accumulated in-trauterine fluid after articial insemination (AI).Embryo donor mares were flushed 8 days after ovu-lation for embryo recovery, and mares bred to carrywere evaluated 12-16 days after ovulation for preg-nancy using transrectal ultrasonography. Recently, 5 mares that failed to became preg- nant (1/5) or produce embryos (4/5) during 12-40consecutive treated withdeep-horn application of misoprostol (200 mcg)during the estrus. These mares were deter-mined, by an experienced clinician, to have con-ception failure in the absence of uterine or ovarianpathologies. These mares were evaluated bytransrectal ultrasonography and when a 30 mmfollicle was present, 200 mcg of misoprostol solu-tion was prepared as previously described, anddeposited in each uterine horn as described in the initial experiment. After treatment, mares werebred in the same cycle using standard breedingmanagement. 3. Results A total of 42 mares were treated with deep-hornapplication of misoprostol over the last 4 years.Twenty-two mares are from the authors' rst publi-cation 23(Table 1) and 5 mares were treated in the same fashion following the rst experiment.

Discussion This work demonstrates a successful re-establish- ment of fertility following deep-uterine horn appli-cation of misoprostol in mares with unexplainedinfertility and suspected oviduct pathology. Thesuccess of this proposed therapy is in agreementwith previous reports 12-17where mares with similar reproductive histories that suggested oviductal pa- thology, were able to achieve reasonable pregnancyrates following treatment. Oviductal globular masses in mares have been described by several authors 3,5-7,9,10in high per - centage of uterine tubes obtained from abattoir, andby flushing saline through the mare's lumen, oviduct function, resulting in subfertility orinfertility. 8Mares with a wide range of ages and breeds seem to be affected by this disorder, as re- ported in this study and as in previous re-ports 11,12,16,17,35about oviductal pathology. Thus, the mare's age and breed are factors that do not seem to be a factor in case selection for treatment.Interestingly, even young mares which never pro-duced embryos or became pregnant have benetedfrom the proposed treatment. There are several tests described to diagnose and assess oviductal obstruction. Oviductal infusion ofdye or microscopic fluorescent patency. these beads into the ampulla or via uterotubaljunction, and subsequently collection and evaluationof uterine 36-38or peritoneal fluid,12,39respectively, might suggest oviductal patency. However, these tests may not be conclusive, since the markers aresmaller (15 /H9262m) than an early embryo (150-200 /H9262m), which does not indicate that the oviductal lu- men supports the embryo transit. In one study,38 a technique utilized the infusion of microspheresin the oviduct by laparoscopic cannulation andrecovery of these beds from the uterus with lavage24 hours after surgery. If no beads (one color foreach side) were recovered from a given side, thetest was considered positive for that oviduct, sug-gestive of loss of function. The test revealed71.4% sensitivity and 85.7% specicity based onpostmortem diagnosis of the oviducts followingtreatment. However, this test is not practical orcost effective, as it requires surgical intervention,high-cost equipment and postoperative procedures.Additionally, it is unclear if these diagnostic testspredispose the mare to future oviductal inflamma-tion and pathology. Thus, there is currently nopractical clinical procedure to determine the uterinetube patency in living mares, and because the maresused in this study were from private owners, none of them could furnish untreated control cycles and theowners were not interested in performing invasiveand high-cost procedures to conrm the oviductalabnormalities. Consequently, the suspicion of ovi-duct blockage had to be made based on reproductive history. Most of the treated mares had a common history of suddenly not producing embryos or establishingpregnancy with no other causes of subfertility iden-tied. For this reason, these mares were submittedto the proposed therapy, which was effective in re-storing fertility in 69% of mares treated in the pres-ent study. Although oviductal dysfunction issuspected in mares suffering conception failure inthe absence of other clinical pathology, the associa-tion of reproductive pathologies with oviductalblockage cannot be ruled out. Moreover, it is sug-gested that salpingitis can originate due to an ex-tension of endometrial inflammatory processes. 40 The deep-uterine horn application of misoprostol in different estrous cycle stages achieved effectiveand similar results, which suggest that this treat-ment can be performed safely at any phase of theestrous cycle. Similarly, using laparoscopic appli-cation of PGE 2to the uterine tube surface, Ortis and collaborators16also reported similar successful res - toration of pregnancy rates when treatment (PGE2) was administered to mares at different stages of the estrous cycle. Apparently, as described by Ball etal 23the amount of PGE2receptors in the oviductal tissue are similar across the estrous cycle, which could explain these results. Other more invasive procedures were also able to rescue fertility of mares with unexplained concep-tion failures by flushing the uterine tube via theampulla 13,14or via the uterotubal junction.12,17 Additionally, several published studies15,16,35in the last 5 years reported similar results after treatment with PGE2by laparoscopy in mares with suspicion of uterine tube blockage. Thus, the protocol for deep- horn application of misoprostol provides an efcientway to restore fertility of mares with unexplainedinfertility. This method provides a safe, practical,cost-effective, non-invasive, and technically simpleprocedure that does not require special equipmentor referral. In addition, this protocol can be per-formed under eld situations and should be consid-ered as a possible treatment for mares withunexplained failure to produce an early pregnancy.

Introduction Bacterial endometritis is among the leading causes of subfertility in broodmares with severe economicconsequences. It has been estimated that 25%-60% of mares who fail to become pregnant afterbreeding have an endometrial infection. 1Financial consequences include increased costs of breedingmanagement, veterinary interventions, and board- ing a barren mare, while stud farms can also beaffected due to lost revenue from unfullled guaran-teed seasons. Predisposing factors for bacterial en-dometritis include breakdown in the physicalbarriers of the reproductive tract, dampened innateimmune system response, and poor uterineclearance. 2 Traditional diagnostic methods for bacterial en- dometritis include aerobic culture and cytologicevaluation of swab or uterine lavage or endome-trial biopsy. Limitations of sensitivity and spec-icity of these techniques for uterine infectionshave been reported, increasing the need for addi-tional tools for diagnosing endometritis. 3,4Cur- rently, aerobic culture is considered to be a commontool used by clinicians for diagnosing a uterine infec-tion as it allows for identication of the causative agent and for antibiotic susceptibility testing to beperformed. Though this test is a great screening toolfor endometritis, endometrial culture is unable to de-tect all cases of bacterial endometritis. 5Through identication of agent and susceptibility testing, thepractitioner is able to select an antimicrobial agentappropriate for treatment. Efcacy of treatment isnot known until after implementation. It would beuseful to have an assay to allow for more specictreatment of bacterial endometritis in the broodmares. Biolm infections may be a primary cause for chronic bacterial endometritis. Current aerobicculture conditions on agar plates are unable to eval-uate bacteria in a biolm state. Models of endome-tritis have been used to determine that the bacterialbiolm lifestyle can be present in the equine uteruswith the majority of biomass found between endo-metrial folds and within the endometrial glands. 6 In clinical practice, the sample obtained with a cul- turette or uterine biopsy rod may not include thisarea of the uterus, and/or the region of the biolm. The three Gram-negative bacterial isolates of the formation.7Bacterial bio - lm is dened as a community of microorganismsirreversibly attached to a surface, producing an ex-tracellular polymeric substance and exhibiting analtered phenotype. 8Biolms are a survival strat - egy of bacteria to reduce the host's immune responseto maintain a state of slowed metabolism andgrowth, and are often tolerant to high doses of anti-microbials. Combined, these traits make biolms achallenge to treat effectively with routine therapies. Traditional antibiotic sensitivity patterns are ac- curate for bacteria in a planktonic state, but anti-biotic tolerance seen with biolms may prevent ef-fective treatment in clinical practice. Isolates fromthe equine uterus in a biolm state required/H110111000/H11003higher concentration of antibiotics than bacteria in the planktonic state. 9Mares suspected of having a biolm associated infection will often have a history of culturing the same bacteria fromthe uterus even after effective antimicrobial therapyhas been administered. The addition of a non-antibiotic compound to dis- rupt the biolm in combination with antibiotics hasbeen shown to be effective at cleaning biolm infec-tions both in vivo and in vitro. 7However, this as - sumes that all bacteria being evaluated will betolerant to these non-antibiotic compounds. Ide-ally, if the bacteria are isolated from the uterus of amare suspected to have a biolm, the bacteria wouldbe cultivated in a biolm state. The biolm bacte-ria would then be analyzed for sensitivity to variousantibiotic and non-antibiotic compounds to deter-mine the best combination for treatment of thespecic organism. The goal of this manuscript is todescribe the use of a biolm assay in a clinicalpractice. 2. Materials and Methods A swab of the endometrium was obtained by a dou-ble-guarded kalajian culturette with a or through transcervical techniques aspreviously described. 10,11Conversely, an endome - trial sample was obtained via small-volume lavage(60 mL saline in a catheter-tip syringe or 150 mLsterile saline). The fluid retrieved was saved andsubmitted for culture. 12Swab cultures were placed in Amie's modied media with charcoal for transport to the lab. Samples from small volume lavage werecentrifuged for eight minutes at 500 /H11003G, superna- tant discarded, and the pellet was inoculated onculture media or broth. A biolm disruption assay was utilized to evaluate bacteria isolated from mares with recurrent infec-tions that were refractory to traditional therapy.This assay has been used previously to evaluatebacteria from the equine uterus in a biolm state. 9 Briefly, bacteria from aerobic culture are cultivatedin liquid broth in a 96-well plate to form the biolmstate. The planktonic bacteria are removed fromthe culture wells and the resulting biolm biomasscan be challenged with non-antibiotic and antibiot- ics (independently and in combination) (Table 1).Following the challenge, any planktonic bacteria/debris are rinsed away and the biolm is disruptedin recovery broth. The recovery fluid is plated ontoagar plates and evaluated for microbial growth todetermine if there was complete killing of all bacte-ria in the well. All samples were analyzed in rep-licates of ve with positive and negative controlsincluded within the same plate. 6,7,13 Medical and laboratory records were evaluated for mares that had the biolm assay performed, andany diagnostics prior to biolm assay results. 3. Results In the authors' practice, a small proportion of brood-mares had persistent bacterial endometritis. Themodied biolm assay was used to assist in thedevelopment of a targeted treatment plan. Retro-spective evaluation was performed on biolm assaysample results from 24 cases collected during the2018 breeding season in central Kentucky. Sam-ples were obtained by practitioners at a hospitalfrom cases in central Kentucky. The patients from which samples were obtained and breed data was available were Thoroughbreds(60%, 9/15), Warmbloods (20%, 3/15) years(5-25 years). Organisms evaluated for biolm pro-duction were Escherichia nosa (12.5%). Non-antibiotic compounds, independently and in combination with antibiotics, were analyzed for sen-Table 1.

Table 2 demonstrates efcacy of non-antibi-otics alone, while Table 3, displays the efcacy of thenon-antibiotics with ciprofloxacin, amikacin, andceftiofur, respectively. All mares for which there are data were treated with a combination of intrauterine antimicrobials,systemic antibiotics, and intrauterine lavages as se-lected by the clinician managing the case. In orderto determine if treatment was successful, uterinecultures obtained on the next heat cycle were as-sessed. Only 66.7% of mares had culture results (16/ 24). Of those, 56.3% had no growth (9/16), while theremaining 7/16 (43.7%) had a positive culture for beta- Strep ,Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,E. coli ,o r Klebsiella pneumoniae. Sixteen mares had information regarding preg- nancy status post-biolm treatment. Half the mares(8/16) were found to be pregnant, or provided embryos.Of the mares found pregnant, 62.5% (5/8) had noaerobic growth following biolm assay results andtreatment. beta-Strep ), while 12.5% (1/8) did not have a culture performed. 4. Discussion Infectious bacterial endometritis is a major contrib-utor to subfertility in the mare. This condition canprove to be a challenge for the equine practitioner todiagnose, treat, and resolve by the subsequentestrous cycle. 14,15With increasing research, bacte - rial biolms have been recognized in the multifacto-rial nature of this disease. Up to 99% of bacteriaubiquitous in the environment exist in a biolmstate. 6Unsurprisingly, the bacterial species con - sistently isolated from the mare's reproductive tractcan live in a biolm state. 6 Biolm formation reduces antimicrobial penetra- tion, allowing the bacterial species to persistthrough treatment. 9Recurrent infections with in - effective treatment can lead to multiple breedings,and ultimately, subfertility. Ferris et al7deter - mined that when used in combination, antibioticand non-antibiotic agents were highly effectiveagainst Gram-negative biolm forming isolates.This emphasizes the importance of accurate cultureisolation of a bacterial species, sensitivity patternsof the bacteria to antibiotics and non-antibiotics. At present, the biolm assay is an accurate assay in equine practice able to assess non-antibiotic and antibiotic compounds causing 100% killing of in-vitro biolm created by a specic isolate. We havefound this assay useful in difcult cases of chronicendometritis that were otherwise refractory totreatment. Many times, these mares representedcases of longstanding infertility and were refractoryto previous treatments (antibiotics, lavages, etc.)prior to the biolm assay. Incorporation of the bio-lm results, improved clinical outcome in thesecases. As an example, one mare persistently grewthe same microbial isolate on three endometrial cul-tures despite aggressive and appropriate therapy,until the species cultured no longer had sensitivityto any compounds available. An endometrial sam-ple was submitted for the biolm assay, and theresults revealed the organism to have a strongresistance prole to all antimicrobials available, butfor a repeatedly 30% At the end of DMSO treatment, theefflux of the uterine lavages became clear, theuterus had reduced inflammation on transrectal ul-trasound, and a normal cytology and no growth onaerobic culture. Following this targeted treatment,an embryo was recovered for the rst time in 2years. At this time, the biolm assay costs the practitio- ner $190.00 (including aerobic culture and sensitiv-ity). The turnaround time from submission tosensitivity results is 3-4 days. This cost is insig-nicant compared to the hundreds of dollars thatcan be spent on ineffective therapies.Table 2. Non-Antibiotic Compounds Antimicrobial HP Tricide FERTILIZATION TO FOALING of the cases, acetylcysteine was effec- tive at killing bacteria in a biolm state while hy-drogen peroxide was effective in 100% of 100% killing as effective.Potentially, compounds that were not effective inthese results may still have some killing ability thatwas not detected in the current assay. The authors'laboratory did have inconsistencies in the testing ofthe antimicrobials, as not every antimicrobial wastested on every biolm assay due to clinician selec-tion of compounds. It is the authors' belief that the biolm assay is useful at generating a more targeted treatment forendometritis, and improves our current diagnosticcapabilities. Fertility is a crucial variable affectedby recurrent bacterial endometritis, therefore, percycle pregnancy rate was used to determine if theassay-based treatment was successful. A 50%-per-cycle pregnancy rate was calculated off the sixteenmares that had this information available. Carefulcase selection should be performed to identify mareswith recurrent infectious endometritis in which abiolm is potentially involved. Failure to recognizeother reproductive pathology that may explain thesource of infertility will reduce the likelihood of theresults from this assay improving pregnancy rates. In conclusion, the biolm assay provides in-vitro efcacy of antibiotic and non-antibiotic combina-tions on a specic bacterial isolate. Uterine culturesamples are already routinely collected, eliminatingthe need to perform an additional procedure for an-other sample. At this time, Gram-negative speciesaccount for /H1101150% of bacterial endometritis infec- tions, making their isolation and sensitivity pat-terns the most informative. 7Further work is needed to investigate the importance of beta-Strep in uterine biolm formation. Overall, the biolmassay could become a useful tool for diagnosis andtreating recurrent, chronic endometritis.

Introduction Ovarian abnormalities in mares may be examined using a variety of modalities including transrectal palpation, anal-ysis, and histopathological means. 1Ovarian tissue may be obtained for analyses through ovarian bi-opsy or ovariectomy. 2Laparoscopic visualization and examination of the equine ovary has been re-ported for diagnostic purposes when ovarian abnor-malities, such as tumors, are suspected but notconrmed. 2The presence of ovarian tumors in mares is associated with reduced fertility.3Neo- plasia of the ovary includes gonadostromal teratomas and dysger-minomas. 1,3While most ovarian tumors of mares have low malignancy rates, dysgerminomas havebeen reported to have in the equine ovary. 1,3 It is not clear from the literature what proportion of ovarian tumors arise from granulosa cells (GCT),granulosa and thecal cells (GTCT) or thecal cellsalone (thecoma). This may be due to a lack of sub-mission of the tumor tissue for histopathology.A mixture of gonadostromal cell types is collectivelytermed a GTCT and is reported to be the most com-mon ovarian tumor in the mare, with the thecomabeing the least common tumor. 1,3The classic ultra- sound appearance of the ovary with the GCT, andGTCT has been referred to as a \"cluster of with a small inactive contralateral ovary. 1,3 The ovary with the tumor is typically enlarged andhas many multicystic areas, while the contralateralovary is anestrus-like. Other GCT and GTCT tu- mors have been reported to present as a single largecystic structures, and may simply appear as a solidmass. The ovulation fossa may not be palpable asovarian tumor tissue may grow into this region.The ovaries with GCT and GTCT tumors may havean abnormally when manipulated transrectally. 1The GCT and GTCT may however be bilateral and other un- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 53FROM FERTILIZATION NOTESusual features been reported.1,3-4 mares with GCT, and GTCT is de- creased.1,3A few mares with GCT, and GTCT con - tinue to have estrous cycles, and may becomepregnant, but in most cases there is negative feed-back on the pituitary from tumor products resultingin a small, static contralateral ovary. 1,3-5Other classes of tum ors, such as epithelial tumors in mares, may present with a relatively normal echo-textural appearance. 1,3Other differentials for an ovary with an unusual or abnormal echotexture include persistent assays are used to assist in the diagno- sis of ovarian abnormalities. Circulating levels oftestosterone, inhibin, and anti-Mu \u00a8llerian hormone have been used as tumor biomarkers for GCT andGTCT with a very high sensitivity. 6-7Progester - one levels are used to conrm that an echogenicstructure on a ovary is compatible with luteal tissueand demonstrates the mare is having estrus cycles,which means a GCT or GTCT is Anti-Mu \u00a8llerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells, and is not produced by thecalcells. 8Thecomas may not result in elevated bio - markers. Elevated levels of these hormonal serumbiomarkers may indicate that abnormal ovarian tis-sue is present, but do not locate the source, andwould not therefore differentiate unilaterally frombilaterally affected GCT or GTCT mares. What isalso not clear is the quantity and activity of neoplas-tic tissue that must be present to cause an elevationin AMH, or if there are a proportion of tumors withthe histologic appearance of GCT or GTCT that donot result in biomarker elevation. In a recent case,a mare with an abnormal ovarian structure wasidentied that originally had elevated AMH andinhibin, and was referred ovariectomy. On asubsequent recheck the ovarian abnormality wasnot was A transvagi-nal ovarian biopsy (TVOB) was performed that re-vealed only healthy ovarian tissue and ovariectomywas not performed (Card and Diel de Amorim, per-sonal communication, 2018). It is reported that an-drogen levels (i.e., testosterone) may be elevated inmares with ovarian cystadenomas but most otherovarian tumors do not produce reliable biomarkers. 9 The size of the mare and the deep abdominal position of the ovaries means that diagnostic modal-ities such as MRI and CT are problematic for use indetermining the nature of an ovarian abnormality.However, full-body scans for CT and MRI are avail-able at a few locations in North America. Surgicalremoval of the suspected abnormal ovary, or bothovaries in case the abnormal ovary cannot be iden-tied, is often performed as it usually provides adenitive diagnosis, and it may be curative. 3Bilat - eral ovariectomy; however, does not preserve themare's fertility. There are select cases where anovarian biopsy would be useful to determine which ovary is affected by neoplasia; if both ovaries areneoplastic; or to identify the nature of an ovarianabnormality prior to invasive, and irreversibleovariectomy. 2Criteria for the use of a TVOB might include abnormal ovarian texture on palpation; un- usual ovarian shape, such as no distinct ovulationfossa; in conclusive hormonal ndings; elevated biomarkers but no abnormal ovarian ndings ontransrectal ultrasound suspect abnor-mal ovarian ultrasound biomarkers; questionable or abnormal ultra-sonographic echotexture of the ovary in the ab-sence of biomarker due estrous difculty accessing biomarker lab-oratories; and investigation of possible bilateraltumor involvement. 2 2. Materials and Methods Equipment A 14-g single-action spring-loaded 20-cm biopsy nee- dleawas modied by extending the needle to a length of 65 cm and changing the bevel of the needle to a tapered point. The biopsy instrument has 3component parts: an inner notched needle with anechogenic diamond point tip, an outer sheath with acutting edge, and a handle that contains a spring-loaded ring mechanism. An u ltrasound machine with a vaginal transducer in a probe housing,which contained a needle guide, similar to trans-vaginal oocyte aspirations, is utilized. Procedure The biopsy device should be gas sterilized, ultravio-let light sterilized, or the handle and needle portionwiped with alcohol and the distal portion of theneedle immersed in cold sterilization media for atleast 10 minutes. Generally 2-3 biopsy needlesshould be prepared for each procedure. It is idealto have one instrument for each ovary to be biopsiedplus a spare. A device per ovary prevents possibletumor seeding to an unaffected ovary. A copiousamount of sterile water or saline should then beused to rinse away the disinfectant with the notch inthe biopsy needle exposed. The handle of the in-strument and any nonimmersed portions should bewiped with disinfectant and the instrument shouldthen be placed on a sterile eld. A probe and probe housing is assembled and the channel for the biopsy needle is disinfected bor a sterile insemination pipette or similar sterile plastic tube is inserted into the needle track and secured inplace. The probe housing and probe are placed in-side a plastic disposable probe cover c, sterile rectal sleeve, or sterile condom. Alternatively, a metal or plastic transvaginal probe housingdis chemically sterilized in a potentiated glutaraldehyde solutionb or other sterilant for at least 10 minutes. The ster- ilant must be removed by copious rinsing with ster- 54 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFROM FERTILIZATION TO FOALING TO WEANINGile water or saline. An ovum pick type probe or a microconvex 7.5-10-mHz ultrasound probe is disin-fected, rinsed with distilled water and 70% alcohol,and the probe is secured into a vaginal probe hous-ing. Sterile lubricant is applied to the probe, andthe probe housing is lubricated with sterile lubri-cant eand held guarded by the sterile, lubricated, gloved hand of the veterinarian. Mares are placed in a stocks and sedated with 20 mg IV) to relax the rectum. The mare's tail is wrapped, rectum emptied, and convention transrectal ultrasound examination per-formed using a linear probe to identify the ovary andarea on the ovary or ovaries of interest. It is essen-tial to identify the ovary to be biopsied and theregion of the ovary to be biopsied. The perineum isprepared and cleansed as if for breeding or articialinsemination. Following sedation, caution must betaken so the mare's head does not drop onto the doorof the stocks resulting in asphyxiation and collapse.The assembled covered or disinfected probe housingor unit is lubricated and inserted, using a sterilegloved hand and arm, into the vagina and positionedat the vaginal fornix lateral to the cervix, ipsilateralto the ovary to be sampled. The operator then re-moves their hand from the vagina and inserts theirarm in the rectum, removes any manure, locates theovary or ovaries to be biopsied and manipulates andpositions the ovary adjacent to the ultrasound probein the vagina. The ovary is often manipulated cra-nial into the abdomen and then flipped up over thebroad ligament for this purpose. The entry point tothe needle tract should be kept covered either by asterile plastic cover, or using a sterile towel duringthis manipulation to prevent contamination. Theovary is carefully examined using ultrasound. Theprobe housing containing the ultrasound probe ismanipulated along with the ovary so the region ofthe ovary to be biopsied is transected by an on-screen needle track. The biopsy instrument should be placed on a ster- ile eld and handled using sterile gloves from thispoint forward. The biopsy instrument is cocked bypulling back on the handle resulting in an audibleclick. The biopsy needle tip and side of the biopsyneedle tip is then lightly lubricated using a sterilelubricant. eThe biopsy needle is inserted carefully into the prepared needle channel of the probe hous- ing and advanced until it meets resistance in thefront of the vagina. At this time the veterinariansupporting the ovary through the rectum againstthe vaginal wall must hold the ovary steady andrmly against the vaginal probe. A biopsy needleguide may or may not be used. The ovary must bepositioned so the region to be biopsied is accessible,such as with the biopsy track bisecting the area ofinterest. The depth needed to reach the target areain the ovary is assessed by evaluating the centime-ter marks on the ultrasound image. The biopsy needle is then inserted into the ovary at approxi-mately that depth using a controlled stabbing mo-tion and real time visualization of the biopsy needlemovement. The biopsy needle is advanced by hold-ing the shaft of the biopsy needle near the needleport or retracted along the track into the target areaof the ovary with consideration for which biopsymethod will be applied. The handle of the biopsyinstrument may be problematic to use for position-ing the biopsy needle, as it may be accidentally red.The authors recommend that only the side of theneedle should be used for positioning. Therefore,when placing the biopsy needle into the area ofinterest, the authors recommend avoid handling theend of the instrument. An unplanned ring of theneedle may puncture the rectum or the veterinari-an's hand in the rectum. The biopsy needle isguided into the target area by visualizing the brightecho produced by reflections generated from the di-amond scoring on the needle tip. The technique for ovarian biopsy must be chosen. In what the authors call the two-step method, theveterinarian views the area of interest in the ovaryand advances the biopsy needle tip under directvisualization to just behind the biopsy location.The needle tip is advanced to the rst stop into theexact location to be biopsied by gentle pressure onthe handle of the instrument and it is moved slightlyto ll the notch on the biopsy needle. The biopsyinstrument operator's hand is removed from holdingthe side of the needle to the handle. The instru-ment is then red by rmly pushing on the end ofthe instrument. An audible click will be heard.The ring motion advances the cutting sheath overthe notch which captures the tissue in the notch.Using this two-step method, the biopsy needle tipdoes not advance when ring, rather the cuttingsheath moves and closes over the notched portion ofthe needle to capture the sample. Alternatively,the other choice of technique called the one-stepprocedure is to advance the biopsy needle to theperimeter of the tissue of interest and re the in-strument in one motion. With this method, theneedle advances as the handle is pushed and sheaththen cut. Note that the biopsy needle should not beheld during ring with either method as this pre-vents the cutting sheath from advancing. The one-step technique advances the needle and the cutting sheath at the same time, which results ina 2-cm advancement of the tip, and this must beaccounted for during needle placement. This iswhy the needle tip is positioned behind the area tothe biopsied. The sample should now be capturedin the specimen notch of the needle. The biopsyinstrument is then withdrawn. The biopsy instrument is moved to a sterile eld for removal of the biopsy core. The biopsy needle isrecocked and an audible click should be heard.The needle tip is advanced to the rst stop by gentlepressure on the end of the instrument to expose the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 55FROM FERTILIZATION TO FOALING TO WEANINGbiopsy core sample (Fig. 1). Care should be taken when removing the core sample as it is thread-likeand easily stretched. There may be blood presentobscuring the visualization of the core, which canbe blotted away using sterile gauze. The samplecore is small and is removed using one or two 22-gsterile needles and placed in a small amount ofxative (10% buffered formalin), or in a labeled sam-ple vial for histologic examination. Even a smallsample should be placed in formalin (Fig. 2A).The biopsy needle may be rinsed with sterile salineor wiped with sterile gauze. The notched portion ofthe needle is replaced inside the cutting sheath byreversing the handle tip, and the needle tip and sideof the needle is relubricated. The biopsy needle isreinserted into the needle channel of the probe hous-ing for a number of subsequent sample collections.Around three core samples should be obtained fromsolid areas of the area of interest. Once the samplecollection is completed, the vaginal probe is re-moved. A small amount of blood may be present on the tip of the probe housing from the biopsy needlepuncturing the cranial vaginal wall. Mares mayreact when the ovary is punctured and may moveslightly, occasionally additional sedation is neces-sary for mare comfort. The biopsy sample shouldnot be captured when the mare is moving for safetyreasons. Fixed tissues for histological examinationare processed in a routine manner and stained usinghematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 2B). Occasionally, a rectal puncture may occur when performing the procedure. This may be due tomare movement, overzealous insertion of the biopsyneedle, failure to identify the location of the biopsyneedle before ring, from positioning errors in areasdifcult to biopsy, operator error especially whenlearning the technique, or from inadvertently ringthe instrument. The veterinarian may experienceskin penetration from the biopsy needle. The bi-opsy needle will have to be retracted through therectum and ovary. This possibility of biopsy needlepuncture through the rectum should be disclosed tothe client. In the authors' research, a number ofthese rectal and operator punctures have occurred,mares were treated with NSAIDs, antibiotics, andrectal temperatures were measured for 3 days there-after; and no complications occurred in the mares.It is possible, however, that an ovarian abscess orinfection may occur if the rectum is punctured.It is possible a complication may arise simply due toinadvertent needle contamination during the proce-dure. A veterinarian's hand may be injured by abiopsy needle puncture by accident. Any biopsy in-strument that punctures the rectum should be con-sidered contaminated and should be either coldsterilized or gas sterilized before it is used again fora biopsy procedure. Ideally the ovarian biopsy in-struments are single use. Postprocedure Rectal temperatures, appetite, and demeanor of themares should be monitored daily for 3 days afterTVOB. Generally, mares are not treated withNSAIDs or antibiotics before or after the TVOB pro-cedure. If there is blood obtained from the manip-ulation of the ovary through the rectum or aninadvertent rectal puncture occurs, then antibioticsand NSAID should be administered. The originand possibility of injury from blood following a rectalexamination should be determined using standardprocedures, and appropriate measures taken. Mares with Abnormal Ovaries The mares with the abnormal ovaries may have verylarge ovaries that may be difcult to pull alongsidethe vagina for biopsy. Some mares with deeply po-sitioned ovaries and short, broad ligaments are morechallenging to biopsy. It may be possible to use thenonmodied biopsy device and perform the ovarianbiopsy procedure through the flank of the mare.Mares with GCT or GTCT that are multicystic also Fig. 1. 14-g biopsy needle with (upper) and without sample notch exposed (lower).

Therefore, theauthors recommend avoiding the cystic areas of anovary when performing a biopsy, if possible. Thetypical appearance of healthy ovarian tissue such asluteal tissue, follicle wall, and stroma obtained us-ing TVOB are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 is a histologicimage of tissue obtained from a GTCT using aTVOB. 3. Results More than 183 procedures for research and clinicaldiagnosis of ovarian abnormalities have been per-formed by the authors without severe complication.In 11/183 mares, the rectum has been puncturedduring the procedure, and none of the animal devel-oped fever or any other complications. One out of 5TVOB attempt of a multi-cystic region of a marewith a suspected GCT or GTCT did not yield suf-cient tissue for diagnosis, and a second procedurewas required.4. Discussion The health and fertility of mares experiencing transvaginal luteal biopsy or TVOB has been re-ported, along with the TVOB of neoplastic ovariantissue. The health and fertility of healthy maresand mares with ovarian abnormalities after thetransvaginal luteal biopsy/TVOB procedure(s),was similar to nonbiopsied mares and was withoutadverse effects. 2Mares were biopsied over many cycles similar to mares undergoing repeated fol- licular aspirations. In the case of ovaries with suspected tumor tissue, the authors reported that generally diagnostic sam-ples are obtained using the biopsy technique. How-ever, there may be an insufcient sample obtained ofthe neoplastic ovarian tissue to make a diagnosis insome cases, particularly if the tumor is multicysticand lacks any solid areas. 2It is also possible that the area of the ovary in which the tumor tissue is located is not biopsied, so the authors recommendedtaking multiple core samples of the tissue from dif-ferent poles or quadrants of the ovary.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 TO FOALING TO WEANINGovaries may be difcult to position and hold steady against vaginal probe for biopsy. The TVOB is a procedure utilized to determine the nature of ovarian abnormalities, and it has a varietyof applications such as ascertaining if one or bothovaries are involved in mares with ovarian tumorssuch as GCT. The technique is also useful whenthe clinical ndings concerning the ovary or ovariesare discordant with the biomarker results. 10A pre - vious study has demonstrated that on histopathology hadelevated for 0.649, respectively). 7,10-12There is a report of two mares with elevated AMH that had a large follicular structure in one ovary and an activecontralateral ovary. In both these mares, the largefollicular structure regressed, the mares were bred,and they became pregnant. Furthermore, severalmares diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral GCT onhistopathology have had ovaries that were withinnormal limits upon palpation (discernable ovulationfossa) and ultrasound, but had behavioral signs in-dicative of a GCT. 3,4,10There is variability in ovar - size, texture on palpation, and ultrasonographicappearance of GCT. 3,12Generally it is advisable to perform a serum biomarker analysis in all cases where a GCT is suspected due to behavioral signs or palpation/ultrasound ndings. This is particularlyimportant when the classical clinical presentation ofa GCT with one enlarged affected ovary and a smallcontralateral ovary is absent. 10,12As a small per - centage of mares with elevated serum biomarkershave transient ovarian abnormalities, serial moni-toring of serum biomarkers ultrasound ndingsis advised in the nonclassical suspected GCT cases,or an ovarian biopsy should be performed beforeperforming an ovariectomy. There is a signicant learning curve in mastering the TVOB; however, it is similar to the follicularaspiration technique. This is a procedure that canbe implemented in a clinical setting. Mares requiresedation but generally tolerate the procedure with-out complications.

Introduction Diseases affecting the internal umbilical remnant are common in foals. Ultrasound is used to diagnose ab-normalities of these structures and to monitor treat-ment. However, little is known about the progressionof normal internal umbilical remnant regression. 2. Materials and Methods Weekly ultrasound examinations were performed be-ginning at 1 day of age in 26 foals. The umbilical veinwas measured in cross-section just cranial to the ex-ternal umbilicus, at the level of the liver, and midwaybetween these points. The umbilical arteries weremeasured in cross-section just caudal to the externalumbilicus, at the apex of the bladder, and at the mid- point of the bladder. The urachus was imaged longitu-dinally as it exited the bladder. Reduction in size overtime was evaluated as percentage change in diameter. 3. Results Structure diameter decreased linearly over time. Thelargest measurements were at 24 hours of age with amedian umbilical vein diameter of 8.33 mm (interquar-tile range [IQR], 7.71-9.08 mm), median umbilical arterydiameter of 5.83 (IQR, mm (IQR, 10.5-11.6 mm).There reduction in diameter for allstructures ( /H1101120%) within the rst week of life. 4.

Introduction of 2016 AAEP AVMA Eco- nomic Survey respondents participated in extern- ships during their veterinary school years, and ofthose, 33.4% participated in 4-6 and 50.0% in 1-3externships. Subsequently, 55.4% applied for aninternship at one or more of the practices where theydid externships. Some respondents (5.7%) indicated that they were currently participating in an internship, and 47.7%had participated in an internship previously; 46.6%of respondents did not participate in an internship.In contrast, an AVMA survey sample of generalveterinary practitioners showed 74.0% had not par-ticipated in an internship and 26.0% percent hadparticipated in an internship (Fig. 1.) Of the 1055 respondents who participated in an internship, 611 were females, and 435 were males.More equine practice females (64.3%) than equinepractice males (37.9%) participated in internships.This is substantially different than respondents inthe AVMA survey of predominately companion ani-mal veterinarians, which reported nearly equal par-ticipation rates between males (23.5%) and females (27.6%) (Fig. 2.) When the distribution of respondents by the year they completed their internship was examined, itwas revealed that more than half of the total num-ber of respondents in both samples completed aninternship in the past 10 years. Participation ininternships was fairly uncommon prior to 1996.Only 11.2% of respondents reported completing in-ternships in years 1986-1996, compared to 41.0% inthe years 2012-2016. More than 40.6% of the 562equine respondents that participated in an intern-ship did so in the past 5 years (Fig. 3). It is notclear whether this is because there are many moreinternships now available in private practice, orwhether currently graduating students or prospec-tive employers lack condence in the newly gradu-ating veterinarians' entry level skills, or whetherthis phenomenon is driven by another factorentirely. To understand why so many equine-oriented new graduates decide to participate in an internship af-ter veterinary school, Equine respondents were que- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 67THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE NOTESried as to their reasons for undertaking an internship, and they were asked to select all thereasons that applied to them (Figs. 4 and 5). Among the 26 male Equine respondents who grad- uated from 2012 to 2016, veterinary medicine,\" for a \"to get more training before entering veter-inary practice.\" In contrast, among the 164 femaleEquine respondents who graduated from 2012 to2016, 72% selected \"to get more training applying for available jobs,\" and just39.6% selected \"plan/planned to apply for a resi-dency\" (Figs. 4 and 5). It was reported that most internships offered an opportunity to experience primary emergency dutywith mentoring, and two thirds had clinical caserounds. About half held a journal club, about athird had procedural rounds to learn techniques,and about a quarter had radiology rounds (Fig. 6). Salary for interns in 2012-2016 was an average of /H11011$27,000. Free housing was included in the com- pensation of 34% of internships reported by the re-spondents. Over time, benets received by internshave increased (Fig. 7). Salaries for 2012-2016 graduate males' rst posi- tion after internships were reported to be about$10,000 more than salaries for female respondents.This disparity has been increasing over time (Fig. 8). Overall, those respondents who participated in internships were quite satised with the experience.Examining the distribution of respondents by gen-der nds that 91.5% of male Equine respondentswere extremely or very satised with their intern-ship experience as were 75.3% of female Equinerespondents.

When determining whether the specic internship experiences have met the expectations of the partic-ipating veterinarian, most Equine respondents be-lieved that their internship met their expectations\"extremely well\" or \"very well\", with the exception ofunderstanding business management (Figs. 10-15). Overall, if Equine respondents had the option of participating in an internship again, 75.3% wouldparticipate in the same internship, 15.1% would par-ticipate in a different internship, 1.8% said theywould not participate in an internship, and 7.8%said they are not sure what they would do (Fig. 16). 2. Entry-Level Skills A specic question in the 2016 AVMA-AAEP Sur- vey of Equine Practitioners asked respondents,\"for each procedure below, please indicate whether or not it is important for new associates to havemastery of it to work in the practice you own or areemployed at.\" About 90% of the AAEP respon-dents stated that it was important for new associ-ates to have mastery of diagnosing and treatingfoot abscesses, and examining and repairing sim-ple lacerations.

However, recent graduates report poorer mental health than more experienced practitioners, and a minority of respondents reporthigh risk for burnout and mental stress. Workplace injuries are common, although they rarelyresult in permanent disability. Many veterinary employment agreements have no maternity/paternity leave policies or lack clear explanations of compensation and benets for expectantparents. Equine practitioners must prioritize workplace initiatives related to mental health,safety, and family to support the wellbeing of the profession for the future. Author's ad-dress: Genesee Valley adwyer7579@gmail.com. 2019 The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) Economic Report1released on November 16, 2018 reports recent information on the economics ofequine practice and relates data detailing contem- porary trends in equine practice to data from thebroader veterinary profession and the equine indus-try. The report, produced through a partnershipbetween the AAEP and the American VeterinaryMedical Association (AVMA), reflects results from acomprehensive survey sent to AAEP members in thespring of 2016. It includes data from 975 AAEPmember respondents (13% of the 7,432 graduateveterinarians who were AAEP members at the timeof the survey) as well as 81 equine practitioners whoanswered a separate but similar AVMA survey.The report summarizes information relating to de-mographics of these 1,056 equine respondents andincludes sections on participant mental and physicalhealth, education, advanced training, current andpast employment, compensation and benets, reve-nue production, debt, practice ownership, family sta- tus and work satisfaction as well as other elementsreflecting the work environment prevalent in vari-ous sectors of equine practice, and conditions of thehorse industry at the time of the survey. The fullreport relates data from equine practice to informa-tion from separate AVMA surveys reflecting othersectors of the veterinary profession. The data were evaluated for statistical signi- cance and trends relating to respondent sex, age,year of graduation, veterinary college, and level ofeducation. Additional lters included participationin internship or residency, board certication, in-come level, and whether the respondent was a prac-tice owner, practice associate, or an employee at auniversity or other institution. The specic prac-tice sector and geographic location that each respon-dent worked in was examined, as was the businessmodel and size of their workplace. This paper summarizes the sections of the report that relate to the physical and mental health ofAAEP respondents (Section 4.8, pages 366-374), in- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 73THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE NOTESjuries sustained at work, and resultant limitations on physical activity in and out of work (Section 4.8,pages 375-388), as well as respondent answers tothe standard Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL)tool (Section 4.8.2, pages 389-430) and informationon parenting and family status (Section 4.3, pages261-266). 2. Results Physical and Mental Health of EquinePractitioners Over 89% of equine respondents reported their phys- ical health as \"excellent\" or \"good.\" This rate wasconsistent among all age groups and males and fe-males. About 10% reported their physical healthas \"fair,\" and less than 3% reported \"poor\" or \"verypoor\" physical health (Fig. 1). About 2/3 of equineveterinarians said that their physical health posedno limitations on their daily activity; most of theremaining 1/3 reported that their physical healthposed only a little limitation. Males (who repre-sented an older cohort) reported that their physicalhealth imposed slightly more limitations on theirdaily activity than females. Over 82% of equine respondents reported their mental health as \"excellent\" or \"good.\" The remain-ing 18% graded their mental health in the fair orpoor range and showed a linear trend of decliningmental health among respondents from recent grad-uation years with cohorts who graduated 1-5 yearsago showing the highest number of respondents re-porting poor mental health, followed by those thatgraduated 6-10 years ago. Practitioners in theolder graduating classes reported the most favorablelevels of mental health (Fig. 2). Over 25% of theequine respondents who graduated in the past 10 years (the majority of whom were female) reported\"very poor,\" \"poor,\" or \"fair\" mental health. Manyof these respondents reported higher levels of neg- ative effects of their mental health on their per-formance, including limitations on daily activityand/or interference with the volume of dailyaccomplishments. Perception of physical health did not show any gender disparity, as 89% of both males and femalesreported good to excellent physical health. Therewas a difference among genders when mental healthwas queried (Fig. 3). Of male respondents, 90%reported good to excellent mental health, 9% re-ported fair mental health, and less than 1% reportedpoor mental health. Of female respondents, 77%reported good to excellent mental health, 19% re-ported fair mental health, and a little under 5%reported poor or very poor mental health. Respon-dents who were practice owners tended to reportmore favorable assessment of their mental healththan respondents who were employed as associates. Nearly 60% of both male and female respondents reported that their physical health posed no limita-tion on their daily activity, whereas slightly lessthan 3% of either gender said that their physicalhealth limited their physical activity \"a lot\" or \"agreat deal.\" The majority of both genders said theirmental health did not limit their daily activity at all,or only a minor amount, and less than 2% of eithergender said that their mental health limited theiractivity \"a lot\" or \"a great deal\" (Fig. 4). Work Injuries of Equine Practitioners Nearly 80% of survey respondents reported one or more work-related injuries that had occurred duringtheir career. However, nearly half of those injuriesdid not result in any lost time. A little more thanone-third of injuries resulted in a work absence thatlasted less than 7 days. A minority of reportedinjuries resulted in a work absence of 30-89 days(4.7%), more than 90 days (3.4%), or a permanent Fig. 1.

About 16% of respondents had been hospitalized for a work-related injury and20.3% had undergone some kind of surgery for aninjury. Male equine practitioners reported higherrates of hospitalization and surgery than females. About two-thirds of both male and female respon- dents reported recent pain that was \"mild\" or \"verymild.\" A little more than one-fourth reported painthat was moderate to severe. Half of respondentssaid that pain did not interfere with their normalwork, but there was a small minority that reportedpain that caused major interference. This grouptended to be older. Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL): Responses from Equine Practitioners The ProQOL, a survey instrument widely used in social science, was embedded in the survey instru-ment. 2Respondent answers to the ProQOL survey questions were tabulated to measure compassion satisfaction (CS; pleasure derived from helping oth-ers) and compassion fatigue (CF; the negative effectsof working in a helping profession) of each respon-dent. CF was further rated by standardized sub-scales that grade a respondents' scores for burnoutand secondary traumatic stress (STS). Group re-sults were tabulated to compare equine practitio-ners to the general veterinary population and toother professionals. Mean scores for CS in equine respondents were in the high normal range (37.5), implying that as agroup, most equine veterinary professionals derivemore pleasure from the helping aspect of their jobthan members of other professions (Fig. 5). Theequine respondents also scored slightly higher (1.1points) than the AVMA group. However, a small Fig. 2.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 75THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICEminority of respondents had CS scores of less than 22. Scores below 22 indicate that those respon-dents are in a high-risk range for mental stressrelated to low CS. CF is the opposite of CS. This term describes the negative mental consequences that may occur inpeople who work in health care or helping profes-sions. The standardized ProQOL scoring systemquanties CF with a composite rating that blends arespondents' score for burnout (negative conse-quences of chronic exposure to trauma or stress inothers that tend to come on slowly) with their scorefor STS (negative consequences of exposure to ex-treme trauma or stress in others that tend to occurrapidly). CF scores for the majority of equine sur-vey respondents were in the low normal range (av-eraging about 24 for burnout and 21 for STS),implying that, as a group, most equine veterinaryprofessionals suffer fewer negative effects of work-ing in a helping profession than do members of other professions (Fig. 6 and 7). A small number of equine practitioners scored above 35 on one or both of the CF subscales indicat-ing \"at risk\" levels of CF. Specically, 5.8% scored over 35 on the burnoutscale, and 1.6% scored over 35 on the STS scale,indicating that this minority of members suffer ex-treme stress in their current jobs. The percentageof at-risk respondents was lower than that noted inthe AVMA group, and the overall mean CF scores ofthe equine group were also a few points lower thanthose of the AVMA group, implying that the equinesector suffers slightly less CF than the general vet-erinary population. A linear trend for both CS and CF scores across graduation year cohorts was noted, with older grad-uates scoring higher (better) on the CS scale andlower (better) on the CF scales (burnout and STS) Fig. 4.

Gender data showed that male equine respondents, who tended to be in oldercohorts, had higher CS and lower CF scores thanfemales, who tended to be in younger co-horts. There was also a linear trend for respon-dents with higher incomes to score \"better\" on theProQOL CS and CF scales than those with lowerincomes. A variety of factors had signicant asso-ciation with higher (worse) burnout scores, includ-ing current educational debt load, internshipparticipation, female gender, and being a member ofa recent graduation class. The survey section on quality of life concluded with about 30 questions relating to well-being thatwere specic to the equine sector of veterinary med-icine. The survey broke down respondent answertrends by gender. Questions relating to feeling sat-ised when learning new information or skills ornoting a positive patient outcome tended to havesimilar positive ratings from male and female re- spondents. Questions relating to the level of stressfelt while on call, handling multiple priorities, orfeeling exhausted or irritated while on the jobtended to have different ratings between genders,with females indicating higher levels of stress, irri-tation, or exhaustion than males. Family Status of Equine Practitioners Just over half of the equine respondents (52.1%) indicated they have children. Another 31.4% of re-spondents reported that they did not have children nor did they plan to have children during theirprofessional career, while 16.5% of respondentsdid not currently have children but plan to havechildren in the future during their professionalcareer (Fig. 8). With regard to available maternity or paternity leave, 40.1% of equine respondents had no leave Fig. 6. Burnout scores of AAEP and AVMA respondents. AAEP mean score was 24; this is a lower level of burnout than the range documented in other professions. Scores above 35 are considered high risk for extreme stress from burnout (page 407 in report). Fig. 7. Secondary traumatic stress (STS) scores of AAEP and AVMA respondents. AAEP mean score was 21; this is a lower levelof STS than what has been documented in other professions. Scores above 35 are considered high risk, indicating extreme stress(page 418 in report). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 77THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICEoffered and 31.8% had between 1 and 2 months; another 16% of respondents had more than 2months leave, while an additional 12.2% reported\"other\" (nonspecied) (Fig. 9). Of those with leave,41.2% of respondents reported that none of the ma-ternity or paternity leave was eligible for compensa-tion and another 34.6% reported that just 1 to 2months of leave was eligible for compensation (Fig.10). About half of respondents who were offeredmaternity/paternity leave said that employmentbenets were continued during the leave. Of thosereporting benets during leave, nearly 60% reportedthat benets continued for 1-2 months and 24%reported that the benets were extended for 2-4months (Fig. 11). Almost three-quarters of AAEPrespondents indicated that policy relating to mater-nity or paternity leave was not well addressed intheir employment agreements. 3. Discussion Many variables affected the data mined by the sur-vey. The group of respondents ranged in age fromveterinarians in their late 20s to those in their 80s.Participants ranged from veterinarians with lessthan 1 to over 60 years of clinical experience. The survey results should be interpreted with these factsin mind, as vast changes have occurred in the equineveterinary profession, the equine industry, the econ-omy, and the culture in the past 60 years. Of particular note is the age and experience distri- bution of male and female equine practitioner respon-dents. Thirty years ago, females represented lessthan 10% of all equine veterinarians, whereas todayfemales comprise the majority of new graduates.The demographics of the survey respondents are illus-trated in the following graphs that plot the percent ofeach gender versus age and years of experience: (Figs.12 and 13). Male equine respondents had an average age of 56 and an average of 30 years of experience, with manyhaving over 40 years of experience. Female equinerespondents were, on average, 17 years younger (av-erage age of 39). The female cohort as a whole hadmuch less experience than the male group (average12.6 years, with over 50% of the female respondentshaving less than 5 years of experience). The vari-ance in age and experience between the male and Fig. 8. Family status of equine respondents (page 261 in report). Fig. 9.

Length of time benets are offered during maternity/paternity leave (page 265 in report). 78 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICEfemale groups should be borne in mind when inter- preting survey data. The data on mental health suggest that the cohort of equine practitioners who are recent graduatesexperience more challenges with mental health andwellness than practitioners who have been in prac-tice for a long time. The trend for declining mentalhealth was a linear one with the recent graduates (5years or less experience) having the highest num-bers of respondents reporting poor mental healthand the largest number of practitioners who saidthat their mental health affected their productivityand/or daily activities. Graduates who had 5-10years of experience also reported an increased rateof poor mental health, although the levels were notas high as the most recent graduates. In contrast,data on reported physical health of equine practitio-ners were constant among all age groups with thevast majority of respondents reporting good to excel-lent physical health. Although a recent report from the United King- dom implies that the rate of injury among equineveterinarians makes this job the \"riskiest of civilianprofessions,\" 3data from this report suggest that while injuries are common, half of all on-the-job injuries among AAEP members do not result in losttime and that only a minority result in a permanentdisability or a work absence lasting more than 30 days. Equine practice is not without physical risk,but the majority of respondents reported only minorlimitations on their physical work or daily activityrelated to pain or to physical or mental healthchallenges. The data collected in the ProQOL survey tool show that most equine practitioners score fairly well onthis standard social science scale with higher thanaverage scores quantifying CS and lower than aver-age scores quantifying CF. However, a minority ofequine respondents had \"high risk\" scores indicatingthey are struggling with low CS and/or a high rate ofburnout (5.8%) or STS (1.6%). Individuals withscores in the high-risk range on any of these metricsmay need to seek professional help to deal with thevarious factors that are affecting their professionalquality of life. The ProQOL survey tool is available online through the AVMA website; equine practitionerswho would like to see how they score on the ProQOLscales may take the survey using the free self as-sessment tool on the AVMA website. The site isaccessible without a member log in. 4 Results detailed in the report section on family status indicate that there is a strong need for theequine veterinary community to address issues re-lating to maternity/paternity. Although over two-thirds of the respondents report that they eitherhave children already or are planning to have chil-dren during their career, 40% of employed respon-dents indicated that their employer did not offer anyprovision for maternity/paternity leave. About40% of leaves that are offered are unpaid, and insome cases employee benets do not continue duringthe leave. Given the recent shift toward a femalemajority in the equine veterinary workforce, it isimperative that employers develop fair maternity/paternity leave policies that are well described inemployment agreements and enforced for all em-ployees who are parents. The data relating to member wellness and parent- ing contained in the AVMA-AAEP Economics Reportprovide useful insight into current trends that affecteveryone who is an AAEP member, but particularlyveterinarians who have graduated within the past10 years. The survey results suggest that initia-tives addressing mental health and well-being, aswell as parenting concerns and workplace injuriesshould be prioritized by AAEP staff and members,especially employers and members of AAEP servicetask forces and committees that address these im-portant issues.

Introduction Starting salaries and gross service revenues from production in the equine veterinary eld generallylag behind those offered in other types of privatepractice. While these differences may result frommultiple factors inherent to the equine industry,they also warrant review and discussion. 2. Mean Compensation of Respondents The mean annual compensation income reported forall Equine respondents was $99,000. This gure islower than the mean annual income of $112,000reported in AVMA survey data that included alltypes of veterinarians. Income levels were noted torise in a roughly linear fashion with years of expe-rience; equine veterinarians who had been in theworkplace less than 5 years reported the lowestmean incomes while those who had 30 or more yearsof experience had the highest. Veterinarians whowere equine practice owners reported a mean an-nual income of $118,000; veterinarians who wereassociates in equine practices reported a mean an-nual income of $78,000. Equine veterinarians whoworked in universities reported a mean annual in-come of about $118,000. 3. Years in Practice, Effect of Internship or Residency, and Effect of Geography The mean personal gross revenue of production among Equine respondents by graduation yearshowed a gradual increase in revenue production until after 20 years of practicing veterinary medi-cine was reached. Respondents less than 5 yearsafter graduation reported mean gross revenue pro-duction of $306,019 while respondents who had beenpracticing for more than 30 years produced a meanof $411,528. Similiarly, AVMA respondents whorecently graduated, on average, brought in less rev-enue than those with more experience. Participation in an internship was associated with lower mean income levels among peer gradua-tion years, but board certication was associatedwith higher mean income levels. Employment inthe racing, reproduction, or performance horse sec-tors was also associated with higher income levels.Geographic location was associated with some vari-ance in income, with the south central region (in-cluding Kentucky) and the southwest region(including Texas) reporting higher incomes and theupper midwest and Western Mountain Regions re-porting lower incomes. 4. Gender Effect The mean personal gross revenue from productionamong Equine respondents by gender was $477,929for males, and $346,638 for females. Among AVMArespondents, the mean personal gross revenue was$515,159 for males and $451,108 for females. Thedistribution of personal gross revenue from produc-tion by gender is presented in Fig. 1. It is impor-tant to note when interpreting this data that the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 81THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE NOTESmean experience (years since graduation) of male respondents (29 years) in this study was more thantwice that of females (12.3 years). This production gap is reflected in a wage gap that was reported to be statistically signicant betweenmale and female equine practitioners; this mirroredthe income gap that was noted among AVMA respon-dents. Among equine practice owners, males re-ported an annual mean income of $140,000 whilefemales reported $83,000. Among associates inequine practice, males reported an annual mean in-come of $97,000 while females reported $73,000.The average male respondent was older and moreexperienced than the average female respondent (seegraphs above), but there may be other factors thatinfluenced income variance between gender cohorts. In general, starting salaries in the equine veteri- nary eld lag behind those offered in other typesof private practice. AVMA respondents reportedhigher post-internship salaries than Equine respon-dents on average, except for male Equine respon-dents who graduated in the period 2012 to 2016;these graduates reported an average starting salaryof $61,867 compared to AVMA males who reported$61,810. In contrast, female Equine respondentswho graduated from 2012 to 2016 reported an aver-age starting salary of $51,109 compared to AVMAfemales who reported $70,452. The gender disparity in starting salaries after in- ternship for Equine respondents in the last 5 yearsis approximately $10,000, or 16.2% lower for females(Fig. 2). This negative nding reflects the broader issue across industries that also nd a gender wage gapbetween 8% and 20% in the United States. 1Scar - city increases perceived value; in equine veteri-nary medicine, this disparity among recentgraduates may arise in part because of the lownumbers of males entering the profession com-pared to females. In addition, 60% of currentequine practice owners are male, which may influ-ence their decision to hire male associates overfemales, a decision that could be based on the status-quo bias (the tendency for people to like things tostay relatively the same), resulting from the expo-sure effect (the tendency for people to like thingsmerely because they are familiar with them). Inaddition to scarcity and status quo, Gorman 2has observed many aspects of gender-related stereo- types on work environment. 5. What Other Factors May Affect Starting Salaries for Equine Veterinarians? Associate veterinarians starting their careers in equine practice face several challenges. Because ofthe high dollar value of many of the horses thatthey encountered as patients in veterinary school,many were not allowed the opportunity to practicehands-on clinical skills, communicate with owners,or develop independent case management abilities.Data show that survey respondents value a compre-hensive list of entry-level skills that many job can-didates may not possess. In addition, horse ownersare frequently very bonded to a specic veterinarianand are often reluctant to allow care by a new doctor.These realities create an environment where newassociates have difculty producing sufcient pro-duction revenue to support robust starting salaries. Fig. 1. Distribution of equine and AVMA respondents 2015 total personal gross revenue of production by gender. Fig. 2. First salaries after internship by gender and year of graduation. 82 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICEMany of these young doctors struggle to produce sufcient income to support the total cost of theircompensation for several years, if not longer. 6. Benets More than 75% of Equine respondents received thebenets of continuing education expenses, licensure,liability insurance, and association dues. A little over60% were granted discounted veterinary care and con-tinuing education leave. Health insurance (52.8%)and paid vacation (51.4%) were received by a littlemore than half of Equine respondents (Table 1). Half of all Equine respondents had children and another 16.5% said they planned to have children inthe future. The remaining 31.4% said they did notplan on having children. Only a minority of re-spondents indicated that their job granted paidmaternity or paternity leave; nearly three quarterssaid that maternity/paternity leave was not welladdressed in employment contracts; less than 10%were granted paid maternity or paternity leave. 7. Gross Revenue Production Relationship to Compensation Most practice management resources indicate that the total cost of compensation (including salary, ben-ets, payroll taxes, etc.) for associate veterinariansshould not exceed a common industry benchmark of 25% of collected gross revenue production. Whenequine practice owners determine starting salariesfor new graduate associates, they must determinehow much of their prot they are able and willing toinvest in mentoring these young veterinarians dur-ing that period until they can become self supportingwithin the practice. Respondents' median personal gross revenue from production, in general, consistently increased asthe number of veterinarians in a practice increaseduntil reaching a three-full time equivalent (FTE)veterinarian practice. American Association ofEquine Practitioner (AAEP) respondents in a one-veterinarian practice with no support staff reportedproducing a median of $205,000 in gross revenue.Those in a one-veterinarian practice with supportstaff produced a median of $330,000, and those in aveterinary practice of two FTE veterinarians pro-duced a median of $400,000. The general trendamong AAEP respondents was that the larger thepractice size, the higher the number of respondentswho produced revenue of more than $300,000. Agreater percent of respondents from ve- and six-doctor practices earned revenue of more than$500,000 than did those from four-doctor andsmaller practices. The median personal gross rev-enue from production for Equine practice ownerrespondents was $385,832 with annual com-pensation of $118,000 equating to 30.6% of produc-tion; and, meanannual income of $78,000 equating to 22.0% of pro-duction revenue. It is important to note that in-cluded in the Equine practice owner compensationmay be compensation for ownership making thecomparison of percent of production inaccurate.For AVMA respondents, the median personal grossrevenue from production was $500,000 for ownersand $450,000 for associates. The higher the median personal gross revenue of production reported by Equine and AVMA respon-dents, the higher the income bracket a respondentreported (Table 2). Overall, Equine or AVMA respondents who brought more revenue into the practice reported higher trendsin personal take-home income (Fig. 3). The data report that, on average, Equine male respondents add an additional $477,929 to revenuewhile Equine female respondents add an additional$346,638; this disparity may also be influencing thegender wage gap identied. However, it is criticalto note that the average age of male vs female re-spondents is 55 years versus 39 years, respectively,and so the average revenue increase is likely beinginfluenced by experience, clinical skills, and clienttrust gained over time. If a new graduate was able to bring in personal gross service revenue from production of $200,000 in theirrst year of employment after internship, the Equinefemale respondent's average salary of $51,109 wouldrepresent 25.5% of revenue, without consideringTable 1.

The Equine male respondent's average starting salary of $61,810would represent 30.9% of production before consider-ing other relevant expenses. 8. Conclusions The method of determining compensation (salary,base salary with production, or other) is often basedon incentives, cash flow, risk tolerance, etc., butultimately the nal compensation is determined bythe basic tenants of business: Supply and demand of veterinarians (gradu- ates, geography, discipline, gender) Client demand (revenue production) Fees and practice business models determinerevenue production and expenditures (staff compensation) Accounting allocation of expenses (compensa- tion vs return of investment) Demonstration of hands- on clinical and com- munication experience skills that impact casemanagement decision making and client ac-ceptance of equine veterinarians. To conclude, the AVMA-AAEP Equine Economic Survey provides us with useful nancial informationfrom which to assess compensation and benetsmodels currently in use with an eye to impacting thefuture of our profession and the scal survival ofequine veterinarians and practices.Table 2.

Preamble It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incre-dulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season ofDarkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winterof despair... (A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens, 1859). 2. Introduction Pinballing between hope and despair, wisdom andfoolishness is a reasonable description of equine or-thopedics. If you ever need to be reminded abouthow old you are, become a professor or be asked togive a talk like this. Perhaps both. Making a con-certed effort to think historically within your owndiscipline is more difcult than ruminating aboutart or civilization. One's initial response is to de-claim in detail how amazingly different things were\"back then\" but really 1979 was exactly like 2019.We thought we knew what we were doing andthought we were pretty good at it. We were not.We are better but still are not as good as we shouldbe. There were then, and now, na\u00efve, idealistic,young veterinarians going out into the world wellconvinced that they will be able to do things better.I certainly hope some of them are at this meetingbecause they are correct. They will be better.I want to believe that no modern veterinarian will help foster the notion that the art and science of equinefracture treatment can be simply combined with thehistory of better rearms. Gary Larson ( The Far Side) cartoons do NOT reflect the reality of what we can do to save horses with fractures. (I was unable toobtain permission from Mr. Larson to print, but thecartoon is \"Horse Hospital,\" showing attending white-coated veterinarians in a horse ward with their pre-ferred surgical instrument: a shotgun.) Having said that, it is clear that our signicant advancements over the last 50 years or so still leaveus with many dead or disabled horses. Why? Horses are not humans and they most certainly are not dogs. Every member of this audience hasspent their professional life both dealing with thisreality as well as doing their best to explain it toothers. Horses are big. Make that really big.Horses develop laminitis. Horses have disturb-ingly little soft tissue covering their most vulnerableskeletal elements. Perhaps most importantly,horses usually have demanding jobs. Unlike(some, not all!) smaller pets, uselessness is not gen- erally recognized as a good characteristic in a horse. Horses are NOT somehow inept at healing. They are NOT some biological mist in the big scheme ofnatural selection. The reality is that quite a fewhorses with orthopedic problems could adequately 86 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE NOTESheal their injuries if we didn't have demands for performance or wildly disparate opinions abouttheir comfort/suffering. There is little question that the option, accep- tance, and ease of euthanasia combined with theexpense and practical difculty of treating injuredhorses have thwarted more rapid advances in oureld. Just think of our options for internal xation.For many decades, we have adapted to using humanmetal implants. Plates and screws designed andsold to humans ONLY with the legal (small print)warning that the implants are more likely to fail ifused in overweight, overactive, or mentally ill peo-ple. That IS the denition of our patients; justsquare it! Fortunately, for the great majority ofequine fractures, the human implants are ade-quately suited. It is fortunate that is the case be-cause the miniscule size of the equine marketassures that no one is going to get wealthy any timesoon developing equine-specic bone implants formajor fracture repair. That is another problemthat our profession faces. There are not enough ofthem repaired. No one (I mean NO one) getsenough practice to be as good as they could be atrepairing equine fractures. There are reportedlyabout 9 million horses in the United States. That isroughly the number of people living in New YorkCity. Of those 9 million, one could easily guess thatless than 10% are even close to being prized highlyenough in terms of true monetary value to justifythe repair of a serious fracture. That gets us downto a number approximating Columbus, Ohio. Ofthose, the number suffering orthopedic injuries re-quiring surgical treatment is an even smaller town.How many of those badly injured horses have anowner who wants a horse that is not going to beusefully sound? Of that subset, how many of thoseowners have the nancial means to pay what isneeded to \"save\" a horse that will be permanentlyretired? We are getting down to a village. Theend result is starkly apparent, only a small fractionof horses with repairable orthopedic injuries end upbeing treated and then equine surgeons are under-standably inexperienced and often inadequatelyequipped. One consequence of our current situation is that equine orthopedists have developed their own set ofstandards for internal xation of fractures that ful-lls more stringent demands. We always aspire toreturn to perfect function. There is no questionthat internal xation of fractures in humans is fre-quently done to improve function but a muchbroader view can be taken in the human. Howmany of us were going to be euthanized by ourparents if we didn't make the high school varsitybasketball team? What does our profession need to do to leave the Gary Larson cartoon paradigm behind? Tryharder. Get better. Become more honest. Edu-cate better and be a bit more defensive of our pro-fession. I would love to go to my grave after havingone (perhaps two) martinis at a cocktail party where I don't have to listen to someone say a horse was putdown because \"there was nothing the vet could do\"when the unequivocal truth was that they (the own-ers) were unwilling or unable to spend the moneyto try. Or, that a horse had to be euthanized be- cause it would be unfair to the horse to make itsuffer. Do notmisinterpret this statement. There absolutely arecases and will continue to be cases that we cannot humanely manage. At the sametime we must be honest, can we also not be curious,ambitious, striving? Be willing to fail. Don't em-brace failure but denitely do not dread it. Weshould instead dread the avoidance of failure by noteven making an effort. It is certainly the case thatnothaving euthanasia as an option has helped ad- vance human medicine. Desperation can motivate creativity. How can we improve both our image and our re- ality as equine veterinarians when it comes to mus-culoskeletal injuries? 3. Start at the Beginning The principles of emergency treatment of fractureshas been presented in this forum and others onmany occasions as well as in print. 1,2First aid of a fracture does indeed involve knowing how to prop- erly apply coaptation that will prevent further in-jury, how to prepare a horse to ship to a hospital,how to sedate, etc., but the truth is that the rst \"First Aid\" is knowledge. Our profession will neverreach its potential if our rst instinct is to always take the easiest option. It is unequivocally truethat there are still many fractures that cannot besuccessfully treated, especially in adult horses, butwe have decreased the proportion of cases in thatcategory and we can do more. What no one can dois bring a horse back to life that has been eutha-nized. Make sure you know what is possible and areasonable notion about how much it costs. Makefewer assumptions. Genuine emergencies are genuinely stress- ful! No one can argue that point but clients rely ontheir veterinarian not only to deal with the situationbut also help them make the best decision. Thebiggest mistake to be made by an attending veteri-narian is acting without appropriate knowledge.A rush to euthanasia is certainly indicated in terri-bly catastrophic injuries but euthanasia is excep-tionally difcult to reverse so it should not be doneimmediately if you are even slightly uncertain aboutthe \"xable\" nature of the injury. The reality isthat many severe lacerations and orthopedic inju-ries appear to be far worse than they are. An ex-cellent example is a shattered middle phalanx; theylook terrifyingly \"bad\" but the great majority are notjust salvageable but most become extremely com-fortable (a minority are usefully/athletically sound)with current surgical techniques. In today's infor-mation-rich world, it is both possible and undesir-able to have an owner nd out after a horse has been AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 87FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREeuthanized that there have been other horses with the same injury successfully treated. Be wary ofoffering a prognosis unless you really doknow a lot about that specic injury. Have a good relationship(more importantly, their cell phone number ...) withan expert (or experts) you trust to provide an accu-rate second opinion. With proper sedation and sim-ple emergency bandaging, a large proportion of\"catastrophes\" can be humanely managed until athoughtful decision has been made. 4. Errors with Splinted Coaptation Perhaps the most critical determinant of the out-come for a horse with an extremely unstable injuryof the distal limb (radius/tibia down to the hoof) iswhether or not the skin remains intact and howmuch soft tissue and further bone injury occurs priorto surgical treatment. Proper splinting duringtransportation may well be a life-saving procedure.Having some appropriate materials immediatelyavailable can make all the difference. The mostversatile and inexpensive material remains thick-walled PVC pipe ( /H110116-inch diameter) cut into staves of appropriate curvature and length. The PVC canbe readily cut to length with just about any type ofsaw in a eld situation. It is strong, light weight,and the curvature of variously cut 6-inch pipe staveswill generally t a reasonably padded bandage.Other materials (electrical conduit, rebar, strongenough/light enough wood, thermoplastics, moldedberglass cast tape) can be used but for ease of useand price, the simple PVC pipe staves are difcult tobeat. Good recommendations for the selection and ap- plication of splints have been published. 1,2An ex - cellent online graphical reference can be found atthe following link: https://www.acvs.org/sites/default/les/les/EQ_Frac_SplintingChart.pdf. A more text-based online resource can be found at http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/emergency_medicine_and_critical_ care/equine_emergency_ medicine/equine_trauma_and_rst_aid.html. The most common errors with a splinted bandage are below: Placing too heavy a bandage. This adds weight to the limb and makes it more awkwardfor the horse to move. Use just enough pad-ding to allow a tightly wrapped bandage to beprotective without acting as a tourni-quet. The outdated concept that a RobertJones Bandage needs to be 3-5 /H11003the diameter of the limb is not sound, especially whensplints are used. The mechanical value of asplint is diminished the farther it is placedaway from the limb. If you use splints, makethe bandage light enough to get the splintscloser to the skin. This is an important prin-ciple that does not always seem to be intuitive. Using elastic tape for attaching splints will nearly always result in the splint shifting/slip-ping. Both elastic adhesive (e.g., Elastikon) or self adhesive (Vetrap), bandage material isgood for the bandage itself but splints shouldbe securely attached with NON-elastic mate-rial such as duct tape or packing tape. Ifmultiple staves are placed around the limb,metal hose clamps can compress the splintsagainst the padded bandage and hold themin alignment. Incorrect length of a splint may lead to more harm than good. If possible, it is still a goodprinciple to stabilize a joint above and a jointbelow the injury. The most common error forcannon bone, carpal, tarsal, radial, and tibialfractures are the use of splints that do notreach the ground. If they do not, motion andgravity tend to allow them to slide down. Splinting the incorrect side of the lower limb can be avoided if you remember to apply atleast one of your splints to the convex or \"open\" side of the injury (i.e., if the horse's fetlock isdeviated laterally [valgus], place at least onesplint medial side and incorporate thefoot.) For severe carpal/tarsal, radial and tib-ial fractures always have the splint in contactwith the shoulder/pelvis. An excessively heavy splint (e.g., 2 /H110034 lum- ber) will often make the limb more cumber-some and possibly serve to worsen thesituation. Do your best to get appropriatematerial. In severe lower-limb injuries (e.g., traumatic disruptions of the suspensory apparatus, com-minuted phalangeal fractures), use the splintto hold the \"stacked\" as well aspossible. A Kimzey LegSaver splint is easiestif you have it but a simple dorsal PVC splintover a light bandage with the heel taped up toit will work well. Pulling/holding the heel upwith the metacarpus and phalanges alignedsimulates the position of the Kimzey and isquick and practical. Another major error to avoid is failure to splint the carpus of a horse with a fracturedulna. Splinting for radial and tibial fractureswill afford modest stability and only slightlyrelieve anxiety but a horse with a properlysplinted ulnar fracture will immediately relaxand be able to maneuver itself with somecondence. 5. Transportation Errors Clients often make serious errors when shipping aninjured horse. The foremost error, by far ,i sm a d e with the best of intentions. The owner/trainer/trucker insists that the injured horse be given \"asmuch room as possible\" in the trailer/van. The sit-uation is not like airline seating; more room is notbetter. Make sure the horse is shipped in as tight acondition as it can be placed. Nearly every adulthorse will be able to protect its injured limb opti- 88 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREmally if it can lean its body/shoulder/pelvis against rm support (trailer wall/partition). The other major shipping error is often made with foal fractures. Foals get tired quickly when theyare stressed and balancing on three limbs. Placean intravenous catheter. Take the time to get thefoal in recumbency on the trailer and, if at all pos-sible, keep an attendant armed with drugs with thefoal to maintain it in recumbency during shipping.This is especially important in more proximal frac-tures that are difcult to stabilize with a splintedbandage (e.g., radius and tibia). Protect the eyes ofany recumbent foal/horse during transport. If possible, ship the horse with the injured limb closest to the rear of the trailer/van. Smooth accel-eration (loading the south end of a horse headednorth) is easy. Smooth braking is not alwayspossible. 6. Errors in Wound Management Wound management is usually very difcult in aseriously injured horse. If you have a truly severefracture that will require emergency surgery it willbe nearly impossible to do a meaningful debride-ment in a eld situation. Valuable time and re-sources will be spent attempting something that willneed to be repeated. It is probably wiser in suchinstances to wrap the site up in an antiseptic-soakedgauze (if anatomically feasible) and ship to a referralfacility as quickly as possible. Broad-spectrum an-timicrobials should be administered intravenously ifa wound of any kind is evident in a horse with asuspected fracture. 7. Pain Management/Sedation Every horse with any type of serious injury shouldprobably be given a fully therapeutic dose of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (e.g., phenylbuta-zone/flunixin). A horse is very unlikely to haveenough pain relief from such drugs that it will sig-nicantly worsen the injury. It is impossible to be purely prescriptive about sedation but the general principle should be to giveenough sedation to get the job done (bandage, splint,wound care, loading, shipping) but not enough tomake them unstable enough to slip or fall. BUT ... the most important element in rst aid is making an informed decision before taking an irre-vocable action. What does the Taijitu (\"yin-yang symbol\"; Fig. 1) have to do with fractures in horses? It is to remindone that a philosophical harmony is essential forsuccess. Mechanics and Biology. Think of the yinand yang as these two antagonistic forces compris-ing the whole when we attempt to manage a frac-ture. If you rip apart a limb in order tometiculously reconstruct a fracture with implantsthat you are sure will provide maximum stability/strength, a nearly inevitable consequence is that thebad biology of that approach will result in failure(infection, incisional problems, avascularity, poor/slow healing). If you go all out to minimize com- promise of the \"normal\" biology but fail to provideadequate mechanical stability, the horse will usu-ally remain painful, the anatomy is not restored,function is lost, skeletal alignment is skewed, thecontralateral limb is deformed and, in the horse,there is always the lurking specter of laminitis.The bottom line in equine orthopedics is that thereare many converging paths to failure. Modern orthopedic surgery must seek a harmony of Mechanics and Biology. What are some ways wecan do this? 1. Do our best to limit tissue damage caused by the surgical approach. 2. Do our best to be accurate with all internal xation. Accurate placement of implants op-timizes the mechanics of the reconstructedfracture. Proper pre- and intra-operative im-aging is paramount. 3. Use (and develop!) better fracture xation de- vices and techniques. Just because some-thing worked \"well enough\" 20 years ago doesnot make it state of the art. 4. Be open to change in order to achieve this harmony. The concept of limiting the damage of a surgical approach has evolved so far in joint surgery that it isnow forgotten how revolutionary arthroscopy hasbeen in equine orthopedics. A tool that was ini-tially used as \"I'll take a look with this scope andthen open it up the way we always did,\" is now usedas the denitive means of managing nearly any frac-ture involving a joint. The continued evolution offracture repair will certainly involve the develop-ment of less and less invasive means of both manip-ulation and reduction of fractures as well as theinternal xation of fractures. We are only in theearliest and crudest stages of this process with lim-ited ability to apply principles of less invasivetechniques. ACCURACY Demands Guidance When we consider any fracture involving a joint, thesingle most important element providing long-termsuccess is perfect reconstruction of the joint surface. Fig. 1. Taijitu (\"yin-yang symbol). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 89FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURESimply getting the fracture fragments together well enough that the bone can heal is not going to beoptimal, especially in high motion joints like thefetlock and carpus. Bone wants to heal. Cartilagewants nothing to do with healing. Articular sur-faces that are not properly aligned will inevitablydegrade resulting in progressive osteoarthritis.This imperative of reconstruction is so strong thatour instinct as surgeons is to take it apart wellenough, see it well enough and be able to manipulateit well enough that we can put it back together withlag screws. Unfortunately, that is often bad biol-ogy. Even the best healing cannot always over-come the consequences of a vigorous \"taking apart.\" Arthroscopic Guidance Fortunately, nearly all joint surgery in horses is nowdone with good biology (i.e., arthroscopy) and thatgives us a chance at harmony. The most commonexamples are condylar fractures, carpal slab frac-tures, and mid-body sesamoid fractures, but anyendoscopically visible fracture is a candidate for abetter biological approach to a mechanical repair.The principles remain the same for all accessiblearticular fractures 3: Put the scope in a position that allows optimal viewing without compromising the approachfor internal xation. This sounds obvious butrequires some decision making. For example, it is much easier to reduce a condylar fracture with the scope in the proxi-mal dorsal joint pouch because the joint can beplaced in It is much easier torepair medial sagittal third carpal slab frac-ture with the scope positioned laterally so thatyou have adequate distance between the frac-ture and the scope. For any displaced articular fracture, use ar- throscopic and radiographic imaging to accu-rately place the glide hole (\"near side\" of thefragment). Drill precisely to the fractureplane with the glide hole. Do not reducethe fracture before drilling the glide hole be-cause it will be more difcult to be certain thatyou are precisely through the near fragment. With displaced fractures, use the centering sleeve and a pin in the glide hole as a \"handle\"to manipulate the fracture fragment into per-fect reduction. Hold the reduction withclamps (or perhaps ngers) and then drill the thread hole in the far side of the frag- ment. This should result in optimal anatomicreconstruction of the joint surface as the lagscrew is tightened. Radiographic/Fluoroscopic Guidance No equine surgeon on the planet disagrees with thisin concept but there is often a tendency in our hu-man nature to cut corners/save a bit of time/becomejust a bit overcondent. It is important for a sur-geon to always concentrate on \"what could be wrong?\" rather than simply visualizing what theythink things should look like. Adequate intra- operative imaging is a basic requirement of orthope-dic surgery and essential to achieving accurate re-duction and implant placement. Saving a fewminutes and a few rems will eventually result in anerror that could have been avoided. It will stillhappen to every surgeon but actively considering thepossibility that you could be wrong will prevent youfrom actually being wrong! CT-Guidance In terms of accuracy in fracture xation, computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard. Although itis still largely an impractical (and economically dif-cult to justify) standard to use in every case, withinthe next 10 years, both pre-operative and intra-op-erative CT will become far more common in equinesurgery. The adoption/implementation of CT maynot be quite as rapid and complete as the shift fromlm to digital radiography but it will become anexpected feature of a completely equipped equinesurgical facility. CT is especially valuable in com-plex fractures that are difcult to \"gure out\" fromstandard lms (e.g., comminuted P1), fractures thatdo not allow adequate fluoroscopic projections thatcan assure accurate screw placement (e.g., tarsalslab fractures) and bones with a complete lack ofdirect exposure (P3 and navicular). Our most highly specic experiences with CT- guided xations are probably within the hoof 4but the same principles apply when using the CT for intra-operative guidance in other types of fracturesor arthrodeses. Use a skin marker to help denethe intended site of implant insertion. Use a skinmarker on the extended line for the drill bit. Takepost-insertion CT to further check placement. Top-ical markers are really only valuable if you can trulytrust them. CT assistance is certainly not \"essential\" for most fractures but it provides one more level of guidanceto help assure accurate xations. Although themachine we have used in these cases ahas limita - tions because of its size, the portability of the unit,and its speed make it very practical for intra-oper-ative use in the distal limb of horses. Accessibilityof intra-operative CT imaging will inevitably becomethe accepted standard for a hospital doing anythingother than the simplest internal xations. Theprice, size, and mobility of 3-dimensional imagingwill eventually change enough to allow this. Evennow, the advantages are becoming more evident atthe same time that rapid changes in technology areevolving. Some key points about CT-assisted internal xa- tion (Figs. 2-4): 1. Try to get your radio-opaque skin markers as perfect as possible. It is better not to have tomake adjustments. If you scan selectively, it 90 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREusually saves surgical time if you get the markers exactly where you want them. 2. Skin markers are more reliable in locations with minimal overlying soft tissue or tissuethat does not move relative to the underlyingbone, i.e., the hoof. 3. Place markers on the projected \"exit\" site of your drill (i.e., where the drill would comethrough the skin on the far side of thebone). This greatly helps your aim and isparticularly critical if you are using an aimingdevice in a small target (e.g., the navicularbone or a smaller P3 wing fracture). 4. If in doubt on really difcult fractures, take intra-operative CT images. Plan your posi-tioning and draping to allow this wheneverpossible. 5. Use fluoroscopy or digital radiography when possible to check the length of glide holes. Mea-surement off the CT is very accurate but not foolproof. Accuracy is everything if you have a fracture that is complex enough that \"simple\" perpendicular screwpositioning is inadequate, especially if the fracture can be put back together well enough to allow loadsharing. In horses, the concept of load sharing isalways critical. If the horse's bone can be put backtogether well enough that the fractured bone andthe metal implants are sharing the load, the chancesfor success are much higher and the horse can betaken out of its cast (always a potential cause ofmorbidity) sooner. Many comminuted fracturesare so difcult to \"gure out\" from plain radiographsthat a vigorous open approach for internal xationwas used for many years but many can now be donevery accurately with minimally invasive reduction Fig. 2.

G, In larger fractures, two screws can provide additional compression androtational stability. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 LECTUREand screw placement if intra-operative CT imaging is available (Fig. 5). Another excellent example of the value of CT in surgery is a comminuted middle phalanx (P2) frac-ture. Comminuted fractures of the middle phalanx(P2) occur in all breeds of horses doing all types ofactivities. Most occur as accidents/missteps inhorses running at speed. In the western UnitedStates, barrel-racing, cutting, and other quick-turnevents are often involved, but in my part of theUnited States, they often occur in horses beinglonged, turned out in an indoor arena, slipping onice, or simply having some other sort of pastureaccident. We also see occasional shattered P2 frac-tures in racehorses. In my personal experience,longing in an indoor arena with modern footing ap-pears to be a surprisingly common history. Similar to the situation in comminuted P1 frac- tures, there are some fractures that are simply tooseverely shattered to consider repair and externalskeletal xation techniques are the best option. If there is a chance to reasonably reconstruct thebone, however, reconstruction combined with an ar-throdesis of the proximal interphalangeal joint has amuch better chance of ending up with a comfortable Fig. 3.

In my opinion, the best current surgical technique is the combined use of interfragmentaryand transarticular lag screws with two dorsally po-sitioned locking plates. This is an example of asurgery that canbe done successfully without CT but is made much easier with the 3-dimensional imaging (Fig. 6). This is also an excellent exampleof a fracture that supercially appears to be almostirreparable but in fact, we should be able to tell anowner that they could expect more than 90% oftreated horses to heal and be comfortable. A much smaller proportion will be athletically sound. Superior Implants The use of bone plates for repair of major fracturesand arthrodeses in horses have been accepted as thestrongest and most versatile general techniqueavailable for many decades now. A major advancein bone plate design and application, the lockingplate, made over 15 years ago has allowed equine Fig. 5.

PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 93FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREsurgeons to achieve a better harmony of mechanics and biology. The original concept of bone plating is intuitive. A surgeon takes a strong, but contourable, piece ofbiocompatible metal, puts some holes in a flattenedpiece of it, and attaches it to the outside of the bonewith screws made of the same metal. When thescrews are tightened, the plate is compressed to the surface of the bone to create friction between theunderside of the plate and the bone. If the strengthof the plate and screws balance with the integrity ofthe bone AND, most importantly, the forces on theentire construct are modest enough, the bone frag-ments remain in apposition well enough to allowhealing in the desired anatomic reduction. Manyhorses have been saved with this traditional ap-proach to bone plating but many attempts havefailed. Horses, even foals, apply enormous loads tothe repaired fracture site and if those forces ofweight bearing overcome the frictional forces of theplated bone, some degree of instability will ensue.Although rigid stability is NOT necessary (or trulyeven desirable) for the biology of fracture healing,stability IS required for ourpatients to stand and walk comfortably. Normal fracture healing isclearly inferior when there is too much rigidity so inhuman patients there has been a burgeoning em-phasis on LESS stable xations as well as manage-ment techniques that allow alteration indeformation (strain) at the fracture site as it heals.We do not have that luxury in horses because wehave so few tools to control their use of the fracturedlimb. Balancing biology and mechanics becomesabsolutely essential to our equine patients but oursolutions must be very different. Locking bone plates are mechanically different. The plate's function is not dependent upon its com-pression to the bone surface. The head of the screwhas threads that lock into the plate itself. Thisresults in a rigid angle between the plate and thescrew and that in turn results in more stability ofthe fracture fragments. The mechanical function ofan external xator or pin-cast is in-stantly recognizable; the transverse pin engages thebone and is securely xed to a rigid element on theoutside of the limb (side-bars or a cast). Weightbearing forces are then transferred to the pins andexternal supports. The locking plate is essentiallyfunctioning as an internal ex-x. The locked screws are like half-pins and the plate is like theside-bar. The advantages, of course, are that ev-erything is under the skin, theoretically sterile andvery close to the surface of the bone. The plate(\"side-bar\") being close to the bone enormously en-hances the strength of the construct. The overalladvantages of locking plates have caused most sur-geons to much prefer their use for the great majorityof fractures. 5-12 Because the locking plate does not have to be in perfect apposition to the bone surface, it allows anentirely different approach to certain fractures.Plates can be placed in a more biologically friendlymanner (i.e., with minimal disruption of the fractureor arthrodesis site). An extraperiosteal \"tunnel\"can be made with a simple device (Fig. 7, E-J, Fig. 8)and the locking plate slid into place under the skin.The screws are then inserted through stab incisions.This technique is absolutely NOT feasible in many Fig. 6. A, This is a common complex conguration seen in com- minuted middle phalanx fractures involving both interphalan-geal joint surfaces. B, Even with an aggressive open approachthat fully exposes the proximal surface of the fracture, it isimpossible to have the understanding of the fracture afforded bya CT. C, Excellent accuracy of the implants is possible becausethe surgeon can plan exactly where screws should beplaced. The planned glide holes are in red and the thread holesin yellow. D, Post-operative radiographs were taken throughthe cast but the stability is such that the cast can be removedrelatively quickly, /H110114 weeks in this case. E, Three-month post- operative radiographs. The fracture and the fusion are welladvanced. 94 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREcomplex and badly displaced fractures nor in ana- tomical locations with extensive muscle coveragebut it is a step toward harmonizing biology andmechanics. Two examples of its practical the most common reason to plate a cannonbone, the minimal soft tissues allow us to use min-imally invasive plate placement for more complexfractures and arthrodeses (Fig. 7, E-J).Medial Condylar Fractures Fractures propagating proximally from the medial condyle are very different from those arising in the lateral condyle. Medial fractures, unlike their lat- eral counterpart, rarely course toward the near cor-tex. Instead, the fractures split the bone verticallyonly to radiographically disappear in the diaphysisOR they spiral more denably up the limb. Either conguration has a high risk of catastrophic failure. Fig. 7. A, Plate passing device with handle and contourable end-sharpened blade. B, In the metacarpus or metatarsus, a 2.5-3-cm incision is made distally and the plate thrust to create a tunnel outside of the periosteum and under the tendons. C, A broad lockingplate is easily slid and positioned. It is contoured with the assistance of radiographic imaging. D, The screws are inserted throughindividual stab incisions. E-J, Examples of cases repaired with minimally invasive plate placement. E, Routine spiraling medialcondylar fracture. F, Severely comminuted foal metatarsal adult fracture. Partialcarpal in pregnant of these fractures is espe- cially probable when the affected cannon bone is in ahindlimb. There are many options for treating these injuries including lag screw xation of the visible portion ofthe fracture only, open application of a combinationof lag screws and plate. Special anesthetic recov-ery systems such as a pool system or sling are in-valuable but fractures can occur up to a few weeksafter lag screw xation. Plate xation has there-fore become a more standard treatment. Becausethese fractures are not displaced, a minimally inva-sive approach can be used to place the plate. Thehorse is placed with the affected limb uppermost.First, two cortical screws are placed in lag fashionacross the condyle using routine technique. The screws are placed from lateral to medial even thoughthe smaller portion of the fracture is medial. Thisis not a mechanical problem because the bone of thedistal cannon bone is extremely dense and the me-dial fragment is large enough to provide adequatestrength. The \"normal\" direction of screws is re-versed because the plate is placed lateral. Lateralplacement is strongly recommended because theplates are removed with the horse standing. A2-cm skin incision is made between the extensortendons on the proximal cannon bone. A plate-passing device was made by attaching a handle to apiece of stainless steel with similar dimensions of abroad plate. The end of the device is sharpened to Fig. 8. Plain radiographs and CT images of a comminuted carpal fracture. Triple plating using a minimally invasive technique allowed management without a cast. The carpus is cosmetic and solidly fused within a few months. 96 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREallow it to be pushed into position. This is placed in the small incision and thrust under the skin to makea tunnel. The plate position could potentially besubperiosteal but we have opted to place them ex-traperiosteally. Extraperiosteal placement of stan-dard (non-locking) plates has some disadvantages interms of the contact between plate and bone but ithas not yet proven to be a problem. After the sub-cutaneous tunnel is made, a roughly contoured10/11 (MC3) or 12/13 (MT3) hole locking broad plateis slid down into it. The \"t\" of the plate is assessedpalpably and with fluoroscopy. The plate is recon-toured as needed and replaced. The holes in theplate can be easily palpated distally. Stab incisionsare made over holes and screws inserted routinely.After two screws are inserted, a plate of the samelength is placed on the surface of the skin and inci-sion made through that plate's holes. The remain-ing screws are inserted. The distal one or twoscrews in the plate are placed in lag fashion if thefracture plane is radiographically visible at thatlevel. Fluoroscopy is used to check implant posi-tioning. One or two skin sutures are used for eachstab. Specic cautions with this technique include the need to avoid the contralateral splint bone with bitsand screws, the difculty in accurately measuringthe depth of holes and the need to check carefullythat each screw is fully inserted into the plate. The plate is removed about 3-4 months following implantation. The horse should be walking at least30 minutes twice daily for a month prior to removal.Sedation with detomidine is usually adequate.Local anesthesia with direct inltration over theimplant or by means of a regional nerve block isdone and a short incision made over the proximal 2cm of the plate. The most proximal screw is par-tially removed. A matching plate is placed on theskin and stab incisions made through its holes.Each screw is backed out above the skin edge.A battery-powered drill with the screwdriver attach-ment is quieter and easier to use in a standing horse.After the screws are all counted, they are removed.(It is a very bad idea to try to remove the plate if oneof the screws is still in it!) The plate is pried up atits proximal end, grasped with vise grips and ex-tracted proximally. If there are no complicatingfactors, the horse is walked for about 30 days withpaddock exercise added for another 30 days andthen started back gradually in work under tack. Carpal Arthrodesis Partial carpal arthrodesis (surgical fusion of themiddle carpal/carpometacarpal joints or just the an-tebrachiocarpal joint) or pancarpal (fusion of theentire carpus) is the best current option to managesevere carpal deformities and otherwise irreparablecarpal fractures. These have historically beenchallenging surgeries because the individual carpalbones are small and difcult to stabilize with tradi-tional plates. With pancarpal arthrodeses, ade-quate stability was mostly achieved by placing two very long plates with multiple screws extending intothe radial and metacarpal diaphyses. 13,14Al- though there certainly have been several cases suc-cessfully managed with vigorous open approachesand traditional plate, the enormous surgical expo-sure and lack of consistently stable xation resultedin many complications (infection and contralaterallimb laminitis) and inherent risk of diaphyseal frac-ture (especially in the radius) because of the stressesapplied with the long moment arm created by span-ning the carpus. A minimally invasive techniquewith three short locking plates can safely allow moreimplants stabilizing the carpal bones and lessen theleverage effect of a long plate 11(Fig. 7). Smaller incisions combined with the greater stability af- forded by three locking implants also minimizes thetime spent in a full limb or long sleeve cast. Mini-mally invasive techniques, in theory, should lessenthe number of surgical site infections but far morecases are needed to validate this notion. We cer-tainly have no denitive proof now of this claim butthe technique to date appears to be robust. Cervical Spine Fractures of the axial skeleton in the horse can be anextraordinary challenges because of the difcult(deep!) approach, limited anatomic options for im- plant placement, enormous blood vessels and arather important structure called the spinal cordthat bears no abuse. Although traditional platinghas had some success, there is no question that theadvantages afforded by the xed angle stability oflocking plates has made cervical fracture repairmore successful (Fig. 9). Although the basket tech-nique has been the more popular and proven tech-nique for fusion of intervertebral spaces in wobblers,locked plating techniques have also be used withsimilar success (but far fewer numbers to date). 15,16 Although we currently use \"standard\" instrumen- tation and implants for equine cervical surgery,custom implants using 3-D titanium printing tech-nologies could be the next advance. Supraglenoid Tubercle Fractures Another excellent example of improving both thebiology and the mechanics of a repair is a fracture ofthe supraglenoid tubercle (SGT) fracture of the scap-ula. This fracture occurs in all breeds of horses,most commonly in yearlings but can be seen in foalsand older horses as well. It is also a good exampleof the evolution of surgical thinking over time.The rst response for treatment for almost allequine fractures was historically rest. Unfortu-nately, the SGT fracture is one of the worst candi-dates for rest because the pull of the massivelystrong biceps brachii on the SGT results in furtherdisplacement and consistently poor healing. Thenext logical step is to surgically excise the fracturefragment and see how the horse does. 17Interest - ingly, enough horses did well enough following sim- PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 97FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREple removal that this remained a popular option for many years. The SGT is a big piece of bone, is theorigin of the biceps, and removal structurally com-promises the shoulder in most cases so it seemedclear that some effort should be made to restore theanatomy with internal xation. Simple lag screwxation, however, is anything but simple in thislocation. First, \"simply\" inserting the screws in asagittal direction (i.e., perpendicular to the fractureplane), is technically challenging because of theanatomy (heavy shoulder musculature). The sur-geon has to get the drill bit cranially positioned withthe drill almost flat up against the cranial shouldermusculature at the same time he/she is aiming to-ward a very narrow target (the scapular neck).More importantly, the force vector of the bicepsbrachii is close enough to parallel with a lag screwused to repair the fracture that the screw will bepulled out of the bone so some form of tension bandrepair is necessary. 18That is a difcult enough surgery that the alternative option of transecting the biceps tendon to eliminate the avulsing force hasbeen advocated and used with success. 19Still, nei - ther removal of a major boney structure nor tran-section of a major tendon seem like they will yieldthe harmony we seek. The combination of the dy-namic compression option of the locking compres-sion plate (LCP) and the locking screws making axed 90\u00b0 angle provide a much easier biological ap- proach and a superior mechanical solution 20(Fig. 10). A smaller surgical approach can be made di- rectly over the fracture without making any effort toexpose the cranial aspect of the SGT. Dependingon the size of the patient, one or two 3- or 4-holenarrow LCPs are used. The cranial lockingscrew(s) in the plate are placed in the SGT fragmentand the fracture is reduced with ngers/pointedreduction clamps. The fracture is then further re-duced by using the self-compressing feature of theplate. A cortex screw is placed in the load positionin the combi-hole nearest the fracture. Tighteningthat screw slides the plate caudally and compressesthe fracture. The remaining hole in the parentscapular neck is lled with a locked screw. Therelative simplicity of this surgery is afforded bythe opportunity to drill directly \"downward\" in-stead of having to aim the drill \"front to back\" intothe narrow scapular neck. The strength of the LCP is perpendicular tothe avulsing vector so it is stable. One of theother potential complications with this fractureand its repair is damage to the suprascapularnerve. This approach and repair allows readyassessment and avoidance of the structure. Im-provement in the surgical treatment of a SGTfracture over the last 30 years is an excellent Fig. 9.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREexample of surgical evolution, what we recognize as progress in equine surgery. The surgical management of equine fractures has evolved considerably over the last several decadesbut, even with that long perspective, it is evidentalmost daily that we need to do better in every facetof our efforts. But ... it is very evident that thereare two immense be tes noires we recognize in equine orthopedics: infection and laminitis. Infection As much as I would love to claim that it is thepatient's \"fault,\" horses are probably no differentthan other species when it comes to their host de-fense mechanisms. Having said that, the incidenceof surgical-site infection in major orthopedic proce-dures in horses has been unacceptably high for along time. 21There are legitimate reasons that help explain this: 1. We use a LOT of metal and the more foreign material there is at a surgical site, thegreater the chance of surgical-site infec-tion. If we don't use enough implants orstrong-enough implants to repair fractures,the xation is unstable. If a fracture xa- tion in a horse is unstable, the horse is usu-ally quite lame and if it is lame,contralateral limb laminitis or breakdownare common sequelae. 2. Because we perform complex repairs with a lot of metal AND we often seek optimal ana-tomic reduction, the incision is open for anundesirably long time. Although it can bedifcult to exactly \"prove,\" there is little doubtthat longer surgeries have a greater risk ofinfection. 3. A large proportion of our equine fractures oc- cur either where vascularity and soft tissuecoverage are very poor (mid-radius distallyand mid-tibia Lack of muscle andother rich sources of neovascularization slowshealing and increases risk. 4. Our patients are not all that clean and are not housed before or after surgery in truly \"clean\"environments. We are getting better but still cannot claim to be good. In a study w ithin our hospital, we have been able to cut the incidence of surgical site in- Fig. 10. Medial-lateral radiographs and intra-operative images of a displaced supraglenoid tubercle fracture. The surgical exposure is simple and the key advantage is the ease of positioning the plates laterally and drilling in a lateral to medial direction. Theself-compressing capacity of the plates is valuable to stabilize the fracture and the xed angle of the screw-plate prevents LECTUREfection in complex orthopedic cases incidence in half but it was still about 14%\u2014nothing to boastabout. 22Further improvements in less invasive approaches and methods of delivering local anti- microbials (coated implants, locally active biolog-ical products, more reliable vascular perfusiontechniques, novel anti-biolm approaches, etc.)will yield further improvements. Laminitis Concluding any discussion about major equine frac-tures with the topic of laminitis seems apt becausetoo many equine lives are still concluded due tolaminitis. The quality of ongoing study in the eldis high and I remain optimistic that more usefulmechanistic studies elucidating the pathophysiologyof supporting limb laminitis will give us some meansof preventing or mitigating this devastating compli-cation. Until we have more information; however,the single most important preventive measure is todo whatever it takes to have the horse move aroundas comfortably and normally as possible. We trulydo not know why some horses can be 3-legged formonths without even a hint of laminitis and othersdrop their cofn bones through their sole when theyare only moderately lame for a short time. Surgicaltechniques that restore satisfactory comfort andsupporting techniques that allow weight bearing re-lief (slings, etc.) remain our best hope to avoidlaminitis. Epilogue As noted earlier, progress in equine surgery can bedistressingly slow because there simply are notenough cases (a combination of potentially manage-able injury with nancial resources/motivation), notenough surgeons, and not enough commercial incen-tive to spur successful innovation as quickly as weall would like. But progress is inexorable and I am optimistic that management of equine fractures will continueto evolve such that the Gary Larson cartoon willhave no meaning to future generations.

Introduction Veterinarians frequently use controlled substances (CSs) during the performance of their work. Whetherused for sedation, anesthesia, euthanasia, or treat-ment of chronic medical conditions, controlled sub-stances are part of most practitioners' dailylife. Because of the ubiquitous nature of their use, itis easy to become casual or even cavalier about thesedrugs. However, there are signicant penalties forfailure to adhere to the comprehensive statutes re-garding CSs. This presentation will provide an over-view of the US Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA), and outline the importance of compliance, themost important areas of non-compliance for veterinarypractices, the best practices for meeting compliancerequirements, how to handle theft of CSs from yourpractice, what to do if the DEA arrives at your door,and resources available to assist you in compliance. 2. Overview of the DEA The DEA was established in 1973 to serve as theprimary federal agency responsible for the enforce-ment of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). TheCSA sets forth the federal law regarding both illicit and licit (pharmaceutical) CSs. With respect topharmaceutical CSs, the DEA's statutory responsi-bility is 2-fold: to prevent diversion and abuse ofthese drugs while also ensuring that an adequateand uninterrupted supply is available to meet legit-imate medical, scientic, and research needs. Incarrying out this mission, the DEA works in closecooperation with state and local authorities andother federal agencies. Following the regulationsof the CSA, the DEA is responsible for ensuringthat all controlled substance transactions take placewithin the \"closed system\" of distribution estab-lished by \"closed alllegitimate handlers of CSs\u2014manufacturers, distrib-utors, practitioners, pharmacies, and researchers\u2014must be registered with DEA and maintain strictaccounting for all distributions. 1 The DEA has 3 divisions: Enforcement, Intelli- gence, and Diversion. Usually if a practitioner getsin trouble it is a regulatory matter rather than acriminal prosecution. The Diversion division hasno criminal law enforcement power without calling AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 101THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES NOTESin the Enforcement division. If a practice is visited by the Diversion division, and any false informationis given, or they have reason to believe that fullcooperation is not being given, the Enforcement di-vision will be called. The CSA, 21 Unites States Code (USC) 801-890, and the DEA regulations, Title 21, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR), Parts 1300 to 1316 can be ac-cessed online. 2They provide for ve schedules of CSs. Substances are placed in their respective schedules based on whether they have a currentlyaccepted medical use in treatment and their relativeabuse potential and likelihood of causing depen-dence when abused. All drugs listed in Schedule Ihave no accepted medical use in treatment andtherefore may not be prescribed, administered, ordispensed for medical use. Schedule II substanceshave a high potential for abuse with severe psycho-logical or physical dependence. Examples of Sched-ule II substances include codeine,hydromorphone, meperidine, oxycodone, fentanyl,and pentobarbital. for abuse, and include ketamine andanabolic steroids, as well as some combination prod-ucts containing small amounts of the narcotics hy-drocodone and codeine. Substances in Schedule IVand V have a lower potential for abuse relative tosubstances in other schedules, and include such sub-stances as diazepam, midazolam, and preparationscontaining limited quantities of certain narcotic andstimulant drugs generally used for antitussive, an-tidiarrheal, and analgesic purposes. The comprehensive document of DEA regula- tions, Title 21, CFR, Parts 1300 to 1316 outlinesthe expectations for handling of CS by manufac-turers, distributors, practitioners, pharmacies,and researchers. 3. The Importance of Compliance In enforcing the CSA, it is the DEA's responsibilityto ensure drugs are not diverted for illicit purposes.This effort can result in signicant nancial penal-ties if registrants have not complied with regula-tions. The DEA regulations provide for up to$10,000 penalty per violation and/or loss of the DEAlicensure. Because each improperly documentedinvoice for a delivery of CSs would be considered oneviolation, there is high potential for nes to be sig-nicant. These penalties could nancially crippleyour veterinary business or cause you to lose yourDEA license. In addition, as a practitioner, yourrole in the proper prescribing, administering, anddispensing of CSs is critical not only to patients'health but also in safeguarding society against thediversion of CSs. It is more important now thanever to be vigilant in preventing the diversion andabuse of CSs. The United States is experiencing an alarming drug abuse problem: more than 6 million Ameri-cans are abusing prescription drugs\u2014more than thenumber of Americans abusing cocaine, heroin, hal-lucinogens, and inhalants, combined. Every day, more than 130 people in the United States die afteroverdosing on opioids. 3The misuse of and addic - tion to opioids, including prescription pain medica-tions, heroin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl,is a national crisis that affects public health as wellas social and economic welfare. The Centers forDisease Control and Prevention estimates that thetotal \"economic burden\" of prescription opioid mis-use alone in the United States is $78.5 billion a year,including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity,addiction treatment, and criminal justice involve-ment. Researchers report that opioid prescriptionpainkillers now cause more drug overdose deathsthan cocaine and heroin combined. Around 68% ofthe more than 70,200 drug overdose deaths In number over-dose deaths involving opioids prescriptionopioids and illegal opioids like heroin and illicitlymanufactured fentanyl) was 6 times higher than in1999. 4 Compliance with all DEA regulations is your best defense against unnecessary business risk and helpsto ensure that you are not contributing to the na-tional opioid crisis. 4. Most Important Areas of Noncompliance for Veterinary Practices and Best Practices for MeetingCompliance Requirements DEA Registration DEA regulations require that each registration must maintain separate records, storage, and ac-countability of CSs. Many practices have each vet-erinarian maintain individual DEA registration,and some states required this. However, this canbe expensive and unnecessary in some states, andcan cause administrative challenges. These dif-culties arise because multiple DEA registrations re-quire multiple recordkeeping sites with strictattention to preventing the commingling of CSs orCS records. To avoid this, one option is to have a \"clinic\" reg- istration. All veterinarians are then listed and ref-erenced under the clinic registration as -1, -2, etc.However, a clinic registration requires the employ-ment of a fulltime pharmacist, so this is not work-able for the vast majority of veterinary practices.The simplest option is to have only one registrantwho acts as the primary registrant with subordinateagents. If state requirements include DEA regis-tration for all veterinarians, or the practice prefersthat, CS should still be ordered through only oneprimary registrant, with other registrants acting asagents. This avoids the specter of duplicate safes,ling cabinets, and accountability exercises. Theprimary registrant then has responsibility to super-vise his agents, as he or she is personally and fullyresponsible for their conduct. This can be risky ifCS protocols are not in place and followed carefully,especially reconciliation. However, if CS are or- 102 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESdered by multiple DEA registrants within a practice, all CSs and CS records must be kept segregated andno exchange of CS between registrants is permittedwithout adherence to specic regulations on distri-bution. The chance for failure of compliance risessharply with multiple registrants. Background Checks The DEA expects that practices will perform back-ground checks on all persons with access to CSs tofairly assess the likelihood of an employee commit-ting a drug security breach. An authorization for abackground check, in writing, must be completed bythe person who is directly handling CSs, or is hiredas a practitioner. This authorization should permitinquiries to be made of courts and law enforcementagencies concerning pending charges or convictions.Information on employees' criminal records shouldthen be requested locally by name, date and place ofbirth, and other identifying information, at localcourts and law enforcement agencies for records ofpending charges and convictions; and nationally bymaking an inquiry at the appropriate DEA FieldOfce. Your written CS policies should addressthis specically. The DEA recommends that employment screen- ing be employed to obtain certain information aboutnon-practitioners (non-registrants) who are em-ployed where they will have access to CSs. In thisregard, it is believed that conviction of crimes andunauthorized use of CSs are activities that areproper subjects for an employer's comprehensiveemployee screening program. It is, therefore, as-sumed that the following questions will be asked ofall prospective employees: Within the past 5 years, have you been con- victed of a felony, or within the past 2 years,of any misdemeanor, or are you presentlycharged (formally) with committing a criminaloffense? Do not include any trafc violations,juvenile offenses, or military convictions, ex-cept by general court-martial. If the answeris yes, furnish details of conviction, offenselocation, date, and sentence. In the past 3 years, have you ever knowingly used any narcotics, amphetamines, or barbitu-rates, other than those prescribed to you bya physician? If the answer is yes, furnishdetails. Responsibility to Report Drug Diversion The DEA further states that a necessary part of anoverall employee security program is the require-ment for reporting of employee drug theft or di-version in the workplace by all team members.Employees who have knowledge of drug theft or diversion from their employer thus have an obliga-tion to report such information to the employer.Employers have a responsibility to treat such infor-mation as condential and to take all reasonablesteps to protect the condentiality of the informa- tion and the identity of employees furnishing infor-mation. Failure to report drug theft or diversioninformation should be grounds for termination. Illicit Activities It is the DEA's position that employees who possess,sell, use, or divert CSs not only subject themselves tostate or Federal prosecution for any illicit activity,but should also become the subject of independentaction regarding their continued employment. Em-ployers must assess the seriousness of the employ-ee's violation, the position of responsibility held bythe employee, past record of employment, etc., indetermining whether to terminate the employee. Recordkeeping Each practice must maintain inventories and re-cords of Schedule II substances separately from allother records maintained by the registrant. Like-wise, inventories and records of CSs in SchedulesIII, IV, and V must be maintained separately or in aform that is readily retrievable from the ordinarybusiness records of the practitioner. The term,\"readily retrievable,\" means the record is kept ormaintained in such a manner that it can be sepa-rated out from all other records in a reasonable timeor that it is identied by an asterisk, redline, orsome other identiable manner such that it is easilydistinguishable from all other records. 5All records related to CSs must be maintained and be available for inspection for a minimum of 2 years. Biennial Inventory All registrants must keep records of CSs that areadministered or dispensed to patients in the lawfulcourse of professional practice. Each registrantwho has CSs on hand must maintain a complete andaccurate record of the CSs ordered under their reg-istration and the date that the inventory was con-ducted. The Biennial Inventory record must be in awritten, typewritten, or printed form and be main-tained at the registered location for at least 2 yearsfrom the date that the inventory was conducted.After an initial inventory is taken, the registrantmust take a new inventory of all CSs on hand atleast every 2 years. This Biennial Inventory mustcontain the following information: Whether the inventory was taken at the begin- ning or close of business Names of CSs Each nished form of the substances (e.g., 100-mg tablet) The number of dosage units of each nished form in the commercial container (e.g., 100-tablet bottle) The number of commercial containers of each nished form (e.g., four 100-tablet bottles) Although an inventory is only required to be per- formed every 2 years, a shorter period of 6-12 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 103THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESmonths is often a better choice. While federal law requires that these records be kept for 2 years, statelaws vary considerably. It is important to be awareof your state laws. Because all required records area potential liability with up to $10,000 ne per vio-lation, throw away records as soon as they age.Do NOT keep them. Forms 222 The Form 222 is used to order Schedule II CSs, andmust be signed personally by the registrant unlessthey have a written Power of Attorney (POA) on le.If you make an error in completing the Form 222,you must draw an \"X' across the entire documentand then keep it on le as a voided form. All voidedor unused forms must be documented and tracked,along with the properly completed forms. Copies 1and 2 are sent off to the distributor and the third iskept in a \"Pending\" le. Upon receipt of the Sched-ule II CS (CII) substances, an acknowledgment ofreceipt must be made on this third copy of Form 222.The actual date the CS are received, and the quan-tity, is very important to record. Unused Forms 222 must be appropriately safe- guarded since the DEA considers the loss or theft ofthese forms as equivalent to the loss or theft of thedrugs themselves. It is a good practice, althoughnot required under the regulations, to keep a log ofthese forms by form number and to indicate thespecic use and date of use for each form. If youshould lose a DEA 222 form or multiple DEA 222forms, you must report this to your DEA eld ofceas soon as you realize it. Handling of Expired or Defective CS Expired and defective CS that need destruction arecovered by updated DEA regulations. The DEAhas had a procedure for registrants to dispose ofunwanted controlled drugs for many years, but theold rules were scattered in different sections of theCFR. The revised regulation consolidates the di-rections in one section (Part 1317). 6In the past, some practitioners flushed medications down the toilet or injected these CSs into the carcasses ofeuthanized animals. With environment concernsabout water supplies and carcass disposal, thismethod cannot continue. In the case of returns or recalls, a registrant may send CS to the individual, manufacturer, or repre-sentative of the manufacturer from whom it wasobtained. For expired or defective CSs, one optionis using a reverse distributor company, who issues aForm 222 for CII and a different form for CIII-V.Alternatively, if you wish to handle this yourself,you can ll out Form 41 from the DEA Web site, andle it with your local DEA eld agent. 7You may not destroy medications until you have gotten the agent's permission and communication. There areoften different state and federal regulations, so thismust be investigated as well. On Form 41 youmust describe the method by which you will directlydestroy the substance. The registrant must have at his or her registered site a method of destructionthat is legal under local, tribal, state, and federallaw. The method must render the substance, \"non-retrievable,\" which is dened as \"permanently alter-[ing] the substance's physical or chemical conditionor state through irreversible means [so as to makeit] unavailable and unusable for all practical pur-poses.\" The DEA notes that \"The process toachieve a non-retrievable condition or state may beunique to a substance's chemical or physical proper-ties. A controlled substance may be considered'non-retrievable' when it cannot be transformed to aphysical or chemical condition or state as a con-trolled substance or controlled-substance analog.\" 8 If a registrant opts to destroy the substance on site through a Form 41 process, the job may not bedone solo. The regulations state that \"Two employ-ees of the registrant must handle or observe thehandling of any controlled substance until the sub-stance is rendered non-retrievable.\" The agencystates elsewhere in the 52-page Federal Registernotice that mixing CSs with kitty litter or coffeegrounds and disposing of the amalgam in the gar-bage does not meet the \"non-retrievable\" standard.Fortunately, several companies offer commercial so-lutions to destruction in this manner. a,b Separate Invoices Regulations state that CS invoices must be kept in aseparate le from other invoices. Accordingly, dis-tributors that ship CSs send packing information ona separate invoice. Practices expecting packagescontaining CS should also be sure that someone willphysically accept package, and not that it will not beleft outside a building or unattended inside. Technicians Administering CS Federal law does not permit veterinary techniciansto administer CSs. Some states have laws statingthat technicians are \"practitioners,\" but the federallaw supersedes state laws. There has not been acourt case in this regard, but if there was a death ofan anesthetized animal, it is possible an angryowner might have legal representation that wouldexploit this fact. Perpetual Inventory Although a perpetual inventory is NOT required bythe DEA, it is the most efcient way to monitorstocks of CSs. If the DEA is checking your prac-tice's compliance, usage records will be required\u2014these can be medical records, a computer printout,or a perpetual inventory. Regularly monitoring theaccuracy of your stores of CSs is often easiest with aperpetual inventory. Because accuracy is so impor-tant, it is best to do an in-house audit of a perpetualinventory on a regular basis. Standard Operating Procedures for CSs Having a set of Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs) will help you appear to be knowledgeable 104 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESabout your responsibility, and serious about compli- ance, in the event of an audit. While the DEAregulations do not require SOPs, they are standardpractice in the medical industry. You should de-velop SOPs relative to the handling of CSs\u2014order-ing, receiving, storing, administering, dispensing,auditing, and disposing. These policies shouldform the foundation of your CS training for staff. Controlled Substance Ofcer A controlled substance ofcer (CSO) should to beappointed for every practice. This person is respon-sible for training new as well as current employeesabout CS policies and protocols, keeping Biennialinventories, maintaining accurate records of CS andForms 222, etc. As a part of that training, staffmembers should be directed that if the DEA pays avisit, the agents should immediately and politelybe taken to a conference room or other neutral site inthe practice. All les they request should bebrought to them by the CSO. Agents should not beallowed to roam loose in the practice. BecauseDEA agents are required to identify themselveswhen they arrive at a facility, there will be no mys-tery as to their identity. Dispensing Although in the language of the DEA regulations,dispensing equals administration, most veterinari- ans consider dispensing as providing a supply ofmedication to a client for their use in a patient.Sometimes treatment of certain conditions (e.g., sei-zures) requires the daily use of CSs. In order todispense CSs, one must write a CS prescription.For practices that choose to dispense CSs to clients,this will require a written CS prescription, which insome states must be reported online within 24hours. Although a practitioner might consider aworkaround of writing an invoice that states thatthe CSs were actually administered in order toavoid the inconvenience of the required paperwork,this is a clear untruth and grounds for criminalenforcement. Ways to Get the DEA's Attention Submission of a Form 106 with the loss or theft of large amounts of CSs A disgruntled employee calls the DEA to re- port that you have inadequate compliance An individual is arrested with CS drugs in their possession that were improperly dis-pensed by your practice or diverted from thepractice without a report of loss An employee of your practice diverts practice CS and overdoses, or is arrested selling thesedrugs A routine DEA visit reveals your practice is grossly out of compliance5. Handling Loss or Theft Consultants suggest that security cameras be placed on the primary location of CS storage in order todeter theft. Your policies should include frequentenough audits of your CS that you would recognizetheft or loss swiftly. This should include regularmonitoring of the perpetual inventory and frequentphysical counts of CS stock. Upon discovering adiscrepancy in the perpetual inventory, it is recom-mended that a note in red pen be inserted thatdocuments the mismatch between expected calcu-lated stocks and actual physical counts, and theresults of an investigation. If, after an investiga-tion, the CSO has not discovered the source of theerror and corrected the perpetual inventory, a deter-mination must be made whether a Form 106 mustbe led. You must le a Form 106 online for all thefts and any \"signicant\" losses within 24 hours of their dis-covery. Each practice needs to determine what isconsidered a \"signicant\" loss. Consultants sug-gest that a \"signicant\" loss be considered 5% ofyour inventory of a particular CS. Loss occurswhen CS are damaged, or missing without explana-tion (e.g., re or act of nature). Breakage of CSsdoes not constitute a \"loss\" of CSs. When there isbreakage, damage, spillage, or some other form ofdestruction, any recoverable CSs must be disposedof according to DEA requirements. If the breakageor spillage is not recoverable, the registrant mustdocument the circumstances of the breakage in theinventory records. Two individuals who witnessedthe breakage must sign the inventory records indi-cating what they witnessed. Note well that all theft must be reported. If you experience a theft of CS, you may wish to considerthe use of a consultant to help you get into compli-ance and weather any ensuing storm. If possible,any requests for services of a DEA consultant shouldoriginate from the practice's attorney, so that therewill be attorney/client privilege about the ndings ofthe consultation and any deciencies found. 6. What to Do If the DEA Arrives at Your Door Because veterinary practices usually only dispense(administer) CSs, the number of les that must bemaintained by law is reasonably small. All lesshould be maintained in a secure manner; accessshould be limited to those employees with a clearneed. The les should be maintained by the CSO,preferably in the limited access room where the ac-tual drugs are to be stored, or in a locked le cabinetdedicated to CS records at the CSO's desk. Handling the CS records in this fashion will en- able you to conne the DEA personnel to a confer-ence room to which you can quickly transportindividual controlled substance les as they are re-quested.

Upon their arrival, DEA agents will identify them-selves. Your staff should be trained to politely es-cort them to a conference room or other ofce andalert the CSO to their presence. If the CSO worksas an ambulatory veterinarian, it is important tohave an alternate that can assemble the requiredles. Controlled Substance Files Required in Veterinary Practices In the event of a DEA visit, these are the les that the DEA will ask for, in the order that they will berequested. DEA Registration (CFR 1301.11 thru 1311.13) This le should contain the original of the DEA registration and the application for the latest DEAregistration, nothing more. There should be a sep-arate le for each registration. As with all con-trolled substance records, separate les must bemaintained for each registration, with no commin-gling. If the registrations are for the individualdoctors, the applications must be signed by them orby another person to whom the registrant grantedauthority to do so by virtue of a POA; otherwise theregistration is invalid. Biennial Inventory CFR 1304.11 Should contain biennial inventories for the past 2 years. There must be a separate inventory for CIImedications and one for CIII-Vs. They must in-clude all drugs currently held under the specicregistration including those awaiting destruction,in vets' vehicles, etc. It is a good idea to send allexpired drugs away for destruction or destroy themin-house through the Form 41 process just prior totaking the inventory. DEA Form 222, Order Forms for CII Medications (CFR 1305) This le should contain all executed DEA Forms 222. For drugs you have purchased, it would beCopy 3, Purchaser's Copy. For drugs you have dis-tributed, Copy 1, Supplier's Copy. The only timethat you would be supplying CII drugs would be anoccasional transfer between multiple registrationsat the practice; this must be done on a Form 222If you ever serve as a supplier for CIIs, it is yourresponsibility on a monthly basis to send the DEACopy, Copy 2, to the local DEA ofce. During anyaccountability exercise, all of the Forms 222 (blankand used) must be available for tally since these arethe means by which you will account for the CII drugs. The lling out of these forms and recordingof received Schedule II CS must be precise; anyincorrect or missing entries can result in a $10,000ne for each infraction.Powers of Attorney for Executing DEA Forms 222 (CFR 1305.07) If the registered doctor(s) signs the DEA 222 person- ally, a le for Powers of Attorney POAs would not benecessary. However, if any doctor decides that heor she no longer wishes to sign the 222s, they mustissue a POA to somebody for that specic purpose.The precise language for the POA is contained at theDEA site. Receiving Records (CFR 1304.22(c)) This le should contain all primary receiving re- cords (invoices) for CIII-V drugs; CII receiving re-cords are the Forms 222 which must be maintainedseparately. The critical factor is that the receivingdocument is dated with the actual date of receipt, anabsolute requirement of the regulations. It is im-portant, though, that these delivery tickets also listthe actual amount of the drugs received as well astheir strength and formulation. Failure to retainall receiving documents and to present them duringa DEA audit will result in signicant discrepancies.Failure to record the date of receipt and number ofunits received on each invoice could result in signif-icant nes. Dispensing Records CFR 1304.22(c) Remember: in the DEA's language, dispensing means administrating. You cannot create an ac- tual le for these since they are an integral part of your daily operations. It is likely that you havethree forms of dispensing records; only one of whichis the actual record as dened by law. First, you have the perpetual inventories which are not actually dispensing records but rather re-cords of intent to dispense. Second, your computersoftware generally has the ability to produce a dis-pensing printout. If this is to be used for account-ability purposes, it is critical that this computerprintout captures all administration since anymissed dispensing (administration) will result inshortages. In order to meet the statutory require-ments, it must identify the date of dispensing,your Registration number, the patient's name orother identifying data, the amount dispensed, thestrength and formulation of the drug, and the ini-tials of the dispenser (administrator). If the DEAuses the printout to do the accountability, they willprobably pick out a number of dispensing/adminis-tration occurrences from the printout and ask you toproduce actual documents (medical records) as away of validating the printout. Third, they mightattempt the reconciliation by utilizing the actualdispensing records, themselves, which are the med-ical les, but because it is very unwieldy, it is un-likely that they will do this. However, it does raisethe specter of records which might not be \"readilyretrievable\" as dened by statute. 106 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESDEA Form 106, Loss or Theft, File CFR 1301.76 This le should contain all DEA Forms 106 sent to the DEA in the past 2 years, nothing else. Remem-ber you only have to report signicant losses, as youdene them, not all losses. However, any loss, onepill or 1 cc, which you determine is the result of atheft must be reported. Losses and thefts must bereported immediately upon discovery. Do not as-sume that the reporting of a theft will inevitablyresult in a visit from the DEA; it depends upon thecircumstances and the amount stolen. The DEAForm 106 should contain a cryptic account of the lossor theft; it is not a confessional. Comments suchas, \"We need to do a much better job of recordkeep-ing\" should be avoided. Such admissions are not agood idea, even if true. Destruction File CFR 1307.21 This le should contain all records (Form 41) of CSs destroyed, nothing else. It is critical that this lebe presented to the DEA, as failure to include thisle in the accountability will result in shortages.Copy 1 of the DEA Form 222 for CII drugs sent tothe Reverse Distributor cannot be included in thisle since all CII records must be maintained sepa-rately. You can, of course, keep a separate destruc-tion le for CIIs; however, consultants recommendthat you keep all executed DEA Forms 222 in the222 les and cull out the Copy 1s during the DEAaudit. As is the case with all controlled substancerecords which report the movement of drugs fromone registrant to the other, the destruction recordsmust list the DEA registration number of each partyto the transaction and the precise date of receipt ordistribution of the drug. SOPs File While the regulations do not require SOPs, they are standard practice in the industry. This le shouldcontain all SOPs relative to the handling of CSs.They will demonstrate your awareness of your re-sponsibility to comply with federal regulation ofCSs. Training Files This le should include evidence of all background checks done on each employee with actual or poten-tial access to CSs. It should also contain an ac-knowledgment from the employee that he or she hasbeen trained in and understands the SOPs relativeto all aspects of CSs. The regulations do require(CFR 1301.91) that the employer advise each em-ployee in writing of their obligation to report anyinstance of actual or suspected diversion of a con-trolled substance. This written notication shouldalso be part of each employee's training le. Copiesof these les can be individually led in each em-ployee's le as well, but originals should be keptwith the CSO's les, readily available without delay.7. Conclusion Compliance with regulations pertaining to CSs is critical for reducing nancial risk to your practiceand upholding your responsibility to protect thepublic health. Diversion of CS from your practiceposes a risk of harm to others that is the antithesisof \"do no harm.\" Bringing your practice into com-pliance with the law is not difcult once you under-stand the expectations more clearly.

Telehealth is an evolvingeld that is radically changing human medicalcare 1,2and will likely do so with veterinary care in the near future.3In regions in which there are areas with very limited access to veterinary exper-tise the development of methods to implement thistechnology effectively seem particularly important.Telemedicine has training and continuing educationvalue. It is attractive to academic institutions be-cause it can allow students and faculty access totraining and collaboration with experts located inany area of the world. 4Moreover, students in aca- demic veterinary referral practices often receivelittle training in primary care cases and are fre-quently exposed to only the most complex or in-tensive cases crating bias in their learning. The development of telemedicine technology could in-crease exposure of students to a wider spectrum ofcases and open possibilities for the development ofnewer models of education in which students re-ceive a combination of remote instruction by uni-versity faculty and eld practitioners while working on external rotations. A lot of confusion surrounds use of the terms, \"telehealth\" and \"telemedicine.\" As a result, mostpeople tend to shy away from the entire category forfear of reprisal from state Boards. The most ac-cepted language is that telehealth involves commu- nicating through digital means about an animal'shealth. It has been proposed that telemedicine is asubcategory that involves diagnosing a conditionand prescribing treatment through electronic meansbut for many both remain synonymous. The dis-tinction may become relevant as the telehealth/tele-medicine space becomes regulated. According tothe AVMA's distinctions, there are categories of tele-health, telemedicine, and teleadvice. Telehealth\"is the overarching term that encompasses all usesof technology to deliver health information, educa-tion or care remotely.\" Telemedicine involves theuse of a technology that enables communicationfrom one site to another that often results in diag-nosis. Teleadvice involves general advice of a gen-eral nature and not specic to that animal. Theveterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) is AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 109THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES NOTESrequired for telemedicine (prescription and diagno- sis) but not for telehealth or teleadvice. It is alsogenerally accepted practice that triage is acceptableif the situation is an emergency situation (e.g., petpoison helpline). Two of the main issues that inhibit client access to veterinary care are cost and convenience. Plenty ofremote diagnostic tools entering the market canovercome these barriers. Some would argue thatveterinarians' delay in exploring new telehealthtools as a complement to their current practice hasactually created space for more technology compa-nies, thus hastening the displacement of veterinar-ians. Equine medicine occupies a unique positionin the telehealth landscape: neither specicallycompanion animal and generally different than pro-duction large animals, it's not clear how they shouldbe treated from a regulatory perspective. And howthey should be categorized from a regulatory per-spective has everything to do with how they shouldbe handled from a telehealth perspective. 2. Solution The use of different telehealth options has the po-tential to improve animal health, client satisfaction,the quality of veterinary care, and the veterinaryprofession. This section will explore ways in whichequine practitioners have used telehealth to betterthe situation of their patients. The truth is thatmost veterinary professionals already practice someform of telehealth, whether that be as emails, phonecalls, or text messages. Many have started to adopttext messaging as a means of exchanging informa-tion (e.g., words, pictures, videos) electronically tothe great benet of their animals. In many occa-sions the use of this technology could simultane-ously increase client satisfaction and increaserevenue for the equine practice. 3. Results The use of teleradiology is probably the most com-mon current use of telemedicine in the equine eldand many practitioners use commercial services oremail exchanges to seek advice of radiologists orother experts in imaging. Electronic devices havebeen used for many years to record electrocardio-grams that can then be read by experts and mostpractitioners commonly use phone conversations oremails to consult with experts in a particular eld.Frequently these consults are made as a profes-sional courtesy or based on a friendship of profes-sional relationship but it is not rare to seek expertadvice electronically in a fee for service ba-sis. There are mixed feelings among general prac-titioners and specialists about the best way tocontinue a collegial relationship while being able tomonetize time and effort invested in remote consultsand training to acquire this expertise. It is likelythat the market will regulate these interactions nat-urally and that courtesy, collegial, and paid interac-tions have their own space.Some practitioners have started using different platforms like Televet, Medici, Petzam, and othersin order to capture the medical record and allow foreasy charging of the client. One of the main bene-ts of going with one of the technology platforms isthat it makes the exchange between the client andthe veterinarian easier from a commerce point ofview. However, one should not feel inclined to signup for a subscription service simply because onewants to practice telehealth. Instead, veterinarians can simply begin using their own phone (or a clinic phone) for the purposesof exchanging information. To many, the idea ofusing a phone to exchange a picture rather thandriving an hour or 2 in the middle of the night tosimply check on an animal is an obvious solution.For others the risks of not personally examiningthe animal are too high. It is likely that some-where in between these two perspectives a balancethat benets animals, owners, and veterinarianscan be found. The advancement of telemedicine more broadly has been hindered by concerns that practicing tele-medicine could jeopardize one's veterinary license.This is not correct. The practice of telemedicine isperfectly acceptable from a regulatory perspective aslong as a sufcient VCPR has been established. Following is the section on establishing the VCPR from the model act of practice from the AmericanAssociation of Veterinary State Boards (AAVSB). The Veterinarian must have sufcient knowledge of the Animal(s) to initiate at least a general orpreliminary diagnosis of the medical condition of theAnimal(s). This means that the Veterinarian has seen the Animal(s) within the last year and is per-sonally acquainted with the care of the Animal(s) byvirtue of a physical examination of the Animal orby medically appropriate and timely visits to the prem-ises where the Animal is kept. This is the suggested language that most states tend to adopt; it is not binding on the individualmember state boards to adopt this language. Ad-ditional features of establishing the VCPR includeinformed consent and the veterinarian is availablefor follow-up care. It is generally assumed that companion animals fall into the rst category (hands-on exam) and pro-duction animals fall into the second category (knowthe premises). If a hands-on examination has beenperformed, then the veterinarian should feel com-fortable exercising their professional medical opin-ion to determine whether or not they have sufcientinformation to diagnose a condition through elec-tronic means. If the veterinary professional feelsas though he or she doesn't have sufcient informa-tion, then they should not feel obliged to diagnose,irrespective of whether that information is conveyedelectronically or otherwise. The regulatory discussion is often centered in de- termining whether a hands-on examination is re-quired in order to establish the VCPR with equines. 110 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESBut this might not be an important point for a couple of reasons: 1. There is a lot that can be done to improve the health of the animal that doesn't require theestablishment of the VCPR. 2. There is a general trend toward establishing the VCPR electronically, which would meanthat telemedicine can be practiced without ahands-on examination of the animal. Based on this, there is a lot of information that could be provided in order to deliver health information orprovide general advice about the animal that doesn'trequire the establishment of the VCPR. Thisshould help to demonstrate to equine veterinariansthat there is a lot that can be done in the absence ofthe VCPR and that they should not be concernedabout facing state board action should they decide toassist an animal in need without having touched theanimal. On the other hand, the implementation oftelemedicine is likely to be fast and disregard ade-quate testing of its shortcomings due to the potentialfor large economic gains. 5Controlled trials can help design best practice guidelines and establish that the health and welfare of patients is not com-promised by this medical modality. In addition to this, there is another area of oppor- tunity that is opening up, not just for general adviceand emergency triage, but for the ability to establishthe VCPR through electronic means. Evidence tosupport the electronic establishment of the VCPR isprovided by the College of Veterinarians of Ontario(CVO), the AAVSB, and Colorado veterinary regu-lations. First, it has been some time since the CVOallowed the electronic establishment of the VCPR inMay 2016. This was achieved despite the fact thatsome practitioners were not in favor of the newpolicy. Since implementation, to our knowledge,there have not been any major or minor revolutionsthat have taken place that would speak against thebenet of establishing the VCPR electronically andusing telemedicine as a viable means of caring foranimals. Second, the AAVSB, as was mentioned above, published a new model act of practice that allows forthe establishment of the VCPR electronically. Thisnew model act was created with thorough consulta-tion of its member boards and approved by them.This points to the fact that there is a general con-sensus that state board members agree that a newpolicy should be in place in order to help their statemembers. Third, in October of 2018, the state of Colorado adopted new legislation that allowed for the estab-lishment of the VCPR electronically, should the vet-erinarian choose to do so. bThis new policy was adopted without any major backlash from practicing veterinarians in the state. In addition to Colorado,most state boards have set up some advisory groupsto look at the advancement of telehealth and howtheir state regulations should adapt to and create new legislation that best prepares and enables theirmembers to provide healthcare when and in themanner in which they are uniquely trained to do so. All of these items, CVO, AAVSB, Colorado, point to the fact that there are more and more ways inwhich telehealth is opening up care to previouslyinaccessible (either for nancial or geographic rea-sons) animals. 4. Discussion There are many things that can be done to improvethe health status of equines even with in the ab-sence of a VCPR (general advice, triage) and whenregulations change to allow for higher levels of care,there will be even more ways to deliver healthcare.All of this is designed to either 1) allow equine vet-erinarians to be more comfortable providing triageand general advice, and/or 2) prepare to practicetelemedicine. There are some specic types of telemedicine in- teractions allowed by current regulations that canbenet equine practitioners and their patients andclients. The overall concept is not replace currentpractices but augment them. Some of these are: Follow-up visits using a telehealth platform. Many follow-up visits are currently being per- formed via text message phone or email. Somevisits undoubtedly will need the veterinarian tobe in contact with the horse but others (for ex-ample, serial rechecks of a wound) may benetfrom remote consultation using video or otherdigital tools. Telehealth platforms can allowmore convenient, better organized, documented,and chargeable interactions. Triage: remote triage can allow animals own- ers access to convenient and immediate expertadvice. These types of interactions have beenshown to save animal owners unnecessary ex-penses but also increase the number of pa-tients and revenue seen by physical practicesby increasing overall volume and monetizingthe advice. Consultations: Telecommunications tech- nology can increase the access to specialty care and expertise. Technology can be used toestablish real-time interactions that allowsharing several live-screen feeds between clini-cians, greatly enhancing traditional means ofconsultation like telephone conversations oremails. During a remote consultation, the 'on-site veterinarian' maintains the VCPR and cangain useful information while maintaining directcontrol of the case and communications. It is very likely that telehealth will replace part of the veterinary medical care we currently provide and ex-pand the spectrum of veterinary work. The veteri-nary profession and equine practitioners should decidehow to implement changes maintaining animal health AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 111THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESand make wellbeing the priority. If implemented wisely, changes could improve animal health, clientsatisfaction, the quality of veterinary care, and theveterinary profession and provide new opportunitiesfor learning and collaboration worldwide.

OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESWhat You Need to Know to Prevent Malpractice and Board Complaints in Equine Practice Nina Mouledous, DVM Circumstances that result in insurance claims can be prevented through sound risk-management protocols in veterinary practice. Important gaps in coverage are a common oversight whenveterinarians obtain and renew insurance policies. This lecture will give veterinariansand veterinary teams tips on preventing complaints, claims, and securing appropriatecoverage. Author's address: 2019 AAEP. 1. Introduction This discussion will give equine practitioners tips on how to avoid malpractice and board complaints intheir practices. Additionally, information will beprovided on the appropriate types of coverageneeded for individual equine practitioners to assurebroad protection against professional liability claimsand board complaints. 2. Solution Any veterinarian with a license is at risk of having amalpractice claim or board complaint. Veterinarymedicine remains one of the most highly regardedprofessions. Yet, there are many challenges stillfacing veterinary medicine. At some point in theirpractice career, many veterinarians may face anallegation of malpractice or a license complaint.As veterinary medicine has advanced, the publicexpectations have increased. The emerging animallaw courses taught at the many law schools in theU.S. are resulting in the veterinary profession be-coming more visible and more vulnerable to litiga-tion. Therefore, veterinarians need to haveappropriate insurance protection.According to cited legal suits, malpractice can be dened as the failure of a professional person to usesuch reasonable skill and diligence as are ordinarilyexpected of careful, skilled, and trustworthy personsin his or her profession. 1A veterinarian will be held to a performance level equal to that of others inhis or her eld. What other veterinarians wouldnd reasonable is termed, \"standard of care.\" Inother words, the standard of care is determined to bewhat a reasonable veterinarian would do in a par-ticular situation. The most common situations that prompt claims involve miscommunication, adverse events and un-fortunate outcomes (without negligence), accidentalloss or injury to animals boarding, collection proce-dures, economic loss, human injury, and negligence(mistakes and errors). This presentation will ex-amine some of these common situations and discussunique challenges specic to equine practice. Howto communicate with clients when an unfortunateoutcome occurs is a key component to decreasingcomplaints. Malpractice (or professional liability) and license complaints can be avoided by practicing good medi- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 113THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES NOTEScine, using enhanced communication skills, main- taining complete medical records, and keepingpeople and patients out of harm's way. Actualclaim examples will illustrate how to preventcomplaints. Equine practice poses additional risks when com- pared to small animal practice because of the highermonetary value of patients, the special veterinarian-client-patient relationship (V-C-P-R), the challengeof recordkeeping in the eld and the increased risksof human and patient injury because of the size andbehavioral nature of equine patients. Malpractice insurance responds to allegations of negligence, but not every policy is the same. It isimportant to understand how the rates are calcu-lated (is it segmented by species or other criteria)and if your rate is affected when you le a claim.Look for features like a \"consent to settle clause,\"which allows the veterinarian to control whether ornot a claim will be settled instead of the insurancecarrier settling without the insured's approval.Know if your policy is mobile or if it only applies ata listed physical location. Also, understand theclaims handling process and how it is tailored for theveterinary profession. Ask about the experience ofthe attorneys provided by the insurance carrier indefending equine practitioners. 3. Practice Good Medicine Veterinarians and their staff are human and medi-cal errors can happen, which is why it is importantto be protected with appropriate malpractice cover-age. And even when veterinarians practice good-quality medicine and follow appropriate protocols,unfortunate outcomes can occur. Some of theseoutcomes are inherent risks and some may be al-leged as mistakes by the client. Participating reg-ularly in continuing educational opportunities andpracticing on the cutting edge of veterinary medicineis essential to practicing good, sound medicine.There are new drugs, new procedures, new vaccines,new protocols and new guidelines veterinarians con-tinually need to be familiar with in practice. Vet-erinarians should refer patients if the expertise toperform a needed procedure is questionable. Vet-erinarians should always recommend what is in thebest interest of the patient. A closed claim exampleof malpractice due to a poor medical decision will bediscussed to illustrate how to prevent claims (rectaltear after care). 4. Enhanced Communication Skills According to O'Connell and Bonvicini,2there is a proven relationship between poor communication and claims. The most common causes of malprac-tice claims due to miscommunication are lack ofconsent, failure to inform the client of risks, progno-sis or options, failure to inform clients of costs, fail-ure to provide complete written and verbal aftercareinstructions, and failure to listen or be available.Veterinarians should explain the risks vs benets ofa recommended procedure or drug and obtain owner consent. 3Using sound communication tools can help veterinarians handle upset clients, deliver bad news, and handle conflict. Communication in vet-erinary medicine is on different levels between theveterinarians, clients, and staff, which increase therisks of communication breakdowns in many places.In equine practice, communication problems arisebecause of the nature of the V-C-P relationship.Oftentimes the client relationship is with the han-dler or trainer rather than the owner, and obtainingconsent can be challenging. The veterinarian is of-ten faced with communicating the patient's medicalsituation with a third party who has care, custody,and control of the horse but does not pay the veter-inary fees. Owner complaints arise when theowner receives an unknown veterinary bill. Medi-cal history is often given by the trainer who may nothave complete knowledge of the patient's back-ground. Other miscommunication examples inequine practice that have resulted in claims aremisunderstanding of outcomes, lack of consent bythe owner, lack of follow up, and language barriers(impaction colic example). The importance andbenets of good communication will be reviewedwith actual claim examples (equine communicationclaim). 5. Disclosing Medical Errors According to Bonvicini,4research on the relation - ship between communication and malpractice riskhas shown that the majority of the malpractice liti-gation in human medicine is related to poor commu-nication between the patient and the physician.While many veterinarians are adept at sharing badnews with their clients in a sensitive and empathicmanner, when the bad news is an adverse outcomedue to a medical error it requires additional tools,insight, and practice. Because of the fear of formalcomplaints and potential malpractice suits, veteri-narians may be hesitant to disclose an unantici-pated outcome or error. Tips on how to disclosemedical errors to clients will be discussed. 6. Good Medical Records According to Scoggins,5if you are accused of mal - practice, your medical records are your best defense.Complete and legible medical records are imperativefor optimal protection when faced with a complaint.Medical records are an open component of your com-munication practices. Documentation should showsound professional judgment based on informationavailable at that time. Check with your state prac-tice act as to record requirements. A good rule tofollow is that any veterinarian who reads your re-cords should be able to pick up where you left offwith treatment of that patient. Items that should be included in medical records are written consent forms, anesthesia logs, surgeryreports, physical exam ndings, diagnostics recom-mended and declined by the client, lab results, esti- 114 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESmate sheets or medical treatment plans, and all communication including texts, e-mails, voice mes-sages, social media communications, and verbal con-versations. Pictures and videos from smartphonescan provide compelling information, especially forabsentee clients. The quality of care will be judgedon the records. The practice owns the records, in-cluding original radiographs. The client of the re-cords is entitled to copies upon request within areasonable time period. Equine practice, especiallyin the eld, can be additionally challenging. Find-ing a suitable environment and the time to write inthe record and obtaining history and consent fromabsentee clients are a few of the challenges (claimexample will be discussed/intensive care unit [ICU]impaction colic/pre-purchase exam [PPE] to illus-trate how to prevent claims with complete medicalrecords). 7. Keep Clients Safe Human injury claims are less common but can bethe most costly and difcult to defend in court.Claimants' attorneys may argue that a veterinarianis considered the expert in animal behavior andshould be aware that animals can react suddenlywhen injured or frightened. Unlike small animalpractice, patient restraint by clients is more accept-able in the equine industry, which opens the veter-inarian to additional exposure for human injuryclaims. Once the veterinary exam has begun, it isthe veterinarian's responsibility to assure the safetyof everyone in the immediate area. The risk ofhuman and patient injuries is higher in equine prac-tice because of the size of the patients, the \"flight\"nature of the patients and inexperienced, non-employee handlers restraining patients. Practitio-ners should consider using chemical restraint when-ever possible to reduce injuries to both patients andhumans (employees and clients). Practicing soundmedicine by making intelligent, safe restraint deci-sions prior to treatment will help reduce human andpatient injuries (example of human injury malprac-tice claim). 8. Professional Extension (Animal Bailee) Animal bailee covers damage to animals in yourcare, custody, and control resulting from an outsidesource and not related to a veterinary incident.Typically, this includes losses resulting from re,theft, escape, flood, catastrophic weather, injuries installs, paddocks, pastures, in addition to many otherperils not related to treatment. This is an impor-tant coverage for practice owners if their practicehospitalizes boards and/or transports animals. A practice owner could be held accountable for inju-ries to or death of patients while in their care.Practice owners should check their policies for cov-erage of patient injuries not related to a veterinaryincident. Practitioners that are completely mobileand do not keep or transport patients in their care,custody, or control do not need this coverage (specicclaim fractured humerus/expensive foal). An important exclusion often found in profes- sional liability policies is that any loss of semen andembryos while in storage or transit is not covered.Veterinarians can ask their insurance providerabout securing an endorsement to cover losses whilein storage or transit by the insured veterinarian (notthird party transit/UPS/Fed X), (examples of semen/embryo claims). 9. Discussion In summary, equine practice poses additional risksof claims when compared to small-animal practice.The higher monetary value of patients prompts cli-ents to seek economic losses by ling a malpracticeclaim when an adverse event occurs. The specialveterinarian-client-patient relationship, the chal-lenging recordkeeping environment in the eld andthe increased risks of human and patient injury alladd to the potential exposures of equine practice.Know the perceived monetary value of your equinepatients and secure policy limits in line with theirvalue.

Introduction Student debt associated with college education in the United States is an increasingly serious issue.College tuition costs have risen at a rate 200%greater than the rate of inflation since 1990. 1,2 Concomitantly, the amount of college student debthas tripled in that time. 3-5In particular, post- graduate education cost has soared, contributing togreater than 50% of the overall student debt. 6Vet- erinary education is not immune. Many veterinarystudents graduate with student debt loads in excessof $100,000. In equine veterinary practice, suchdebt loads are particularly unsustainable due in nosmall part to the proportionately lower pay scaleassociated with entry level positions in the equine veterinary industry. The causes of student debt, and veterinary stu- dent debt in particular, are many and varied. Ex-amining them all is not within the scope of thispresentation, although some aspects will be alludedto in the second portion of this program, in theprocess of examining strategies for dealing with stu-dent debt. But one fact is undeniable: veterinaryeducation is expensive and getting more so. It isalso true that associate salaries in equine practice lag substantially behind those of other segments ofthe veterinary profession. 7These two factors com- bine to make the reality of equine practice less at-tainable for current students and graduatesembarking on their careers. Indeed, recent infor-mation provided to the AAEP suggests that thenumber of students expressing a desire to pursueequine practice has decreased from as high as 5% in2005, to 1% currently. 8In signicant drop-off at 4-5 years post-graduation. 8Is student debt, and the inability to manage debt in the face of sal-aries in the equine veterinary industry to blame forthese ndings? The purpose of this paper is to address this ques- tion. The stimulus for the research behind it was aconversation with a veterinary practice owner inwhich it was stated that the student debt issue ismerely a matter of out-of-state or foreign veterinaryschool expenses and that if students simply connedthemselves to attending in-state schools, this prob-lem would go away. The author hypothesized thatthere was much more to the student debt issue thanthis blanket statement. To test this hypothesis, 116 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES NOTEStwo informal polls were conducted via Facebook groups, with the intent to determine answers to thefollowing questions: 1) Is student loan debt only acritical issue for out-of-state or foreign veterinaryschool graduates? 2) What is the relative impor-tance of a number of factors in terms of ability torepay debt, including the aforementioned in-state vsout-of-state, interest rate, year of graduation, andchosen method of repayment? And nally, is theresulting combined effect driving aspiring veterinar-ians out of the equine veterinary profession? A survey was conducted on two Facebook group pages associated with veterinarians. Respondentswere asked to indicate their school of graduation,whether they attended the veterinary school as in-state residents or paid out of state fees (includingforeign schools), the year in which they graduated,their total educational debt at graduation, the inter-est rate associated with their student loans, andtheir current amount owed. In the end, debt wasanalyzed over a period of 33 years (1985-2018) with597 veterinarians providing data on their studentloans. Twenty-eight stateside schools and 16 for-eign schools were represented. Of the 597 respon-dents, 377 (63%) supplied their residency status.For schools that offer different tuition rates based onresidency, in-state students represented 268 re-sponses, while out-of-state students comprised an-other 87 responses. Eleven students paid acombination of out- and in-state fees. Anothereleven students had in-state fees through the West- ern Interstate Commission for Higher Education(WICHE) program. Data is presented representingindebtedness at graduation and current indebted-ness by year of graduation. (Graduation yearsprior to 2000 are aggregated due to fewer responsesand thus fewer data points; Figs. 1-16.) In addi-tion, indebtedness at graduation and current indebt-edness is shown on a comparative basis forgraduates paying in-state tuition vs those payingout of state or foreign location tuition. The charts in Figs 1-16 depict individuals' debt change from their graduation year and trending tocurrent time. The horizontal axis represents theyear while the vertical axis represents the debtamount in thousands of dollars. Several trends are immediately noticeable. First is overall debt at graduation. Prior to 2003, norespondents reported debt at graduation of over$150,000. By 2008, over 50% of the respondentsreported a debt above that level at graduation.Second, with a few exceptions, respondents report asteady downward trend over time in the amountowed until approximately 2010. However, begin-ning in 2011, a signicant percentage of respondentsactually report an increase in indebtedness sincegraduation. This trend is most marked amongthose respondents with the highest debt loads.In addition, those debts which do continue to trenddownward do so at a slower pace in later years thanin earlier ones. Lastly, while in-state respondentstended to carry less debt than out-of-state or foreign Fig. 1. 2001 Graduates. Fig. 2. 2002 Graduates. Fig. 3. 2003 Graduates. Fig. 4. 2004 Graduates. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 117THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESstudents, the patterns in terms of ability (or lack thereof) to repay debt were consistent. In the process of analyzing the data on debt, av- erages per decade were also evaluated. The aver-age over all decades of debt at graduation was$155,473. The widely accepted average debt for aveterinary school education is $150,000, which at a glance this data supports. However, looking solelyat the last 18 years, those graduating in the rstdecade of the millennium reported an average debtof $123,144 while those in the second decade had anaverage debt of $195,392. Of signicant concernwere the numbers associated with average current Fig. 5. 2005 Graduates. Fig. 6. 2006 Graduates. Fig. 7. 2007 Graduates. Fig. 8. 2008 Graduates. Fig. 9. 2009 Graduates.

For those graduating in the 2000s, debt hadbeen paid down to an average of $53,253 while thosegraduating in the 2010s reported an average currentdebt of $178,056. Thus, in aggregate over thecourse of time, those with debt in the rst decade ofthe millennium have reduced their debt by 60%.In the subsequent decade, over an admittedlyshorter period of time, graduates have reduced theirdebt by less than 10%. See Table 1 for a summary. Cases of debt increasing over time since gradua- tion impact this metric. This trend of increasingdebt is occurring in spite of veterinarians payingtheir monthly payments as directed, most often ac-cording to income-based repayment plans. Thesheer size of individual debt amounts relative toincome earned results in income-based repaymentsthat are less than the accumulating interest. Themagnitude of these debt loads is, in fact, greatest forthose who attended out-of-state or foreign-based vet-erinary schools. In the 2010s, both out-of-state andfor-prot foreign veterinary school graduates report an average current debt greater than their debt atgraduation. Out-of-state students started with anaverage debt of $251,415 but currently average$267,769. For-prot school students started withan average of $301,159 but now have an average of$333,289. In-state students fared better, but stillincurred a large increase in overall graduation debt.Those graduating with in-state tuition in the 2000shad an average debt of $96,821, which increased toan average of $158,781 in the 2010s. Interest rates were also analyzed for impact. Not all responding veterinarians disclosed their interestrates, so the sample size was smaller. If a veteri-narian reported a varying rate or multiple rates, anaverage was obtained. In the 2000s, the averageinterest rate reported was 3.7%. The average raterose to 6.6% in the 2010s. The combination ofgreater amounts owed with concomitantly higher Fig. 13. 2013 Graduates. Fig. 14. 2014 Graduates. Fig. 15. 2015 Graduates. Fig. 16. 2016 Graduates. Table 1.

In spite of the accumulated data from the rst survey, a clear answer to the nal question of theimpact of debt on the pursuit of a career in equinepractice had not been elucidated. In March of2019, a second survey was conducted, polling 1,796veterinarians. Survey subjects were asked to indi-cate whether or not they were equine veterinarians,and if they were not, whether they had originallydesired to be and changed their area of interest as aresult of nancial considerations. One thousandseven respondents (56%) stated they were notequine veterinarians and had never had an interestin pursuing equine practice. Of the remaining 789(44%) expressing equine practice as their desiredcareer niche, 441 (55.36%) stated they left, neverpursued, or considered leaving an exclusive equinepractice. Of that number, 202 (45.8%) indicatednancial reasons associated with student debt asthe reason. The remaining 239 (54.2%) stated theyleft, never pursued, or considered leaving an exclu-sive practice due to factors outside student loandebt. Thus, student loan debt appears to be one ofseveral signicant factors, and perhaps the mostimportant, contributing to veterinarians leavingequine practice. Student debt is a serious issue for veterinarians who have graduated from veterinary school sincethe year 2000. The idea that only those who at-tended out-of-state or for-prot schools are strug-gling with debt must be rethought. The datacollected shows an alarming increase in student loandebt, especially over the last decade. In-state tu-ition was not exempt from this increase. In-statestudents experienced a 60% tuition rate increasealong with a near doubling of average interest rateswithin a decade. Certainly, graduates of foreignschools and those who paid out-of-state tuition rateswere impacted to a far greater degree. But theimpact is largely one of scale\u2014the amount initiallyowed at graduation is compounded by the higherinterest rates, leading to repayment amounts that are beyond the ability of most associate salaries tokeep up with. The fact that salaries for associatesin equine private practice have not increased com-mensurate with this massive change in scale of debtworsens the problem. As a result, a meaningfulpercentage of aspiring equine practitioners end uppursuing alternate career paths.

Introduction Student loan debt has risen in the United States to where it now comprises the second largest segment of overall debt in the country, behind only homemortgage debt. The highest percentage of thatdebt is associated with post-graduate or professionaleducation, and mean debt for veterinary schoolgraduates has increased 3-fold from 2001 to 2018.The increased debt load has been particularly dif-cult for veterinary graduates desiring a career inequine practice. As a result of lower average start-ing salaries in the equine industry, equine careeraspirants face a signicantly higher debt-to-incomeratio than other industry segments. The reasons for higher student debt at graduation are multifactorial. College tuition, and in particu-lar graduate and professional school tuition, hasincreased at a rate signicantly greater than infla-tion. Simultaneously, previous levels of federaland state funds, in the form of low interest loans and grants, have not sustained historical levels of sup-port. Outsourcing of previously government subsi- dized loan entities to contracted services and privateloan providers has resulted in higher interest ratesfor borrowers, as well. When confronted by thesefactors, it is easy to see why a young, less nanciallyliterate, passionately career-driven student could beoverwhelmed by the perfect storm of debt. It is beyond the scope of this presentation to eval- uate the many political and policy factors that have led to rapidly rising tuition rates. The Veterinary Debt Initiative, a combined effort of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and the As-sociation of American Veterinary Medical Colleges(AAVMC), has outlined a number of steps aimed ataddressing public policy issues relative to studentdebt as well as directly assisting veterinary studentsis learning about, understanding, and dealing with AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 121THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES NOTESstudent debt load. This presentation will concen- trate on currently available student debt repayment methods, as well as some real-life examples and tips from graduates who have successfully managedtheir debt. There are a number of options available through various government agencies and programs that aredesigned to facilitate student repayment. Follow-ing is a summary of these available options. 2. Public Service Loan Forgiveness The public service loan forgiveness is a governmentsponsored program designed to forgive any remainingstudent debt, and to do so tax free, after a total of 120on-time payments have been made toward that debt(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service). These 120 paymentsmust be made in conjunction with employment at anapproved employer\u2014dened as a government entity,a 501(c)(3) non-prot, or some other non-prot thatprovides a public service. In theory, it is an opportu-nity for graduates of a professional program to devote10 years to public service work while making mini-mum, income-based payments toward their debt, andsubsequently have any remaining debt forgiven.However, debt is not automatically forgiven; instead aPublic Service Loan Forgiveness application must besubmitted after completion of all requirements, andthere have been reports of difculty getting applica-tions approved. Additionally, there are relativelylimited opportunities for qualifying employment inveterinary medicine, making this option nonviable formany graduates. 3. Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program This is a government-sponsored program that willrepay debt up to $25,000 per year over a period of 3years, in exchange for agreement to work in desig-nated public service jobs or in specic private prac-tice areas that have been designated as areas ofneed. States, regions, and other government ornongovernmental entities rst need to apply fortheir area or need to be designated as such. Oncethey are made part of the program, positions areadvertised through federal governmental channels.The majority of these private practice positions arein mixed practice, with an emphasis on livestock andfood animal service, which limits opportunities forthose interested in equine practice. 4. Income-Driven Repayment Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans were intro-duced to provide options for graduates for whom thestandard repayment plan, based on equal paymentsover a period of 10 years, resulted in monthly pay-ments that were not affordable. This is often thecase in veterinary medicine, especially in the equinesector. There are several different IDR plans.Determining which is best for each individual situ-ation might require consultation with a qualiednancial advisor. Plan options include:Income-based repayment (IBR)\u2014payments are capped at 10% of discretionary income for all loanstaken out after July 1, 2014, and 15% of discretion-ary income for all loans taken out prior to that time.Any remaining balance is forgiven after 25 years. Pay as you earn\u201410% of discretionary income as a monthly payment, with loan forgiveness at the endof 20 years. Revised pay as you earn\u201410% of discretionary income toward debt, remainder forgiven after 20years for undergraduate debt, 25 years for post-graduate debt. Income-contingent repayment\u2014for those loans failing to qualify for other IDR options, repaymentset at 20% of discretionary income, or based on anamount amortized over 12 years. Forgiveness oc-curs after 25 years. A common aspect of all of the above IDR plans is that any forgiven amount at the end of either 20 or25 years is considered taxable income. In addition,the combination of high debt loads (often over $200,000) with relatively low income levels, can re-sult in IBR plans that do not cover the cost of inter-est, resulting in loan balances that increase overtime, rather than decrease. Nonetheless, commonadvice from nancial planners is for practitionersearly in their career to use an income-based repay-ment plan and then save as much money as possiblein order to be able to pay for the tax liability asso-ciated with debt forgiveness at 20-25 years. 5. Standard Repayment The standard student loan repayment plan is based onequal payments over a course of 10 years, resulting incomplete payoff of the loan at that time. This plan isfeasible for those with relatively small debt loads butbecomes unwieldy for those with a high debt-to-incomeratio and with current student loan interest rates over6%. It is rare for a veterinary student to graduatewithout a 6-gure student loan, which puts almostevery new graduate equine veterinarian in the highdebt-to-income-ratio category. Based on the options described above, one can see where many recent veterinary graduates wish-ing to practice equine medicine are caught be-tween the proverbial \"rock and a hard place\" interms of student debt. High debt loads result inunaffordable payments based on a standard re-payment plan and payments, which only margin-ally touch the principal balance on income-basedrepayment plans. Recent graduates have beencounseled to adopt the income-based repaymentplans, save every penny they can, and target ittoward the eventual tax liability that will occurwhen their loan balance is forgiven. While thismay be sound advice on an individual basis, itpoints to a signicantly flawed system in general.In addition, it leaves graduates vulnerable tochanges in administration and associated changesin repayment plans. 122 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESBased on the survey results presented in another paper at this conference, a number of individualswere in fact able to pay off their student loans suc-cessfully. Twenty of these individuals were ran-domly selected and asked to provide a narrative asto how they accomplished this. Responses are in-cluded below. Dr. AThe main reason I was able to pay this debt off in a timely manner while working in equine exclusivepractice was because my spouse has a more signif- icant income than me and my parents helped me invet school with some educational and livingexpenses. Dr. BI graduated in 2004 with approximately $50,000 in debt, which was virtually all in deferred loansthat did not accrue interest while in school. In 5years I was able to eliminate the loans due primarilyto a bequest of $25,000 from my grandmother's will.The rest of the money I saved (salary during thatperiod was roughly $50,000-$65,000/year) due pri-marily to never living alone or high on the hog.I had a roommate immediately after vet school andshared a crappy two bedroom rental with a friend,then with my ance \u00b4e, for 3 years. Then I married and moved into a really crappy two-bedroom rentalwith my wife until debt free. Dr. CI was accepted into 4 veterinary schools.Why that's pertinent\u2014I was able to choose and ultimately, I chose based on tuition cost. Two out ofthe 4 were WICHE schools, so I was looking atroughly half the tuition cost per year versus the othertwo, which at that time was around $37,000 per year.If (I) [sic] had been faced with $160,000 in tuition, Imight not have accepted. I lived in a single-widetrailer with a roommate. I lived cheap. I can elaborate on how I paid my debt down, be- cause I certainly didn't make a lot of money, butbottom line it was about making smart decisions andcost of living. Dr. DUpon graduation, I went into practice right away as a resident vet at a large Standardbred breedingfarm in my home county. I did not do an internshipand was able to start making signicant paymentsimmediately. (I still work at the same farm 15 yearslater.) I decided to pay off $1000/ month which waswell over the minimum payments required. Be-cause I moved back to my home town, I was able torent from my mother at a reduced rate. Otherwise,I lived pretty frugally. Dr. EI did an equine internship and then got an ambu- latory job after nishing my internship. The prac-tice that I was in was a small practice and while Ihad job satisfaction, I was drowning in debt. It wasmentally defeating to know that I was a doctor, butthat if I had not gone to vet school I could have beena manager of McDonalds and been in a better nan-cial spot. I was barely able to make a dent in my debt with my equine salary even with living in aridiculously cheap farm house and primarily drivingthe work truck. I was able to pay between $800-$1200/month to- ward my loans, which was upwards of 30%-50% ofmy income but was barely covering the interest if atall. After 2 years in that job, I was looking at thepossibility of relocating across the country and theodds of me nding an equine job vs a small-animaljob were not in my favor. I elected then to switchjobs to small animal (after much soul searching sincethis was the last thing I wanted to do). I immedi-ately doubled my salary and started paying down mystudent loans aggressively. Five years to the dayafter starting my small animal job, I paid off mystudent loans. For the past 3 years of my loans, my husband was paying the large bills in our household with hissalary and I was putting almost all my money to-ward student loans and small household bills. Dr. FI am fortunate that both my husband and I have good jobs. I am a federal vet bc in my area, I makefar more than doing private practice. Early yearsafter vet school I was paying up to $4500 per monthjust to knock down the principal. We've always been able to live comfortably but, overall, any extra money goes to loans. Dr. GI am exclusively Equine and have been since I graduated in 2006. I graduated with about$165,000, with about $30,000 of that from gradschool. I deferred my loans for a year during myinternship. I then paid the minimum payment on a30-year xed loan up until 2013. In 2013 I appliedfor and started IBR. Looking back this was not agood decision as my payment did not cover anythingbut some of the interest. In 2014 I had twins inMarch and opened my own ambulatory practice inJune so I continued on IBR because I was just tryingto survive and pay the bills. In July of 2016 myhusband and I started the Dave Ramsey plan. Atthe time our total debt was $155,000 with $139,000being my student loans. We emptied our savingsdown to about $2000 and put the rest on our debt.Within 2 months we were just paying on my loans.Through this debt payoff I was only paying myselfabout $50,000 a year. I did side jobs such as vettingendurance rides and drug testing through USEF.All that extra income went straight to debt. Myhusband also owns his own business and pays him-self around $50,000 a year. We were on track to payoff at the middle of this year. My mom passed awayand left me some money. With a $20,000 draft frommy husband's business and about $15,000 from myinheritance we paid it off in October of 2018. Dr. HI graduated in 2008 and have been practicing without any time off the entire time. I am JUSTNOW making enough money being a full-time equine AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 123THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESvet. I graduated college early and took a year off between college and vet school. During that year Iestablished residency by starting my own hunter/jumper show barn/sales and training business. Upon graduation I was making six gures train- ing and selling horses. I kept my business andstarted in practice for myself and basically just dab-bled in being a veterinarian. I did this for 2 yearsbefore my husband got a job and we moved. When I got a job as an associate (the fourth asso- ciate at the practice) in a 100% equine practice.I worked on 100% commission. I have to look backat the exact numbers, but I denitely made less than$20,000 that year. Because of the very low pay I once again started training and buying selling horses and started apractice of my own with another of the associates thatleft the original practice. Dr. II owed a little over 100,000 when I graduated in 2006. My husband and I both had jobs, so we livedoff his income and used mine to pay off debt and wedelayed having kids for 3 years. I picked up everyweekend on call I could (we got 50% of what wegrossed from emergency call) and we lived frugally.The practice I work in is large-animal exclusive andI do 50% equine. My debt was paid off completely in7 years. Dr. JI worked for 5 years right out of school as an associate in mixed practice then went out on my ownas solo equine only. I have no ofce and no employ-ees, so my overhead is very low. I consolidated atthe lowest rates possible as soon as I took my loansfor fourth year and started to repay even though Ididn't have to. I used my scholarships awarded atgraduation to pay off a big chunk of my loans to startas my husband was gainfully employed and I had ajob waiting. I wasn't expecting those scholarships,so I gured my loans were a good way to use them. I paid more than the minimum every month and when I could afford more I paid up to 3-4x's mypayment amount requesting the extra be applied tothe principal. I also took advantage of the interest reduction for automatic withdrawal after 18 months of on-timepayments, so I think my interest is only 2.75%.I do not own a home yet because my savings fails togrow much but I am doing that later this year I hope.I made strategic plans for my own practice by buyingolder, used equipment but have slowly been upgrad-ing things. I have had help from my folks withpersonal loans to buy some new equipment like myvet box. Dr. KI graduated in 2010 and did a 1-year academic equine internship. I then did a 3-year residency inlarge-animal internal medicine (and was subse-quently board certied after passing boards). Dur-ing those 4 years of further studies, I deferredpayment on my loans for 3 years bc I couldn't affordit (internship salary, $32,000/year; resident salary, $35,000/year). The nal year of my residency I gotmarried and my husband started paying $1000/month toward the loans, which didn't even cover theinterest. My loans were $134,000 on graduation,and went up to $185,000 in the interim, at 6.8%interest, all federal. I took a mixed-animal job, 80% small, 20% equine, paying $75,000/year. I loved the improved qualityof life with much less on call, and better pay. I thengot a raise to $90,000/year the following year. Dur-ing all this, once I started working at my mixed-animal practice, I started paying $2100/monthtoward the loans. The only reason I was able to dothis was because we basically lived off my husband'sincome, didn't eat out, and lived as cheaply (read:college student) as possible. My debt was paiddown even more quickly when we moved to New York2 years ago and bc of my husband's increased salary,started paying $4100/month and living the same(college student style). I took a small-animal-exclusive job, bc I could not imagine working thehours, with on call, emergency duty, etc. for lesspay that equine practice provides. I now make$100,000 per year as an associate, paid vacation, noafter-hours duties, no on call, no weekends. As faras the debt goes, we are basically only making prog-ress because we live like we are poor, and I paybasically my entire paycheck to the loans and we liveoff my husband's salary. Dr. LI was very lucky that at the time I graduated (2007) I was able to consolidate about $100,000 of thedebt at 1.7% interest. That was due to on-time pay- ments and borrower benets that lowered my very lowinterest rate even further. That made a huge differ-ence. Secondly, I had about $20,000 in private loansand I threw everything I had at those to pay them downover the course of one year when I nally was makingenough money to even try. Also, I have always had a\"second\" job. I did USEF drug testing, and vaccineclinics while I was an associate. In 2014 I left myposition as an associate. I was making about$80,000 /H11001whatever I earned in side money ($10,000- $15,000/year). That was the year I knocked out the$20,000. I started in a sports medicine practice withthe idea that I would be buying in after 2 years. Nothaving on call freed me up to work more efciently andthe higher margins of sports med means that I can earnmore. In the beginning I took a part-time positionwith Baneld to keep my income up to where it hadbeen, and from there I was able to transition to small-animal ER relief work, which is also extremely lucra-tive. So, I brought in about $200,000 last year with aneven split between what I made in my business andwhat I made on the \"side\" doing ER. I do overnightshifts, and I sleep as I can on the overnights, and lots oftimes I \"work\" for 48 hours straight living off naps ... Dr. MI graduated with $56,000 in debt with the majority being a federal student loan. I also had a small 124 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESloan payable directly to Cornell. My rst year in practice I was making $35,000 plus production.My goal was to pay off the loans in 5 years. Ini-tially, every single spare dollar went to paying downthe loans. I always paid more monthly than wasneeded. In 2001, our local harness racetracks (thereare 2 within 30 minutes) lost their regulatory vet.The races cannot be run without a vet on property, sothey reached out to the local vets. I was one of thelocal vets that got hired per diem. Because thetracks race in the evening after typical businesshours, I worked as many days as feasible. Someweeks, it was my only day off and both weekend days(so 3 days a week). Some weeks, it was all of theracing days (5-6 days a week) in addition to myregular job. I started my calls at 7:00 am or so andnished about 5:00 pm then headed to the track towork until about 11:00 pm. I commonly worked 90days in a row with no days off. The pay at the trackwas $250/night. The additional money went to pay-ing down my loans. Dr. N1) went to a state school for undergrad so I could benet from academic scholarships to allow for zerodebt going in to vet school, 2) chose an in-state vet-erinary school, 3) borrowed less than the full amountfor each semester. I borrowed enough to cover tu-ition plus just a small amount for living. I alsolived as cheaply as possible. I shared books withclassmates, ate at home, didn't travel, and workedover school breaks. 4) My parents did help me byproviding some living expenses as well as paying myinterest payments on my compounding loans duringveterinary school. 5) I found a job close to homeafter school and lived with my parents for 4 yearsafter graduation. This allowed me to put most ofmy salary toward my loans and pay down my prin-ciple. I did this until I started saving for a home, atwhich point I switched to an income-driven paymentplan. I am fortunate to live in an area with a cheapcost of living, so I'm sure it's easier for me to makepayments versus someone who lives in a more expen-sive area. I am in mixed-animal practice. I absolutely had interest in being an equine vet, but the low incomecombined with the poor work-life balance discour-aged me. What is missing from these narratives is what many graduates interested in equine practice arelooking for: a scenario enabling a career in privateequine practice while still being able to service theirveterinary school debt. Some respondents relied on spousal income to provide a living, while their ownincome went almost totally toward debt. Otherstook on second and third jobs to supplement theirequine private practice income. Most lived frugallyand held off on routine aspects of life such as homepurchases or starting a family. The Dave Ramsey method was mentioned by some respondents during the survey process described inan earlier paper. For those who are unfamiliar,Dave Ramsey recommends what he refers to as the\"avalanche effect\" (https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/how-the-debt-snowball-method-works). Whilemost nancial advisors advise paying as much asone can toward whatever debt is associated with thehighest rate of interest, Dave Ramsey recommendstrying to pay as much as possible toward loans withthe smallest balance so as to eliminate them com-pletely as soon as possible. Any payments madetoward these loans, once they are paid off, is thenadded to the minimum amounts being paid towardthe larger loans. This cumulative approach reliesto a degree on behavioral economics, by understand-ing that satisfaction is gained via the elimination ofsmall debts and condence in one's ability to tacklethe bigger debts develops. There are many otheraspects to his recommendations, but this is the mainfeature relative to paying off debt. Despite its con-trarian approach to some aspects of debt, the pro-gram has become very popular. Clearly, student debt and the ability to pay that debt is a signicant factor in choosing to practiceequine medicine, or even being able to afford tochoose equine practice as a career option. One com-mon theme from equine veterinarians graduatingsince 2008 who have also paid off their debts isreliance on spousal income, inheritances, or moon-lighting in small animal or other jobs. The choicesfacing current veterinary school graduates are notrosy, and the equine industry in general may benear a reckoning point in terms of tackling thisissue.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 125THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING PRACTICE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESRecognizing Problems in the High-Risk Pregnant Mare: Diagnosis of Placentitis and OtherInfectious Problems Theresa DACT; Karen Von DVM, Bailey, DVM, MS, DACT* Rapid identication and correct classication of mares with high-risk pregnancy is paramount, especially for those affected by infectious problems, including placentitis. This review describesdiagnostic techniques and ndings to facilitate early identication and treatment of mares withcompromised pregnancy. Authors' address: North Carolina State mid-late-term pregnan- cies experience pregnancy failure. Based on retro-spective studies of pathology cases in Kentucky andEurope, the primary cause of pregnancy loss is pla-centitis/fetal sepsis. 1-3Analysis of 1211 aborted equine fetuses, stillborn foals, and placentas submit-ted to central Kentucky resulted in diagnosis of in-fectious causes of death in approximately 25% of cases, with placentitis accounting for approximately19% of cases and fetal/neonatal bacteremia account-ing for 3.2% of submitted cases. 1Analysis of 1822 autopsy cases in Normandy resulted in diagnosis ofinfectious causes of abortion in 48% of cases, withfetal sepsis and placentitis accounting for 38.1%. 2 In Italy, examination of 103 cases of pregnancy lossand neonatal death demonstrated an infectiouscause in 50% of cases, with fetal sepsis and placen-titis accounting for 27.5% of pregnancy loss. 3In contrast, in some studies, viral or noninfectiouscauses represent the major sources of pregnancy loss. Smith and coworkers3found umbilical tor- sions in 38.8% of aborted fetuses, compared to 4.5%in the USA. 1,3In Italy, Marenzoni and coworkers4 found viral disease in 23.2% of cases, while Murase5 and coworkers demonstrated viral causes of preg-nancy loss in 24% of diagnosed cases in Japan.Because clinical presentation of these and other con-ditions is subtle and nonspecic, identication ofcompromised pregnancies and correct classicationof high-risk mares in time for successful interven-tion represents a serious challenge to the equineindustry. 2. Identifying the High-Risk Mare It is generally recommended that all mares be eval-uated periodically throughout pregnancy. Maresshould be vaccinated for equine herpesvirus 1 usinga killed vaccine at 5, 7, and 9 months of gestation,which provide convenient junctures for evaluation ofpregnant mares. 6At a minimum, it is recom- 126 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MARE NOTESmended to examine mares in late autumn or early winter (November/December in the northern hemi-sphere) to conrm pregnancy prior to the breedingseason. An additional exam should be performedin conjunction with routine spring vaccines or pre-foaling vaccines 4-6 weeks before term. 6These examinations represent opportunities to screen mares for underlying factors that would result in a high-risk classication and identify mares that are expe-riencing undiagnosed pregnancy loss in a timelyfashion. The examination should include observa-tion of overall maternal health and ambulation, acomplete physical examination, and an evaluation ofthe pregnancy through either palpation or trans-rectal ultrasonography. Careful attention shouldbe given to vulvar conformation and evidence ofvulvar discharge at this time. Due to the weight ofthe fetus and fetal fluids in late gestation, the cervixcan be displaced cranially, exacerbating risk of urinepooling, pneumovagina and fecal contamination ofthe caudal reproductive tract. Mares that exhibitwhite crystalline accumulations just below the ven-tral commissure of the vulva should be suspected toexperience some degree of urine pooling, while pneu-movagina can often be diagnosed as vaginal disten-tion via transrectal palpation or based on thecharacteristic aspiration of air when the vulvar lipsare gently separated. The mammary glands shouldbe evaluated visually and palpated at each exam.Mares normally do not experience glandular mam-mary development before 10-14 days prior to foal-ing and evidence of glandular development or milkproduction greater than three weeks before term isassociated with feto-placental compromise. Glan-dular development should be differentiated fromedema or fat deposition in the mammary gland,which can occur routinely and are not indicative oflarger problems. Mares with identied urogenitalabnormalities (such as vaginal discharge, urinepooling, poor perineal conformation or pneumova-gina), or physical problems that may affect themare's ability to carry the pregnancy (includinglameness, repeated or ongoing colic, or other sys-temic illnesses), should all be classied as high risk.In addition, any mare with a history of late-termpregnancy loss or subfertility should be included inthis group (Table 1). 3. Common Differential Diagnoses for High-Risk Mares Mares with high-risk pregnancy should undergo ad- ditional scrutiny and owners should be made awareof specic signs of pregnancy compromise, includingprecocious mammary development, vulvar dis-charge, abrupt changes in body shape, or abruptchanges in attitude and appetite if these are notalready apparent. Because abortion frequently oc-curs in the absence of any premonitory signs, maresexperiencing a high-risk pregnancy should receiveregular screening examinations at least monthly,with specic attempts to identify and characterizegestational disease in order to guide therapeutic choice. As suggested above, placentitis contributes to ap- proximately one third of late-term abortions andfetal loss. 1,7-9Any mare that is characterized as high risk based on the parameters above should undergo careful, regular diagnostic screening in or-der to institute appropriate therapy prior to fetalcompromise. Three types of placentitis have beendescribed, broadly classied as placentitis. 10,11 Ascending placentitis caused by transcervical bacterial through the caudal reproductivetract. Isolated the most common pathogens worldwide.1,7-9,15,16Utero - placental colonization results in local pericervical in-flammation, frequently visible as an increase in thecombined thickness of the uterus and placenta(CTUP). This may lead to separation of the fetalmembranes from the endometrium (Fig. 1A andTable 1.

How ever, Leptospira species are most frequently associated withthis disease. 1,7,8,25Diffuse placentitis can also be caused by fungal organisms (1.8%-6.73%), with Asper- gillus species being the most common culprits (Fig. 1C).1,2,7,8These conditions more commonly cause acute placentitis, with rapid fetal death and minimal premonitory signs. However, carefulscreening may identify ultrasonographic signs ofuteroplacental disease or fetal stress, while hemato-logic parameters may also change prior to abortion. Focal mucoid, nocardioform placentitis has been described as a cause of abortion and premature de-livery worldwide, including North America, Europe,South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. 1,7,8,25-31 Placental lesions are commonly located at the baseof the gravid uterine horn and characterized by cho-rioallantoic edema and inflammation, combined Fig. 1.

Focal placentitis can be diagnosedby identifying the characteristic thickening and sep-aration of the chorioallantois via transabdominalultrasound. Fetal stress associated with placentalinsufciency may also cause bradycardia and alter-ations in fetoplacental hormone production. These and other conditions associated with late- term pregnancy loss fall into two general categoriesin regard to disease progression and pregnancy out-come: rapid abortion or prolonged insult. Diffuseplacentitis, viral infections, and umbilical torsionfrequently result in expeditious abortion of a freshlydead fetus. In those cases, diagnosis is commonlynot obtained until after abortion. In contrast, as-cending placentitis, focal placentitis, twin preg-nancy, and placental associatedwith chronic placental insufciency and fetal stressprior to abortion, presenting an opportunity for suc-cessful diagnosis and treatment. 4. Diagnostic and Screening Modalities for High-Risk Mares Ultrasonographic screening of the CTUP via trans- rectal and transabdominal ultrasound remains thegold standard for preterm diagnosis of placentitis,while detailed ultrasonographic examination of thepregnant uterus is the only reliable means of diag-nosing twins, umbilical torsion or other physicalabnormalities preterm. Normal parameters for CTUP are well established and consistent across horse breeds. 33,34,36-39Treat - ment based on elevations in CTUP have been shown insome studies to improve gestational outcome andresult in viable and productive offspring. 31-37,40-43 The probe is placed just cranial to the cervix and thenlaterally to visualize a characteristic branch of themiddle uterine artery between the bladder/abdominalcontent and the uterus. Placental dysfunction and abortion are associated with increases in the CTUPgreater than 8 mm between 271 and 300 days, 10 mmbetween 301 and 330 days, and greater and 12 mmafter 330 days. 33,34In severe cases of placentitis, hy - perechoic debris can be seen between andthe uterus. On transabdominal ultrasonographic ex-amination, the CTUP identied in a regionwith direct or close apposition of the uterus to the bodywall and with little folding. Efforts should be made toidentify a region of fluid where the amnion is sepa-rated from the chorioallantois to prevent overinterpre-tation of disease. Measurements are made from theexternal uterine surface, frequently identiable as ahyperechoic line internal to the body wall, to the hy-poechoic/anechoic allantoic fluid, and should range be-tween 7.1 mm ( /H110061.6 mm) and 11.5 mm ( /H110062.4 mm) at the ventral aspect of the uterine body. 33,34,39Mea- surement of CTUP should be paired with critical eval-uation of parameters of fetal health, including thepresence of a single fetus, fetal activity, fetal fluidcharacteristics, and fetal heart rate. Specic mor-phologic parameters can be measured to assess appro-priate development for gestational age, as described byBucca. 39Generally, fetal fluids should be anechoic or hypoechoic, with small amount of free-floating debris depending on the activity level of the foal.43In late gestation, the amniotic fluid is generally slightly more hyperechoic than the allantoic fluid, which is charac-teristically anechoic with some localized hyperechoicdebris visible during fetal activity. The fetus shouldbe in anterior presentation by the end of the ninthmonth of gestation. The late-term fetal heart rateshould be approximately 75 beats per minute, increas-ing by 15-20 beats per minute (bpm) in periods ofactivity. Distressed fetuses often will have low fetalheart rates ( /H1102160 bpm) initially, followed by a high heart rate terminally. Selected ultrasonographic pa-rameters during the last 3 months of normal equinegestation are summarized in Table 2. Although ultrasonographic examination repre- sents a valuable tool for the diagnosis of multiplegestational abnormalities, it has several criticaldrawbacks: Firstly, transrectal and transabdomi-nal ultrasonography each require specialized equip-ment that not all practitioners have available.Secondly, because parameters are based on subjec-tive placement of the ultrasound probe, they areTable 2.

Thus, in order toincrease diagnostic sensitivity and specicity, he-matologic parameters are frequently included inscreening and diagnostic protocols. A complete blood count, serum chemistry and lac- tate may provide immediate information regardingmaternal systemic health, whereas serum proges-terone or estrogen concentrations in-sight into fetoplacental wellbeing. 23,45,46 Ousey and colleagues22proposed that an early rise in the progestin concentration may be seen in cases of chronic placentitis prior to the normallyexpected rise 2-3 weeks prior to parturition inresponse to placental insufciency (twins), pathol-ogy, and/or fetal stress. Alternately, in cases ofacute placentitis or fetal sepsis, a premature rapiddecline in progestogens generally precedes fetal de-mise. When present, the premature rise may beassociated with activation of the hypothalamic-pitu-itary-adrenal axis, which may suggest precociousmaturation and potential improved viability of thefoal. 22,47,48 Large quantities of plasma estrogens are also found in maternal circulation after mid gestationdue to hypertrophy of the fetal gonads. Dehydroepi-androsterone (DHEA) and 7-dehydroepiandrosterone(7-dehydro-DHEA) produced in large amounts in midpregnancy by the fetal gonads serve as precursors forsynthesis of estrogens by the placenta. These includeestrone, 17 /H9252-estradiol, 17 /H9251-estradiol, and their sulfo-conjugates well as the unsaturated /H9252-ring steroids equilin and equilenin and their 17 /H9251-dihyroequilenin, 17 /H9252-dihyroequilin and 17/H9252-dihyroequilenin.49,50Normally, estrogens re - main elevated for the majority of pregnancy until theygradually decline over the nal 1-2 months of gesta-tion. In compromised pregnancies prior to day 280and the hormone's natural decline, a reduction inplasma estrogens likely indicates severe fetal compro-mise and potential demise. Therefore, concentra-tions of total estrogens above 1000 ng/mL betweendays 150 and 280 are typically assumed to be normalwhile concentrations of less than 500 ng/mL are asso-ciated with severely compromised or deceased foals. 18 Recent work in a large population of mares describedcutoff values, diagnostic sensitivity and specicity forboth progesterone and estradiol-17 /H9252.48Cutoff values for progesterone and estrogen with potential clinical utility are summarized in Table 3. Other serologic markers of disease, including se- rum amyloid A, lactate and /H9251-fetoprotein, mi- croRNA, and metabolomic variations have all beenproposed as measures of fetal health. 19-21,51In the authors' laboratory, we have identied 12 serum metabolites that differ between mares with experi-mentally induced placentitis and healthy pregnantmares. As early as 4 hours post inoculation, a sig-nicant increase was mares compared to healthy controls(Beachler, unpublished data). However, to date, none of the serologic parameters are known to be specic to placentitis or any partic-ular disease, nor are they predictive of fetal out-come. Consequently, veterinarians must dependon regular screening, ultrasonographic appearanceof the fetus, uterus, and placenta as well as thecomplete clinical picture of the mare to guide ther-apeutic decisions and gauge clinical response.Table 3.

Conclusion In conclusion, late-term pregnancy loss is an impor- tant economic and emotional burden to horse own-ers, which is difcult to address due to the subtleand nonspecic nature of clinical disease and theextreme sensitivity of foals to prematurity. Correctclassication of mares with high-risk pregnancy andregular diagnostic screening for disease may guidetreatment to reduce pregnancy loss and neonataldisease. This review describes diagnostic tech-niques and ndings to facilitate early identicationof mares with compromised pregnancy and rapid,preterm diagnosis of disease (Table 4).

McGladdery, BVMS, CertESM, MRCVS A wide variety of disease conditions can affect the pregnant mare and her fetus in the later stages of gestation. Many of these conditions can have a signicant impact on fetal health and result in a poorperinatal outcome. Therefore, recognizing problems in these so-called \"high-risk\" pregnant mares canallow the adoption of treatment and management strategies to help improve the nal outcome. Broadlyspeaking, conditions originate either from abnormalities related to fetoplacental development or as aconsequence of maternal disease conditions. These conditions may result in a high risk of compromisingthe pregnancy and a poor outcome, ranging from abortion or stillbirth to a premature, dysmature, or sickneonatal foal. The disease mechanisms affecting the fetus are usually related to hypoxia, infection, ordisturbance of normal growth and development. Conditions can be divided into having either aninfectious or non-infectious etiology. This paper will concentrate on diagnosing those conditions with anon-infectious etiology, particularly those involving placental and umbilical address: common are pregnancy-related problems? There are no worldwide surveys that specicallyreview the incidence of pregnancy-related diseaseconditions in mares. However, the most recent sur-vey of pregnancy loss in Thoroughbred mares in theUnited Kingdom reported an incidence of 4.7% be- tween the October 1st pregnancy examination andfoaling (abortions and stillbirths) with 11.1% occur-ring in mares over 19 years of age. Since the 1990s,several surveys of the causes of abortion, with someincluding perinatal deaths, have been publishedfrom various parts of the world with striking differ-ences noted regionally for the major causes. 1-4 The most notable differences are those losses attrib-uted to bacterial placentitis and umbilical cord re- lated pathology. In the United States more than25% of losses were reported due to bacterial placen-titis but less than 5% to umbilical cord related pa-thology. Conversely, in the United Kingdom nearly40% were attributed to umbilical cord related pa-thology and less than 10% to bacterial placentitis.Surveys from other parts of the world including Aus-tralia and mainland Europe have reported umbilicalcord related causes of abortion at 23% (Australia)and 16.5% (France). It is not known whether these geographical differences are entirely related to the circumstances of equine environment, disease prev-alence, management practices and other factors inthe various localities or because of differences in AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 133IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MARE NOTESbreed distribution or whether differences in diagnos- tic criteria and pathological interpretation are sig-nicant. There is clearly a signicant rate of foalmortality occurring in late pregnancy and this hasnot changed appreciably over the last few years.Also, as these surveys did not include those foalsthat survived despite a compromised pregnancy,morbidity is clearly higher. 2. Diagnostic Examinations and Laboratory Tests Recognizing a compromised pregnancy may be obvi-ous if the pregnant mare is systemically ill, developspremature mammary development and lactation,has a vulvar discharge, develops an increased ab-dominal circumference, or has a very prolonged ges-tation. Some conditions that have a signicantimpact on fetal health and neonatal outcome may bemuch harder to recognize. In contrast to obstetriccare in pregnant women, routine surveillance ofpregnancy (i.e., antenatal blood testing and ultra-sound scanning) is still not normal practice in maresbeyond early pregnancy. Investigation and diagnosis of suspected abnor- malities in pregnancy should focus on the mare'shistory (especially her previous breeding history),physical examination ndings, and assessment oflaboratory parameters, including serum hormoneproling, serum biochemical markers, and milk elec-trolyte analysis. Detailed of the fetusand placenta is performed using transrectal palpa-tion and ultrasound examination as well as trans-abdominal ultrasound examination includingDoppler ultrasonography. A regime of regular fetaland maternal monitoring up until foaling providesadditional information. 3. Hormonal Proling The prepartum rise in maternal serum progesteroneand progestagens in the last month of gestation isassociated with development of the mare's mam-mary gland and a change in mammary secretionelectrolytes. 5Evaluation of serum progesterone concentrations can provide information regarding the fetoplacental status in late pregnancy. Devia-tion from the normal late-term progestagen rise or asudden fall in levels is consistent with fetal compro-mise. Placental abnormality typically causes a pre-mature progestagen rise and then a fluctuatingpattern that does not follow the normal late-termpattern. Single hormone measurements are likelyto be less useful than serial daily or weekly bloodsampling when initially assessing the status andthen monitoring the fetoplacental unit. 6Further - more, different ELISA progesterone assays will givedifferent results depending on the variation in crossreactivity with progesterone and the progestagensfound in any particular test, so it is important to beaware of the normal prole for the assay being used. Estrogen precursors are produced by the fetal go- nads and then aromatized by the placenta to pro-duce which isthe most widely measured estrogen in commerciallaboratories. Although there is some recent evi-dence that changes in estradiol 17 /H9252may be of diag- nostic value in bacterial placentitis, measurement ofestrone sulphate does not appear that useful in pre-dicting potential abnormality, as signicant changedoes not occur until very close to abortion. 7 Recent ndings reported serum progestins and estrogen levels measured with time resolved fluoro-immunoassay from 201 days of gestation untilterm. 8Mares with high progestin and low estrogen concentrations were likely to either abort or deliver a dead foal during mid-to-late gestation. Mareswho were treated either ritodrine for placentitis, or altrenogest and rito-drine if deemed at risk of abortion had a better foaloutcome when concentrations of progestins and es-trogen trended toward normal than those whereconcentrations worsened. Improvements in foaloutcomes were especially evident in mares treatedprior to 290 days of gestation. Results from thisstudy suggest that monitoring progestins and estro-gens, using this technology, could be benecial inpredicting efcacy of therapy and/or pregnancyoutcome. 4. Biochemical Markers A number of biochemical markers have been evalu-ated with alpha feto-protein (AFP) and serum amy-loid A (SAA) of most interest. A recent researchstudy in an induced model of ascending placentitiscompared the rise in maternal serum levels of theacute phase protein SAA in normal pregnancies andthose in an experimental model of induced placenti-tis. Mares with placentitis had signicantly in-creased SAA values that remained high untilabortion whereas successful treatment either pre-vented the SAA rise or decreased its concentrationto baseline and was associated with delivery of ahealthy foal. 9The clinical usefulness of SAA in naturally occurring placentitis and other fetoplacen- tal conditions where inflammation is a feature hasyet to be fully demonstrated. AFP is a glycoprotein manufactured by the fetus and is present in the amniotic fluid and maternalserum of pregnant women. AFP assays are nowpart of mid-trimester prenatal screening programsin pregnant women. High levels of AFP are asso-ciated with neural-tube defects and low levels withchromosomal abnormalities such as Trisomy. 10 A recent study demonstrated that AFP is present inthe fetal fluids of mares during the third trimester ofpregnancy. 11Mares with experimentally induced ascending placentitis had elevated plasma concen- trations of AFP. However, it remains to be deter-mined whether this fetal protein is a useful markerfor spontaneous cases of equine placentitis or otherfetoplacental abnormalities. 134 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREElectrolyte changes in the preterm mammary se- cretions of pregnant mares can be used to help pre-dict fetal maturity and readiness for birth. 12In a normal full-term mare (carrying a mature fetus) mammary secretion calcium concentrations risenear term to a concentration between 20 and 40mmol/L. Sodium and potassium concentrations re-flect serum levels until near term when sodium con-centration falls /H1102120 mmol/L) and potassium concentration rises ( /H1102240 mmol/L) with an inversion in from par-turition. Mammary valuescan be useful indicators inlate gestation with precocious changes and abnor-mal patterns. More recently, mammary secretion pH changes were correlated to imminent parturition. A recentpaper reported a signicant reduction in the pH ofmammary secretions normal foaling mares on theday of foaling P/H11021.0001), and most mares (11/14) with then foaled within 24 hours. 13The mammary secretion pH changes had a good correla- tion with electrolyte changes in predicting the day offoaling. A study in pregnant mares with inducedplacentitis found that the mammary secretion pHchanges did not follow the same patterns as normalpregnancies and pH did not fall as expected prior todelivery. 14 5. Ultrasound Examination for Biophysical Assessment Fetal ultrasound examination allows direct visual- ization of the fetus providing the easiest and mostreliable modality to assess fetal wellbeing. Ultra-sound imaging of the fetus is performed from both atransabdominal and transrectal approach to deter-mine a range of fetal biophysical parameters inhealthy mid-to-late gestation mares. 15-19Biophys - ical parameters include fetal presentation and posi-tion, fetal number, fetal size relative to knowngestational age (by measuring aortic and thoracicdiameter and/or total orbital diameter), and fetalfluid character. The appearance of the fetal fluidsmay indicate abnormalities with increased echoge-nicity (placentitis) or changes in fluid depth (hy-dropic conditions). In addition, the fetoplacentalunit is assessed by evaluating the combined thick-ness of the uterus and placenta (CTUP). Signi-cant increase of the CTUP is often associated with apoor outcome; similarly, edema of the chorioallan-tois may be associated with abnormality. 20,21Con- versely, some signicant placental abnormality may bepresent but remain undetected, possibly due to aninaccessible location for imaging. 22Fetal body and limb movements can be assessed and movement generally is a positive sign, but care should be takennot to mistake periods of fetal sleep in a quiet fetusas being abnormal. Extreme fetal activity can beabnormal and a sudden episode of vigorous move-ment combined with an equally sudden stop in ac-tivity has been associated with fetal death. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and rhythm and FHR reactivityrepresent some of the most sensitive indicators offetal wellbeing. FHR gradually declines, due to in-creasing parasympathetic tone, as gestation pro-gresses. Brief increases occur associated withmovement in the healthy, responsive fetus. FHRaccelerations of 25-40 beats per minute (bpm) forapproximately 30 seconds are usually recorded dur-ing activity. Either sustained bradycardia ortachycardia (i.e., inappropriate for gestational ageor activity) or a wide range in FHR may indicatefetal distress. 22A lack of heart rate variability sug - gests central nervous system (CNS) depression mostlikely due to chronic hypoxia. Fetal organs canbe identied along with other important anatom-ical structures and it may be possible to recognizemajor anatomical abnormality. Doppler ultrasonography has become an indis- pensable tool in human obstetrics for evaluatingpregnancies with conditions such as pre-eclampsia,intrauterine growth restriction, fetal anemia, andumbilical cord abnormalities. Doppler ultrasonog-raphy of the fetal umbilical artery and middle cere-bral artery as well as the maternal uterine artery have become the mainstay of human fetal assess-ment. 23This has led to much interest in the poten - tial value of Doppler ultrasonography in thediagnosis of equine pregnancies. Dopp-ler ultrasonography studies in pregnant mares haveinvestigated the blood flow in the uterine and um-bilical arteries and measured blood flow volume andsemi-quantitative indexes that reflect down streamresistance to blood flow (i.e., resistance index [RI]and pulsatility index). 24,25Uterine artery RI is high (0.85) in early pregnancy and decreases (0.55) between 40 and 150 days and then remains low untilterm. Uterine artery blood flow increases exponen-tially to /H1102218,500 mL/min at term with the largest rise occurring in the third trimester associated withthe majority of fetal growth. These ndings dem-onstrate that the mare's uterine vascular system,similar to in develops into a low-resistance,high-flow circulation during midpregnancy whenthe placenta is well developed and fetal growth isincreasing rapidly. There is evidence supportingreduced uterine artery blood flow in aged mareswith endometrosis. 25Foals delivered from mares with endometrosis had lower birth weights suggest- ing that poorer placentation as a result of endomet-rosis reduced the foals' growth rate. Vascularresistance in the uterine artery is at its greatestearly in pregnancy, as a consequence, blood flow atthe beginning of diastole is reduced and this can beseen as an early diastolic notch in flow velocitywaveforms. The disappearance of the diastolicnotch normally occurs by about 200 days as theplacenta expands and uterine artery perfusion in-creases. 26A mare that aborted due to EHV-1 in - fection was noted to have a late disappearance of the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 135IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREdiastolic notch as did some mares with naturally occurring placentitis.27 6. Twinning Historically, twin pregnancies were the most com-mon cause of pregnancy loss in Thoroughbredmares. 28Twin pregnancies are now uncommon due to well-established twin management regimes during early pregnancy. While late-gestation twinpregnancies are now rare, twins as a cause of latepregnancy complication must still be considered.Abortion or stillbirth of both foals was reported in64.5% of mares carrying twins, 21% delivering onelive foal and 14.5% both foals alive. 28Any with premature mammary development undergoing transabdominal ultrasound examination shouldconrm the pregnancy is a singleton not a twin.Identifying two fetal bodies (especially the presenceof two fetal thoraces and two fetal hearts) and/orapposing chorioallantoic membranes will aid in theidentication of twins. Any mare that has under-gone a late twin reduction procedure (i.e., especiallyif after 100 days of pregnancy) is at risk of fetalcompromise in the surviving twin associated withthe failure of placentation to develop normallywhere the dead twin's placenta had been attached. 29 7. Umbilical Cord Related Pathology The root cause for umbilical cord related pathologyin mares is still not well understood. About 90% ofumbilical conditions in mares are due to excessiveumbilical cord torsion with 10% due to ischemicnecrosis of the chorioallantois. 30There remains a lack of consensus among pathologists regarding the pathological criteria that dene umbilical cord tor-sion. Abortions from cord torsion usually occur be-tween 6 and 8 months of gestation, likely during atime of fetal mobility. If the umbilical cord under-goes rapid and excessive twisting where vascularcompromise is complete, sudden fetal death andabortion will occur. However, it is not known ifcord torsion always causes an acute, total vascularocclusion or if forms of subacute or chronic torsioncan occur with a partial prolonged obstruction toblood supply similar to that which occurs in thehuman fetus. 31Increased cord length (normal cord length in Thoroughbred (TB) mares is 36-83 cm) is known to be a risk factor for cord torsion in equinefetuses. 32There is some evidence that long cords may be more common in males and foals from older mares.33Obstruction of blood flow, even if only temporary, may result in the production of thrombi within the cord vessels. These thrombi may thenblock smaller vessels, most commonly near the cer-vical pole of the placenta, and lead to areas of isch-emic necrosis within the placenta. These casesusually occur later than those of cord torsion, atabout 9-10 months of gestation, and are generallyalways associated with a long cord. Doppler ultra-sound is used in human medicine to identify abnor-malities in umbilical cord blood flow. 34Dopplerultrasonography of the umbilical cord has not been widely studied in late gestational mares and hasproved technically difcult. However, a smallnumber of studies in pregnant mares have shownconsistently, that as pregnancy advances, there is areduction in the RI, in the umbilical arteries, whichmeasures semi-quantitatively the resistance toblood flow in blood vessels downstream to the um-bilical artery being measured. This indicates thatan increase in blood flow is occurring within theplacental vasculature as gestation progresses. 24,35 8. Fetal Hydrops Fetal hydrops is a condition that typically affectsmares in mid-to-late pregnancy. A common pre-sentation is noticeable abdominal enlargement,developing over a few days to a couple of weeks.Although the increase in abdominal size often ap-pears very rapidly, it may also be more insidious innature. Fetal hydrops is the result of an excessiveaccumulation of fetal fluids in either the amniotic(hydrops amnii or or allantoic (hydropsallantois or sionally both compartments may be affected.37 Hydramnios cases are reported to have a slowerprogression of fluid buildup, and therefore slowerabdominal enlargement. Severe and rapid abdom-inal enlargement is more commonly noted in mareswith hydrallantois. The production and regulationof allantoic and amniotic fluid is complicated and theetiology of hydrops remains unclear. Both forms ofhydrops may be associated with congenital defectsand altered fetal swallowing, secondary to a cleftpalate or neurological dysfunction, has been sug-gested as an explanation for hydramnios. It isgenerally accepted that dysfunction of the chorioallan-tois is the primary cause in hydrallantois. Leptospi-rosis infection has been reported related to theoccurrence hydrops. 38,39Massive hydrops can precipitate a prepubic tendon rupture or rupture of the body wall and the mare may suffer from uterine iner-tia during delivery as a result of uterine muscularweakness. Other complications of hydropic condi-tions include uterine rupture, abortion, dystocia,retained placenta, and hypovolemic shock. The prog-nosis for survival of the foal from a hydropic pregnancyis poor because of growth restriction from inadequateplacental villous development or from major congeni-tal defects. Clinical signs in hydropic mares can be varied and include inappetance, reluctance to move, and araised heart rate and respiratory rate due to pres-sure on the diaphragm. Inflammatory markers (-brinogen and SAA) and muscle enzymes aspartateaminotransferase (AST) and creatinine kinase (CK)have been reported to be elevated, which may berelated to muscle tearing associated with abdominalwall damage. Classically, the fetus is not palpableby transrectal palpation and the uterus is turgid anddistended above the level of the pelvis. Transrectalultrasound evaluation reveals fetal fluid that may 136 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREappear hyperechoic. In hydramnios, the amniotic membrane may rather than its moreusual undulating appearance. Transabdominal ul-trasound examination is also very useful when dis-tinguishing between conditions contributing toabdominal enlargement in the pregnant mare.In a normal pregnancy, the volume of allantoic fetalfluid ranges from 8 to 18 l and the volume of amni-otic fetal fluid from 3 to 7 l. 39-41Mares suffering from hydrallantois or hydramnios can accumulate massive quantities of fluid within either the allan-toic or amniotic compartments or a combination ofboth with up to 230 l reported for a case of hydral-lantois and up to 96l reported for one case of hy-dramnios. 41,42Determining fluid depth in the amniotic and allantoic compartments can help dis- tinguish between the hydropic conditions and alsomonitoring how fluid depth changes over time.It is reported that allantoic fetal fluid depth aver-ages a maximal vertical depth of 13.4 /H110064.4 cm and 7.9/H110063.5 cm for amniotic fluid. 15Cases of hydrops may have depths of more than 30 cm usually the maximum that can be measured ultrasonographi-cally. Using transabdominal ultrasound guidance,amniocentesis and allantocentesis of fluid samplescan be sampled from the respective compartmentsand analyzed for biochemical constituents to conrmthe origin of the enlarged compartment. This pro-cedure does carry a signicant risk of abortion andshould be performed by experienced veterinarians. 43 Amniotic fluid has higher concentrations of sodium,chloride, and total carbon dioxide and alkaline phos-phatase activity and lower concentrations of fluid.37Calcium, CK, and urea were greater only in allantoic fluid in the few weeks before parturition.44Fetal biophysical parameters may reveal fetal distress with abnor- malities in FHR, evidence of growth restriction, anincreased CTUP and thickening of the chorioallan-tois and amnion from edema. 9. Other Causes of Abdominal Enlargement Abdominal wall rupture and/or rupture of the pre-pubic tendon can also cause abdominal enlargementin pregnant mares. Abdominal wall rupture maybe due to traumatic injury to the abdominal musclesor can be idiopathic in origin. Abdominal wall rup-ture can occur bilaterally or unilaterally, or alongthe ventral midline. Unilateral muscle wall rup-tures are likely to be traumatic in origin. Idio-pathic abdominal wall ruptures are thought to bemore common in draft breeds and older brood-mares. 45Researchers measured normal abdominal muscle thicknesses, with ultrasound, in pregnant mares and reported the results in a study.46The muscle measurements in heavy-type in 2 mares prior to muscle wall rupture that although muscle thicknesses were within thenormal range there were echotextural changes in-cluding increased linear areas of intramuscularedema and increased echogenicity from hemorrhageidentied in the cutaneous trunci and internal ab-dominal oblique muscles. The investigators alsonoted that serum CK, but not AST, levels wereelevated. 46 Prepubic tendon rupture is another cause of ab- dominal enlargement. Ruptured prepubic tendonscan be partial or complete and may be present inassociation with abdominal wall muscle ruptures.Differentiating clinically between partial prepubictendon ruptures and caudoventral muscle rupturesmay be difcult. With complete rupture of the pre-pubic tendon, the udder will drop and rotate crani-ally and hemorrhage will be visible in the mammarysecretions. The mare often develops widespreadedema in the ventral abdomen and mammary gland.Mares with tendon lor-dosis or a \"saw-horse stance.\" 10. Other Placental Conditions Affecting Late Pregnancy Premature placental separation secondary to other placental conditions may be detected during ultra-sound scans assessing fetal wellbeing although theprimary cause can remain unidentied. Rapid pla-cental separation is a feature of acute herpes virusinfection secondary to uteroplacental vasculitis.Separation may also occur toxicosis,mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS) placenti-tis and ischemic necrosis of the cervical pole. Ex-tensive placental separation will result in fetaldeath and abortion or preterm delivery; however,partial separation may be compatible with the preg-nancy continuing toward term. Fetal compromiseas a result of placental compromise occurs from re-duced placental contact resulting in hypoxia. Bodypregnancy is a rare condition that can also result inplacental compromise. Body pregnancy occurswhen the vesicle xates in the uterine body and thedeveloping chorioallantois does not extend normallyinto the pregnant horn. Caudal body pregnanciesare usually lost early in gestation but cranial uter-ine body pregnancies can develop to term. 47Fi- nally, villous atrophy or hypoplasia can be a cause growth restriction and late fetal loss. 48Vil- lous atrophy may correlate with focal disease. Mareswith signicant chronic degenerative endometrialdisease detected prior to becoming pregnant are suitable candidates for late pregnancy monitoringto detect the occurrence of any fetal compromiseearly on. 11. Fetal Deformities A variety of congenital defects occur in foals, some ofthese may be true malformations and have a genetic ortoxic etiology; however, some of the more common con- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 137IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREditions are considered to be deformations due to ab- normal growth and development caused by arestricted \"in-utero\" position. 49Deformations appear much more commonly in foals abnormal presen- tations, such as transverse or caudal presentation.Congenital skeletal deformations may be single ormultiple and include wry nose, cervical and thoracicspinal torticollis, and/or scoliosis. These may also bea consequence of abnormal position during vertebraldevelopment or occasionally true vertebral malforma-tions. Flexural limb deformities are also a commondeformation in foals. 50Other conditions include soft and hard mia, hydrocephalus, There are studies that explain the cause of these defects.The presence of serious fetal defects may result inabortion, stillbirth, or early neonatal demise. Detec-tion and is challenging.Premature mammary development and lactation areoften the rst indicators of impending delivery due tofetal deformity, yet determining the root problem oftenoccurs postpartum. Ultrasound examination and/orDoppler ultrasonography hold the most promise forthe early detection of fetal aberrations. 12. Fescue Toxicity Tall fescue grass, commonly grown in parts of theUnited States, may be infected with an endophyticfungus (Neotyphodium coenophialum) and wheneaten may result in alkaloids, es-pecially ergovaline. Exposure to endophyte toxinshas been associated in late pregnancyincluding placental thickening, edema, and separa-tion, agalactia. Reducedserum progesterone and prolactin levels are presentin the affected mares. 51Foals that survive pro - longed gestation are reported to be emaciated butlarge-framed and dysmature. Fetoplacental ultra-sonography premature placental separation. This latternding has been reported to occur a few hours priorto spontaneous delivery in one study on fescue in-fected mares. 52Abnormal fetal growth and other biophysical parameters indicating compromised fe- tal wellbeing should also be assessed. 13. Prolonged Pregnancy \"Prolonged\" pregnancy more commonly reflects vari-ation in normal gestational length (usually consid-ered to be about 320-365 days) that occurs in themare associated with a variety of factors includingfoaling month of the year (related to photoperiod),foal sex, breed, and intrinsic genetic factors relatedto the individual. Most mares deliver foals within arepeatable gestational length, plus or minus a fewdays. Occasionally, underlying maternal/fetal ab-normality may be responsible, toxico-sis, pituitary and af - fect fetal growth and development while alsoprolonging gestation with the fetus essentially grow-ing at a much slower pace. This may result atfull-term delivery of a small and undersized fetus.Although the 2D ultrasound assessment of fetal sizeis limited by the large size of the late-term equinefetus, useful measurements can be made to assesswhether substantial differences in size are presentto that expected for the known gestational age.A small number of studies have reported serial mea-surements of fetal size in mid-to-late pregnancy us-ing aortic diameter, total orbit dimensions, andthoracic diameters to allow identication of a growthrestricted fetus. 16-19 14. Abnormal Presentation Caudal presentation of the equine fetus is relativelyuncommon, but was reported as the cause of dysto-cia in 14% of cases presented with dystocia to areferral hospital. 54In the same study, 10% of mares with d ystocia were attributed to transverse fetal presentation of which a greater proportionwere in draft breeds. Routine late-term ultra-sound examination can be used to conrm normal,cranial fetal presentation after 9 months' gesta-tion. Transrectal ultrasound examination can beused to identify the fetal cranium and fetal orbitsnear the pelvic inlet. Transabdominal ultra-sound examination will identify a fetus in cranial presentation in a ventral position by identifying thefetal heart in the mare's caudal abdomen with thefetal abdominal contents located in the mare's cra-nial abdomen. 15. Maternal Risk Factors Although the possible effect on the fetus of a widerange of maternal conditions, such as acute abdom-inal crisis (e.g., gastrointestinal colic/intestinal dis-placements, colitis, uterine torsion, rupture wall rupture/hernia),severe maternal disease (e.g., neoplasia, inflamma-tory bowel disease, chronic grass sickness, Cushingsdisease, Chronic heaves or recurrent airway ob-struction) and severe orthopedic disease (e.g., lami-nitis, septic tenosynovitis, or arthritis) may beobvious, the impact on fetal wellbeing is not wellunderstood. 55-62Studies of fetal physiology in late gestation have shown that the normal metabolic relationship between the mare and her fetus isnely balanced, indicating that equine fetal growthand development will be very sensitive to distur-bances originating from maternal disease. In lategestation, the equine fetus is very reliant on glucosemetabolism and has a limited capacity for endoge-nous glucose production and also a limited ability toswitch to alternative fuels when glucose availabilityis suddenly reduced during, for example, the acutematernal fasting that might occur in a severely ill 138 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREpregnant mare.63Similarly, fetal oxygenation must be maintained and maternal problems that affect uterine circulation may have signicant det-rimental effects. Maternal endotoxemia and theproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators in mater-nal disease will clearly have the potential for a rangeof negative effects on the fetus. Finally, maternaldrug therapies, which may be essential for treat-ment of maternal disease and even critical to themare's survival, may have unintended or unknownconsequences on the fetus. 64Although some stud - ies have investigated the placental transfer of drugs,in general there is only sparse information on drugmetabolism and safety in pregnant mares and thefetus is considered to be potentially at greater riskdue to its limited ability to metabolize and eliminatethe majority of drugs and compounds it may beexposed to. Monitoring such mares to determinefetal health status is essential. 16. Conclusions Recognizing a potentially compromised pregnancycan be difcult. Maternal and/or fetal conditionsthat threaten pregnancy can occur with fewsigns, thus limiting the ability of a veterinarian tomanage the condition appropriately. However,some conditions are more predictable and adopting apolicy of mid-to-late pregnancy surveillance to de-tect the subtle signs of disease can be rewarding.

These typesinclude ascending placentitis, diffuse placentitis,and nocardioform placentitis (also called focal mu-coid placentitis). The latter two forms of placentitisare less commonly diagnosed and are not as wellcharacterized as ascending placentitis. 2. Types of Placentitis Diffuse placentitis, which is associated with maresaffected by systemic bacteremia or leptospirosis,rarely presents with premonitory signs prior toabortion or delivery of a compromised foal. 3Abor- tions due to leptospirosis account for around 3% ofall abortions and 12% of bacterial abortions. 4,5 In areas with endemic leptospirosis, vaccination ofbroodmares may minimize this condition. A com-mercial vaccine alabeled for use in broodmares has been available since 2015 and has demonstratedsafety in pregnant mares during the second trimes-ter. 6,7When leptospirosis or bacteremia is sus-pected as a result of systemic disease, renal disease, or uveitis, submission of samples for culture re-mains the diagnostic test of choice to identify theparticular serovar of leptospirosis, but the fastidiousnature of the organism in laboratory settings makesthis impractical for clinical use. 3The microscopic agglutination test has good sensitivity and specic-ity for pregnant mares, and can serve as the basisfor institution of appropriate antibiotic and proges-tational therapy. 3 Focal mucoid placentitis is and the ventral uterine body,or occasionally gravid or non-gravid horn, and pene- tration of the organism to the fetal fluids of fetus.Ultrasonographic examination or necropsy examina-tion of the placenta usually will copious,tenacious exudate the chorionic the placenta from the endometrium. Postpartum,cytology of the exudate can easily performed inpractice, which may reveal chain-forming gram-posi-tive bacilli, conrming a clinical diagnosis. However,the characteristic location of ultrasonographic changesshould be considered diagnostic of the disease, partic- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 141IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MARE NOTESularly if the mare exhibits other signs of chronic pla- centitis such as precocious mammary development,endocrine changes consistent with fetoplacental dys-function, or evidence of fetal dysmaturity and stress.Treatment should consist of systemic antibiotics andprogestational therapy described below, paired withintensive gestational monitoring due to the risk ofdystocia or delivery of a weak, compromised foal. Ascending placentitis, with or without fetal sepsis, is the most common infectious cause of pregnancy lossin the mare, accounting for approximately 20% to 40%fetal and neonatal submissions to necropsy laborato-ries worldwide. 1,2,5,12In contrast with the other two conditions, the pathophysiology of this disease is extensively described. Briefly, affected mares fre-quently are multiparous and middle aged to geriatric.They may have poor vulvar conformation, vestibulo-vaginal reflux, or other abnormalities of the caudalreproductive tract that facilitate contamination of thevagina and compromise cervical integrity. 13-15Fecal, urinary, or environmental contaminants thus gain ac- cess to the cranial vagina, ascend through the cervix,and colonize the chorioallantois, causing severe focalnecrotizing inflammation. Common etiologies. From the chorioallantois, bacte-ria have an advantageous starting point from whichthey can travel to the allantoic fluid, umbilical vein,and/or amniotic membrane. The fetus is then ofteninfected by hematogenous spread or through swallow-ing/ aspiration of fetal fluids. 16,17Bacterial migration and subsequent inflammation result in local upregu- lation in proinflammatory cytokines (Il-6, IL-8, andIL-1/H9252), as well as prostaglandin E and prostaglandin F2/H9251(PGF2/H9251) production, and alterations in fetoplacen - tal endocrine production.16-24Alterations of the normal gestational hormonal prole, as well the con- current proinflammatory environment, result in anincreased duration and intensity of propulsive myome-trial activity (contractures) prior to parturition and/orabortion. 25 3. Treatment Due to the far-reaching effects of placentitis,treatment should ideally address the immediateinfectious component of disease, dampen the in-flammatory cytokine response, modulate prosta-glandin production, and restore the progestationalendocrine prole. As such, recommended treat-ment for all forms of placentitis is multimodal, withantibiotics serving as the cornerstone of therapy.Antibiotics are combined with anti-inflammatoryand immune modulatory therapy, hormonal ther-apy, and/or tocolytic therapy (Table 1). Resultsfrom several studies suggest that long-term treat-ment is most effective in combating placentitis inmares. 26-28However, some studies demonstrated equivalent results with a short-term treatment approach (1 to 3 weeks).29,30Unfortunately, in the authors' experience, clinical signs often return within a week or 2 after therapy has been discontin-ued. Pregnancy outcome in these cases is oftennegative. This is supported by evidence that theinciting intrauterine bacteria are frequently noteliminated by antibiotic therapy. 28,31-33Therefore, the authors suggest that therapy should be initi- ated at the time of diagnosis and continued untilfoaling or abortion, particularly if trimethoprim sul-Table 1.

Antibiotics Using models of pregnancy and ascending placen-titis, disposition of antibiotics to the fetus andfetal fluids has been investigated. Penicillin,gentamicin, and TMS each were found in fetalfluids at concentrations that reached or exceededthe minimum inhibitory formany gram-positive that ceftiofur crystalline- free acid and ceftiofur sodium do not readily cross the placenta and do not reach therapeutic concen-trations in the fetal fluids, making it less useful forthe treatment of either ascending or diffuse placen-titis. Recently, work in Illinois demonstrated thatenrofloxacin administered intravenously or orallyalso achieves therapeutic concentrations againstmany organisms in the fetal fluids. 44,45However, despite preliminary reports of potential safety for foals, fluoroquinolones should be used in pregnantmares with extreme caution due to potential carti-lage damage in the resulting offspring. 44-46 It is important to note that sensitivity patterns of clinical isolates can vary considerably and that thein vitro activity of antimicrobials does not necessar- ily translate to in vivo efcacy. Thus, under ideal situations, antibiotic therapy should be institutedbased on culture and sensitivity data and with con-sideration of pathophysiologic environment. In re-ality, obtaining culture and sensitivity data fromeither focal placentitis or diffuse placentitis cases isnot feasible preterm. Furthermore, the severe con-sequences of therapeutic delay in cases of ascendingplacentitis, including abortion, fetal infection andfetal demise, dictate that empiric antibiotic therapybe initiated in almost all cases before culture andsensitivity results are available. As such, the prac-titioner is frequently left to interpret published in vitro sensitivity proles for the organisms of interest and combine these results with known informationabout drug passage into the pregnant reproductivetract in order to select therapy. In evaluating the reported efcacy for common antibiotics in combating Crossiella equi and Amyco- latopsis species, the authors note a shift in the literature over time. Whereas early literature re-ported greater sensitivity of nocardioform organismsto a range of therapeutics, Erol and coworkers 47,48 recently found relatively high resistance patternsamong 60 isolates tested. Amikacin, second- andthird-generation cephalosporins and penicillin be for ciprofloxacin against Crossiella equi and Amy- colatopsis species is nearly four times the peak con- centration of ciprofloxacin that reached the allantoicfluid, which suggests this would be an inappropriateantibiotic choice for nocardioform placentitis. 45,48 In contrast, TMS is able to meet and exceed thosenecessary values in fetal fluids and is the most com- monly recommended antibiotic for mares with no-cardioform placentitis. 28,48 For pregnant mares with leptospirosis, a high dose of penicillin G has been recommended empiri-cally to protect against gestational effects. 49Peni - cillin is highly effective against acute infections ofleptospira organisms and has been shown to reachfavorable concentrations in the placenta, fetal fluids,and fetus. 28,35,36Likewise, favorable distribution to the pregnant uterus should also be taken into account for mares with other systemic diseases dueto the risk of organisms seeding to the placenta orfetus by hematogenous spread. While antibiotic therapy for ascending placentitis should ideally be guided by results of culture andsensitivity obtained from the cervix or cranial va-gina, numerous documented thatStreptococcus equi subsp. Esche- richia coli are the common etiologic agents, and proles of antibiotic sen sitivity for common isolates are available. 37,38Furthermore, because mixed infections and secondary infections are com- mon, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be selected. Based on demonstrated drug penetration, antibi- otic sensitivity testing, and ease of administration,trimethoprim-sulfonamide drugs are the most com-mon antibiotic choice for the spec-trum of activity or drug penetration identied by theGeneric Drug Working Group (M Papich, personal communication). contains trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, and sulfadiazine at a 1:5 ratio. WhileTMP-SDZ is labeled for horses in various formula-tions b,c,dmost in vitro assays for antibiotic sensitivity contain only TMP-SMX and a large body of work re- garding efcacy (across species) and drug distribution exists for this drug, including the equine fetal fluidsand fetus. 35In horses, distribution of TMP-SDZ is described for plasma, pulmonary epithelial cells, and tissue-chambers, among others.39,40Recent work in - vestigating the use of Equisul-SDT demonstratedslightly increased absorption for this suspension com-pared to previously available formulations, resultingin a slightly lower recommended dose (24 mg/kg every12 hours, vs 30 mg/kg every 12 hours) and producedclinical remission of lower airway disease in 59% of112 treated horses compared to 15% of 68 un-treated horses. 41Work from the University of Florida showed a signicant improvement in fetal outcome of experimentally infected ponies in amodel of ascending placentitis after treatment withmultimodal therapy including TMP-SMX. 26In contrast, in support of relatively poor clinical out- comes from mares with naturally occurring ascend-ing placentitis or nocardioform placentitis, work inthe AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 143IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREtreated with TMP-SMX after diagnosis of placentitis via ultrasonography had a negative outcome.31,50 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that TMP- sulfonamide drugs lose potency in the presence ofpurulent material and that horses treated withTMP-SMX or TMP-SDZ remained culture-positivefor the infective organism after prolongedtreatment. 26,32,41,51 Using an ex vivo model of antibiotic activity, the authors recently conrmed that TMP-SMX was in-activated in the face of purulent uterine fluid, as wasgentamicin and ceftiofur. In contrast, in the samemodel, penicillin and gentamicin together retainedactivity in purulent fluid. 33,52Ongoing work in the authors' laboratory has further demonstrated dose- dependent activity of ciprofloxacin in purulent fluid,with bactericidal activity achieved at doses previ-ously in equine allantoic fluid (KA Von Dollen,unpublished data). 53This dynamic is of interest for both ascending placentitis and nocardioform placentitis, which are characterized by necrotizingand It is possiblethat a systemically adm inistered reaches concentrations in uninfected allantoic fluidand fetal tissues sufcient to prevent bacterialspread, but that it is unable to inhibit bacterialgrowth locally in the chorioallantoic space. It maybe necessary to add additional antibiotics, such aspenicillin with gentamicin, or a fluoroquinolone tohave an immediate Immune Modulating Therapies Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) therapy iscommonly recommended for clinical cases of placen-titis. Prostaglandins are produced in response toinflammation through conversion of by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes includingCOX-1 and COX-2. 54These prostaglandins, turn, promote uterine contractility and premature delivery. Flunixin meglumine has been shown tomitigate the effects of endotoxin in mares in earlygestation, abating prostaglandin production and promoting pregnancy maintenance. 55This was conrmed ex vivo in placental placentitis with rocoxib, a COX-2-selective NSAID, utilizing a loading dose of 0.3 mg/kg bymouth, followed by 0.1 mg/kg by mouth every 24hours for the remainder of gestation. Mares whoreceived rocoxib the fluid, as compared to un - treated animals. Pentoxifylline is an immune modulator with mul- tiple potential modes of action, including decreasingthe release of cytokines, enhancingblood flow, that pentoxifylline crossed the fetal membranes andachieved high concentrations in the fetal fluids. Subsequently, the same group included pentoxifyl-line in a multimodal treatment protocol consisting ofTMP-SMX (30 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours),pentoxifylline (8.5 mg/kg by mouth every 12 hours),and altrenogest (0.088mg/kg by mouth once daily). 26 Mares with experimentally induced ascending pla-centitis that were treated with this protocol hadsignicantly higher foaling rates compared to un-treated mares. 26 However, subsequent work in the authors' labora- tory found that pentoxifylline did not suppress prosta-glandin by placental tissue exposed toendotoxin or heat-killed Streptococcus zooepidemicus and did not modulate uterine arterial blood flow inpregnant pony mares treated with pentoxifylline (17mg/kg by mouth every 24 hours). 20,61Thus, the mechanism of action for any treatment effect of pen- toxifylline is undetermined. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has also demon- strated promising results for pregnancy support inmares. It has long been shown to inhibit plateletaggregation and increase blood flow in humans, andis used as a preventative of pregnancy-induced hy-pertension, mares withexperimentally induced placentitis and producednine viable foals compared to none in the controlgroup. A recent study found that the total arterialblood flow was signicantly higher in late-termmares receiving acetylsalicylic acid compared to con-trols receiving lactulose. 66 Clinically, most practitioners include a NSAID in any treatment regimen for placentitis with theintent of suppressing prostaglandin production.Although not as well as flunixin me-glumine and rocoxib in equine placentitis, ace-tylsalicylic acid has an additional potential benetof enhancing uterine blood flow. 66In addition, while its mechanism of action has not been rmly established, disposition and efcacy of pentoxifyl-line in mares with placentitis is supported bytwo studies by Macpherson and coworkers 26,27and it may promote pregnancy maintenance through complementary mechanisms, such as inhibition ofbacterial adherence, modication of fetal cytokineexpression. and other tocolytic agents are widelyused in the treatment of preterm labor in women.In mares, limited studies have investigated thesafety or efcacy of tocolytic agents. Palmer andcoworkers were unable to inhibit parturition withclenbuterol, and at this time only progestins areused routinely for tocolysis in mares. 67The ratio - nale for this therapy stems from the role progestinsplay in inhibiting formation of myometrial gapjunctions and prostaglandin secretion (the so-called 144 2019 /H11408Vol. PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MARE\"progesterone block\"). In women, clinical data clearly demonstrate that progestins are effective atpreventing preterm labor. 68-74Likewise, in mares it is well-described that a decrease in progesterone frequently precedes abortion or fetal demise,whereas mares with elevated progestogens have arelatively better prognosis. 21-23During early preg - nancy, altrenogest was shown to prevent pregnancyloss in mares treated with the synthetic prostaglan-din analogue cloprostenol during early pregnancy. 75 Work in other laboratories has shown that treat-ment with altrenogest in combination with TMP-SMX and pentoxifylline improved foal survival,whereas treatment with TMP-SMX and pentoxifyl-line alone did not. 26,27On the contrary, work from Aurich's laboratory76,77has suggested that indis - criminate use of delay foal deliveryand increase neonatal risk. Furthermore, somestudies in mares with experimentally induced pla-centitis have found that administration of altreno- gest provided no benet over TMP-SMX andnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy alone. 28,29 Further work is needed to demonstrate both effec-tiveness and safety, and to clarify the mechanism ofaction for this treatment approach. In the mean-time, because it is viewed as safe and may delaypremature delivery, progestins are widely acceptedas a key component of therapy for any mare that isat risk for abortion. 14,26,78-80 Adjunctive Therapy Several studies have demonstrated a decrease inestrogens prior to abortion in natural and experi-mental gestational disease. 24,81Recently, work by Canisso and colleagues29,82investigated the - tiveness of estradiol cypionate as a substitute foraltrenogest or an adjunct to commonly utilized therapeutic regimens. Although no difference wasseen in overall foal survival at parturition or at 60days of age, which combination ofTMP-SMX, flunixin meglumine, altrenogest, and/orestradiol cypionate their dams had foals and a morenormal peripartum model. 29,82Thus, if docu - mented in a larger group of mares and/or cases ofnaturally occurring placentitis, addition of an estro-gen may improve neonatal health of high-risk foals. 4. Pregnancy Management After diagnosis and initiation of therapy, manage-ment of mares with placentitis frequently consists ofa regular monitoring program. This may includeany combination of ultrasonographic examination,serum progesterone assay, estrogen assay and should always be grounded inan overall health assessment of the mare duringeach examination. The prognostic value of sero-logic screening has not been evaluated critically.However, monitoring should be performed at leastintermittently in order to ensure that therapy isdiscontinued in the event of fetal death in order to promote cervical dilation and complete uterineclearance. 5. Postpartum Diagnostic Tests and Management Placental Evaluation Evaluation of the placenta may provide critical clues to the health status of a foal or the cause of abortion.This may guide the clinician in postpartum treat-ment choices for both the dam and the foal. As-cending bacterial placentitis presents as athickening and discoloration of the caudal chorio-allantois around the cervical star, while focal mu-coid placentitis is frequently located in the ventralbody near Histologically, infectedplacentae are characterized by suppurative, necro-tizing placentitis. Umbilical inflammation (funisi-tis) may be noted in cases of ascending or diffuseplacentitis, but rarely in cases of focal mucoid pla-centitis. Premature separation of the fetal mem-branes occurs more frequently in cases of ascendingplacentitis and evidence of an intact, thickened cer-vical star and placental rupture distad should potential hypoxia. fetal membranes are more common in maresthat experienced placentitis, and failure to identifythe entirety of both horns should dictate a moreintensive health screening of the mare. Uterine Culture Uterine culture can be performed immediately afterfoaling to evaluate treatment efcacy and guidepostpartum antibiotic choice. It should be notedthat the uterine environment is expected to be con-taminated during foaling and the postpartum uterusrepresents an excellent growth environment for bac-teria. Consequently, a positive culture is expectedin many mares 6 to 24 hours after foaling and anti-biotic treatment may not be needed for uterineclearance. 31,83,84In the authors' laboratory, mares with documented intrauterine streptococci at abor- tion or foaling were allowed to rest for one estrouscycle without treatment and were culture negativeat 30 days after foaling (unpublished data). 6. Treatment of the Postpartum Mare and Foal After Placentitis Treatment protocols for postpartum mares experi- encing placentitis have not been critically evaluated.Empirical treatments may be clinician and mare-dependent and can include a combination of uterinelavage, ecbolic therapy, antimicrobial, and anti-in-flammatory therapies. Uterine lavage is institutedto aid in removal of uterine debris and residualmicrobes. In some practices, mares receive a single large- volume lavage (6 to 12 L of non-sterile isotonic salinesolution via guarded nasogastric tube, repeated un-til the efflux begins to be clear, generally in 2 to 8 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 145IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREcycles. This results in total lavage volumes of 12 to 48 L) at 24 to 48 hours postpartum. If the mare isconned to a stall or has an excess ( /H110222 cm in depth) of intrauterine fluid visible on transrectal ultra-sound, oxytocin (5 to 20 units in the muscle every4 to 6 hours) can aid in fluid evacuation from theuterus. Mares with evidence of periparturienttrauma, retained fetal membranes, or poor uterineinvolution are administered broad-spectrum antimi-crobial therapy for 5 to 7 days after foaling, andanti-inflammatory therapy for 3 to 5 days afterfoaling. The importance of proactive neonatal diagnostic and therapeutic intervention in foals born to mareswith placentitis cannot be overemphasized, but isbeyond the scope of this manuscript.

Rose et al 1reported a 4.5% pregnancy loss rate in Thoroughbred mares (including stillbirths)in the last third of gestation. Although improve-ments have been made in the reproductive efciencyof broodmares, advances have largely been achievedin early pregnancy. 1 Furthermore, knowledge of normal fetal physiology and the pathophysiology of the disease processes thataffect the late-term fetus is challenged by a limitedability to study this period of equine pregnancy. Inhuman obstetrics, monitoring of fetoplacental and ma-ternal health is routine for all unborn babies duringpregnancy, but this is still not generally the case withequine pregnancies. Some clinicians do adopt ultra-sonographic examination protocols that routinelymonitor placental thickness (CTUP) from mid-latepregnancy and then treat accordingly. 2,3However, more commonly, mares are assigned to empirical treatment regimens based on perceived risk. As un-derstanding and knowledge improves, hopefully moreclinicians will adopt strategies that have a sound clin-ical and evidence-based approach. A recent study as-sessed a rapid examination protocol (REP) todetermine the accuracy of a more simplied approachfor determining fetal wellbeing in late pregnancy, which might be more practical in a eld setting forscreening large numbers of mares quickly. 4In this study, 129 late-term pregnant mares were scannedtransabdominally, twice in their last month of preg-nancy to determine either the equine biophysical pro-le (EBP) or a new, REP to determine how accuratethey were. The REP measured only fetal heart rate,fetal aortic diameter and the combined thickness ofthe uteroplacental unit and took between 5 and 15minutes for each exam. At term, 27 fetuses werecompromised and 102 mares had healthy asymptom-atic foals. Statistical analyses showed slight differ-ences in test sensitivity (81.5% and 85%), specicity(83% and 87%), and accuracy (83% and 87%) for EBPand REP, respectively. The authors concluded thatboth the EBP and REP were of value for the diagnosisof fetal abnormalities and useful for routinely moni-toring the fetuses of late-term, pregnant mares. 4 A number of signicant problems can occur during the latter stages of pregnancy that place either themare or her fetus or both with a high risk of a poor outcome. This paper will discuss managing thosewith predominantly non-infectious origins to try and improve the likelihood of a favorable outcome forboth the mare and her foal. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 149IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MARE NOTES2. Twin Pregnancies Survival of twin equine fetuses to term is limited. Although early pregnancy detection with the ultra-sound scanning and manual twin \"crush\" by 16 daysfrom ovulation has largely eliminated twin pregnan-cies, very occasionally, twins may be missed andpresent as a complication in mid-to-late preg-nancy. Several management tools for reducingtwins to a singleton pregnancy exist from earlypregnancy to days' ultrasound-guided cardiac puncture. 5For twin pregnancies that exceed these periods of gesta- tion, options are limited and termination of the preg-nancy is generally always recommended. If twinssurvive to late gestation, the likelihood of both oreven one surviving and proving viable is relativelyunusual, especially if an equine athlete is required.In a study of 124 sets of twins, only 35.5% of maresdelivered live single or twin foals, of which only 18foals lived more than 2 weeks. 6Severe growth re - striction and often prematurity are very likely toresult in small, weak individuals that initially strug-gle to survive and may suffer signicant complica-tions. Including failure of ossication of the smallcuboidal bones in the knees and hocks especially,that will impact negatively on future athletic ability.The mare is also at much higher risk of dystocia andsubsequent reduced fertility during the followingbreeding season. Historically there have been very few reports of successful maintenance of twin pregnancies withone surviving twin and one mummied fetus. 7-9 Despite their small size at birth, surviving foalswere delivered alive and apparently thrived. Thisscenario is a rare outcome that requires vigilantmonitoring of pregnancy and parturition, and exten-sive client education regarding the risks and costsinvolved for both the mare and foal. In the event oftwo live twins that continue to grow into late gesta-tion, the risks of a catastrophic ending are substan-tial and pregnancy termination is recommended. 3. Umbilical and Placental Conditions That Affect Late Pregnancy Umbilical cord torsion is most likely a sudden, rapid event, without any premonitory signs, and fre-quently results in abortion. There is some evidencethat Doppler ultrasonography is of value for assess-ing umbilical torsion in human babies and thereforemight be useful for screening mares. 10,11Few stud - ies, to date, conrm that this technique has suf-cient sensitivity or specicity to be of value indetecting umbilical cord torsion in equine fetuses.There are currently ongoing epidemiological studiesattempting to better understand the etiology of cordtorsion and identify potential risk factors. 12Pres- ently, pregnant mares with suspected risk for um-bilical cord torsion undergo empirical therapeuticpractices that are aimed at maintenance of preg-nancy. Individual mares may be enrolled on a monitoring program if they have had more than oneloss, but these are likely to concentrate on CTUPand other fetal biophysical parameters, but are notusually targeted specically at reducing the risk ofcord torsion. Research studies have shown that placental pro- gesterone production releases neuroactive steroidsinto the fetal circulation. 13These are responsible for maintaining a sleep-like behavioral state in the fetus during pregnancy and there has been somespeculation that altrenogest treatment may have asimilar effect and might lessen the risk of cord tor-sion by reducing fetal mobility. This premise hasbeen suggested as a reason for differences in inci-dence of umbilical cord torsion between the UnitedKingdom and North America. Although the effect of severe cord twisting is obvi- ous, the consequences of milder or intermittent cordtwisting is unknown in horses, but is recognized inhuman pregnancies. 14Constricted blood flow may lead to production of thrombi within the umbilical vessels which can be a factor in the development ofischemic necrosis of the placenta. Aspirin (acetylsal-icylic A 2synthesis. Low-dose aspirin therapy is used in pregnant women for the treatment of pre-eclampsia to improve uterine andplacental perfusion and preventing microthrombi for-mation. 15A recent study utilizing Doppler ultrasono - graphic measurement of blood flow in the uterinearteries of mares showed that uterine perfusion wasimproved by twice-daily administration o f5go f oral aspirin. 16These ndings suggest prophylactic aspi - rin therapy might reduce the risk of thrombi forma-tion, causing cord torsion and ischemic necrosis of theplacenta. Pentoxifylline also shows promise for improving uterine perfusion. A study by Ousey and co-workers 17demonstrated that long-term treatment with pentoxifylline (from 50 to 120 days of gestation) resulted in increased uterine artery blood flow inyoung pregnant mares. Improved blood flow wasdocumented during treatment and through to theend of pregnancy. Similar effects were not identi-ed in aged mares with endometrosis, a populationof mares that would benet most from increaseduterine blood flow. An interesting nding from thisstudy was the increased placental vascular resis-tance after pentoxifylline treatment caused an un-wanted reduction in placental blood flow. Thus abetter understanding of what effects pentoxifyllinemight have on uterine blood flow is needed to deter-mine whether the drug might have harmful effectson the fetus. Additional therapies for equine pregnancies af- fected by disturbed placental blood flow oftenmimic those used for mares with bacterial placen-titis due to the similarity in clinical signs. Pla- centitis treatment protocols commonly includecombinations of antimicrobials, altrenogest (double 150 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 the placenta and fetus may be of benet. 4. Fetal Hydrops and Other Causes of Acute Abdominal Enlargement Although a rare problem, acute abdominal enlarge- ment is a risk to the mare's health and wellbeing aswell as the fetus. The main differential diagnosesto consider for acute abdominal enlargement arefetal hydrops, and abdom-inal wall also be the cause of prepubic tendon ruptureand or abdominal wall muscle rupture and thusabdominal enlargement can result from more thanone condition. Common clinical signs for acute abdominal en- largement in most of these conditions include de-pression, inappetence, a reluctance to move, anincreased heart and respiratory rate, and a deepplaque of ventral abdominal edema. Of particularconcern is abdominal wall rupture with pain andlocal swelling or hemorrhage in the soft tissues as-sociated with muscle tearing. Evidence of mam-mary gland pain, hemorrhagic discharge in milksecretions thepubis) indicate a potential prepubic tendon rupture. Deciding on how to manage abdominal enlarge- ment will depend on identifying the cause and se-verity of the condition. In the case of hydropicconditions, the potential congenital fetal defects andfetal growth restriction jeopardize fetal survival.However, if the hydrops mare presents with minoror slow-developing abdominal enlargement, then fe-tal assessment and monitoring the progress of fluidaccumulation may be a possible approach. An im-portant concern with abdominal enlargement is therisk of prepubic tendon rupture/abdominal wallmuscle rupture, so deciding to manage the hydropicpregnancy is unusual. In most cases, the diagnosisof hydrops is not in doubt and the negative fetalbiophysical parameters or identication of fetal de-fects during ultrasonographic examination conrmthe priority is the mare's health over that of herfetus. Where there is a potential for imminent pre-pubic tendon rupture, urgent termination of thepregnancy is indicated to prevent signicant injuryto the mare. The scenarios where one might consider continu- ing to full term in an attempt to save the foal are ifthe pregnant mare is close to term (ideally over 300days' gestation), the fetal hydrops involves smallervolumes of excess fluid, and ultrasonographic as-sessment of fetal wellbeing has not identied anyfetal anatomical defects, and the fetal biophysicalparameters are normal. In this circumstance, itis still extremely important to know whether thefoal's survival supersedes the risk to the mare's sur- vival, of her continuing to carry the pregnancy.In one report of hydrops amnion, a Thoroughbredmare was managed carefully from 265 days' days' gestation, resulting in a live foal. 18The mare's abdomen was supported by a belly wrap, she was treated with altrenogest and flunixin meglu-mine, and hand walked carefully. The mare wasalso monitored for pain, increased abdominal cir-cumference (monitoring weight increase would havebeen helpful, if possible) and ultrasound changes inher prepubic tendon and abdominal muscles. Fetalmonitoring of heart rate only revealed abnormalvariations close to delivery. Milk electrolyte valueswere precociously elevated and had an abnormalpattern for about 2-3 weeks before delivery. Deliv-ery was assisted during hospitalization, and the foalwhen born was very weak, weighed only 28 kg, andhad signicant bilateral carpal valgus requiring sur-gery as an older foal. Factors to consider in a caselike this are not only survival, but the probability ofthe foal developing into a competitive athlete. Reducing the risk of prepubic tendon rupture (or a partial tear becoming a complete one) and abdomi-nal muscle wall rupture with some form of abdomi-nal support in abdominal enlargement cases is wellworth considering. The mare's overall demeanormay also improve if abdominal support makes hermore comfortable. The simplest method, and onethat is most likely to be readily available, is a bellywrap in the form of several rolls of wide elasticbandage applied from behind the mare's withers toher flanks in an overlapping pattern. The bandag-ing should be comfortably tight and changed on al-ternate days to allow assessment for skin rubs andpressure sores. The other alternatives are com-mercially available belly bandages used commonlypost-operatively after colic surgery or Caesareansection. Although relatively expensive, they are re-usable and can be washed to keep them clean.The bandage can also be removed easily to allowshort rest periods. Commercial belly bandages areeasy to adjust with respect to both size and t andtherefore likely to be more comfortable. If a decision for termination of the pregnancy has been made, the recommended technique is a combi-nation of controlled transcervical drainage of fetalfluid followed by assisted vaginal delivery of thefetus. 19In most cases, the foal is delivered alive and is euthanized. The use of controlled drainage is important to prevent sudden, massive, splanchnicpooling of blood, hypovolemic shock, collapse, andpossibly death of the mare. Fetal fluid drainage isperformed once the mare has been prepared. Rapidintravenous access is established by placing unilat-eral or bilateral jugular catheters and attaching anambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) to allow easymonitoring of heart rate and to detect any arrhyth-mias. Where euthanasia of the fetus is certain, themare can be injected with 250-500 mcg cloprostenol12 hours before commencing drainage, although the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 151IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREmare will have to be monitored closely overnight to ensure she does not start foaling prematurely so itmay be best avoided in an ambulatory setting.There is the disadvantage if this does occur thatcontrolled drainage will be made more difcult.The mare's tail is bandaged her perineum cleanedand Caslick's suturing opened if necessary. Thecervix is then treated to produce relaxation by ap-plying directly either 1 mg prostin E-2 (PGE-2 gel) a, 400-600 /H9262g lubricant or hyoscine butylbromide (60 mg)cmixed with sterile lubricant. The cervix can be manually evaluated (after 30 min to a few hours, depending on the product used) for softening prior toinduction of delivery. The cervix can be manuallydilated further, but it is important not to over dilatethe cervix thus compromising controlled drainage offluid. If only partial drainage is desired, then cer-vical dilation should be avoided. Once the chorio-allantois can be palpated, transcervically, a sharptrocar (24-32F) dis used to carefully puncture the membrane. In the case of hydramnios, the amni- otic membrane will also have to be penetrated.A small-bore stomach tube or cuffed catheter eis placed in the fetal fluid compartment and fluid slowly siphoned off. The tube can be capped peri-odically to slow fluid removal, which should take atleast 30 minutes but 1-2 hours is more ideal. Themare's heart rate is monitored during the procedureand drainage can be reduced or stopped if she be-comes tachycardic or shows signs of potential col-lapse. Systemic support is provided, concurrentlywith fluid drainage, in the form of colloids (plasma,whole blood) or hypertonic saline followed by crys-talloid fluids. With careful drainage it may be un-necessary to treat the mare with fluid therapy;however, approximately 25% of the fluid volume re-moved generally has to be replaced. The fetal fluidis collected in buckets to allow approximate calcula-tion of the total volume of fluid removed. Samplesof fluid can be submitted for laboratory analysis andmicrobial culture. When sufcient fluid has been drained and the mare is stable, then assisted vaginal delivery can beundertaken to deliver the fetus. With hydropicconditions, the mare usually experiences uterine in-ertia due to the extreme stretching of the uterinemusculature. The fetus is likely to suffer from po-sitional and postural abnormalities requiring inter-vention and assistance with delivery. Oxytocin(10-20 IU, IV) may be needed to encourage uterinecontractions; however, uterine stretching with hy-drops can affect responsiveness to oxytocin (Mc-Gladdery, personal observation). Depending on thestage of gestation that the pregnancy termination isperformed, the response to oxytocin can be reducedrelative to that at full term when there is upregula-tion of oxytocin receptors and the mare's uterusbecomes very sensitive to even very low doses ofoxytocin. 20,21Although the foal is likely to be rela - tively small, care is needed to ensure the mare'scervix is sufciently dilated to avoid cervical tearing when delivering the fetus. In some cases, a con-trolled vaginal delivery under general anestheticmay be necessary to deliver the fetus. Undergoinga general anesthetic when the mare is at risk ofcirculatory collapse is clearly not ideal. Mostmares will retain their fetal membranes after deliv-ery, and this condition will need to be managedcarefully to avoid the risk of toxic metritis-laminitissyndrome. Medication with broad-spectrum anti-biotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and oxytocin islikely to be necessary. Some mares experiencevarying degrees of colic following delivery, possiblydue to the creation of a large amount of space withinthe abdominal cavity following removal of the hugevolume of fluid and large-bowel repositioning. De-spite the potential for problems, mare survival isnormally very good. The incidence of recurrence ina subsequent pregnancy is low although, the authordoes have experience of one mare that had hydropsamnion on 3 separate occasions. If the hydrops mare presents in late pregnancy (within 2-4 weeks of full term) some clinicians haveattempted partial fluid drainage to reduce the vol-ume of fetal fluids thus lessening the risks to themare while also salvaging the pregnancy. Themare is carefully monitored and managed until de-livery with the hope that the foal may have reachedsufcient maturity by the time of delivery so that itwill be able to survive. 22 If partial fluid drainage is chosen, the procedure is very similar to that described for fluid drainageprior to pregnancy termination. Following partialfluid removal, administration of broad-spectrum an-timicrobials to mares is prudent to combat infectionthat may be introduced during drainage, particu-larly because the cervical plug is compromised withthe procedure. Treatment with non-steroidal quiescence andmodify the inflammatory response is necessary.This study reported no success in treating 10 mares,who were 2-4 weeks from full term, with partialdrainage from the allantoic compartment and alldelivered nonviable foals. The authors suggestedfetal demise was most likely from iatrogenic fetopla-cental infection and fetal asphyxia due to associatedplacental separation. 22 In any mare that appears imminently at risk of rupturing her prepubic tendon or suffering a severeabdominal wall rupture, the best option may be toterminate the pregnancy rather than risk the mare'sfuture usefulness as a broodmare. The mare'sability to carry a future foal and deliver normallyagain would be highly questionable and resortingto embryo transfer or other assisted reproductiontechniques might be the only option available ifthe relevant breed regulations allowed. However,pregnancy management can be successful. 23This study reported on managing 13 pregnant mares 152 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREwith either a body wall hernia only or both a prepu- bic tendon rupture and a body wall hernia. Theyfound no difference in prognosis based on the type ofcondition and had better results in mares managedconservatively than those that had intervention byeither induction of parturition or Caesarean. Con-servative management involved support for themare and frequent monitoring of fetal wellbeing.The mare's management comprised of abdominalsupport, as described previously for mares with hy-drops, using commercial belly bandages or wraps,analgesia provided by nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-tory drugs and stable or stall rest (with careful handwalking to reduce ventral edema). Some mares canbecome very painful and may need additional painrelief from drugs such as intravenous lidocaine con-tinuous infusion or butorphanol injection (0.01-0.04mg/kg, IV this drug has a fairly immediate effectand to maintain analgesia requires injecting every 3hours). If the mare's condition can be stabilized,then the pregnancy can continue to progress to-wards full term allowing the fetus to reach full ma-turity without the need for intervention. Serialultrasound monitoring to detect any worsening of apartial prepubic tendon rupture or the size and ex-tent of abdominal muscle ruptures is useful in de-termining the course of action and the prognosis.Frequent fetal monitoring to determine fetal wellbe-ing is important, with regular ultrasound examina-tions, to determine fetal biophysical parameters anddetect any deterioration in fetal health that mightlead to the need for sudden intervention. Monitoring the change in maternal serum proges- terone (and progestagens) concentrations and mam-mary secretion electrolyte values can help conrmthe fetus is starting to reach a state of readiness forbirth similarly, ensuring that the mare has a fullyattended delivery and any assistance necessary isimmediately available is crucial to a good outcome.In the review of cases reported by Ross and co-authors, 7 of 8 mares allowed to foal naturally did sowithout any signicant assistance. 23These nd - ings were in contrast to the often held view thatinduction of parturition or Caesarean section is anecessity for mares with prepubic tendon conditions.Monitoring for evidence of fetal readiness for birth isparticularly helpful in these cases as decisions aboutthe need for intervention, should the mare's condi-tion suddenly deteriorate, can be balanced with arisk assessment of whether the fetus is sufcientlymature and ready for birth. The foal requires anactive hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axisfor nal organ maturation and to ensure postnatalsurvival. Generally speaking, the aim is to alwaystry and maintain the pregnancy beyond 300 days ofgestation; few foals will survive if born prior to this.Nonetheless, even if this milestone is reached, thelikelihood of a sufcient level of maturity for sur-vival is not guaranteed. In some cases, stimulating early fetal maturation may be wise if the situation in the mare deterioratesor the fetoplacental environment deteriorates to such an extent that the foal has a better chance ofsurvival if delivered. Researchers have investi-gated the use of dexamethasone to promote fetalmaturity. In one recent study, healthy Thorough-bred mares were treated for 3 days with 100 mgintramuscular dexamethasone from day 315-317 ofgestation. Mares were allowed to deliver foals nat-urally. The length of pregnancy was shortened intreated mares, on average, by nearly 2 weeks com-pared with normal, foaling mares. The time be-tween the last administration of dexamethasone andfoaling ranged from 1 to 8 days in the treated mares.Maternal serum progestagens rose signicantly dur-ing the 3 days of treatment, indicating a responseconsistent with activation of the fetal HPA axis.Although, there was evidence of suppression of fetaladrenocortical activity, all the foals were healthy atbirth. Foals from treated mares were signicantlysmaller than foals from normal, foaling mares.None of the treated mares suffered any untowardsequelae, such as laminitis, although all mares hadpoor udder development and did not produce normal colostrum. 24There is a concern that in systemi - cally ill mares who may already have raised cortisoland progestagen levels, and are therefore possiblyalready stimulating activation of the fetal HPA axis,that any maternal treatment with dexamethasonemay disrupt HPA axis induced fetal maturation.This might lead to a disturbance in the nal mat-uration of vital organ systems with the conse-quence that the fetus is ill-prepared for postnatallife. Despite these concerns, and albeit in a smallnumber of clinical cases, high-dose dexametha-sone treatment has been considered advantageousfor salvaging pregnancies in selected cases. Antic-ipating that about 5 days will be needed on averagefor the treatment to be effective must be borne inmind if electing to use this regime. Evidence ofsuspected activation of the fetal HPA axis can bedetermined by checking for elevated serum proge-stagens and full-term milk electrolyte proles in themare prior to treatment. Ideally, the results willindicate there is no evidence of fetal maturation.If the results indicate signicant HPA axis activitymay already be occurring, the negative effects ofdexamethasone treatment should be factored in asthis may signicantly worsen the fetal outcome.If possible, allowing the mare to foal spontaneouslywill give her foal the best opportunity to havereached a level of readiness for birth that results init being sufciently mature to be able to survivepostnatally. However, if circumstances dictatethat urgent induction of foaling or a Caesarean isindicated, this is normally when the mare is in animminently terminal state, the likely degree of ma-turity of the foal can also be anticipated by monitor-ing the change in maternal serum progestagen AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM Diagnosing gross physical fetal deformity, abnormalities, during ultra-sonographic examination is very difcult in lategestation because of the large size and position andposture of the fetus in utero. The fetus is normallyin anterior presentation, lying in dorsal or dorsolat-eral recumbency, with the cranial thorax often sur-prisingly far from pelvic brim. When scanningtransabdominally from the mare's ventral abdomenthe fetal caudal abdomen and quarters disap-pear, dorsally and relatively cranially in the mare'sabdomen towards her spine, and out of view. Withthe mare's large bowel acoustically shadowing thisregion, it is not possible to image the entire fetalskeleton. Also, because the foal lies often withsome degree of body curvature and its limbs flexedat the carpus or tarsus, it is very difcult to diagnosecontracture of the distal limbs or spinal scoliosiswith any certainty. Occasionally cranial defectssuch as hydrocephalus or omphalocoele with thebowel floating in the fetal fluids may be identied.However, the circumstances of discovering a defor-mation may only arise incidentally at the foal's de-livery, often associated with dystocia but prior todelivery it might arise during assessment if abnor-mal presentation is suspected or in cases of hydropsor coincidental with premature mammary develop-ment and lactation in late pregnancy. In the lattercase it may be that deformity is suspected ratherthan denitively identied but practically thesemares are generally best treated as if a 'suspected'placentitis is present. The fetal deformation ap-parently triggers a placental response leading topremature mammary development. 6. Prolonged Pregnancy Management of prolonged pregnancy often involvesprimarily resolving the owners concern about theperceived length of time the pregnancy has goneover the mare's expected foaling date, especially ifshe has no sign of any mammary development.Owners may also be concerned if the mare has had aprevious history of prolonged gestation with off-spring that were small and weak individuals atbirth. Fortunately, the likelihood of abnormalityunderlying the prolongation is low unless she hashad exposure to fescue infected pastures. The nor-mal gestational range in mares is very wide and upto 365-370 days with some mares still producing anormal foal after even 400 days. Also, foals fromprolonged pregnancies are often relatively smallrather than over-sized and there is not a greater riskof a dystocia occurring. Besides fescue toxicity,pathological insults to the HPA axis and placentalinsufciency affecting the rate of fetal growthcould lead to a very prolonged gestation. Assessingthe mare routinely by 365 days' gestation can allayan owner's fears and be reassuring. A rise in pro-gesterone and the progestagens in maternal serumwill indicate that the fetal HPA axis is starting torespond. Similarly, even modest changes of milk electrolytes showing a pattern approaching, if dis-tant, the full-term milk electrolyte prole is encour-aging. Ultrasound assessment of the fetus todetermine that biophysical parameters are normaland allow serial assessment of the growth of thefetus is benecial. Concern is warranted if the fe-tus appears very small for gestational age and thereis a noticeably thin placenta with an abnormally lowCTUP or there has not been the expected gradualincrease in thickness of the placenta in the last thirdof pregnancy. Similarly, concern is warranted if inthe very rare instance there is any evidence of cra-nial deformity during ultrasound examinations thatmight be consistent condition ofthe hypothalamus or pituitary. Doppler ultrasonographic examination of the mare's uterine arteries to determine blood flow mayindicate that blood flow volume is lower than ex-pected and the resistance index is higher. This isconsistent with a similar reduced blood flow in theplacental circulation possibly having a rate limitingeffect on fetal growth, the author has experience ofone such case. The use of pentoxifylline or aspirinto potentially increase uterine blood flow might bebenecial in these circumstances. 7. Abnormal Presentation Abnormal presentation can be detected ultrasono- graphically prior to delivery. Transverse presenta-tion is rare, although more common in draft breeds.Statistics are not readily available on the incidenceof caudal presentation in Thoroughbred or lightbreed mares, but it is estimated at less than 1:500and, in one review of 517 spontaneous foalings, 0%of dystocias were in posterior presentation. 25Ar e- view of cases to an equine referral hospital did notnd any difference in the incidence of dystocia due tocaudal presentation when compared to a study ofdystocia where the population was predominantlydraft breeds to their light breeds population. 26,27 It is also reported that mares who have a foal incaudal presentation may repeat the presentation infuture pregnancies. 28Diagnosis of abnormal pre - sentation can be challenging because of the way thefetus lies in utero and because the hind limbs andhooves may be palpated or scanned within the preg-nant horn located above the foal's head, neck, andbody, it may appear the foal is in caudal presenta-tion when it is lying normally. A fetus lying ratherobliquely across the abdomen rather than clearly incranial presentation with head and neck directedtoward the pelvis would be suspicious for caudalpresentation because if the hindlimbs are not withinthe pregnant horn the foal may move into full pos-terior presentation as it rotates prior to foaling.Identication of the fetal thorax and heart oftenprovides the most accurate means of determiningfetal presentation in late gestation. 154 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MARE8. Maternal Disease Conditions and Musculoskeletal Problems Affecting Pregnancy Maternal disease conditions, particularly colic in late pregnancy, can be challenging to manage.First of all, colic pain has to be distinguished fromthe abdominal discomfort associated with parturi-tion. Ideally, the overall strategy adopted will be tosave the life of the mare and at the same timemaximize the likelihood of the foal surviving as well.In most situations this will require the fetus to re-main in utero because of the risks associated withthe foal not being ready for birth. Economic con-siderations and the stage of gestation may in somecircumstances signicantly alter this approach.The conditions most of concern in the late pregnantmare are those related to endotoxemia and includecolitis, large colon displacements and torsions, ante-rior enteritis, and a variety of other small intestinalconditions. Profound disturbances in systemic cir-culation may be also involved in these conditionswhich may critically affect uterine perfusion andplacental transfer of oxygen and nutrients to thefetus. Recurrent pain unrelated to the gastrointes-tinal tract may have a reproductive tract origin andconditions include uterine hemorrhage and uterinetorsion. The latter is relatively uncommon and thepain level is generally not as severe as that associ-ated with intestinal displacements, especially colontorsions, which can be violently painful. Diagnosis of abdominal conditions can be a chal- lenge in the late pregnant mare due to the size of thepregnancy and the amount of space in the caudalabdomen it occupies. Rectal palpation may allowonly limited assessment of the gastrointestinaltract, and ultrasound both transrectal and transab-dominal, may be more useful to identify free fluidin the peritoneal cavity or distended small bowel orthe thickened and edematous colon wall present incolon displacements. Similarly, be difcult, unless undertaken with ultrasoundguidance, as the gravid uterus will generally occupythe full ventral extent of the abdomen in late preg-nancy. Increased cell counts and protein levelsmay reflect disease associated with either compro-mised uterine or bowel wall. Although, manycauses of abdominal pain are not serious and mayreflect changes in dietary management of the maresome conditions will require surgical correction.Occasionally, standing surgery may be appropriate,for example many cases of uterine torsion are moreeasily corrected by a standing flank laparotomy;however, it is more likely an exploratory laparotomyin dorsal recumbency will be required. Maintain-ing oxygenation of the mare is challenging in thesecircumstances with the weight of the gravid uteruspressing down on the diaphragm and even ventila- tion may not prevent low oxygen tensions and aninevitable degree of severe fetal hypoxia. Particu-larly in late pregnancy the oxygen demands of therapidly growing fetus are high. 29Similarly main -taining maternal blood pressure and therefore avoiding reduced uterine and fetoplacental perfu-sion must also be addressed. Generally, the mare'ssurvival is more important and supersedes the foalin these circumstances; however, normally the foal'sbest chance will be if it can remain in utero until ithas fully matured and be delivered normally at fullterm. Although postoperative dehiscence of themidline incision is generally a concern in late preg-nant mares following surgery, especially if a largeincision is necessary, wound dehiscence and the riskof catastrophic bowel evisceration at the time themare foals or that she will have difculty producingsufciently strong abdominal contractions is rare.Ultrasound monitoring of the midline wound candetect any suspicion of wound breakdown and thecommon use of colic belly bandages has improvedthe management of these type of wounds. As men-tioned earlier, the use of a large-dose dexametha-sone regime to promote fetal maturation mayagain be appropriate in pregnant mares, post colicsurgery, in some instances. While the mare is hos-pitalized, continuous telemetric fetal electrocardio-graphic monitoring may be practical and allow closeassessment of fetal wellbeing and detect any early indications of fetal compromise. This may be par-ticularly important if the mare has postoperativecomplications from endotoxemia, anemia, and hy-poalbuminemia. Telemetric systems, (e.g., KruuseTelevet 100) fallow continuous recordings to be eas - ily made. Both heart rate and heart rate variabil-ity can be determined. Decreasing heart rate andincreasing heart rate variability parameters indi-cate maturation of the fetal autonomous nervoussystem. Accelerations and decelerations in heartrate are easily detectable. Accelerations often oc-cur with fetal movements and indicate wellbeing inthe fetus. A recent study of heart rate variability innormal mares and their fetal foals in late gestationonly showed signicant changes in fetal heart ratevariability in the last few minutes before foal-ing. 30,31For the 10 days prior to foaling, fetal heart rate (FHR) and heart rate variability remained con- stant and did not predict the beginning of foaling.Only during the last 30 minutes before delivery, inthe majority of fetuses, did FHR decrease and RRinterval increase. Accelerations and decelerationsin FHR were detectable at all times, but neithertheir number nor duration changed over time.In human fetuses, reduced heart rate and decelera-tions in heart rate are considered signs of fetal com-promise. Therefore, unstable heart rate variabilityparameters in the days before foaling, a reduction inthe number of accelerations, and an increased num-ber of decelerations may indicate a pregnancy atrisk. Continuous telemetric fetal heart rate moni-toring is a potentially useful technique especiallywhere continuous assessment of fetal health isneeded in response to a rapidly changing clinicalsituation. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 155IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREMost mares are treated with broad spectrum an- tibiotics postoperatively and there is research datato indicate that penicillin, and trim-ethoprim sulphonamides but not ceftiofur sodiumcross the placenta and can be detected in allantoicfluid and would give antimicrobial cover to the fetusas well. 32-34For other medications there is very little if any data with respect to drug effects on the fetus and safety. Altrenogest does appear to havean ability to block prostaglandins at least in the rsttrimester of pregnancy. Researchers demonstratedthat altrenogest treated pregnant mares who werebetween 93 and 115 days of gestation did not abortwhen injected with cloprostenol in contrast to theuntreated control mares who all aborted. 35Proges - terone is believed to regulate prostaglandin catabo-lism by influencing the enzyme prostaglandindehydrogenase and it is possible that altrenogest isalso able to regulate prostaglandin through a simi-lar mechanism. 36There is also some evidence for the ability of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and COX-2 inhibitor, rocoxib, to cross theplacenta and affect prostaglandin and cytokine syn-thesis and therefore would make this a potentiallybenecial drug treatment to protect the fetus post-colic surgery and in other conditions where endotox-emia is of concern. 37 Pentoxifylline is a methyl-xanthine derivative used widely in human medicine that has a variety of effectsespecially on microvascular blood flow. These effectsare mainly through decreasing blood and plasmaviscosity, by lowering plasma neutrophils and macrophagesare thought to play a mediating role with down regu-lation of many inflammatory cytokines including necrosis factor /H9251(TNF /H9251) and interleukins IL-1 IL-6. It may be that the metabolites of pentoxi-fylline are clinically the most pertinent. The micro-vascular effects reduce tissue damage in ischemic-reperfusion injury and improve placental circulationand decrease the risk of preterm labor in pregnantwomen. 38Studies in the pregnant mare have also shown that it crosses the placenta and is present in allantoic fluid.32For the above reasons there has been plenty of interest in this drug in the treatment of placentitis, but it may also be of value in improving themicrovascular circulation in other placental conditionsin the pregnant mare. Finally, tocolytic therapy to delay preterm deliv- ery is an important intervention in human obstet-rics. Although tocolytics have not been shown toimprove neonatal outcomes, they can delay pretermdelivery long enough for antenatal corticosteroids tobe administered. A wide channel blockers are cur-rently thought to be the most effective with the leastside effects. Only clenbuterol (\u00df sympathomimeticdrug) has been studied in the mare and is liked bysome clinicians for helping produce uterine relax-ation to aid with manipulations during dystocia.As a tocolytic agent to prevent delivery it has notbeen found to be effective in delaying parturition inthe mare. 39 The other main group of maternal conditions that may jeopardize the foal are severe musculoskeletalproblems, especially severe laminitis and septic te-nosynovitis or septic arthritis. Increasing marebody weight due to the growing fetus in late preg-nancy may exacerbate painful musculoskeletal con-ditions. The levels of pain experienced by the maremay impact her ability to eat normally, resulting inweight loss. In late pregnancy the demands of thefetus, which would normally be increasing in weightby 500 g daily, may have negative consequences onboth the mare and fetus. In some situations wheremares acutely founder or have a severe tendon orjoint infection or respond poorly to treatment forseptic synovial structures there often becomes over-whelming pressure for euthanasia of the mare onhumane grounds before she can reach full term.In these difcult cases, promoting fetal maturationwith dexamethasone may be the only opportunity tosalvage the situation and try and save the foal.It is likely that a terminal Caesarean may be thebest option for delivering the foal safely in thesecircumstances. 9. Conclusion Managing the late pregnant mare with a compli-cated pregnancy presents many challenges to theclinician from the initial diagnosis and monitoringthe progress of disease to deciding on the most ap-propriate treatment option. As we learn moreabout equine fetal physiology and the pathophysiol-ogy of the disease processes occurring more ratio-nale treatment regimens with hopefully even betternal outcomes will become possible.

Burden, DVM, MS, DACT Retained fetal membranes represent one of the more common postpartum problems in mares. Manage- ment of retained fetal membranes in the mare requires prompt veterinary intervention as a delay intreatment may lead to an increased risk of potentially fatal sequelae, including toxic metritis andlaminitis. There are multiple strategies utilized by the veterinarian to achieve complete expulsion orremoval of retained fetal membranes. The method selected for removal of retained fetal membranes isdependent on effectiveness, safety, cost, and convenience. Early intervention can prevent serious med-ical complications in the mare. Author's address: Introduction In the mare, the fetal membranes (often referred to as the placenta) as a whole include the allanto-chorion, amnion, and umbilical cord. These mem-branes are normally passed during the third stage ofparturition with signs of transient abdominal dis-comfort due to ongoing uterine contractions. Re-tained fetal membranes occurs when complete orpartial failure of the chorioallantois to separatefrom the endometrium occurs. 1Membranes re- tained postpartum are consid-ered \"retained fetal membranes\" and representone of the more common postpartum problems inmares. 2While the overall incidence is low (2%- 10.6% in lightweight breeds, higher in draughtbreeds but as high as 54% in Friesians), 2-4the con- sequences if left unresolved can be severe. Al-though mares may retain fetal membranes followinga normal gestation and foaling, several risk factorsare associated with a higher occurrence of retainedfetal membranes including mare age, breed, previ-ous retained fetal membranes, and peripartumcomplications such as Caesarean, abortion, dysto-cia, placentitis, prolonged gestation, and hydropic conditions. 1,3,5,6 The objective when managing retained fetal membranes is to attain complete expulsion or re-moval of the fetal membranes; in doing so, avoidingtrauma to the entire reproductive tract, minimizingexcessive force that could lead to uterine horn ever-sion/prolapse as well as preventing metritis and en-dotoxemia that can result in fatal consequences.Among veterinarians there does not appear to beany agreement on or evidence of a \"best\" method oftreatment for retained fetal membranes nor thetime interval when removal should be attempted. 7 The method selected for removal of retained fetalmembranes is dependent on effectiveness, safety,cost, and convenience along with the discretion ofthe veterinarian or level of comfort with a givenremoval technique. 2. Pathophysiology The equine placenta 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF NOTESarea for nutrient exchange.6Following parturi - tion, the umbilical cord is ruptured, leading to col-lapse of the umbilical vasculature and smallervessels throughout the fetal releasestimulates rhythmic contractions expel the free fetal membranes fromthe uterus. 8In the normal mare, the horns of the allantochorion invaginate as they are released and pass through the ruptured cervical star. This isencouraged from the dependent weight of the mem-branes (amnion) hanging down externally from thevulva. The membranes are expelled intact with theallantoic surface showing outermost, in most cases. The cause of retained fetal membranes in mares is not well dened and is likely multifactorial. It ishypothesized that a multitude of impaired physio-logic changes result in an abnormal release of themicrovilli from the endometrial crypts in suscepti-ble mares. 2Uterine inertia due to myometrial ex - haustion associated with dystocia or advanced the myometrium followinghydrops allantois, hormone imbalance associatedwith preterm delivery, or low levels at thetime of parturition along with specic placentalcharacteristics may account for the higher inci-dence of retention. 1,2,9,10Allantochorion thick - ness, microvilli length, and degree of attachment atparturition along with an increased folding patternof the non-gravid horn are potential factors in in-creased membrane retention. 3Fibrosis and adhe - sion formation have been reported in both themicrocotyledons and stromal connective tissue inheavy draft breeds while low serum calcium concen-trations have been directly linked to incidence ofretained fetal membranes in Friesian mares. 10,11 No matter the cause, membrane retention longer than 3 hours postpartum can lead to life-threateningsequelae in mares such as metritis, sepsis, andlaminitis. 1,12Acute metritis can develop with au - of the retained allantochorion or microvilliwithin the endometrial crypts, providing a nidus forinfection. The environment becomes ideal for bac-terial invasion and replication leading to inflamma-tion and intrauterine fluid accumulation; toxinsfrom gram-negative bacteria may be systemicallyabsorbed leading to endotoxemia and subsequentlaminitis. 1For all of these reasons, prompt mem - brane removal and medical management is war-ranted. Proactive management of membraneremoval (prior to 3 hours) may prove benecial formares with placentitis, abortion, or dystocia and forintensely managed broodmare operations or maresat distant locations. 3. Diagnosis Clinical signs of retained fetal membranes in themare may be obvious as portions of the membranesprotruding externally from the vulva. However,mares whose foaling was unattended may have noindication of retained fetal membranes other than a history of unknown or incomplete membrane expul-sion. In many cases, a portion of the allantochorion(i.e., tip of the non-gravid horn) can be retained andmay go unnoticed if the fetal membranes have notbeen closely examined. Some mares with partialretention of the allantochorion can present 24-48hours postpartum with clinical signs of metritisand/or endotoxemia to include fetid vaginal dis-charge, depression, pyrexia, injected mucous mem-branes, tachycardia, and increased digital pulsesassociated with the onset of laminitis. 1 However, clinical signs of illness are not always present in mares with retained membranes, there-fore it is essential that the fetal membranes beexamined carefully after delivery. The chorioallan-tois is laid out so that the full membranes can beexamined. Placing the membranes in the shape ofan F allows examination of the ruptured cervicalstar at the base of the membranes and each uterinehorn (forming the arms of the F). The umbilicus islocated at the base of the gravid horn and the am-nion is attached to the umbilicus. When the mem-branes are damaged or torn, sometimes they can bepieced together by following the vascular patterns. 13 In any instance where retained fetal membranes aresuspected, the mare should be examined further. Additional diagnostic procedures include trans- rectal examination and bloodwork. Transrectal palpation of the uterus can reveal the degree ofuterine tone/involution, which may be increased insome mares with retained fetal membranes (uterusactively contracting) or reduced with accumulationof intraluminal fluid that occurs in mares with me-tritis. Transrectal ultrasonography can further de-ne the amount and character of fluid in the uterus,and possibly, tags of retained chorioallantois. Fol-lowing cleansing of the perineal area, digital exam-ination of the uterine lumen is performed to attemptto locate retained membranes and degree of attach-ment evaluated. When endotoxemia is suspected,blood samples should be collected for complete bloodcount, biochemistry panel, serum amyloid A, andlactate. 4. Treatment Multiple strategies are utilized by the veterinarianto achieve complete expulsion or removal of retainedfetal membranes. 2,5,10,14,15The method selected for removal of retained fetal membranes is depen- dent on effectiveness, safety, cost, convenience, andexperience of the veterinarian. Mares housed inclose proximity to the veterinarian, or at largestud farms accustomed to postpartum management,can be closely monitored and conservatively evalu-ated with repeat veterinary visits. Mares housedin eld conditions without ready access to veterinarycare may require more rapid, but safe, managementof retained fetal membranes. For veterinarianstraveling long distances to treat mares withretained fetal membranes, prompt resolution of the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 159IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREcondition can be essential to the wellbeing of the mare given that return trips can be challenging.Finally, prophylactic membrane removal may bewarranted in mares after dystocia or placentitis whoare at higher risk of fetal membrane retention. The most common method to aid in fetal mem- brane removal is administration of oxytocin in theearly postpartum period. Oxytocin administrationis especially effective in healthy mares within 12hours of routine foaling. Mares are highly respon-sive to the effects of oxytocin in the immediatepostpartum period. Ten to 20 IU given intrave-nously or intramuscularly, every 30-60 minutesmay be all that is necessary for membrane expul-sion. The portion of the membranes (if any) exter-nal to the vulva should be tied in a knot above thehock to provide weight without being trampled or pulled on by the mare. Repeat doses of oxytocincan be administered up to 6 hours post-foaling oruntil placental expulsion has occurred. Oxytocincan also be administered as a constant rate intra-venous infusion (50-100 IU oxytocin i n 1 L saline administered slowly over 30-60 minutes). 3In some cases, notably Friesian mares with lower serum calcium levels postpartum, the addition ofcalcium-magnesium borogluconate (200 mL of 23%solution i n 5 L intravenous fluids) can aid in mem- brane expulsion. 1,10Large-volume (24-36 L deliv - ered at a volume of 4-6 L at a time) uterine lavageis often combined with oxytocin administration tohasten membrane expulsion. When the membranes are intact and rmly at- tached, the chorioallantois can be distended withdilute betadine solution or isotonic fluid (Burnstechnique), which is thought to stimulate releaseof microcotyledons from the endometrium. 16The technique is relatively atraumatic to the uterus and provides little opportunity for bacterial contamina-tion to the uterus because the membranes are intact.The perineal area is cleansed and a sterile stomachtube is passed through the ruptured cervical starof the chorioallantois. The released edges of thechorioallantois cranial to the cervical star are thengathered around the stomach tube and held in handto form a seal around the tube. The allantoic cavityis then infused with 10-12 L of warm water/salineto the uterus, dilate the endometrial cryptsto release the and stretch in endogenous oxytocin release. 1,8 Exogenous oxytocin is administered to promote uter-ine contraction. Uterine distension may need to bemaintained for up to 30 minutes before membranesare passed. Additional uterine lavage can be per-formed after the membranes are expulsed. Large-volume uterine lavage is a tool that is rou- tinely used in the postpartum mare, and it can beperformed to promote separation of the chorioallan-tois from the endometrial surface in mares withretained membranes. Traditional large-volumeuterine lavage is often used in mares that do nothave intact fetal membranes present. With large-volume uterine lavage, isotonic fluids or dilute dine infused between the chorion andthe endometrial surface. 17The fluid is then si - phoned off with care to avoid membrane remnantsor endometrium from occluding the tube. Large-volume lavage is commonly utilized in the postpar-tum mare to reduce debris, contaminants, andabnormal intrauterine fluid that may predispose themare to metritis and endotoxemia. 14 Manual removal of fetal membranes is a useful technique that has varying degrees of acceptanceamong equine veterinarians. Controlled, manualremoval of fetal membranes has been employed formany years using a variety of approaches. 5,16-19 Techniques that have been described for manualfetal membrane removal include grasping the exter-nalized free portion of the membranes and applyingcontrolled traction, 5,20placing a hand between the endometrium and chorion to separate the attached membranes, twisting of the allantochorionic mem-brane into a tight cord, 11and placing a wooden ring between the chorion and endometrium and advanc- ing the ring to separate the membranes from theendometrium. 5The degree of membrane attach - ment, as well as duration of membrane retention,can affect the outcome of manual membrane re-moval. The circumstances relevant to the mare(normal vs high-risk pregnancy) and veterinarian(experience, access to the mare) factor into the decisionto attempt manual membrane removal. Advantagesof manual fetal membrane removal are rapid removalof membranes in a farm setting with little need forspecial equipment. Importantly, the membranes canbe fully evaluated while the veterinarian is present onthe farm. Potential risks of manual membrane re-moval are retention of microvilli, tearing/retention offetal membrane tags, hemorrhage, and uterine horneversion/uterine prolapse. cases where the fe - tal membranes are abnormally heavy (i.e., placentitis)proactive removal of membranes can reduce the risksof membrane tearing, horn eversion, or uterine pro-lapse. Essential to the decision-making process ischoice of technique and a thorough knowledge of howto safely perform manual membrane removal to en-sure reduced complications and health of the mare.Whenever the chorioallantois is tightly adhered,forced extraction will be complicated and an alterna-tive approach should be utilized. One method of controlled manual membrane re- moval was recently described and is utilized often bythe author. 21The technique is often selected fol - lowing assisted vaginal delivery or in the rst 12hours following a normal foaling. In the period di-rectly postpartum, membrane removal is ideallyperformed after a short period of bonding betweenthe mare and foal, with the mare standing or insternal recumbency. Sternal recumbency elimi-nates the dependent weight of the fetal membraneswhile performing the procedure. The clinicianshould exercise caution when performing procedureson recumbent mares as unexpected hindlimb move- 160 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREment or attempts to stand during examination and treatment can be hazardous. The perineal area iscleansed and digital transvaginal examination isperformed to allow the veterinarian to determinethe degree of fetal membrane attachment to theendometrium. Most often, the gravid horn is de-tached and free within the uterus while the non-gravid horn remains attached to the endometrium.With a scissor-like action, two ngers are used tobluntly \"dissect\" attached portionof the chorioallantois from the endometrium (uter-ine body and base of one or both horns). With thebase of the horns free from the endometrium, themembranes of the attached horn are encircled usingthe thumb and forenger. This \"ring\" of ngers areused in a gentle manner to move cranially up andback on the attached membranes to evenly separatethe chorioallantois from the endometrium. Con-trolled pressure and digital separation are repeat-edly applied in a cranial direction toward the tip ofthe uterine horn. The veterinarian's external handshould be used to relieve tension from the weight ofthe attached membranes to reduce the probability ofmembrane tearing or uterine horn eversion. Ifmembranes do not detach readily from the endome-trium or excessive haemorrhage is noted, the proce-dure should be discontinued. Another, novel technique for actively removing fetal membranes involves catheterization of an ex-posed umbilical vessel, infusion of water and disten-sion of membrane vasculature, which promotesdetachment of the chorioallantois. 22This proce - dure leads to stretching of the umbilical vessels,degeneration of the epithelial cells due to osmoticswelling, and subsequent detachment of the mi-crovilli. 23The result is a rapid but gentle separa - tion of the fetal membranes from the endometrium.The technique is utilized after initial oxytocin ther-apy fails to result in release of retained membranes.Minimal equipment is necessary to perform the pro-cedure: a stallion catheter or foal nasogastric tube(/H110217 mm diameter), garden hose adapter with a flow control valve, and a garden hose. Mares should beadequately restrained in stocks or in a box stallwith sedation when necessary. The perineal areashould be cleansed prior to the procedure and oxy-tocin (10-20 IU IM) administered immediately be-fore catheterization of the umbilical vasculature.An umbilical vessel (artery or vein) is longitudinallyincised with a scalpel blade to expose the vascularlumen. The catheter, attached to the garden hosevia the flow control adapter, is advanced craniallythrough the incision until resistance is met. Low-pressure water flow initiated and the catheter isadvanced further, when possible. A variation ofthe technique utilizes a spray pump adapted forwater infusion when a garden hose or clean watersource are not available. An average of 7-8 L wa-ter is required to obtain complete stretching andswelling of the membranes. 23The veterinarian holds the tube in situ and adjusts water flow whilemonitoring the clinical response and physical reac- tions of the mare. It is necessary to keep the waterpressure low to reduce damage to the proximal bloodvessels that are essential for infusing as much ofthe chorioallantois as possible. Some mares showsigns of mild discomfort, and fluid flow should beslowed or discontinued allowing the mare to relaxand the progress of membrane release to be as-sessed. Gentle traction is often placed on the mem-branes at the level of the mare's vulva to assist inexpulsion. In most cases, retained fetal mem-branes are expulsed within 10-15 minutes of umbil-ical vasculature infusion. However, the processtakes slightly longer in some mares. When separa-tion does not occur in 30 minutes time, other treat-ment options should be considered. 23 Incomplete separation, failure of the membranes to release, and tearing of membranes during theumbilical infusion are complications of the process.The incidence of failure rate or tearing was higherin mares that retained membranes for longer than12 hours postpartum. 23Some mares also experi - ence mild discomfort during the procedure, which isremedied by discontinuing infusion until the mareis more comfortable. Overall, umbilical vessel in-fusion is an easy technique to perform to aid inremoving retained fetal membranes. The proce-dure is performed after oxytocin therapy has beenunsuccessful in promoting membrane expulsion.In most cases, umbilical vessel infusion provides agood outcome with few side effects. While the pro-cedure works best within 8-12 hours of foaling, thelow investment of time and resources makes it agood method for early intervention in all cases ofretained fetal membranes. There are an abundant number of methods for removing retained fetal membranes in mares. In-terestingly, a survey of veterinarians (54% repro-duction specialists) found that most treatmentsfor retained fetal membranes reported by thepractitioners reflect a lack of specic treatmentguidelines and management recommendations. 24 Oxytocin therapy is commonly used with doseranges between 10 and 20 IU administered intrave-nously or intramuscularly as often as 30-minute to2-hour Calcium was only administeredalongside oxytocin in 3/102 respondents. Tractionand manual removal were attempted by 30% ofpractitioners; the Burn's technique was utilized by25% of practitioners surveyed. More than half ofthe respondents relied on a previously used tech-nique. Large-volume lavage was the most commontreatment used by more than half of the surveyresponders. Large-volume lavage is used to re-move intrauterine fluid accumulations of inflamma-tion, debris, and bacteria. Much like the Burn'stechnique, the mare's perineum is cleaned and asterile stomach tube is introduced through the cer-vix and into the uterus. Six to 12 L of warm, iso-tonic fluid (0.9% NaCl, 161IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREinto the uterine lumen. Some practitioners prefer lactated Ringer's solution because of balanced pHthat is less irritating. 8Sterile fluids can be un - wieldy to work with in large volumes (24-36 L), areexpensive and may be unnecessary when working ina grossly contaminated environment. A solution of\"homemade\" 0.9% NaCl solution can be made bymixing 102 g table salt (3.5 ounces) with 12 L ofwarm water. The fluid is infused into the uteruswith a sterile or clean nasogastric tube tted to aclean stomach pump until the uterus is comfortablydistended. With the veterinarian's hand forming acage around the tip of the tube, the efflux is siphonedfrom the uterus. Care must be taken to avoid as-piration of the endometrium or retained fetal mem-branes into the tip of the tube. Lavage is repeatedseveral times (often up to 36 L) until the effluentbecomes signicantly less cellular. In mares whohave retained fetal membranes after Caesarean sec-tion, special care should be exercised with uterinelavage so that the suture line is not compromised. 1,8 In particular, the uterus should be gently \"rinsed\"rather than distended and suction along the sutureline should be strictly avoided. Prophylactic, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is administered both prophylactically and in responseto mares with clinical signs of metritis. In the veter-inary survey, prophylactic antimicrobials were utilizedby 42% with a variety of types, frequency, and admin-istered routes reported. Common choice of antimicro-bials include penicillin (procaine or potassium) andgentamicin, ceftiofur alone or with gentamicin, or tri-methoprim sulfa combinations. Systemic antimicro-bials should be administered for 5-7 days, but not lessthan 3 days after the placenta has been expelled.Intrauterine administration of antimicrobials is usedroutinely by some veterinarians to control bacterialproliferation. The efcacy is unknown and intrauter-ine administration of antibiotics and antiseptics hasbeen reported to irritate the endometrium and de-crease meglumine, rocoxib, phenylbutazone) is an important part oftreatment for mares with retained fetal membranes. Many veterinarians administer the antiendotoxic dose of flunixin meglumine (0.25 mg/kg, IV, every 8hours), particularly in mares showing signs of me-tritis. Tetanus prophylaxis should be administeredif vaccination status is unknown. Exercise is im-portant to aid in uterine clearance and involutionand can be useful for mares with retained fetalmembranes. Paddock turnout is ideal but handwalking is also useful. Exercise is contraindicatedin mares at risk for laminitis. Samples for uterine culture and cytology are rec- ommended in the estrus cycle after the completion oftreatment and prior to subsequent breeding cycles.A uterine biopsy may be indicated to predict futurefertility of mares with prolonged retained fetal mem-branes or metritis.5. Prognosis The prognosis for survival and future fertility after retained fetal membranes is good in mares that aretreated rapidly and do not develop metritis/endotox-emia or laminitis. The prognosis for survival is guarded to poor in mares that develop metritis/laminitis, but varies de-pending on the mare's response to therapy. Summary Management of retained fetal membranes is a pri-ority for the health of affected mares. Therapy isdirected at rapid, atraumatic removal of membranesand prevention of life-threatening conditions such asmetritis and laminitis. The method selected for re-moval of retained fetal membranes is dependent oneffectiveness, safety, experience, and cost. Famil-iarity with a variety of methods for removing re-tained membranes will provide the veterinarianwith the best management tools needed to preservethe health of the mare.

Introduction Mares have foaled for many centuries in the wild on their own and have suffered few complications.With more intensive breeding programs and newtechnologies, reproductive efciency has improvedand mares are producing bigger, earlier foals. Thus,mares are at increased risk for peripartum com-plications. An awareness and early recognition ofproblems in the periparturient period, especiallypostpartum complications, is necessary to improvethe success of treatment and prognosis for themare. Since delivery of a foal is a fast and explosive process, there are injuries to the mare that can occurand sequelae that may be detrimental. Many post-partum problems occur after what was considereda \"normal\" foaling, although breed, age, gestationalproblems, and dystocia may contribute to inci-dence. 1,2Unfortunately, nonspecic signs are of- ten associated with many postpartum problems andveterinarians must differentiate, diagnose, andtreat problems as best as possible with clinical signsthat are present. This article will focus on com-mon postpartum problems that are potentially lifethreatening or signicant to future fertility. Thepossible differential diagnoses will be broadly cate-gorized into mechanical and physiological postpar-tum conditions.2. Mechanical Postpartum Conditions Uterine Prolapse/Uterine Horn Inversion Uterine prolapse does not commonly occur in the mare due to the cranial attachments of the broadligaments. 2However, dystocia and retained fetal membranes (RFMs) have been associated with anincreased incidence of this condition. 2 Diagnosis of a uterine prolapse is made by observ- ing the everted organ protruding through the vulvaas a red corrugated mass. The uterus should notbe mistaken for the chorioallantois and should bedifferentiated from the bladder. Most often, theuterine body is prolapsed, and less often, a uterinehorn or the entire uterus is present. In the case ofuterine horn inversion without complete uterineprolapse, the uterus will not be visible external tothe mare. Prolapse and inversion of the uteruscauses a decrease in venous return creating anedematous, fragile organ. Possible complicationsfrom uterine prolapse include internal hemorrhage,incarceration and ischemia of intestines and blad-der, and hypovolemic and/or endotoxic shock. 3,4 Clinical signs can be mild (more common with horn inversion), to include restlessness; pain; anxiety;tenesmus; increased pulse and tomore prolapse) withweak shallow pale 164 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MARE NOTESTreatment is to replace the uterus as quickly and as cleanly as possible, minimizing trauma andproviding supportive care. Uterine replacementis accomplished, rst, by controlling straining,through administration of sedatives, spasmolytics(N-butylscopolamine), epidural anesthesiaor general anesthesia depending on how is and the environment and facilities available.Epidural anesthesia may reduce the amount of reflexstraining provoked by vaginal manipulation; however,it will not eliminate the mare's abdominal press. 1 Mares showing signs of endotoxic or hemorrhagicshock should be stabilized with intravenous fluids,nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antibiotics.Depending on the severity and nature of the mare'scondition, steroids, antibrinolytic drugs, blood, orplasma may also be warranted while uterine replace-ment occurs. Elevation of the uterus and placementof the mare with her hind end higher than the frontwill aid in restoring circulation, reduce congestion andedema and decrease traction on the uterine ligaments,facilitating correct anatomical replacement. The tailshould be tied out of the way and the uterus cleansed.Some authors recommend using warm water and non-detergent soap 3or mild disinfectant such as dilute povidone-iodine solution.2Sugar or hypertonic saline have also been advocated, aiding in extracting fluid thus decreasing edema and uterine size for easier re-duction. RFMs attached to the prolapsed uterusshould be removed by gentle \"peeling\" of the mem-branes from the endometrium or other manual re-moval techniques. 5Deep endometrial lacerations should be repaired with absorbable suture prior to replacing the uterus. The uterus is replaced withblunt pressure using the palm of the hand or a closedst to knead the uterus into the vagina, and to preventfurther trauma to the friable uterus. Once the uterusis replaced into the abdomen, palpation is performedto conrm both horns are in the correct anatomicalposition. Partial eversion of one horn will promotecontinued pain and straining with subsequent recur-rence of the prolapse. Uterine infusion with saline ora warm antiseptic solution aids in uterine distentionand proper placement of uterine horns. 1,3,6In the author's experience fluid alone may not replace the horn, especially if the horn has been invaginated for aperiod of time and the uterine myometrial contractionshave started to involute the uterus. or propanthelene bromi - dec(30 mg IV) may aid in relaxing the uterus, allowing release of the uterine tip as fluid is infused. Once the fluid has been siphoned from the uterus, low doses ofoxytocin (5-10 IU, IM or IV) are administered to helputerine involution. This regime may also be usedwhen invagination of a uterine horn occurs due to pro-longed tension and weight of a retained placenta. Prophylactic treatments to address endometritis/ metritis, septicemia, initiated. large-volume uterine lavage, will be nec- essary to further cleanse the replaced uterus.The future fertility of the mare depends on sys-temic health, uterine damage, and risk of peripar-turient hemorrhage or subsequent prolapse, all ofwhich can be difcult to predict. Rectal Prolapse Rectal prolapse has been associated with any condi-tion that causes tenesmus. 7Therefore second- stage labor or a prolonged dystocia with increased abdominal straining can cause varying degrees ofprolapse from rectal mucosa to intussusceptionof the peritoneal rectum or colon through the analsphincter. Immediate replacement of the rectum isimperative to prevent decreased venous return, isch-emia, and damage of the vasculature within themesocolon with subsequent edema, necrosis, perito-nitis, hemorrhage, and death. Therapies and pro-cedures similar to those used for uterine prolapsecan be employed with a prolapsed rectum. Even ifrectal replacement is uncomplicated and quick,continued observation for signs of abdominal dis-comfort, peritonitis, endotoxemia, and mesenterichemorrhage is necessary. Exploratory surgery maybe indicated to determine the extent of rectal damage.The prognosis for survival after rectal prolapse isguarded. 1,8 Perineal and Rectovaginal Lacerations Perineal lacerations can occur as a result of malpo-sitioning of the fetus causing the forefeet to trauma-tize the vestibule or perineum, damage from thefoal's poll and/or shoulders as it emerges throughthe vulva, fetal oversize, or from overzealous assis-tance during foaling. 9-11A higher incidence of perineal or rectovaginal laceration occurs in primip- arous mares or mares that have had previous peri-neal surgery. 6,11First-degree perineal lacerations involve the mucosa of the vestibule and skin of the dorsal commissure be made by perform-ing a caslick (vulvoplasty) in the immediate post-partum period if edema is minimal. Second-degreeperineal lacerations require a more extensive ves-tibuloplasty to address damage to the perinealmusculature. In cases with signicant edema orinfection, repair is performed after initial healingof the surface and resolution ofinfection. 6 Third-degree perineal lacerations (recto-vestibular lacerations) occur when the of foal pen-etrates the dorsal vaginal with the foal's limb is identied duringthe delivery process, and the limb can be replaced toprevent further destruction of the perineal region. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 165IN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MARESurgical repair is generally recommended 4-6 weeks after foaling to allow inflammation to resolve,wound margins to epithelialize and wounds to con-tract. 9Immediate repair of these injuries fre - quently results in dehiscence due to excessive edemain the tissues and poor fecal preparation. Prior tosurgical repair, the mare's fecal consistency must beaggressively managed to ensure soft fecal characterthat will not interfere with rectal wound healing.Recommendations vary by surgeon but include stoolsofteners such as green grass, frequent nasogastricadministration of mineral oil, magnesium sulfate ortop dressing feed with raw linseed oil. Careful at-tention to surgical preparation and postoperativeinstructions are essential for the success of thesurgical procedure. 12Weaning of the foal prior to surgery can be benecial for reducing stress or metabolic strain on the mare. Repair success ishighly variable but prognosis for return to fertility isgood with successful repair. In one study, post-repair pregnancy rates were 75%. 12Previously re - paired mares are at risk for subsequent tearing sothey should be monitored closely toward the end ofgestation and assistance rendered during delivery. Cervical Lacerations Cervical lacerations are most commonly producedduring a dystocia although they also occur afternormal parturition. 10Minor lacerations of the ex - ternal os, that do not interfere with closure of thecervix during diestrus are of lesser consequence,while those that interfere with the competency ofthe cervical canal warrant attention. 2,10Failure of the cervix to properly close promotes susceptibility to chronic endometritis and subsequent pregnancyloss. Examination of the cervix is best done, manu- ally (digitally), during diestrus (after day 6 post- ovulation) when progesterone levels are highest.Using digital examination, the circumference of theexternal os, the cervical canal, mucosa, muscula-ture, and internal os should all be assessed. Spec-ulum examination can be unreliable except foridentifying the most severe defects. Cervical adhe-sions can be a sequelae to lacerations, ultimatelypreventing the cervix from opening, occluding thecervical lumen and potentially leading to pyome-tra. 2,13Diagnosis of adhesions is best made by dig - ital palpation of the cervix and vagina. Cervicaladhesions can be reduced through manual dissec-tion and application of steroid-containing emollientcreams. Cervical repairs are performed in both the stand- ing and recumbent mare. Subsequent breedingmay occur 30 days after repair with articial insem-ination being the method of choice for breeding.For natural mating, breeding shed awareness anduse of a breeding roll will allow less penetration bythe stallion and decrease the likelihood of furthertrauma. Pregnancy rates after surgical repair ofcervical lacerations are dependent on the severity oflaceration and length of time the defect is present prior to detection. 13 Recently two studies looked at foaling rates after cervical laceration repair.14,15The rst study in - volved 218 mares diagnosed with cervical defects.One hundred forty-ve mares underwent surgicalcervical repair, 42 mares were treated for cervicaladhesions only, 24 mares had a combination of cer-vical lacerations and adhesions with repair, and 31mares had cervical defects but no surgery was per-formed. 18The overall live foal rate in mares with surgical cervical repairs was 61.9% versus 48.39% for affected mares that did not undergo surgery. In the second study, 18 mares had cervical repair performed in the Trendelenberg position (mare indorsal recumbency with hind limbs elevated abovethe head to improve access to the urogenital tract). 14 Lacerations extended 50%-80% of the length of thecervix in 13 mares, and /H1102290% of the length of the cervix in 5 mares. In 14 mares with known post-surgical breeding history, 9 conceived (64%) and 8had live foals (57%). The duration of time betweenoccurrence of the cervical defect, identication, andsubsequent repair had a profound influence of fer-tility, with earlier diagnosis and repair providing abetter prognosis. 15Mares having a cervical lacer - ation diagnosed and repaired within the rst yearhad twice the probability of carrying a foal to termversus mares diagnosed and repaired with an inter-val of greater than 25 months (30%). 15The reason behind this discrepancy may be due to the chronicity of intrauterine inflammation, infection, and poten-tial development of endometrial brosis. Although surgical correction of the incompetent cervix improves its' integrity, cervical function oftendoes not return to normal. Cervical lesions heal viabrosis, which impairs cervical tissue from relaxingnormally when the mare is in estrus (estrogen influ-ence). Incomplete cervical dilation in estrus couldinterfere with penile coupling and intrauterine se-men deposition through the cervix. More impor-tantly, post-mating uterine clearance could also beimpaired with poor cervical relaxation resulting inendometritis. Uterine therapies (lavage, ecbolicagents, antimicrobials) are often necessary in thebreeding management of mares after cervical repair. Poor cervical relaxation after surgical laceration repair may also occur during parturition. This canaccount for the recurrence of cervical lacerations insubsequent parturitions. 15The rate of diagnosis (20.3%) and treatment (26.4%) recurrence has been identied in mares presented multiple times for sur-gical cervical repair. 15Examination of the cervix after ovulation (diestrus) is important to ascertain if repair is necessary again. Vaginal Lacerations Lacerations to the vaginal vault can occur caudally,which is generally retroperitoneal, or cranially withpotential penetration into the peritoneal cavity.Vaginal lacerations are often caused during dystocia 166 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREby a foal's foot or during obstetrical manipulation. Tears that are retroperitoneal should be evaluatedto determine the degree of damage, feasibility ofsurgical repair, amount of contamination, and like-lihood of abscess formation. 4Minor lacerations can be treated with lavage and cleansing, applica- tion of emollient creams, and administration antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 1Deeper/full-thickness lac - erations often require surgical repair and arecorrected while the mare is standing. 2Small and large intestinal prolapse and/or urninary bladder prolapse can occur through a full-thickness vaginallaceration during delivery or post-foaling. Whenevisceration occurs during foaling it is necessary toidentify the origin of the intestine (mare or foal i.e.,schistasomus reflexus), and assess the prognosis ofboth the mare and foal. 16If the intestine belongs to the mare, extensive trauma to the intestine can occur during delivery producing hemorrhage, vas-cular compromise, devitalization and peritonitis.Extensive bowel trauma often necessitates a ventralmidline celiotomy for adequate assessment and re-pair. In all cases of full-thickness vaginal lacera-tion, secondary peritonitis often develops causingsigns of fever, depression, and colic. Transabdom-inal ultrasound and abdomincentesis are helpfulto ascertain the degree of peritonitis and contami-nation present in the abdomen. Broad-spectrumantibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, andsupportive care should be initiated. vage and prophylactic treatment for laminitis in peritonitis. 3. Physiological Physiological postpartum complications are condi-tions which generally have a clinical presentationthat includes colic, anorexia, ileus, cardiovascularcompromise, and abnormal body temperature. Theveterinarian must differentiate the cause of the con-dition using available diagnostic tools so that treat-ment is provided in a timely manner. Periparturient Hemorrhage Hemorrhage from the proximal, middle, and distaluterine, external iliac, internal pudendal, and utero-ovarian artery has been described in late pregnancyand after foaling. 17Periparturient hemorrhage of - ten occurs in older, multiparous mares; however, itis becoming an increasing problem in younger pri-miparous mares 7-10 years of age. 18Mares exhib - iting discomfort or colic that are mid-gestation, dueto deliver, or 24-72 hours postpartum may be expe-riencing a hemorrhagic event. Most commonly,mares hemorrhage within 24 hours of parturitiondue to rupture of the right proximal uterine ar-tery. 17Possible risk factors include dystocia, foaling while standing, aggressive intervention in foaling as- sistance, and prior history of hemorrhage.18The eti - ology for rupture has not been denitively ascertained.In one study of 31 postpartum mares, vessels showedatrophy of smooth muscle cells, brosis of the tunica media, thickening of the disruptionof the elastica interna. associated with increasing age and/orparity. 17In the same study, the uterine arteries had the most severe intimal and medial lesions, thus pre- disposing them to rupture. Most arterial lesionswere found at bifurcations, curves, and abrupt flexuresof the vessels. In some cases, saccular aneurysmswere identied. 17Additional hypotheses regarding cause for rupture include elevated blood flow volume causing hemodynamic stress to the arterial walls,19 copper deciencies interfering with elasticity of thevessels, and stretching/tension of the artery due todisplacement and pressure by the cecum. 20 Three different clinical scenarios occur with peri- partum hemorrhage. In the rst scenario, hemor-rhage is conned to the broad ligament. Althoughthis condition is usually self limiting due to hema-toma formation within the broad ligament, the mareis often acutely painful and shocky. Mucous mem-branes appear normal to pale depending on the ex-tent and duration of hemorrhage. The marefrequently has an elevated heart and respiratoryrate and shows reduced interest in her foal. Littlechange in packed cell volume or total protein occursin the acute period post-hemorrhage. The secondscenario occurs when hemorrhage occurs directlyinto the uterus postpartum. Intrauterine hemor-rhage is suspected when large quantities of fresh orclotted blood are expelled from the vulva, noted inthe tail, or seen in the stall. While the mare mayshow signicant discomfort shortly after delivery,she often becomes more comfortable as blood isevacuated from the distended uterus. This condi-tion is also self limiting. The third presentation forpostpartum hemorrhage is rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, which can be equivalent toexsanguination. When this occurs, clot formationis more difcult because blood is not containedwithin the ligament/uterus and flow is unimpeded.Most mares die immediately. Additional clinicalsigns tachypnea, F). Survival rates for mares experiencingperiparturient hemorrhage are affected by manyfactors, including type of hemorrhage (intrauterine/extrauterine) and clot formation. In a retrospectivestudy of 73 mares experiencing periparturtienthemorrhage at Hagyard Equine Medical Institute,the survival rate was 84% (61/73), 21which higher than previous reports.22Mares that hem - orrhaged prepartum had a survival rate of 60%(6/10) while mares with postpartum hemorrhagehad a survival rate of 87.3% (55/63). 21Successful treatment was attributed to early recognition of the disease and aggressive medical manage-ment. 21Therapeutic efforts included sterile poly - when deemed necessary. 20Data from the same study showed that 47% (25/53) of mares became pregnant following recovery with 60% (15/25)of mares having more than one foal. 25 Diagnosis of periparturient hemorrhage is made with clinical signs as described above. However, itis necessary to determine the distribution and ex-tent of the hemorrhage, so optimum treatment andprognosis can be established. Transabdominal ul-trasound, with either a 2.5/3-MHz sector arraytransducer or 5-Mhz array transducer active hemorrhageintra-abdominally from intra-uterine hemorrhage.It is this author's preference not to twitch or rectallypalpate a mare that is thought to be hemorrhagingto avoid affecting blood pressure or risk disruptingclot formation. Use of sedatives should also be ju-dicious. Abdominocentesis is indicated to differen-tiate intra-abdominal hemorrhage from peritonitis visceral rupture. Treatment is directed toward systemic, cardiovas- cular support to maintain sufcient blood flow tovital organs. 18while avoiding changes in blood pressure, which could affect clot formation and he- mostasis. The most im portant initial consideration is to improve perfusion and keep the mare quiet andwarm to promote clot formation. In the author's ex-perience, administration of butorphanol tartrate din 20-mg doses IV as needed, induces quiescence, as well as turning off barn lights and blanketing. In mostcases, the foal should remain with the mare becauseremoving the foal can increase the mare's agitation.A divided stall is useful in cases where the mare'sbehavior jeopardizes the health of the foal. Various drugs have been used for sedation and comfort including xylazine, ebutorphanol tartrate,d and diazepam.fCare must be taken when using sedatives since many decrease blood pressure and can further accentuate hypovolemic shock and de-crease perfusion of vital organs. Further therapy to reverse shock and control hem- orrhage can include the following: tointercellular spaces. Crystalloid fluids di-lute clotting factors and adversely affect clotformation. 3. Colloids a. Plasma\u20143-4 L IV, intermittently with fluid therapy if plasma protein concentration islow. Care must be taken to avoid increas-ing oncotic pressure excessively and disrupt- ing the clot. b. Whole blood\u2014requires collection and blood donor. Expands oncotic blood volume whileproviding increased oxygen-carrying capacity,clotting factors, and platelets. Six to eightliters are needed in mares with hematocrits of17% or less or mares that are still uncompen-sated after fluid and plasma therapy. 4. Aminocaproic acid g(40 mg/kg loading dose di - luted andantiplasmin activity. 21,23These drugs should be used with caution in mares with dissemi- nated coagulopathies because it can lead tofatal thrombosis (rare). 5.

The recommended dose for a500-kg horse i s 4 g every 6 hours for 3-4 days. Uterine Tear/Rupture Uterine rupture or tear commonly occurs as a se- quelae to dystocia, uterine torsion, hydroallantois,or fetotomy. 1,6,11,21A mare can sustain a uterine tear after an apparently normal delivery.2Clinical signs usually appear a few days after parturition and include depression, anorexia, fever with mild tomoderate colic, /H11006endotoxemia depending on dura- tion and extent of peritonitis. Large uterine tearsare associated with severe hemorrhage and perito-neal contamination but these are rare. Diagnosis of uterine tear can occasionally be made by transvaginal uterine palpation. The largesize and edema of the postpartum uterus often pre-cludes detection of a tear. 25,26It has been sug - gested that uterine tear thickness may be identiedby simultaneous rectal and uterine palpation. 11 Caution should be exercised when attempting todiagnose uterine tear through palpation as partial-thickness tears can become full-thickness tears afterpalpation. Transabdominal ultrasound and abdominocente- sis are useful tools to diagnose peritonitis (afteruterine tear) and to differentiate uterine tears fromperiparturient hemorrhage. Intra-abdominal fluidquantity and character can be highly variable inmares with uterine tears and peritonitis. Early indisease, appreciable amounts of peritoneal fluidmay be difcult to detect, and the cellular characterof the fluid may be similar to normal peritonealfluid. In advanced cases of peritonitis, excessiveflocculent peritoneal fluid with or without evidenceof brin deposition may be present. Abdominocen-tesis identies fluid characterized by increased redand white blood erythrophagocytosis, anddegenerate neutrophils. 30Peritoneal fluid charac - teristics in are unaffected 168 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PERIPARTUM MAREby the foaling process and are similar to normal fluid (WBC /H110215000 cells/ /H9262L, total protein /H110212.5 g/dL). Peritoneal tics in mares with uterine tears incrementally in-crease with time, therefore, serial abdominocentesesare recommended to detect this condition. Generalguidelines of total protein /H110223.0 g/dL, a differential of neutrophils (degenerate) are useful when attempting to detect auterine tear using abdominocentesis. 27 Stabilization of the mare should include fluid therapy, anti-inflammatories, broad-spectrum sys-temic antibiotics, and preventative care for endotox-emia and laminitis. In some cases, mares mayrequire transfusion with plasma or whole blood. Medical and surgical treatments have been de- scribed for uterine tears. 1,26,28In a retrospective study of 49 mares having uterine tears/peritonitis, survival rate was 75%, overall, with no signicantdifference between medical (73%) or surgical (76%)treatment. Admission variables, treatment cost,duration of hospital stay, and likelihood of foalingafter discharge were not signicantly differentbetween treatment groups. 28Tears were signi - cantly more likely to occur in the right uterinehorn. 28Another study looked at medical records of 92 mares diagnosed with uterine tears by vaginal exam, exploratory surgery, or necropsy. Short-term survival for mares that were treated surgicallywas 78%. 28Additional pathology besides a uterine tear was discovered within the abdomen in 23% of mares that were treated surgically. Sixty-four per-cent of mares bred the same year as repair of auterine tear carried a foal to term, suggesting goodprognosis for survival and future fertility after sur-gical repair. 26The effect of uterine tear on fertility depends on the presence of adhesions (serosal and luminal surfaces), chronic infection, and permanentdamage to the uterus. 11Some suggest regular transrectal palpation of the uterus after uterine tear repair to prevent adhesion formation. Routineuterine care (which might include careful, large-volume administration of oxytocin,intra-uterine Metritis is characterized by marked inflammation ofthe deep layers of the uterus. RFMs, persistentcontamination of the uterus by bacteria, and uterinecompromise/trauma are predisposing factors for me-tritis. 29,30However, metritis can also develop after abortion, uterine inertia, and normal foaling.31 Lochia, devitalized tissue, and/or delayed uterine involution, provide a suitable environment for bac-terial growth when ascending bacterial contamina-tion occurs. 31Increased nitric oxide production during the inflammatory process decreases uterine contractility so debris, bacteria, endotoxins and in-flammatory byproducts are not expelled, allowingtranslocation of bacteria or endotoxin into the systemiccirculation resulting in life-threatening endotoxemia, septicemia, laminitis, and death. 30,31Early diagnosis and treatment of metritis is imperative for survival and future reproductive efciency. Clinical signs become evident from 1 to 7 days postpartum, and can be characterized by pyrexia,depression, abdominal discomfort, and anorexia.Elevated pulse and respiratory rate, and/or con-gested or toxic mucous membranes are evident withshock, endotoxemia, or septicemia. Diagnosis canbe made with manual intra-uterine and/or transrec-tal ultrasound examination revealing the uterus tobe enlarged, flaccid, and pendulous from the accu-mulation of fetid, thick tan-to-chocolate-coloredfluid. Poor uterine involution, lack of uterine rug-gae on the dorsal uterine surface (consistent withinvolution), and edema further substantiate de-creased uterine contractility and clearance. Cul-ture of the uterine contents can reveal a variety ofbacteria such as Escherichia coli bacterial infections occur commonly in mares with metritis.32A recent study examining bacterial isolates from mares with metritis showed that out of a total of 88 bacterialisolates, 80.7% grew a mixed population of bacte-ria. 32Of all isolates, 54.5% and 45.5% were Gram-negative and -positive, respectively.32 The isolated bacteria was Esche- richia coli (30.7%). Hematologic changes or accumulation of PMNs within theuterus. Fibrinogen and serum amyloid A usuallyincreases during the acute inflammatory phase.The most commonly used antimicrobials ceftiofur,and potentiated sulfonamides. 32Because anaero - bic bacteria can be involved in some cases, metroni-dazole is sometimes included in the therapy. The primary objective for treatment is removal of the inciting cause: RFM, bacteria, and endotox-ins from the uterine lumen and with ap-propriate systemic and intra-uterine antibiotics.Repeated large-volume uterine lavage can be per-formed with homemade saline (12 L warm tap waterwith 3 oz of table salt mixed in a sterilized bucket).Three to six liters of saline are infused into theuterus using a sterile/clean nasogastric tube, andthen the uterine contents are siphoned off. Caremust be taken to ensure that the end of the naso-gastric tube is guarded with the hand so that theendometrium is not aspirated into the end of thetube. The lavage is repeated until the recoveredfluid is improved and more or less cellular. De-pending on the mare's systemic compromise,amount and cellularity of the fluid, this proceduremay need to be performed 1-3 times a day.

Systemic and/or intra- uterine antibiotics are initiated based on the cultureand sensitivity results. When looking at bacterialisolates from mares with metritis, 32antibiotic susceptibility differed among bacteria. Sixty to eighty-nine percent Gram-negative isolates weresusceptible spp. and E. coli showed the highest incidence of antibiotic resistance. 32Antibiotic selection should be made using results from culture and sensitivity. Additional treatments for endotoxemia/laminitis in-clude fluid therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, sys-temic antimicrobials, forlaminitis (deep bedding, cryotherapy, hoof pads). Gastrointestinal Disorders In addition to abnormalities of the reproductivetract in postpartum mares, aberrations in the gas-trointestinal tract must also be considered in maresthat are not normal after foaling. Normal uterinecontraction/discomfort associated with uterine invo-lution must be differentiated from more seriousgastrointestinal complication such as bruised orruptured viscera, colonic torsion, or displacement. 33 Depending on the extent of the damage to the vis-cera, a mare can show mild colic signs, immediatelyor intermittently during the rst 72 hours after par-turition, to more severe signs that include endotoxicshock and septicemia with peritonitis. 2Diagnostic techniques for detecting ileal impactions, cecal or colonic rup-tures, and mesenteric tears of the small intestine. 34 Treatment is directed at the source of colic andranges from medical management to celiotomy. Many conditions affect the life and fertility of the postpartum mare. Rapid identication and treat-ment of problems may mean the difference betweenlife or death for a mare. Observation and assess-ment of clinical signs are the best initial resourcesfor the equine veterinarian faced with an unwellmare in the postpartum period.

Introduction Castration remains one of the most commonly per- formed eld surgeries by equine veterinarians.Complication rates vary among studies but remainrelatively high with 10% to 28% of horses experienc-ing some form of complication and continues to be amajor source of malpractice suits against equineveterinarians. 1-4Even with strict adherence to aseptic principles such as in-fection, and eventration are possible. A thoroughunderstanding of how to recognize and managethese complications will oftentimes improve the ul-timate outcome. While the preferred surgicalapproach will vary among individuals and the equip- ment that they choose, no method is without inher-ent risks. Castration can be performed in either standing sedated patients using local anesthesia or underintravenous general anesthesia. The various tech-niques have been well described elsewhere and in-clude closed, semi-closed, and open. 5While it is possible to safely close castration incisions in recum-bent patients, most prefer to leave the incisions opento heal by second intention especially in eld set-tings. As with any eld surgery, proper anestheticand surgical planning should be reviewed and careshould be taken to make sure any necessary equip- ment to manage complications is present in additionto what may be needed for the procedure. 2. Edema/Seroma Postoperative swelling is the most frequently en-countered complication of castration and is gener-ally responsive to medical management (Fig. 1).Edema and swelling of the scrotal and preputialtissues is normal but if it persists or becomes exces-sive should be addressed. Generally it will resolvewithin several days of the procedure but may occur7-10 days later, especially if postoperative exerciserecommendations are not adhered to. In more mildcases, increasing exercise and administration ofnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) issufcient to reduce inflammation.

Older horses may develop edema more often when compared to younger horses, which may make themmore reluctant to exercise and increase the chancesof seroma formation. 4A recent paper has shown that the closed method of castration is less likely to lead to complications when compared to the semi-closed technique. 1The authors of that paper tended to use the semi-closed technique on older horses (mean age, 46 months) and the closed tech-nique on younger (mean age, 18 months) patients.In that study a statistically signicant higher per-centage of equids castrated by the semi-closed tech-nique experienced complications (23.5%) than onesin which closed castration was performed (6.1%). 1 Seromas may develop several weeks following cas- tration especially if the incisions close prematurely.If a seroma develops, the horse should be chemicallyand physically restrained and following asepticpreparation the incision should be manually re- opened and stretched with a sterile-gloved nger.Once adequate drainage is established, broad-spectrum antibiotics and NSAIDs as well as forceddaily exercise should be continued until the incisionsheal and all swelling subsides. Occasionally a strip of subcutaneous or fatty tis- sue will protrude from the scrotal incision which cancause owners to worry and may contribute to swell-ing and serve as a nidus of infection. Once thecastration is completed and the incisions have beenstretched, any subcutaneous tissue that may hangdown from the site should be carefully trimmed.Occasionally, a portion of omentum may protrudedown from the incision. Following adequate chem-ical and physical restraint, the omentum may beligated as proximal as possible and safely transectedor emasculated (Fig. 2).3. Infection If swelling and/or a seroma becomes persistent, especially in the presence of fever or supportivecomplete blood count (CBC) ndings, infection should be suspected (Fig. 3A). Most infections arelocal and respond to similar treatment as for sero-mas. Long-term drainage may arise from infectionof the spermatic cord ( scirrhous cord ) even months after surgery. The most common bacterial isolatesfrom postoperative castration infections includeStreptococcus zooepidemicus and Staphylococcus sp . Preoperative antibiotics and aseptic technique aswell as owner compliance are all important in theprevention of postoperative infections (POIs). 5Al- though there are conflicting results in the literatureregarding the efcacy of prophlactic antibiotics atpreventing infections, the author routinely adminis-ters procaine penicillin G (22,000 IU/kg) approxi-mately an hour before surgery to allow sufcienttime for circulation prior to making an incision.Early treatment of incisional infection or seromawill allow management in the eld in most in-stances. Establishing adequate drainage by open-ing and enlarging the incisions, lavaging the sitewith copious amounts of sterile isotonic fluids, andinstituting broad-spectrum antibiotics may all animals,under injectable anesthesia. NSAIDs should beadministered to reduce pain and inflammation asso-ciated with the infection. With established infec-tions of deeper tissues as in scirrous cords surgicaldebridement of the infected stump and associatedbrous tissue is warranted. Sinus formation maytake place over a year after the incisions have healedand will present with persistent serous drainage(Fig. 3B). There is a direct communication along the sper- matic cord with the abdominal cavity so the poten-tial to develop septic peritonitis exists, thoughoccurrence is occurswith all castrations and peritoneal nucleated cellcounts can be surprisingly elevated without leading Fig. 1.

Hemorrhage A mild amount of bleeding will occur with all cas-trations following recovery from anesthesia; how-ever, if bleeding is prolonged or in a steady stream,further measures should be taken. Horse ownersare commonly told that if hemorrhage is mildenough that they can \"count the drops,\" there isminimal cause for concern. Proper use of a good-quality pair of emasculators is imperative to reducethe risk associated with castration site hemorrhage.The emasculators should be placed perpendicularto the spermatic cord, under minimal tension andfree of any surrounding tissue. In older horses orlarger breeds, bluntly dissecting free the cremastermuscle from the spermatic cord and emasculatingeach structure individually may reduce the risk as-sociated with hemorrhage. Regardless of whattype of emasculators are used, sufcient time (1-2minutes) should be provided and the stump proxi-mal to the site of the emasculators should be rmlyheld with a separate instrument such as Rochester-Carmalts once the emasculators are released, thestump may be further inspected for evidence of hem-orrhage (Fig. 4). Any persistent bleeding vesselsshould be identied and ligated prior to completionof the surgery. If bleeding continues once the horseis standing, the scrotal incision should be exploredfor the source and direct ligation performed. If thehemorrhage is originating from the stump it mayneed to be locally anesthetized and emasculated asecond time. At this point a transxation ligatureshould be placed as far proximal on the stump aspossible. Placement of a transxation ligatureproximal to the emasculators is thought to increasethe incidence of complications following castrationsand should only be performed when necessary tocontrol active hemorrhage. If one is unable to iden-tify the source of the bleeding, the scrotal incisionmay be packed with a roll of gauze or a sterile hucktowel may be sutured or towel clamped in place to the scrotal skin in an effort to apply direct pressure.Hemorrhage that occurs from deep within the ingui-nal ring during surgery may need to be controlled byplacing sterile gauze into the inguinal canal throughthe external inguinal ring in an accordion like fash-ion to exert local pressure and sutured or clamped tothe surrounding skin. The packing may be re-moved 24-48 hours later and the horse monitored toconrm that the offending blood vessel has clotted. Emasculating the spermatic cord under excessive tension may cause the testicular artery and associ-ated vessels to retract into the abdomen beyondthe reach of the surgeon. In this instance, internalhemorrhage may occur. Horses with internalbleeding may be identied by characteristic palemembranes, tachycardia, tachypnea, lethargy, andmild colic. Ultrasound of the ventral abdomenshould be performed to detect the presence of hemo-abdomen, which appears as hyperechoic fluid swirl-ing in the abdomen.

Referral should be considered ifinternal bleeding is suspected, hemorrhage is pro-longed, its source cannot be identied, or signs ofhypovolemic shock develop. 5. Eventration/Evisceration Although a rare complication of castration, eventra-tion of the small intestine through the inguinal ringsis oftentimes fatal. A breed predilection for in-creased risk may occur with Standardbreds, DraftHorses, and possibly Saddlebreds and TennesseeWalking horses. Recently, a large online surveywas conducted of equine practitioners with regard toeventration following castration, which agreed withan earlier study that the overall incidence of thiscomplication is low (0.2%). 6The survey also sug - gested that castrations performed standing and theuse of emasculators vs twisting the cord until break-age were less likely to lead to eventration. 7When eventration occurs, initial therapy should be aimed at protecting the bowel from further damage. Thebowel should be thoroughly lavaged with sterile iso-tonic fluids and held in place in the scrotal incisionwith large sutures or towel clamps. If more intes-tine has passed through the incision than can beheld within the scrotal remnant, a sling may befashioned with a small towel sutured to either sideof the scrotal skin. Alternatively, the horse maybe re-anesthetized and the external inguinal ringenlarged to allow the bowel to be replaced within theabdomen. Replacing the bowel into the abdomenonce a horse has been re-anesthetized is generallynot possible due to edema that forms in the intesti-nal wall and mesentery once eventration has oc-curred. The internal inguinal ring is not readilyaccessible; however, with one hand acting as a re-tractor to protect the intestine against further dam-age, a pair of surgical scissors or a curved bistourymay be guided into the cranial end of the externalinguinal ring and the ring may be extended severalcentimeters. This greatly facilitates replacementof the intestine into the abdomen but also requiresprimary closure of the external inguinal ring withheavy-duty author prefers polyglactin 910athreaded through a her - nia/kidney needle with the two ends tied together.Once the blunt point of the needle is guided acrossthe cranial aspect of the external inguinal ring, theneedle can be pulled through the loop of suture so noknot is needed and subsequent bites are facilitatedby holding the suture in traction. Further bowelprolapsing through the canal during transportationto a referral hospital is unlikely with the eternalinguinal ring sutured closed and further damage tothe intestine should be halted. If one is unfamiliarwith suturing the external inguinal ring a thoroughknowledge of the anatomy is helpful and an assis-tant, if available, will greatly facilitate the proce-dure. The horse should be sent for an exploratorylaparotomy as soon as possible because the intestine cannot be adequately evaluated for viability in theeld. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy andNSAIDs are instituted prior to shipping. It is theauthor's opinion that the further one is from a sur-gical facility, the more one should consider re-anes-thetizing the horse and attempt to replace the bowelinto the abdomen with closure of the external ingui-nal ring if an effort to save the horse is going to bemade. 6. Other Considerations Duration of surgery may be related to an increasedcomplication rate so having all instruments openand set out prior to anesthesia can save valuabletime. Less additional anesthesia may be needed ifLidocaine is used to directly infuse the testicle andpossibly the spermatic cord in order to maintain adeeper plane of anesthesia. 6 Injury to the penile shaft has been reported dur- ing routine castration. A quick review of the rele-vant anatomy and double checking that the correctstructures are present prior to emasculation shouldreduce the chances of inadvertently damaging anyunrelated tissue. 5 There are reports that use of the Henderson equine castration tool results in fewer complicationsand may decrease surgical time by twisting the corduntil breakage rather than emasculation. 8Use of the Henderson castration tool has become relatively common although this author has limited experi-ence with its use. Some thought should be given to anesthetic com- plications during even short eld procedures. Fa-cial nerve paralysis can result from direct pressureto the facial nerve from the buckle on a halter so thehalter should be removed until the horse is ready tobe stood up. Pulling the down leg forward will de-crease the likelihood of radial nerve paralysis.Care should be taken to nd the safest place toperform castration in the eld with regard to steril-ity and safety from xed objects when standing.Covering the patient's eyes and keeping the environ-ment quiet will help maintain horses in recumbencyuntil they are ready to stand. If a horse is to stum-ble and fall as they stand, they generally fall for-ward so an assistant applying steady traction totheir tail as they stand, and then quickly relievingthe tension once they are up, frequently provides fora better recovery. Once the horse is standing, thetail should be released, and the assistant can care-fully put a hand on the cheek piece of the halter andone on their shoulder until they are steady on theirfeet. 7. Conclusion While complications associated with castration can-not be eliminated, proper preoperative planning,good surgical technique, and early recognition andtreatment will improve outcome. Having every-thing needed to address complications as they arise AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 175HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENTwill allow for proper rst-aid measures and may decrease exposure to litigation. These complica-tions happen to new as well as seasoned practitio-ners and some thought should be given to assurethat should they arise, they can be properlyaddressed.

Introduction Complicated surgical and anesthetic cases benet from referral to a hospital setting. Unfortunately,referral is not always an option. In addition, rou-tine cases can turn difcult very quickly. Beingprepared with the appropriate equipment and drugsavailable is essential for a positive outcome. 2. Materials and Methods Regardless of the procedure, a brief physical examshould be performed on every horse prior to sedationor anesthesia. Whenever sedating or anesthetizingan equid, it is imperative that the handler is payingattention to the situation and understands the risksand concerns associated. Owners or handlers shouldbe warned of the risk of sudden aggression withalpha-2 agonist drugs. 1The occurrence of aggres- sion appears to be dose dependent; therefore, the han-dler should have a rm grip on the halter when higherdoses are being used. In addition, any horse can havean adverse reaction to a drug or intra-arterial injectioninadvertently could occur. Therefore, from a liabilityperspective, do not allow a child or someone inexperi-enced to handle the horse during a procedure. The temperament of the horse, procedure type, and duration should be considered when selectinga sedation protocol. Anxious or excited horsesbenet from the inclusion of sublingual detomidine gel a(45 minutes) or intramuscular (IM) detomidineb (30 minutes) prior to beginning any anesthesia orprocedure. IM detomidine has a longer duration ofsedation than intravenous (IV) dosing and less in-tense cardiovascular effect. For standing proce-dures, give an IM dose of detomidine (1 mg/45 kg)during preparation and then follow with an IV doseof detomidine (0.5-1 mg/45 kg) imm ediately prior to starting the procedure (just prior to the surgicalincision). The inclusion of an opioid is useful forpainful author's than For butorpha-nol, this is specically helpful in minimizing thehead pressing or head bobbing behavior followingIV administration. When performing any anesthetic procedures in the eld, have a box or tote easily available that contains drugs, an endotracheal tube, IV cathetersand emergency medications that might be requiredduring the anesthetic event. Drugs to have availablefor SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENT NOTESAlthough placing an IV catheter is not a common practice in the eld, it certainly makes dealing withdifcult situations easier. The author recommendshaving 14-gauge 3.5\" and 18-gauge 3.5\" short-termcatheters available two additional doses ofketamine in 3-ml syringes and an Reversal agonists israrely not recommended unless inad-vertent overdosage occurs. Adequate sedation is essential prior to induction of anesthesia as it is not uncommon for recoveryquality to mimic induction quality. Sedation withan alpha-2 agonist as premedication for any procedureinvolving general anesthesia in the eld. The bu-torphanol can provideadditional approximately 20-30minutes of general anesthesia. For longer proce-dures, placing an IV catheter and using the combi-nation of 50 gm guaifenesin, 1 gm ketamine, and500 mg xylazine (called \"Triple formaintenance of a surgical plane of anesthesia forup to 1 hour. The infusion can be bolused to anadult at approximately 150-300 ml after inductionand slowed to a drop per second or slower to main-tain anesthesia. A 1-L bag of 0.9% NaCl or mg midazolam, 2 gm ketamine, and 500 mgxylazine can be used as an alternative to \"tripledrip\" and administered in the same manner. Recovery in the eld is typically smooth due to the short duration of anesthesia. Most horses will rollto sternal recumbency and then stand after about15-20 minutes. Place a halter and lead rope on thehorse to assist recovery and maintain control. Forlonger procedures requiring multiple boluses ofketamine o r1Lo rm o r eo f \"triple drip,\" sedation is recommended prior to recovery. Administer 50-100 mg xylazine IM near the end of the procedure or100 mg IV xylazine at the conclusion of the proce-dure. For an excited or nervous horse, a bolus of3-5 mg IM detomidine 5-10 minutes prior to con-cluding the procedure or 3 mg IV at the conclusioncan be effective for maintaining recumbency until the anesthetic agents have redistributed. Addi-tional doses of xylazine or detomidine should beavailable in case sedation is not adequate to main-tain recumbency until the horse is prepared tostand. In the event that a horse attempts to standsuddenly after the procedure but is not strongenough to maintain its position, allow the horse tofall into recumbency and, if possible, place your kneeon the back of the neck until a bolus of 5 mg deto-midine can be administered intravenously. An ad-ditional bolus of xylazine is rarely adequate to maintain recumbency in an excited horse. In the event of cardiac arrest in the eld, imme- diately attempt cardiac compressions at a rate of60-80 compressions per minute. The horse shouldpreferably be in right lateral recumbency and not ona soft surface. Compressions should be aggressiveand performed using either your knees or feet, jump-ing with your full force over the rib spaces caudal tothe elbow. Epinephrine should be intravenouslyadministered at (utilizingintubation and an endotracheal tube), or intracar-diacally (using a catheter stylet or spinal needle).Epinephrine can be administered every 3 minutescombined with cardiac compressions until a positiveoutcome is achieved or multiple attempts at resus-citation over 20-30 minutes have failed. The prog-nosis for resuscitation in adult or juvenile horsesfrom cardiac arrest is poor; existing disease, cause ofcardiac arrest, body size, and availability of humanassistance and drugs determine outcome. 3. Discussion Anesthesia should never be considered simple orroutine. Even short procedures can become compli-cated. A physical exam prior to sedation, a plan,and additional anesthetic and emergency drugswithin reach will improve the chances of a successfuloutcome.

Introduction Wounds involving the lower limbs of horses are a common occurrence in equine practice. The mini-mal soft tissue coverage of equine limbs increasesthe risk that lacerations or penetrating injuries mayinvolve a synovial structure, such as a joint or ten-don sheath. If a wound does communicate with asynovial structure, then that structure is at a highrisk of becoming infected. Septic arthritis/tenosyn-ovitis/bursitis is a potentially life-threatening condi-tion in horses and early diagnosis and treatment iscritical to increase the likelihood of a successfuloutcome. Despite the frequency with which synovial struc- tures become contaminated by wounds, early recog-nition can still be challenging. Synovial fluid cultures are often unrewarding and take severaldays to perform, 1which limits their usefulness in making early treatment decisions. Likewise, a tra-ditional synovial fluid analysis looking at total nu-cleated cell count, differential, and total protein canalso be confusing when values fall between what isaccepted as normal and infected. This paper de-scribes techniques that can be used in the eld to determine whether a wound involves a synovialstructure.2. Anatomy Know your anatomy! While this seems like the most basic statement, it cannot be overemphasized.Most of us are comfortable knowing where the majorjoints are in relation to a wound, but tendon sheathsand bursas are often overlooked. This seems to bea particular problem with wounds around the carpiand tarsi where there are several extensor tendonsheaths and bursas that are often forgotten. Sinceit is unrealistic to expect us all to suddenly becomeanatomists, why not use modern technology to helpinstead? Most practitioners carry smartphones and it is probably the one thing always with you. There area plethora of resources available via the Internet,but browsing the Internet looking for the right source or image often isn't practical in a eld settingwhen a client is waiting. To overcome these obsta-cles, the following are a few suggestions. There isan app available that reviews injection techniquesfor the majority of joints and tendon sheaths ( Equine Joint Injections by Veterinary Advances). It can serve as a quick reference for a brief refresher onalternative injection techniques or which synovialstructures are in a particular region. Alterna-tively, choose one or a couple of anatomy resources AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 179HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENT NOTESand take pictures with your phone. For example, a picture may show the carpus with all the extensortendon sheaths, one of the hock that shows thejoints, tarsal sheath and bursas, and one of thefetlock region with the joints and digital flexor ten-don sheath. These can be saved as photos thatprovide a quick reference of the relevant anatomy ofa particular region without having to rely on goodcell phone service or having a pile of books in yourtruck. Some recommended anatomy references forsynovial structures are listed at the end of thepaper. a,b,c 3. Ultrasound If a wound may involve a synovial structure and anultrasound is available, it can be very helpful todiscern what structures may be involved and wherethe wound tract actually goes. After clipping thehair surrounding the wound and neighboring ana-tomic structures of interest and thoroughly cleaningthe region, but before probing the wound (as this canintroduce air artifacts), the area can be examinedwith the ultrasound. In the majority of cases, alinear 7.5-MHz probe is most useful to deliver thedetail needed. If not available, a rectal probe or acurvilinear 3.5-MHz abdominal probe may also pro-vide enough detail to determine the trajectory of thewound. Start by covering the ultrasound probe with a glove or sterile probe cover to avoid introducing anycontamination into the wound and to avoid contam-ination to the ultrasound probe. Using sterile lubein the wound and on the ultrasound probe, begin byimaging directly over the wound. By moving theprobe slowly up and down and side to side, it canoften be seen where the wound courses by lookingfor gas or fluid (Fig. 1). If a tract can be identied,it should be followed with the ultrasound probe todetermine what direction it goes and to whatdepth\u2014this will often indicate what synovial struc- tures to be concerned about. Once the trajectory ofthe injury has been determined, perform a focusedscan of each synovial structure in the neighboringregion. This may result in scanning a structurethat the practitioner does not normally ultrasound,and thus is not as familiar with, but as long as theboundaries of the structure are known, then it canbe successfully imaged. Signs that may suggest thesynovial structure has been contaminated by thewound would include: increased synovial fluidwithin the structure, brin withinthe the bonesurface within a synovial structure. 2 If gas is found within the synovial fluid, that is strong evidence for communication of the synovialstructure with the wound. Findings of a thickenedsynovial membrane or synovitis without clear con-tamination of the structure should be interpretedwith some caution. Depending on the duration ofthe wound and amount of surrounding cellulitis andinflammation, some inflammatory reaction withinthe synovial structure may occur resulting in in-creased fluid and synovitis. 4. Radiographs Radiographs can be useful to detect trauma to theunderlying bones, but plain lms can also be helpfulwhen assessing a wound. As with any radiographicstudy, it is important to take at least two orthogonalviews. Using slightly lower kVp and mAs settingsthan normal, or digitally modifying the radiographpost-exposure will provide better visualization to thesurrounding soft tissues. Often the wound is visi-ble as a gas opacity, but in case of uncertainty, asmall metallic BB or object can be taped to the limbto highlight the wound on the radiographs. Radio-graphs can be helpful to provide better insight as to Fig. 1. A, Horse with a wound over the point of the right shoulder and B, Corresponding ultrasonographic image. The ultrasound image shows gas echos (arrow heads) penetrating through the supercial muscle layer towards the biceps tendon but remainingsupercial to the tendon 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENTwhere the wound is located in relation to the under- lying joints. Likewise, they should be observed forany gas opacities that may be within a synovialstructure. Gas in the subcutaneous tissues is com-mon with wounds and will often track proximallyand distally along fascial planes (Fig. 2A). In con-trast, gas within a synovial structure will often col-lect in the most proximal recess of the joint ortendon sheath and will often appear as a more dis-crete air bubble (Fig. 2B). For example, with awound on the palmar aspect of the pastern thatinvolves the digital flexor tendon sheath, gas opacitymay be seen in the proximal recess of the tendonsheath, proximal to the fetlock. Therefore, whenassessing radiographs that include wounds, it is im-portant to make sure the soft tissues are not over-exposed, determine what structures are in closeproximity to the wound, and to look for air where themost proximal recess of the synovial structure wouldbe situated. The use of contrast radiography is dis-cussed in the next section. 5. Synoviocentesis If the above mentioned, less invasive methods arenot denitive in determining whether a wound in-volves a synovial structure, then synoviocentesisshould be performed. When deciding where to in-sert the needle, it is important to choose a site awayfrom the wound. For example, in a horse with adorsal carpal laceration that may involve the carpal joints, the palmar lateral recess should be used forarthrocentesis instead of the more common dorsalapproach. Likewise, it is not recommended to in-sert a needle through a region of cellulitis due to arisk of introducing bacteria from the subcutaneoustissue into the synovial structure. If available, anultrasound can also be useful at identifying pocketsof fluid or alternative locations to perform a syno-viocentesis when the standard approaches are notpossible. As with any synovial injection, it is im-portant to use strict aseptic technique. Once a needle has been inserted into the synovial structure of interest, the rst goal is to try to get asample of the synovial fluid. This can often be achallenge as synovial fluid may be draining out ofthe wound. If a sample of fluid is collected, itshould be placed into an ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (EDTA)-blood collection tube for analysis.When only a small volume of synovial fluid is ob-tained, the EDTA tube should be shaken rst toremove some of the EDTA to prevent it from arti-cially altering the analysis of the sample. Cytologicevaluation of the sample should at a minimum in-clude a total nucleated cell count, differential count,and total protein (Table 1). If a large enough sam-ple is obtained, fluid should also be placed into ablood culture vial for possible culture. Studieshave demonstrated that the highest chance of ob- Fig. 2.

Guidelines for Cytologic Parameters in Normal and Septic Synovial Structures Condition Total 65 /H114082019 181HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENTtaining a positive culture from synovial fluid is if the fluid is placed in blood culture vials as opposed tojust empty blood collection tubes. 1,3Nevertheless, a positive culture result will only be obtained in about 50% of cases, and therefore, the absence of apositive culture result should not be used to deter-mine if a synovial structure is infected or not. In addition to cytological examination of the syno- vial fluid, a gram stain of the fluid may also beperformed to look for intracellular bacteria. Whilethis test is very useful to conrm sepsis of a synovialstructure if intracellular bacteria is seen, it is mostcommonly unrewarding. It should also be reiter-ated that there must be intracellular bacteria toconrm sepsis as only observing bacteria on theslide could be due to contamination during the prep-aration of the slide. Some suggestions to get themost out of the slide preparation is to prepare theslide with as thin a layer of synovial fluid as possi-ble, and if the fluid is not very cellular, then tocentrifuge the sample rst, and to make the slidefrom the pellet of cells at the bottom of the tube. Please note that synovial fluid collected from a structure may not t perfectly into either of thesecategories. Therefore, it is important to combine your cytologic evaluation of the fluid with other di-agnostics as described in this paper. After a sample of synovial fluid has been collected, or if a sample cannot be obtained, saline or contrastcan be injected into the synovial structure. Salinecan be used to distend the synovial structure ofinterest and to see if saline escapes through thewound. For this to be successful, it is important toknow the approximate volume of the synovial struc-ture to distend and to have the saline drawn upusing aseptic technique prior to inserting the needleinto the synovial structure. If saline is seen to leakfrom the wound and the structure cannot be pres-surized, then those are indicators that the synovialstructure is not intact. As an alternative to using saline, contrast mate- rial can also be instilled into the synovial structure(arthrogram). Typically, radiodense material (i.e.,Iohexol) is used. Diluting the contrast in a ratio of1:1 with sterile saline facilitates injection into thesynovial structure while still providing sufcientcontrast on radiographs. Again, it is important tohave an idea of the volume of the synovial structureto know how much contrast solution can be expectedto inject easily. Following injection, it is often ben-ecial to leave the needle in place with either thestylet inserted (if using a spinal needle) or a smallsyringe attached to the hub of the needle to preventleakage of the contrast solution. Radiographs arethen taken of the region to determine whether thecontrast is in the correct synovial structure andwhether contrast is seen leaking out of the wound(Fig. 3). While the use of contrast radiographs ismore technically challenging than using saline todistend the region, it is especially useful when in-jecting more difcult structures such as the navicu- lar bursa. Another manner in which the use of contrast ma- terial has been described is by injecting the contrastdirectly into the wound, followed by radiographs, todetermine the tract of the wound (stulogram).While this can occasionally be effective, there arealso some concerns with using this technique thatneed to be considered prior to its use. The rst isthe risk of introducing dirt or contamination fromthe wound into the deeper tissues. Even if thewound has been thoroughly cleaned, there is still aconcern that debris could be forced deeper into thewound by the injection. Secondly, it can be verychallenging to get the contrast to follow the samepath as the original wound. Shortly after injury,tissues will swell and the horse's leg position maychange, which may prevent the contrast from follow-ing the original wound tract. Therefore, a negativeresult in which it appears that the contrast does notcourse toward a synovial structure should be inter-preted with caution when using this technique. 6. Serum Amyloid A Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is probably the newest toolto enter the market that may help determine whenan infection is present. SAA is an acute phase pro-tein normally produced in the liver. It rises rapidly(within 4-12 hours) in response to inflammatorymediators such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- /H9251and shows rapid degradation once the inflammatory stimulusis removed. 4-6Since SAA has been shown to also Fig. 3.

There are several important factors to remember when using SAA as a determinant of whether asynovial structure is infected or not. First, how oldis the wound? If the wound is very acute then theSAA may still be low because there has not beensufcient time for the protein to be upregulated.A low SAA does not mean that the synovial struc-ture is not contaminated. Second, is there cellulitisor a large amount of swelling surrounding thewound? SAA rises in response to inflammation, notjust infection, therefore inflammation in the leg orconcurrent cellulitis will make the systemic SAA beelevated. This does not mean that the joint is in-fected. Finally, since SAA goes up in response toinflammation, acute trauma to the joint, such as anintra-articular fracture, can also cause SAA to beelevated without the joint being infected. There-fore, while checking SAA is a simple test to performand may be very benecial in certain cases, it is notrecommended for use as a sole means to determinewhether a joint is infected or not as there are toomany variables that may cause a false positive ornegative. 7. Conclusions Wounds continue to be a common occurrence inequine practice and determining whether or not asynovial structure is involved is critical to determinean appropriate treatment plan for the horse. Rec-ognizing what anatomical structures may be in-volved with a wound is the rst step in assessment.Following that, a combination of ultrasound, radio-graphs, and synoviocentesis can be used in mostcases to establish whether a synovial structure isinvolved, and therefore, help know how to best man-age the case.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction paranasal sinuses are encountered infrequently in equine practice. These cases fre-quently pose diagnostic and treatment challenges.Many cases are complicated by chronic secondaryinfections, which can be as difcult to treat as theprimary pathologic condition. Treatment failure insuch cases may result from failure to identify andtreat the primary inciting cause, and antimicrobialfailure due to severity and chronicity of the second-ary infection. Management with antimicrobialsalone has limited success because they typically failto treat the inciting cause or fail to appropriatelyresolve the secondary infections due to retained in-spissated material. The basis for successful treatment for conditions of the paranasal sinuses lies in understanding thenormal regional anatomy, the benets and limita-tions of diagnostic techniques, and following certainguidelines for surgical and medical treatment ofthese conditions. Equine patients have 5-7 paranasal sinuses down into functional units: the rostral set of sinuses (RMS, VCS), and DCS, CMS, SPS, MCS). rostral and CMSs are separated by a bony septum. The RMS communicates directly with theaxially located VCS over the infraorbital canal.The called the The rostral sinus group drains into thenasal passageway via a nasomaxillary opening intothe middle meatus. Depending on the age of thehorse the caudal root of the 8 and the entire 9 cheekteeth are typically associated with the RMS. 1 The DCS is a rostromedial extension of the FS and the two are often referred to as the conchofron-tal sinus. The FS and CMS communicate via thefrontomaxillary opening near the level of the medialaspect of the orbit. The CMS communicates withthe SPS caudally under the ethmoidal labyrinth with the SPS continuing caudally under the cra-nium. The MCS is referred to as the greater eth-moturbinate and communicated with the CMS.The caudal sinuses drain via a nasomaxillary open-ing into the the middle 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENT NOTESdrain separately or may combine as a common drainage angle into the nasal passage. The 10 and11 tooth roots are associated with the CMS in mosthorses. 1 Key anatomic considerations are: 1) with regard to sinus lavage, the rostral and caudal groups ofsinuses don't directly communicate with one another(without surgical intervention); 2) the drainage an-gles to both sets of sinuses are small relative to thesinus cavities enabling mucosal congestion that willlimit important landmarks to identify both to aid inexploration of the sinus cavity and avoid inadvertentcomplications during treatment. Uncomplicated primary and secondary sinusitis are suited for management by an ambulatory prac-titioner in the eld via trephination. Additionalconditions that may be addressed may include max-illary and frontal bone fractures, cysts, ethmoidhematomas, and neoplasia diagnosis. Sinoscopicexamination of maxillary fractures can aid in theirrepair and avoid chronic secondary sinusitis by iden-tifying and removing bone suspect neoplasia or debride-ment of necrotic areas of bone and cartilage withinthe sinus and nasal passage. Smaller sinus cystsand ethmoid hematomas can be diagnosed and po-tentially treated endoscopically as well. Instru-mentation can be accomplished from the sametrephination site in the FS, but is easier if performedvia a second appropriately placed trephination sitebased on the lesion's location. The goal of this article is to describe techniques and principles that will improve the diagnostic ac-curacy and treatment of paranasal sinus conditionswhile minimizing complication in an ambulatorysetting. 2. Materials and Methods History and Physical Examination A complete medical history should be obtained including duration of clinical signs, medications,and operations performed, and any underlyingmedical conditions (e.g., Cushing's disease) thatmay impact case outcome. A physical exam witha focus on the upper respiratory tract should beperformed before treatment is initiated. Sinusdisease frequently presents with a mucopurulentunilateral nasal discharge, which at times may bemalodorous if associated with dental disease orneoplasia. Bloody discharge can be encounteredoccasionally. The thin conchal bone of the nasalpassages may deform, collapsing the nasal pas-sageways on the affected side leading to decreasedairflow, and in advanced cases the horse may de-velop a respiratory noise on inspiration or expira-tion. Percussion over the frontal and maxillarysinuses while holding the mouth open to enhance resonation of the noise can help identify ll withinthe sinus cavities with the affected side demon-strating a dullness compared to the normal hollownoise observed in an unaffected sinus. Other signs may include distortion of the facial anatomy, epiphora on the affected side due to pressureon the nasolacrimal duct, exophthalmos, cutaneousstulas over the bone, and infre-quently headshaking-like behavior. Rarely caseswill present with signs of systemic illness includingfever and inappetence. Imaging The two imaging modalities readily available tothe ambulatory include radiographsand 45\u00b0-dorsolateral-ventrolateral obliqueviews are performed. It is recommended to includeoblique shots of both the affected and unaffected sidesallowing for comparison of the sinuses due to the com-plex facial anatomy. Alternatively performing den-tal obliques of the maxillary molars (30-40\u00b0dorsolateral-lateral) allow for ofthe maxillary cheek teeth apices while still allowingfor evaluation of the sinus cavities. 2Most fre - quently observed ndings include include changes in the apices of the cheek teeth, sclerosis or resorption of periapical bone, remodeling of bone asso-ciated with the involved sinuses, and nasal septumdistortion. Interpretation of skull radiographs can be chal- lenging to the less experienced practitioner. Refer-ral for evaluation by a radiologist or other specialistmay be suggested based on the eld practitioner'scomfort level. Most practitioners are familiar withthe appearance of fluid lines in the frontal and max-illary sinuses. However, sinuses completely full ofpurulent material may not display fluid lines lead-ing to misdiagnosis. Fill of the sinus with ra-diopaque material reduces the sensitivity of theinterpreter to evaluate for apical disease so cautionis warranted when evaluating a check tooth withdental disease. 4It may benet to repeat radio - graphs following removal of the purulent material toimprove the sensitivity of the dental radiographs.Disease in the ventral conchal sinus is frequentlyunder appreciated. It can be difcult to identifyradiographically in some horses. 5 Nasal endoscopy may be helpful in conrming the source of nasal discharge as drainage from the na-somaxillary aperture can be indirectly visualizedrostral and dorsal turbinate.Smaller diameter pediatric endoscopes evaluate thedrainage endoscopy can also identifyethmoid hematomas PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 185HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENTmay have sinus involvement. In chronic sinusitis cases, it is important to evaluate the middle anddorsal meati for erupting abscesses and entrappedinspissated material and necrotic bone that maycause continued nasal discharge even if the sinuscondition is successfully resolved. This is morereadily accomplished with a smaller diameter 1-mendoscope. Repeat endoscopy may be warranted incomplicated cases to evaluate progress of treatment. The gold standard for imaging the paranasal si- nuses includes computed tomography (CT) and mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI), both of which offer a3-dimensional view of the sinus cavities, nasal tur-binates, and tooth roots. With the advent of tech-nology allowing for standing CT examination of thehorse, owners may be more willing to consent toadvanced imaging as there is no longer the risk ofgeneral anesthesia. Unfortunately, we are un-likely to see these technologies utilized in a eldsetting due to cost, size, durability, and safety. In more complicated cases of paranasal sinus dis- ease, direct visualization is required to fully diag-nose and treat the condition. Direct visualizationcan be obtained by trephination or facial/maxillarybone flaps to access the paranasal sinuses. Com-bining the use of sinoscopy with a small trephina-tion allows for a less invasive exploration of thesinus when compared to a large maxillary-frontalbone flap. While performing these procedures in ahospitalized setting is ideal, sinoscopy via trephina-tion of the FS with perforation of the VCB can besuccessfully performed in a eld setting for diagno-sis and treatment of conditions of the sinus cavities.When performing the endoscopic approach, it hasbeen determined the FS is the safest approach andallows for the most complete evaluation of the para-nasal sinuses. 6 Trephination and Sinoscopy Trephination and sinoscopy andsafely performed in the equine patient understand-ing sedation when combined with appropriate re-gional and local analgesia and restraint. Prior tosurgery the horse is administered appropriate broadspectrum antibiotics and NSAIDs. A maxillarynerve block is placed on the affected side. This willanesthetize the infraorbital canal that coursesthrough the maxillary sinuses. If entering the FS,a supraorbital canal nerve block can be performed toreduce sensitivity of the sinus mucosa over the tre-phine site. The skin is blocked with local anes-thetic in the subcutaneous tissues over the site to be trephined. When accessing the sinuses, it is impor-tant to be mindful of the location of the infraorbitalcanal and nasolacrimal duct. To avoid the infraor-bital canal, the surgical site is placed above or belowan imaginary line drawn from the medial canthus tothe palpable foramen of the infraorbital canal dorsaland rostral to the facial crest (Fig. 1). Thenasolacrimal duct is avoided by placing the surgicalsite above or below an imaginary line drawn be- tween the medial canthus and nasal notch. 7 To perform a frontal trephination site for sinos- copy, the author typically locates a point halfwaybetween the medial canthus of the eye and midline Fig. 1.

Markers using skin staples can be placed on the proposed area and a radiograph takento conrm placement prior to creation of an incision.A variety of tools can be used to create surgicalaccess, and the size of the hole does not appear toimpact healing. 8For sinoscopy, a galt trephine hole 25-50% larger than the diameter of the endo- scope is recommended to aid passage of the endo-scope and avoid damage to the outer lining of theendoscope against the bone's edge. A U-shaped in-cision large enough to accommodate the trephine toavoid excessive trauma to the skin is created. Ifpossible, the periosteum is preserved with sharpdissection off the parent bone that will be removed.The trephine is turned clockwise cutting throughthe bone until a slight give in the bone is appreci-ated. At this point the bone is removed and if nec-essary the underlying mucosa is bluntly resected. If performed standing with the head elevated above the level of the pectorals, bleeding is typicallyminimal allowing exploration of the frontal-conchal,caudal maxillary, and SPS opening. Culture/cytol-ogy should be performed at this time if deemed nec-essary. If substantial purulent material is present,the sinus can be lavaged with a hypertonic salinesolution. A flexible endoscope is then driven intothe caudal sinuses to enhance visualization withoutnecessitating creation of a larger facial flap. Once the caudal sinuses exploration has com- menced, the ventral in therostral aspect above theinfraorbital throughthe bulla with or sinus. The bulla's exact location, associationwith the infraorbital canal and apical bone variesbased on age, individual anatomy, and concurrentpathology leading to anatomic distortion. At this point the rostral sinuses are lavaged of blood clots and purulent material if present. Often,endoscopic exam of these sinuses is limited due toactive hemorrhage. If drainage into the nasal cav-ity is compromised, some horses may require a s-tula be created between the VCS and nasal cavity.This is typically associated with signicant hemor-rhage and may require packing of gauze in the sinuscavity and through the stula to alleviate the hem-orrhage. Following any additional evaluation andlavage, the skin incision is closed with surgical skinstainless steel staples which eases re-evaluation ofthe sinus on subsequent days. On subsequent days the paranasal sinuses are lavaged and the to secondary infection are successfullytreated. The rostral sinuses are easier to explore atthis point as bleeding is minimal if iatrogenictrauma to the sinus mucosa is avoided. Carefulinspection of the entire paranasal sinus tract is war-ranted in cases which involve inspissated material,providing extra attention to the VCS. In somecases additional trephination of the sinuses may be required to enhance exploration and instrumenta-tion of the paranasal sinuses. During the course oftreatment, the nasal passage should be evaluatedendoscopically to rule out entrapment of inspissatedmaterial within the meati and abscessing throughthe thin sinus wall, which often contains seques-tered bone that requires removal. Daily lavage iscontinued until all blood clots and purulent materialis removed and foul nasal odor has resolved. NSAIDs are typically continued for 3-5 days and broad-spectrum antibiotics are administeredfor 2-4 weeks depending on degree of contamina-tion. Blind needle lavage may be performedthrough the previous surgical site wit h1Lo f sterile saline 7-14 days from the commencementof the initial round of treatment. This deter-mines if additional lavage and exploration is nec-essary to resolve the secondary sinusitis based onthe nature of the discharge. 3. Results and Discussion Primary sinusitis that is nonresponsive to systemic antimicrobials and dental sinusitis can often bemanaged with the described techniques in the eld,provided inspissated material is completely removedand the primary dental condition is successfully re-solved. While a less invasive needle lavage of theparanasal sinuses has been described, the authornds it limited as it lacks the direct visualizationthat is required to remove inspissated material fre-quently associated with sinusitis and often fails the SP and VCS. 9Outcome, dura - tion, and cost of treatment varies considerably basedon individual cases. Generally, a primary or second-ary dental sinusitis of short duration with minimalinspissated material and no anatomic distortion willhave a considerably shorter convalescence period com-pared to a case complicated by extensive inspissatedmaterial, masses, and anatomic distortion. Treat-ment failure with these cases often is attributed tofailure to completely remove inspissated material, fail-ure to remove all diseased dental material from analveolus, oral maxillary stulation, or failure to iden-tify and remove necrotic mucosa and bone. There are situations that may warrant referral depending on the size of the lesion and the practi-tioners comfort level with surgery within the para-nasal sinuses. If the lesion is signicant in size,especially with ethmoid hematomas, a frontomaxil-lary flap may provide better access for completelesion removal as hemorrhage can signicantly im-pact the ability to visualize using a less invasivetechnique. It is the author's preference to performbone flap surgeries in a hospital setting due togreater risk of contamination and hemorrhage.Some chronic sinusitis, especially if associated withsinus wall necrosis and inspissated material, lendthemselves to referral due to the multiple days ofdebridement and lavage required for success.

Conclusion When presented with cases of paranasal sinus dis- ease, a working knowledge of the anatomy will aidthe ambulatory practitioner in both diagnosis andtreatment. Treatment outcome in paranasal sinusconditions is dependent on identifying the cause forsecondary infection and removal of all inspissatedmaterial. Equipment required for successful treat-ment is available to most equine practitioners.The ability to perform these procedures in a stand-ing sedated patient and the minimally invasive na-ture of the procedure allows these techniques to beemployed in the ambulatory setting.

To the author's knowledge, theprevalence of specic laryngeal disorders in racingQuarter Horses has not been reported, and evidenceexists that the prevalence of some obstructive disor-ders of the upper respiratory tract differ betweenbreeds of racehorses. 1The objective of this paper is to describe a practical approach for the racetrack orambulatory practitioner to address select epiglotticdisorders commonly encountered in racing QuarterHorses. 2. Materials and Methods Laryngeal disorders are routinely evaluated usingresting transnasal endoscopy in a eld setting, andthis generally is sufcient for diagnosis of epiglotticdisorders. When resting endoscopy yields equivo-cal results or when a dynamic laryngeal obstructionat exercise is suspected, dynamic endoscopic examshould also be considered, as resting endoscopy hasa poor sensitivity for some obstructive laryngeal dis-orders. 2Oral endoscopic examination of the sub- epiglottic area may be necessary if persistent dorsaldisplacement of the soft palate is present or to eval-uate lesions in the subepiglottic portion of the aryepiglottic mucosa (Fig. 1). This procedure isgenerally well tolerated by most horses with ade-quate sedation and placement of an oral speculum,but may also be performed under short general an-esthesia in the eld. The author utilizes a segmentof 26-mm inner diameter (ID) endotracheal tube as aguide subepiglottic (instillation topical diagnosis disorders. 3Mea- surement of thyroepiglottic length, the distancefrom the body of the thyroid cartilage to the apexof the epiglottis taken from a lateral laryngeal radiograph, has been shown correlate with thepresence in 4Normal length have been have not yet Horses.

Coughingcan also be a feature of epiglottic disorders in race-horses, as well as the mature non-racehorse. 5En- trapment of epiglottis the dorsal surface made typ-ically with transnasal endoscopic examination of thelarynx, visualizing a scalloped mar-gin and an entrapping membrane dorsal to the epi-glottis, continuous with the aryepiglottic folds 6(Fig. 2). If persistent dorsal displacement of the soft pal- ate is present concurrently, transoral endoscopy,performed in the standing sedated horse or undershort be nosis. Epiglottic or epiglottitis may alsobe factors entrapment.Reduction of the entrapment is generally achievedby axial division of the entrapping membrane, andseveral methods of division have been described.The membrane may be divided under endoscopicguidance transorally or transnasally using a hookbistoury - scopic diode12or Nd:YAG13laser. These tech - niques have been described in standing, sedatedhorses under local anesthesia or under short generalanesthesia. Transnasal axial division using a hookknife in the standing horse can pose risk of iatro-genic damage to the soft palate or epiglottic carti-lage, but use of a shielded hook bistoury has beendescribed to reduce these risks with this approach. 14 Resection of the entrapping membrane has also beendescribed by Coleridge et al 15using obstetrical wire snare laryngeal forceps under transoral endoscopic guidance under general anesthesia.The decision to refer to a surgical facility or treat inthe eld is largely based on the experience of thepractitioner and the endoscopic appearance of theentrapment. Careful case selection is imperative ifthe decision is made to pursue correction in the eld.The character of the entrapping membrane mayvary from thin and to thickened, -brotic, and ulcerated. Fibrosis and inflammation ofthe membrane may prevent adequate reduction ofentrapment with axial division alone, which isendoscopically apparent as a reluctance of the mem-brane to fall below the rostral margin of the epiglot-tis after division. For this reason, chronicallythickened and brotic cases may require resection ofareas of the membrane using transendoscopic lasertechniques or through a laryngotomy incision, andare more easily managed at a surgical facility (Fig.3). In some chronic cases adhesions may be en-countered between the entrapping membrane and Fig. 1. Transoral endoscopic image of an ulcerative lesion of the subepiglottic mucosa.

Cases most appropriate for management in the eld are those with minimalbrosis and ulceration associated with the aryepi-glottic membrane. The author's preferred methodof reduction in both a eld and hospital setting istransoral axial division using a hook bistoury underendoscopic guidance, with the horse anesthetized inlateral recumbency. This method, described byRoss, Gentile, and Evans, 11requires minimal spe - cialized equipment and can be easily performed inmost eld scenarios. A description of this methodfollows. Required equipment includes a 1-m flexi-ble beroptic or video endoscope for visual guidanceof division (recommended), and a commerciallyavailable or custom fabricated hook bistoury. The author prefers to perform axial division in the eld under general anesthesia with prior to induction ofanesthesia. Racing regulations and withdrawaltimes should always be considered prior to adminis-tration of medications and the choice of perioperativeantimicrobial. As long as no obvious contraindica- tions exist, the author also routinely administers 20mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate eintrave - nously perioperatively. The horse is anesthetizedand placed in lateral recumbency. A dental specu-lum is utilized to allow oral access. Using hand-assisted guidance, a 1-m flexible endoscope is guidedinto the caudal or epiglottis is visible. Manual dorsal dis-placement of the soft palate is usually required tovisualize the epiglottis. The small size of the cau-dal oral cavity in Quarter Horses may prevent ade-quate manual guidance of the endoscope, and inthese cases, a modied guide fashioned from a short-ened 36-40-mm ID endotracheal tube may be usedto guide the endoscope and bistoury. Under endo-scopic guidance, the bistoury is positionedbetween the epiglottis and the entrapping mem-brane at a point as near the apex of the cartilage aspossible, and rostral traction applied long \"working length\" aid in com-plete transection of the membrane and reduce therisk of reducing the entrapment before complete di-vision. Care must be taken to avoid iatrogenicdamage to the epiglottic cartilage. Also, placementof the bistoury must be sufciently near the apex ofthe epiglottis to ensure complete division of themembrane, as incomplete transection may result inre-entrapment after recovery from anesthesia.Post-operatively, oral antibiotics and nonsteroidalanti-inflammatories are administered for 7 days,and 20 mL of \"throat spray\" administered twicedaily and dimethyl-sulfoxide 90% in 1:1 ratio with 16 mg dexametha-sone sodium phosphate eadded per 100 mL of solution. Race training usually resumes 2 weekspost-operatively, depending on the degree of laryn- geal inflammation present. Endoscopic conrma-tion of resolution of inflammation surrounding thesurgical site as well as conrmation of adequatedivision of the membrane are recommended exposure at the apex of theepiglottis. 6Presenting clinical signs are those of most epiglottic disorders: respiratory noise, cough- ing, and exercise be inflamed, elevating the epiglottis dorsally,or resulting dorsal displacement of the soft palate.Acute cases of epiglottitis may be mistaken for epiglot-tic entrapment, although both may occur concur-rently, 16as the mucosal edema may obscure the typical of the epiglottis. Systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and antimicrobialtherapy are instituted, along with topical anti-inflam-matory medications (\"throat spray\") described above.In the acute phase, corticosteroids may also be admin-istered systemically to reduce inflammation. 6In cases that exhibit severe epiglottic or laryngeal edema, the author prefers to administer 20-40 mg dexameth-asone sodium phosphate eintravenously once at the institution of treatment. Horses should be rested, and antimicrobial therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories continued for 10-14 days, 17Dorsal epiglottic abscessa may be present without the presence of chon-dritis, and can be managed with transendoscopicdrainage with a Nd:YAG laser, 18lavage and de - bridement under endoscopic guidance, and sys-temic and local antimicrobial therapy. 6 Subepiglottic granuloma may also be a cause of the clinical signs described above, and may resultfrom chronic ulceration or infection of the subepi-glottic portion of the aryepiglottic fold. These le-sions may result in dorsal displacement of the softpalate, and may be visible endoscopically or mayrequire elevation of the epiglottis for visibility.These granulomas are typically treated with sys-temic and local anti-inflammatories and antimicro-bials and extended rest of 4-6 weeks. 6Laser ablation or sharp excision of exuberant or recurrent granulation tissue either transorally, transnasally,or via laryngotomy is indicated, but laser cautery is recommended after sharp re-section 6via laryngotomy. granuloma thatrequire surgical debridement may require more in-tensive management and referral to a surgical facil-ity is recommended. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 191HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENTSubepiglottic Cysts Horses with subepiglottic cysts commonly present with the complaint of respiratory noise, exercise in-tolerance, coughing, and with large cysts, dyspha-gia. 19Subepiglottic cysts may be present in adult horses as a cause of poor performance or in foals associated with chronic cough, bilateral nasal dis-charge, and pneumonia. 20The endoscopic appear - ance of the epiglottis may vary from asymmetricelevation above the soft palate, to a normal appear-ance if the cyst is located ventral to the caudalpalatal margin. Assessment of the subepiglotticarea may be facilitated by transendoscopic applica-tion of topical local grasping forceps. If this instru-mentation is not available, oral evaluation may beperformed endoscopically with the horse sedatedand oral speculum in place or under general anes-thesia. 6Cysts appear typically as smooth, mucosa- covered spherical masses located within the loose subepiglottic portion of the aryepiglottic fold.21 Treatment is centered upon removal of the cysticlining. Approach through a laryngotomy incision for removal represents the traditional surgical method ofremoval. Tulleners described two transoral mucosal incision and sub-mucosal dissection, and the use of a snare fashionedfrom two Chambers mare catheters and obstetricalwire performed under general anesthesia in lateralrecumbency 19after nasotracheal intubation. Stand - ing with use of equine laryngeal grasping forceps hasalso been described, but requires experience as rup-ture of the cyst and incomplete excision is a commoncomplication. 19Dougherty and Palmer22reported resolution of a subepiglottic cyst of of formalin. 3. Results/Discussion Epiglottic entrapment has a good prognosis for re-turn to racing in Thoroughbred and Standardbredracehorses. Complicating factors that may nega-tively influence prognosis include presence of epi-glottic hypoplasia Potential long-term complications include intermittent or persis-tent dorsal displacement of the soft palate and re-entrapment by the aryepiglottic fold. Ownersshould always be warned of the potential for dorsaldisplacement of the soft palate, regardless of surgi-cal selection. Re-entrapment rates of horses under-going side to 40%.24The more widely used methods of standing transendoscopic laser division (5%13), standing transnasal hook division (5%7), and transoral hook division (10%11) compare favorablyin terms of rate of re-entrapment. Method of sur- gical correction is generally based on availableequipment, experience of the practitioner, and -nancial considerations of the owner. However, asmentioned earlier, the degree of inflammation/bro-sis of the entrapping membrane, thyroepiglotticlength, and endoscopic appearance suggestive of epi-glottic hypoplasia as well as the tolerance of thepatient to standing procedures should also guidechoice of approach. Standing transnasal tech-niques have the advantage of foregoing general an-esthesia, but require patient cooperation, longersurgical times, and a surgical laser or shielded hookbistoury. Kieffer et al 12showed that 3 months post-operatively, Thoroughbred racehorses returned to performance at a level comparable to untreatedhorses, with only cases requiring membrane resec-tion starting fewer races post-operatively. Whilethe prognosis for racing Quarter horses is so farunreported, the author's experience is similar towhat is reported in Thoroughbreds. It has been theauthor's experience that most entrapments in Quar-ter Horses are thickened, brotic, and ulcerated,which may reflect a delay in diagnosis or presenta-tion for performance limitation. Although, Tulle-ners 13reported 92% of entrapments were thick, were ulcerated in Thorough- breds as well. Epiglottitis is reported to result in long-term com- plication rates of up to 50%, including intermittentor persistent dorsal displacement of the soft palate,epiglottic deformity, or epiglottic entrapment. 16 Horses with cartilage loss secondary to epiglotticchondritis, while infrequent, generally carry a poorprognosis for racing, with development of perma-nent dorsal displacement of the soft palate com-monly developing as a long-term sequela. 17 Subepiglottic cyst removal has a good prognosis19 given no cystic lining remains after removal. Thetransoral approach to removal eliminates thepotential complication of laryngotomy, but can re-sult in some post-operative complications. Exci-sion using a snare can result in submucosalcicatrix formation that may require further surgi-cal excision, and transendoscopic excision can re-sult in excessive subepiglottic swelling requiringadditional anti-inflammatory therapy. 19Be- cause these approaches at cyst excision may re-quire more tedious tissue sparing dissection andassociated longer anesthetic episodes, they may bemore safely performed in the more controlled en-vironment of a surgical facility rather than at-tempted in the eld. However, transendoscopicaspiration and formalin injection 22may represent a viable option for eld management of subepiglot- tic cysts if nancial constraints of the owner pro-hibit referral to a surgical facility. Epiglottic disorders in racing Quarter Horses can be an important cause of potentially serious perfor-mance limitations. Early diagnosis and appropri-ate management or referral in the eld may reduce 192 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENTthe risk or severity of complications associated with some disorders. Frequent and thorough endoscopicexaminations are important for diagnosis of causesof exercise intolerance, and may lead to early diag-nosis and avoidance of chronic epiglottic conditions.

Eastman, DVM, MPVM, DACVS; and Schumacher, Hills Ave, Salinas, CA 93908-1140 (Eastman); University of Tennessee, Department of Large Animal phallectomy is often indicated for horses with neoplasia of the penis and prepuce too extensive forlocal treatment, chronic paraphimosis, severe ha-bronemiasis, or trauma resulting in penile dysfunctionor stenosis of the distal urethra (Fig. 1). 1,2 Methods of partial phallectomy include the Vin- sot's procedure, the modied Vinsot's procedure, procedure, the Scott's procedure, and en bloc resection. 1The procedure described here is a modication of the Vinsot's procedure.3 Partial phallectomy is generally performed with the horse anesthetized, but it can be performed withthe horse standing if there are nancial constraintsor if risks associated with general anesthesia arehigh. To perform the procedure with the horsestanding, the penis and internal lamina of the pre-puce must be adequately desensitized. This can beachieved by infusing local anesthetic solution cir-cumferentially into the subcutaneous tissues at theintended sites of amputation and urethrostomy, byanesthetizing the pudendal nerves, or by a combina-tion of these two methods of analgesia. A pudendalnerve block completely desensitizes the penis andinternal lamina of the prepuce and may be moreeffective than inltrating local anesthetic solution at the intended sites of urethrostomy and amputation.Inltrating the site of urethrostomy with a localanesthetic solution may increase the difculty ofperforming urethrostomy. Pudendal Nerve Block The pudendal nerve is the primary nerve supply tothe penis (Fig. 2). 1To perform a pudendal nerve block, the horse should be adequately chemicallyand physically restrained. The feces should beevacuated from the rectum, and the area ventral tothe perineum should be prepared for aseptic injec-tion of solution. For the pudendalnerve block, a 1.5-inch (3.8-cm) 20-gauge needle isintroduced on each side of the penis where the peniscurves around the ischium ventral to the anus (Fig.3). 4,5Instilling a small amount of local anesthetic solution (1-2 mL) beneath the skin at the injection sites by using a 25-gauge needle makes inserting thelarger bore needle safer. Each needle is angled ax-ially toward a point on the ischium slightly lateral tomidline. Five milliliters of bupivacaine HCl ormepivicaine HCl is injected when the point of theneedle contacts bone. Within ve minutes, the pe- 194 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENT NOTESnis protrudes from the preputial cavity. Inadver- tently piercing the penis with a 20-gauge needledoes not appear to be problematic. 3 Partial Phallectomy An antibiotic, such as procaine penicillin G (22,000IU/kg, intramuscular), and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) are administered pre-operatively. The horse's status of vaccination against tetanus should be reviewed; tetanus toxoidand tetanus antitoxin should be administered if thehorse's vaccination status is unknown. A stallioncatheter is inserted through the urethra all the wayinto the bladder and secured in place to the urethralprocess with a suture or with two hypodermic nee-dles placed 90 degrees to each other through the urethral process and the catheter. A tourniquet isplaced around the penis proximal on the site atwhich the urethra stoma is to be created, using aNye tourniquet, a penrose drain, or umbilical tape tominimize hemorrhage during the procedure. A longitudinal skin incision is created on the ventral aspect of the penis, beginning slightly distalto the tourniquet and extended distally for about 5cm. The incision is deepened to extend through theretractor penis muscles, the bulbospongiosus mus-cle, the corpus spongiosum, and the urethral mucosato expose the catheter (Fig. 4). Identifying the ure-thra is greatly facilitated by the presence of theurethral catheter, which can be easily palpated.The stoma is created 1-2 cm proximal to the pro-posed site of transection. The cut edges of the ure-thral mucosa are apposed to the a suture should encompassthe tunica albuginea surrounding the corpus spon- Fig. 1.

The use of asimple continuous pattern provides hemostasis su-perior to that achieved by using an interrupted su-ture pattern and decreases the time of surgery. After the stoma is created, the urethral catheter and tourniquet are removed, and a ligature is placedtightly around the penis, 1-2 cm distal to the stoma,to compress the dorsal vasculature and corporealbodies. Latex tubing, applied by using the Calli-crate Bander castration device, aa tightly tied suture of umbilical tape, or some other type of nonabsorb- able suture, serves as the tourniquet. The use ofthe Callicrate Bander was described in detail byArnold et al. 6The tourniquet is applied several centimeters proximal to the site of amputation and several centimeters distal to the newly createdstoma, and the penis is transected several centime-ters distal to sloughs, usuallywithin 3-4 weeks. 3,6Most surgeons recommend only the initial dose of prophylactic antibiotics and do not nd it necessary to continue them post-operatively. The authors give NSAIDs for 5 daysincluding the day of surgery. Horses should be con-ned to a small paddock for 30 days and observeddaily during this time.2. Discussion This modication of the Vinsot's technique is thesimplest of the various techniques of partial phal-lectomy to perform with the horse standing. Byusing the unmodied Vinsot's technique of partialphallectomy, a triangular-shaped section of integu-ment and underlying retractor penis muscles, bul-bospongiosus muscle, and corpus spongiosum penisare excised from the ventral of the urethral mucosa. The apex of this tri-angle points distally, the base of the triangle isabout 2.5 cm, and the length of the triangle is about4 cm. The incised mucosa is sutured to the 2-0 the tunica albuginea surroundingthe corporeal body with the suture. With the modication of the Vinsot's technique described, a triangle of tissue is not removed, andthe stoma is created using a single longitudinal in-cision through the integument that extends into theurethra. Making a stoma in this fashion simpliesand speeds the surgery while providing a stoma ofadequate size. The authors have observed thathorses display no clinical signs of discomfort after apartial phallectomy is performed using the tech-nique described. Based on the results of severalstudies and the authors' experience, it is believedthat horses experience little or no discomfort afterpartial phallectomy performed using a modicationof the Vinsot's technique. 3,6The Callicrate Ban - deracastration device has long been used to castrate Fig. 4. A stallion catheter is visible through the skin incision on the ventral aspect of the penis and used to guide the optimalplacement of incision into urethral lumen. Fig. 5. Completed urethrostomy, prior to application of a liga-ture at the site of transection distal 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP SESSION: FIELD SURGERY - SOFT TISSUE AND WOUND MANAGEMENTbulls and when applied using appropriate local an- esthesia has been shown to cause no welfareconcerns. 7 In a study by Arnold et al,6the outcome of 11 horses that underwent partial phallectomy while standing by using a technique similar to what isdescribed, all horses had a good outcome and suf-fered no or minimal complications. The urethralstoma of these horses was created at the perineum,and the penis was transected distal to latex tubingplaced close applied us-ing the Callicrate Bander acastration device. The owners of these horses were pleased with the horse's cosmetic appearance at long-term follow-up (aver-age 15 months). Complications of most techniques of partial phallectomy include hemorrhage at the penilestump, especially at the end of urination. This hemorrhage emanates from the corpus spongiosumpenis postoperative hematuria is uncom-mon. 3,6Stricture at the stoma created using other techniques of partial phallectomy has been reported, but the formation of a stricture at the stoma has notbeen observed using this technique 1,6Owners should be warned about the possibility that the horse may develop urine-induced dermatitis if itfails to learn to posture during urination in a man-ner necessary to avoid urinating on its hind limbs. 3. Conclusion Although partial phallectomy performed with thehorse anesthetized is safer for the surgeon and al-lows more surgical control, it may not be in the bestinterest of the horse if general anesthesia is deemedto be risky. Financial constraints may prevent some horses from receiving a needed partial phal-lectomy. The technique described can be per-formed inexpensively in a eld setting, because thehorse need not be anesthetized. This modicationof Vinsot's technique of partial phallectomy providesgood results, and complications associated with theprocedure are minimal.

Rectal examinations are a critical component of clin- ical veterinary practice resulting in rectal tearsbeing a job-related risk for equine practitioners.Unfortunately, they remain a signicant source oflitigation in our profession. Between 2000 and2013, they amounted to 3% of the total number ofclaims received by the American Veterinary MedicalProfessional Liability Trust. 1To optimize the out- come for the horse, the owner and the veterinarian,appropriate treatment, communication, and docu-mentation are vital. This \"How To\" is designed toempower the reader to be prepared to do a thoroughjob in the diagnosis of and rst aid treatment of arectal tear. Background Rectal tears can be life threatening and should betaken seriously. They have been documented inmares, geldings, and intact males. Obviously, maresare more frequently palpated for reproductive pur-poses, whereas stallions and geldings tend to only bepalpated during a colic work-up. It is suggested thatstallions and geldings are at a higher risk because theyare unaccustomed to this procedure, as compared tobroodmares. 2Breed and age risk factors have beenreported, with Arabian horses, American Miniature Horses, and older horses being overrepresented.2 In any case, the biggest predisposing factor is failure ofthe rectal wall to relax during the examination. Grade I tears involve the mucosa only. In Grade II tears, the mucosa is intact but the muscular lay-ers are damaged. Grade II tears are rare and oftenincidental ndings. Grade IIIa tears involve alllayers except the serosa. Grade IIIb tears are sim-ilar to Grade IIIa tears but are located in the moredorsal area either side of midline such that it is onlythe mesorectum/retroperitoneal tissues that remainintact. Grade IV tears involve all layers of the rec-tum wall including the peritoneum and are the mostserious, as feces can directly enter the peritonealcavity. Diagrams of these classications are pro-vided in Fig. 1. After nding blood on your rectal sleeve after a rectal examination, it is critical to determine if arectal tear has occurred. Clear communication withthe owner/manager at this point is vital, but it is alsonot a territory many practitioners feel comfortable inor have experienced before. Having had to checkhorses after seeing a smear of blood on my sleeve, thisauthor can tell you that the \"sinking feeling\" of think-ing you may have a rectal tear is simply awful. How- 198 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONS NOTESever, you must explain that a thorough evaluation has to be done. Bear in mind that trust is hard won andeasily lost, so do not lose it over poor communication inthis situation. Evaluation for a Rectal Tear To check where the blood has come from, rstlyensure proper chemical and physical restraint toprevent straining. This author prefers to sedate thehorse with an alpha-2 agonist drug, such as detomi-dine hydrochloride a(0.01 mg/kg IV) /H11006butorphanol, and apply a nose twitch with a reliable handler.3 Epidural anesthesia is optional at this stage based on the temperament of the horse. For an epidural,this author prefers a combination of xylazine hydro-chloride (0.17 bromidebcan give a short pe - riod of rectal muscle relaxation, but given its shortduration of action, administering it just prior toperforming the rectal exam is advised. Modestdoses can generate sufcient rectal relaxation(0.04-0.08 mg/kg IV). When performing any rectal examination never push against a tight or strainingrectum. It is the authors' strong preference to perform a bare-armed rectal examination when evaluating theintegrity of the rectum and searching for a rectaltear. However, some chose to use a surgical gloveover a rectal sleeve with the ngers cut off. Whenperforming a bare armed rectal exam, please becognizant of the potential for zoonotic infectionsfrom contaminating fecal material. This authoruses copious lubricant jelly after rubbing a coating ofpovidone-iodine solution or chlorhexidine solutionover the barn arm and hand to be used. Followingcompletion of the exam, a thorough 5-minute scrubwith antiseptic soap is recommended. With thehorse well restrained chemically and physically,patiently evacuate any remaining feces from therectum. Once the rectum is empty, apply more lu-bricant jelly to your arm and hand and systemati-cally and gently explore the rectal surface. A barehand makes it easy to sense a roughened mucosaldefect or small tear. Evaluating the tear and doc-umenting its location is very important. Grade I and Grade II tears can be treated with laxative therapy and antibiotics and managed in situ. However, they need monitoring, and it is im- perative that laxative and dietary changes do indeedproduce the desired effect of softened feces. The bigrisks of managing a Grade I or Grade II rectal tearin ambulatory practice is monitoring the progressionof the defect and ensuring it does not pack with fecesand enlarge or deteriorate. The inconvenience offrequent veterinary visits, as well as foregoing theoption of direct suturing by a skilled surgeon, oftenmake referral a better option. Rectal packing andrst aid are imperative to prevent a Grade III (a orb) tear from becoming a Grade IV tear and to pre-vent peritoneal contamination in a Grade IV tear. First aid for the rectal tear horse involves prevent- ing further straining and escalation of the tear.If not already done, perform the following: 1. Epidural and metronidazole). 4. Tetanus prophylaxis.5. Place rectal packing to at least 10 cm proxi- mal to the tear to prevent fecal contamination(Fig. 2). This is done by taking a doublearms-length of 3 /H11033stockinette bandage and ll- ing it with moistened cotton (Fig. 3). Spraythe surface of the lled stockinette with dilutepovidone-iodine solution. Cover the surfaceof the packing with lubricant jelly. Prior toplacing the packing, gently clean any remain-ing feces from the rectum. Insert the pack-ing into the rectum, which should not resist ifthe epidural anesthesia is effective, and close Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of rectal tear classication.6 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 199BEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONSthe anus with either a purse string suture or the placement of one or two towel clamps. 6. Intravenous fluid therapy should be used if shock is evident. From a case series of 85 horses presented to a university clinic, 93% (14/15) of Grade I and 67%(2/3) of Grade II tears were discharged. 5Without going into details of surgical technique or nancial constraints, overall the discharge rate for Grade IIItears was 69%. Eighty percent of Grade IV tears(25/31) were euthanized on presentation and 2/6survived after aggressive surgical intervention. Summary Apparently mild tears may need intensive manage-ment to prevent escalation to a life-threatening le-sion, and appropriate rst aid and swift referral canimpact the prognosis of all grades of rectal tear. In a recent article, the following statement was pub-lished: 1\"If a rectal tear is suspected, the veterinar - ian must determine the severity of the tear, informthe owner about the nature of the problem, admin-ister appropriate emergency treatment, and offerreferral.\" This statement now offers a standard ofcare that practitioners must all take note of.

Introduction Continuing advances in techniques, software, and hardware combined with more attractive pricing,are making direct radiology (DR) the norm in equineand mixed-animal practice. The ability to performdiagnostic radiographic studies within the practiceof equine dentistry is essential to recommendingand providing quality patient care. Techniquesused to acquire high-quality DR dental images arenow well within the capabilities of the general prac-titioner. Recent advances in sensor plate sizes anddesign have made intra-oral (IO) DR easier to per-form, safer for the equipment, and have improvedimage quality. Incorporating IODR techniquesinto equine dentistry can improve patient care as well as decrease owner expense by improving work-flow, increasing image quality, achieving early de- tection of pathology, and reducing the need forrepeating radiographic studies upon referral. Im-proved image quality compared to computed radiol-ogy (CR) systems and decreased time spent onretakes, improves patient care while increasingpractice efciency. If expert consultation and/or re-ferral is indicated, the acquired study, or a link to itin cloud storage, can easily be emailed to the expert.This decreases the need for repeat radiographic ex-posure and sedation events to the patient while re-ducing client costs. IODR techniques are easily learned and can result in superior image qualitycompared to CR techniques. Based on the author'sclinical experience, the following manuscript pro-vides a brief review of the primary concepts andprincipals of rad iology that are necessary to the proper acquisition of IODR dental radiographs.Following this, a detailed step-by-step technique guide outlining the methods used to acquire eachIODR radiographic view serves as a reference forpractitioners who wish to perform equine IODR den-tal radiology. 2. Radiology Physics, Techniques and Principals Radiation Beam Generator Physics Most portable beam generators create a parallel beam effect at approximately 30-40 centimeters.This is important because for these beam generatorslm to focal distances any closer than this results indivergent beam artifact (DBA). DBA increases theappearance of overlapping of three-dimensional jux-taposed structures in a two-dimensional image.This is because the portion of the beam outside theprimary beam diverges and penetrates objects out-side the primary target area at a more oblique anglethan the primary beam. DBA can be minimized byalways maintaining your lm to focal distances at or AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 201BEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONS NOTESgreater than your beam generators specication for distance to parallel beam formation. Keeping thetarget tissue/structure in the primary beam (it doesnot diverge) will also help reduce DBA of the pri-mary subject matter. The smaller the focal spot of the beam generator the less scatter of the x-ray beam and the shar-per the image. 1,2Most standard beam generators have a focal spot of 1-2 mm. Dentistry-specic beam generators may have focal spots of less than 1mm. Beam generators with larger focal spots han-dle higher kilovoltages and higher Milliampere-sec-onds (mAs) over repetitive exposures with lessdeterioration of the equipment compared to genera-tors with smaller focal spots at the same settings. 2 Generally, choose a beam generator with the small-est focal spot that will suit the overall needs ofradiology in your practice. The Inverse Square Law 3,4states that the inten - sity of the generated beam diminishes with increasein the lm to focal distance in a predictable manner.Specically, when the lm to focal distance is dou-bled the exposure is quartered. When the lm focaldistance is halved the exposure is quadrupled.Mathematically the formula states: Old exposuretime divided by New exposure time equals Old lmfocal distance squared divided by New lm focaldistance squared. From a practical standpoint, us-ing this doubled/halved-quartered/quadrupled con-cept, we may be able to leave the beam generatorsettings constant and simply change its distancefrom the phosphor/sensor plate to account for differ-ent sized patients without constantly changing thebeam generator settings. This saves time and de-creases guesswork when setting up techniques onthe beam generator. Small distance adjustmentsusing this concept may be helpful. However, due tothe DR systems specialized algorithms interpretinginformation received by the sensor plate, larger ad-justments will not be represented as they wouldhave in conventional lm radiology. 5In this case the beam generator settings will need to be adjusted. Bisecting Angle Technique Bisecting angle technique (BAT) is used to reduce distortion artifact when the sensor plate/cassettecannot be placed parallel to the long axis of thesubject matter. 6,7The technique aids in the reduc - tion of foreshortening or lengthening of the targettissue/structure on the acquired image (Fig. 1).Reduction of this distortion improves accuracy whenusing radiographs to aid treatment and/or surgicalplanning. BAT is performed as follows: the anglebetween the plane formed by the sensor plate andthe plane formed by the long axis of the subjectmatter (tooth) is measured/estimated. This angleis bisected with a new imaginary plane. The x-raybeam is directed through the subject matter (tooth)but perpendicular to the new imaginary planerather than perpendicular to the plane of the sensorplate or the long axis of the subject matter (tooth;Fig. 2). IODR sensor plates do not flex and bend as do CR sensor plates in plastic bags or vinyl cas-settes. Since the bisecting angle of the CR lm isactually a tangent to only one point on the curvedCR sensor, all other points on the CR sensor aredistorted to varying degrees when imaging the max-illary cheek teeth (Fig. 3). This results in the DRimage having less distortion than the CR image. Buccal Object Rule, Clarks Rule, \"SLOB\" Rule In dentistry, the SLOB rule8,9is used to differenti - ate two overlapping objects, or, objects so close toeach other on a radiograph, that differentiatingwhich one is lingual/palatal and which one is buccalcannot be determined. In equine dentistry this of-ten applies to the palatal and buccal roots of themaxillary cheek teeth. The rule states that whenthe beam generator tube head shifts in the horizon-tal plane, the lingual/palatal object (root) will shiftto the same side of the sensor plates image as the tube head was shifted to and the buccal object will Fig. 1.

Place the IODR sensor plate in the mouth lengthwise over the tongue at approximately a45\u00b0 angle to the plane formed between themandibular cheek teeth arcades. The lowermost long edge of the IODR sensor is againstthe cheek and over the mandibular cheekteeth on the same side as the target maxil-lary arcade. The upper most long edge isagainst the palatal gingival margin along theopposite maxillary arcade from the targetmaxillary teeth (Fig. 11). Using the BAT, position the beam perpendic- ular to the bisecting angle created between theplane of the cheek teeth long axis and that ofthe IODR sensor plate (usually between 45\u00b0and 60\u00b0). Center this primary beam over the rostral ex- tent of the facial crest and acquire the image. The primary beam may need to be shifted ros-trally or caudally along the face depending onthe primary target tooth. Generally, depend-ing on patient size, ve teeth will be ex-posed. Two to three juxtaposed teeth will be signicantly affected by divergent beam arti-fact (DBA) at one end of the radiograph andtwo to three juxtaposed target teeth in theprimary beam at the other end will be unaf-fected. Alternatively, the centrally locatedtwo to three teeth may be projected well withDBA on either end (Fig. 12). Proper sensorplacement and primary beam alignment rela-tive to the target tooth of interest are critical toquality image acquisition (Fig. 13). Note the interproximal space angles vary throughout the arcades (Fig. 14). Close at-tention should be paid to these angles aligningthem to the primary beam at the level of thetarget tooth. This will help avoid overlappingof dentition in the primary target area. Inaddition, if necessary, increasing the lm tofocal length (adjust exposure technique accord-ingly) will help decrease DBA reducing over-lapping of juxtaposed structures.

Discussion By combining basic radiology physics, techniquesand concepts with hands on step-by-step proceduralguidelines for acquiring IODR dental images, prac-titioners can quickly become competent in IODR dental radiology. In the author's case, practicingwith one cadaver specimen over the period of half aday, resulted in excellent preparation for applicationof the techniques on clinical patients. Resultswithin the clinical patient population were initiallynot as good as with the cadaver specimen (mostlydue to improper positioning and motion in live pa-tients resulting in the need for additional imageacquisitions) but quickly improved. Consistentquality IODR dental radiographs were obtainedwithout the need for multiple reacquisitions by thefth clinical patient. Proper sedation is key to obtaining quality images without motion artifact due to tongue lolling andchewing. In some patients, the length of the sensorplate, size of the masseter muscle (especially inheavily muscled horses), lateral bow of the maxilla,and the tension in the buccal tissues may restrictaccess to the maxillary molars during the maxillarycheek teeth IO dorsal ventral to theanisognathic relationship of the equine mandibleand maxilla this was not a problem acquiring themandibular cheek teeth ventral dorsal view. Basedon the physics involved in the BAT, the flat DRsensor plate should produce less image distortionthan a curved CR sensor (Fig. 3). The most difcult IO projection to image in the equine patient is the lateral view of the mandibularpremolars and molars. This is largely due to theoral cavity and mandibular anatomy restrictingplacement of IO sensor plates in the lingual vesti-bule. Because of the constraints resulting from Fig. 12. IO right maxillary bisecting angle corrected (IO right DL-VMO) radiograph depicting divergent beam artifact. As cheekteeth are viewed from left to right on this IO right maxillary bisect-ing angle corrected (IO Right DL-VMO) radiograph, divergent beamartifact progressively worsens. The rst two cheek teeth on the leftof the image (right maxillary third molar and right maxillary secondmolar [from left to right]) are imaged well as they were in theprimary radiographic beam at the proper lm to focal distance.

These teeth are more easily imaged with anextra-oral DR technique which the patient acceptsmuch more readily. Regardless of the anatomy, DRtechnology will continue to improve and help con-quer the remaining anatomical hurdles. 6. Conclusion Complete radiographic evaluation of the entire equinedentition will likely involve both intra- and extra-oralimaging to obtain the best possible studies. Well-trained assistants and proper sedation are key to ef-cient, quality image acquisition. Many practitionersalready have DR equipment capable of extra-oral den-tal radiology. Unfortunately, this equipment doesnot always yield the most accurate images of theequine dentition. When used in the oral cavity stan-dard DR sensor plates are at greater risk of damage.In many cases this is due to sensor plate design issues such as size, shape, and bezel area dimensions. Thisis especially true when attempting to image incisorand canine teeth. DR sensor plates designed speci-cally for IO imaging solve the vast majority of theseissues giving the practitioner another tool to improvepatient care. IODR dental radiology is easy to learnand can improve practitioner productivity while poten-tially decreasing owner expenses.

Introduction Weight loss in the horse is a frequently encountered problem in practice; however, nding the cause oftenremains a diagnostic challenge. This might be inpart because weight loss is a complex problem withnumerous possible mechanisms underlying it and,therefore detecting the dysfunctional body systeminvolved sometimes proves difcult. It is also pos-sible that the clinician is under pressure to reach adiagnosis in the most cost-effective manner, which,if weight loss occurs in the absence of other concom-itant clinical signs, can make selecting the mostappropriate diagnostic more difcult. There are few current resources available to the clinician thatprovide a comprehensive approach to weight loss inthe horse. 1-4 Weight loss is essentially a result of a greater energy use than energy intake. Mechanisms forweight loss can be categorized differently; 2,4six spe- cic mechanisms that can lead to weight loss are 1)lack of access to appropriate foodstuffs; 2) lack ofingestion of available nutrients; 3) abnormal diges-tion, absorption, or metabolism of nutrients; 4) in-adequate delivery of nutrients to peripheral tissues;5) increased rate of protein and energy use or loss;and 6) primary muscle wasting disorders. The goalof this paper is to provide an outline for a diagnosticapproach to weight loss and relate this approachback to mechanisms of weight loss.2. Materials and Methods 1. Obtain a signalment; this should provide you with information on use of the horse which isimportant for evaluation of diet. Also, a sig-nalment provides a risk assessment for condi-tions more prevalent in certain age groups,such as weanlings (e.g., equine proliferativeenteropathy) and aged horses (e.g., musculo-skeltal disease and dental disease such asequine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hy-percementosis [EOTRH]). 2. Obtain a thorough history that includes de- tailed information on diet (quantity and qual-ity of foodstuffs, method of housing andfeeding), deworming, dental care, medications(such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs [NSAIDs], adversely affectprotective and absorptive properties of the gutwall), whether there is other disease or otherclinical signs that have been noted, andwhether there are other horses sick. Evaluation of a horse's diet and ensuring the horse is being provided food that is appropriate for equidsand meets the horse's digestible energy require-ments is a rst step to understanding caloric intake.Equine nutrition is an art and a science. The sci-ence can be based on the many resources that are AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 211BEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONS NOTESavailable that allow calculation of digestible energy requirements and nutritional value of foodstuffs.As an example, the author uses the following for-mula to calculate digestible energy requirements formaintenance /H20849kg/H20850/H110030.03 /H20850 The digestible for a 500-kg horse is /H1101116.4 MCal/day. This value can be multiplied by a factor of 1-3 to account for thehorse's workload. Horses can consume /H110112%-3% of their bodyweight in roughage and should be pro-vided with a minimum of 1.4% of bodyweight. Hay(80% dry matter) contains /H110110.9 MCal/lb and concen- trate feeds contain /H110111.4 MCal/lb. These numbers can provide a baseline to create or evaluate a horse'sdiet. The art of equine nutrition allows for adjust-ments of the diet based on monitoring the horse overtime and assessment of additional needs the horsehas based on performance or underlying diseases(for example, equine metabolic syndrome or myopa-thies). Lack of access to appropriate food occurswhen inappropriate foodstuffs are provided, inade-quate ration quantity is provided, or the ration is ofpoor nutritional value, and when the food is unap-petizing/unpalatable. Further, social orders withinthe herd resulting in food competition and lameness/gait decits are signicant causes of lack of access tofood for horses. 3. Complete a thorough physical examination paying particular attention to temperature,heart rate, respiratory rate, presence of ab-normal heart and lung sounds, muscling, thepresence of dependent edema, the presenceof joint effusion(s), and the presence of diar-rhea. Diarrhea is suggestive of dysfunctionof the large intestine. 4. A body condition score should be obtained since body condition score in conjunction withserum albumin has been shown to possibly bea prognostic indicator for survival. 5If pos - sible, an actual weight can be obtained usinga scale. 5. Observe the animal's ability to ingest hay and grain from the ground. If possible,distinguish between prehension, movementof the quidding or dysphagia (food at na-res, coughing). If the case pertains to asuckling foal, observe the foal while it isnursing and watch and listen for swallow-ing and any milk at the nares. Ingestion of food requires a functional neurologic system, a healthy oral cavity and esophagus, and adesire to consume the offered food. Cranial nervedecits that result in dysphagia can be a signicantcause of inability to ingest food. Although sudden signicant dysphagia will more commonly result indifculties maintaining hydration, more chronic andmild dysphagia can lead to weight loss. Horseswith painful conditions of the mouth and/or dentaldisease will frequently drop food as they eat, eatslowly, and over time are at risk for losing weight.Also, disorders of the esophagus and stomach canimpair normal ingestion of food. Ingestion is also highly influenced by attitude and overall health. Many equine illnesses are accom-panied by anorexia or refusal of feed. Inappetencecan be due to pain or general lethargy from disease;conditions such as chronic renal disease, liver fail-ure, heart failure, and fever are commonly associ-ated with anorexia. Dyspnea, for example seen inadvanced cases of equine asthma syndrome, willlead to horses not ingesting sufcient amounts offood to meet requirements which, in addition to theincreased requirements caused by the disease pro-cess, contributes to weight loss. In addition to health disorders, management fac- tors contribute greatly to the desire of horses toconsume food. For example, some horses havestrong preferences for certain sources of roughageover others (alfalfa vs. grass hay) and suddenchanges of feed can lead to anorexia. Stabling con-ditions (amount of light, single vs. group housing,ability to see other horses and/or engage in socialbehaviors) and changes of housing partners/herdmates can lead to anxiety which can lead to reducedfood intake. Ancillary Diagnostics\u20141 1. Choose ancillary diagnostics based on results and ndings from sections 1 to 4. Examplesinclude evaluation of the respiratory tract (re-breathing examination, diagnostic imaging,bronchoalveolar lavage/tracheal aspirate),evaluation of the heart (echocardiogram), en-doscopy of the upper airway if the horse isdysphagic, transrectal abdominal palpation/ab-dominal ultrasound if there is a history of colic,and endocrinological testing if there is evidenceof hirsutism. 2. Transrectal abdominal palpation is a cheap and straightforward tool to use for diagno-sis of large enough caudal abdominalmasses. It might also provide informationon intestinal wall thickness and size oflymph nodes. 3. Manure should be collected and can be eval- uated for ber length and the presence ofsand. Depending on the case additionaltesting of feces can be pursued such as deter-mination of fecal egg count or testing for in-fectious organisms. 4. Nasogastric intubation is a cheap and straight- forward method to evaluate swallowing and de-termine whether there are limitations in the 212 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONSesophageal phase for food reaching the stomach (e.g., esophageal stricture). 5. A routine hemogram, brinogen, and serum provide valuableinformation organs (e.g., renal,liver, and muscle damage, and func-tion). Any abnormalities detected shouldaid the diagnostician in selecting a nexttest. Common abnormalities noted inhorses with weight loss include anemia(chronic re-nal disease, hyperparathyroidism, or asearch for malignancies. Finding excessparathyroid hormone related peptide,which is released in paraneoplastic syn-dromes, supports a diagnosis of malig-nancy. This peptide increases calciumresorption from the bone resulting in clini-cal hypercalcemia. Ancillary Diagnostics\u20142 Choosing further ancillary diagnostics usually de-pends on earlier ndings. Examples of additionalsituations and possible further tests are listedbelow: 1. If azotemia without a signicant weight loss has been found, further testing including uri-nalysis, fractional clearance of electrolytes,renal ultrasonography, and response to intra-venous fluid therapy might help distinguishbetween acute and chronic renal injury. 2. If there is evidence of a chronic inflammatory process, diagnostic imaging of the thoracicand abdominal cavities is warranted. Ifthere are no abnormalities found to suggestdisease of the thoracic cavity, peritoneal fluidanalysis should be considered regardless ofwhether abnormalities on the abdominal ul-trasound were detected. Furthermore, gas-troscopy should be considered to determinewhether there is normal outflow of ingestaand whether there is evidence of disease in-cluding ulcers and neoplastic conditions. 3. If abnormal areas in organs (spleen, liver) or abnormal structures are seen, tissue biopsiesshould be considered, keeping in mind therisk for hemorrhage. Neoplastic conditionsin the thorax and abdomen exfoliate rarely, 1 which is why obtaining tissue biopsies is of-ten required to provide a denitive diagnosisof neoplasia. If the abnormal structure isthought to represent an abscess, dependenton its location, abdominal, or thoracic surgerymight be warranted to limit leakage and con-tamination of the body cavity.4. Hypoalbuminemia is a result of insufcient production (liver), excessive use (catabolism),excessive loss (renal, gastrointestinal), orthird spacing. If other causes have beenruled out, function of the gastrointestinaltract can be evaluated through a glucose ab-sorption test. The glucose absorption test isperformed by administering a 20% glucosesolution at 1 g/kg via nasogastric tube afterfasting. Blood glucose is measured at base-line (before giving glucose) and every 30 min-utes for 2 hours and every 60 minutes foranother 4 hours. Blood glucose should beapproximately twice the baseline at 90-120minutes following glucose administrationand the value normalizes within 6 hours. Itshould be noted that demonstration of thepresence of carbohydrate malabsorptionand/or hypoalbuminemia has no apparent di-agnostic specicity. 6 5. If dysfunction of the intestine is suspected a rectal mucosal biopsy can sometimes provideevidence of inltrative disease; however, it isnot uncommon that full-thickness biopsies ofthe suspected affected area (small intestine)is needed. These biopsies can be obtainedsurgically in order to provide more detailedhistopathology of the gut wall. It is also pos-sible to obtain mucosal biopsies from the du-odenum transendoscopically. 7 6. If inflammatory bowel disease is suspected, the response to treatment with a larvicidalanthelmintic and corticosteroids might pro-vide useful prognostic information. 8 7. If there is evidence of primary muscle disease a biopsy of the sacrocaudalis dorsalis and/oraffected muscle should be evaluated. 3. Results The diagnostic approach described here is de-signed to provide a step-by-step guide for the prac-titioner faced with a horse with weight loss. It iscommon that in addition to the weight loss otherclinical signs are noted, such as diarrhea and colic,which might allow for this approach to be modiedto evaluate the abdomen in a more direct way.However, it is important to consider all possiblemechanisms of weight loss and select ancillarytesting based on signalment, history, and exami-nation ndings. Ideally, the approach outlinedhere will result in a diagnosis and explanation ofthe horse's weight loss based on the mechanismsdescribed above: 1) lack of access to appropriatefoodstuffs results in an insufcient intake of di-gestible energy. Causes include a lack of quan-tity of food, insufcient quality of food, and factorsin the horse's environment, such as other disease(e.g., musculoskeletal) or social interactionswithin a herd precluding the horse obtaining food.2) Lack of ingestion of available nutrients becauseof oral disease, neurologic disease, esophageal dis- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. /H114082019 213BEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONSease, and anorexia caused by other disease also result in insufcient intake of digestible energy.3) Abnormal digestion, absorption, or metabolismof nutrients results in insufcient nutrients avail-able for use in tissues. Malabsorption of proteinsand other nutrients can lead to insufcient energyuptake. Typically, malabsorptive conditions arecaused by dysfunction at the level of the smallintestine and include diseases such as parasitismand inltrative disease. Frequently malabsorp-tive disease is accompanied by a protein-losingenteropathy, because of the damage to the intes-tinal wall. Evaluation of serum proteins and pos-sibly evaluation of glucose absorption can providethe clinician with information on the absorptivecapacity of the gastrointestinal wall. Specic dis-orders that result in weight loss through thismechanism are those that result in disruption ofthe gastrointestinal wall (e.g., ulcerative diseaseand inltrative disease) and diseases of the liver.4) Inadequate delivery of nutrients to peripheraltissues also results in insufcient nutrients avail-able at the tissue level. Delivery of nutrients relies on an adequate circulating blood volume.Cardiovascular and respiratory disease are exam-ples of conditions that result in insufcient deliv-ery of nutrients. 5) Increased rate of protein andenergy use or loss such as seen in excessive catab-olism and protein-losing conditions such as renaland gastrointestinal disease eventually lead toweight loss. There are physiologic reasons why ahorse might have an increased energy demand;examples include an increased level of exercise,pregnancy, lactation, breeding, and cold environ-mental temperatures. Neoplastic and inflamma-tory diseases (pneumonia, pleuritis, andperitonitis), traumatic injuries (fractures), andother painful conditions (laminitis) also increasemetabolic rate and thus caloric needs. If in-creased demands are not met, loss of body weightoccurs. Conditions that directly affect the gastro-intestinal wall frequently result in a protein-los-ing enteropathy, which is a condition in whichserum proteins are lost into the gastrointestinaltract. This protein loss occurs through increasedlymphatic pressures, mucosal erosions, or throughdefects in the epithelial tight junctions. Clini-cally, dysfunction is frequently secondary to mu-cosal ulceration such as seen in conditions such asenteritis, colitis, gastric ulceration, and parasit-ism. However, these conditions can also result indefects at the level of the tight junctions. 6) Pri-mary muscle wasting disorders result in loss ofspecic muscle mass. If muscle mass loss occursin a more generalized fashion it causes actualweight loss. An example is equine motor neurondisease in which generalized muscle atrophy oc-curs resulting in an often-signicant loss ofweight.4. Discussion The diagnostic outline described here is designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the horse withweight loss. A retrospective study evaluating horsesthat were primarily presented for weight loss showedthat a diagnosis was obtained in 93% of the cases. 3 Most horses had evidence of parasitism (30%) anddental Of the 60horses, 42 (70%) survived. Another recent retrospec-tive study described ndings in 40 horses that pre-sented for weight loss despite having a good appetite. 5 This study showed that a denitive diagnosis was es-tablished in 60% of cases, and for weight loss was not deter-mined in 16/40 (40%) cases. Interestingly, the den-itive diagnosis in this study was not associated withoutcome. Ten horses were euthanized, and 5 horseswere lost to followup; of the remaining 25, long-termsurvival rate was /H1101180%. This study showed that to- tal protein and albumin concentrations were higher insurvivors than in nonsurvivors and that body condi-tion score was correlated with total protein, albuminconcentrations, and duration of clinical signs. Both ofthese studies showed fair-to-moderate survival ofhorses with weight loss. In conclusion, it is critical toperform a complete and thorough evaluation in horseswith weight loss using a systematic approach such asoutlined here. When inflammatory bowel disease issuspected, initial response to treatment with anthel-mintic and corticosteroid therapeutics can provideprognostic information.

Introduction Lifting of large animals (or equids) including horses, donkeys, and mules may be needed if theybecome trapped in conned spaces including ditches,ravines, tree forks, mud, and wells. In addition,horses with extreme weakness following an injury or afall, or with a history of neurologic or musculoskeletaldiseases can be unable to stand, making transport andeven survival difcult. 1-7Tactical large animal res- cue is a eld that has evolved to aid animals in thesesituations. 8Because of the hazards of the size of the animals and the behavior of horses, it is critical thatthose attempting to work with recumbent or strandedanimals have proper training, and immediate access toequipment to aid in the rescue process. Furthermore,due to the nature of equids as prey animals, the re-cumbent or stranded equid may struggle incessantly, 216 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONS NOTESoften leading to severe musculoskeletal injuries and exhaustion.3,4Prolonged recumbency of large ani - mals is associated with secondary injuries includingcranial trauma, eye injuries, myopathies, and nerveparalysis. 3,4 Effective lifting devices used in large animals must utilize the skeletal system for support due tothe considerable weight of these animals. While anumber of devices have been developed in the last 15years to effectively aid vertical lifting of horses,many of them are complex systems that requirefrequent training of personnel, and the equipment isnot readily available at the site of an incident, iscumbersome to move and store, and is expen-sive. 2,7-11Two of those devices including the An - derson Sling Support Device and the UC DavisLarge Animal Lift were developed by a team lead bythe rst author 6,12The Anderson Sling Support De - vice was developed as a full-body support sling forextended support and airlifting. 6This device was later used as a recovery aid from general anesthesia in horses.11The UC Davis Large Animal Lift was developed to fulll the need for a lightweight device that was easier to apply to the recumbent horse andfor shorter use than the Anderson Sling SupportDevice. 12The Animal Rescue and Transportation sling is a system used in Europe for both horses and cattle and provides general body support.5Compli - cations associated with recumbency such as pres-sure sores, myopathies, neuropathies, and ileus canbe prevented, and survival improved with theprompt use of these devices. 4A more simple, fast to apply, inexpensive, more readily available at the incident, and easy short term system to use in emer-gency situations is deemed necessary. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the use of a novel four round sling system referred to as theLoops System as an option for brief vertical lift.Additionally, as horses may need to be moved on theground from areas of danger or pulled from connedspaces, the use of this novel Loops System is de-scribed in many commonly used technical rescueprocedures. In Part 1 this paper will discuss thevertical lifting of six sedated standing horses usingthe Loops System and referred to it as the LoopVertical Lift System. In Part 2, this paper willdescribe the use of the Loops System to perform vecommonly used technical rescue procedures by pro-viding illustrated, step-by-step instructions for eachprocedure: forward assist, rear assist, rear drag,whole-body roll, and placement on the recumbenthorse for vertical lift. Part 1\u2014Vertical Lifting of Six Sedated Horses Using the Loops System 2. Materials and Methods Loop Vertical Lift System on Live, Standing, Sedated Horses All procedures involving live animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit-tee at UC Davis. A pilot experiment consisting of a brief lift was undertaken prior to the full experi-ment. The pilot experiment was performed withone horse to assess sedation needs and general ap-proach for Loop placement. The horse in the pilotexperiment received 0.01 mg/kg of detomidine hy-drochloride intravenously (IV), prior to placement ofan intravenous catheter, then the loops were placed,and the horse was lifted 26 minutes after sedationadministration. Upon initial suspension and theloops moving through the hind limbs, the horse be-gan kicking with each hind limb, double-barrel kick-ing, and bucking. This sedation protocol wasdeemed inadequate for that particular horse, andmodications were made to the sedation protocol.Additionally, foam cushions were placed over theloop straps in the hind limb to prevent the strapsfrom wedging between the hind limbs (shown infollowing sections). The purpose of the study wasto describe and evaluate if the loops system, whensupporting the horse with nonweight bearing for areasonable amount of time as expected for lifting arecumbent horse, would cause any harm, and betolerated by the horse. Animals Six geldings from the Center for Equine Health herdat the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine en-tered this study. The animals were transportedto the William R. Pritchard Veterinary MedicalTeaching Hospital on the day of testing. Thehorses ranged in age from 6 to 15 years (mean, 9.7years; SD, /H110063.1 years), ranged in weight from 507 to 640 kg (mean, 578.7 kg; SD /H1100649.5 kg) and included three Thoroughbred, two Quarter Horses, and oneOldenberg. Physical Evaluation The horses underwent a complete physical examina-tion, and a brief lameness exam on the day prior to thelifting procedure. Immediately after the lifting pro-cedure, a brief physical examination was performed,and 1 hour after the animals fully recovered fromsedation their ability to ambulate at a walk was eval-uated and classied as being normal or abnormal.At 24 hours post-lifting procedure, the horses under-went another complete physical and brief lamenessexamination. The examinations were performed bytwo board-certied equine medicine veterinarians.Assessment of potential pressure points by loopssuch as in the axillary, xiphoid, inguinal, and sheathareas for the presence of edema and pain was per-formed. Edema was classied on a scale of 0 (noedema), 1 (mild: minimally visible but detected uponpalpation), 2 (moderate: visibly detected) to 3 (severeedema: visibly detected and pitting upon palpation).Pain was assessed using the Colorado Equine ComfortAssessment Scale, ranging from 0 to 4. 13To assess lameness, the horses were walked and briefly trotted in a straight line, then moved in a circle clockwise andanticlockwise while being observed by the two veteri- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 217BEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONSnarians. Lameness was graded according to a simpli- ed lameness scale because a full lameness exam wasnot performed. Briefly, lameness was classied as was not perceived in any circumstances; 1if lameness was not consistently apparent in at walk,trot or circles; 2 if lameness was only consistentlyapparent at the circles, but not when trotting in astraight line, and 3 if lameness was consistently ap-parent at a trot in a straight line; and 4 if lamenesswas consistently apparent at a walk in a straight line.The purpose is to determine if adverse changes hadoccurred from the pressure of the loops system duringthe lift. Sedation and Catheter Protocol Sedation was performed by IV administration ofdetomidine, at doses to achieve the desired effectand taking into consideration the individual horse'sdemeanor, temperament, and level of excitementdue to environmental stimuli. Based on the nd-ings of the pilot experiment, a two-step sedationprotocol was instituted. The initial sedation wasaimed to achieve the horse's cooperation in order toplace the intravenous catheter ensuring prompt ve-nous access during the procedure, whereas the sec-ond sedation was aimed to have deeper sedationmanifested by the horse's head hanging low to theground. Each horse received an initial dose of deto-midine administered IV prior to placement of a jug-ular catheter. aIn the initial sedation, each horse received either 3 mg or 5 mg of detomidine IV (0.005 to 0.009 mg/kg; Table 1), depending on the horses'demeanor and level of excitement. Once the horseappeared sedated, the area over the jugular veinwas clipped and aseptically prepared. A 14 gauge,5 14inch catheterawas placed in the left or right jugular vein and sutured into place using 2-0 nylon suture. The horses were walked to the padded an-esthesia recovery stall, and the round slings wereplaced following a systematic procedure for place-ment of the Loop Vertical Lift System as describedbelow. A second dose of detomidine was adminis-tered to each horse via the IV catheter (either 5, 7, or10 mg of detomidine [0.008 to 0.018 mg/kg; Table 1],depending on the horse's response to the rst seda-tive and their level of excitement). The doses andthe interval between sedation administration were recorded. Placement of the Loop Vertical Lift System on a Standing, Sedated Horse The components of the Loop Vertical Lift System included four Lift-All EN6 0X6F T Green Tuflex with a34/H11003314-inch pin, and duct tape. Two people applied the sling to 3 horses and 3 peoplewere used to apply the sling to the other 3 horses.Duct tape was used to maintain the round loopsin place while setting up the shackle, as the ducttape was expected to break apart as the horse islifted and the loops expanded. Each of the Lift-AllTuflex Green EN60 Roundslings has a rated capac-ity in pounds ranging depending on use from 4,200(choker), 5,300 (vertical), 7,400 (basket 45\u00b0), and10,600 (basket 90\u00b0); and meet or exceed the Occu-pational Safety and Health Administration andAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers B30.9standards and regulations (Lift-All 2014). The an-chor or D-ring screw shackle had a rated capacity of57,000 lbs (28.5 tons). Once the lightly sedated horse was in the padded anesthesia recovery stall, the Loops Vertical LiftSystem was placed following a systematic approach.Those persons working with the horses wore hel-mets and gloves. The rst-round sling loop wasplaced around the left front limb by lifting the leftfront limb, then it was pulled up under the elbowand slipped over the horse's head. Duct tape wasplaced around the two straps of the round loop abovethe withers and was used to hold the round slingloop in place against the body of the horse while theremaining loops were placed. The second-roundsling loop was placed in the same manner on theright side of the horse so that the two round slingloops crossed each other at the sternum. The twoseparate round sling loops were clipped togetherboth at the sternum and at the withers using two ofthe carabiners to keep the round loops from slippingup into the girth area (Fig. 1A). The third-roundsling was placed around the left hind limb by liftingthe limb, then it was pulled up over the limb, the tailTable 1. Summary of Sedation IV detomidine hydrochloride given at the initial sedation (for placement of the IV catheter) and at the second sedation (for lifting procedure) were chosen according to the level of excitement due to environmental stimuli and horse's demeanor. 218 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONSwas pulled through the round loop, and the two straps of the round sling were duct taped over thecroup so that the straps were held in place againstthe body of the horse. The last round sling wasplaced in the same manner on the right hind limb ofthe horse, such that the round slings crossed eachother underneath the tail and between the hindlimbs. Carabiners were used to clip the roundloops together both at the croup and under the tail(Fig. 1B). Once all four round slings were all held together on the back of the horse, the shackle was opened andeach of the round loops was placed into the shacklein the center of the horse's body. For safety, tworopes were tied from the shackle to metal rings inthe back corners of the recovery stall in order tosecure the shackle, and prevent the horse from lung-ing forward out of the stall. Two lead ropes werealso fed through the stall doors so individuals couldcontrol the head of the horse while outside of thestall. Finally, the anchor shackle was attached to the electric winch system via the latched rigging clipon the end of the chain (Fig. 1C). Foam cushionswere used over the loops in the hind limbs (Fig. 1D). Lift Protocol Using the Loop Vertical Lift System Once the Loops System was in place, the horse wasvisually evaluated for level of sedation and given thesecond dose of detomidine as described earlier.Lifting was initiated 5 minutes after the secondsedation administration. Each of the six horseswas lifted a few inches off the ground with an over-head chain hoist for 3 minutes within the closed-door recovery stall, and then lowered to the groundand allowed to stand. The entire lifting procedureswere digitally recorded for later evaluation. At theend of three minutes of lifting, the horses were al-lowed time to stand unassisted for several minutes,then the loops were removed by letting them slide tothe ground. Horses then were walked to adjacent Fig. 1. Placement of the Loop Vertical Lift System. A, Placement of loops on the cranial aspect of the horse's body.

Once horses were willingly able to hold their head up (30 minutes to one hour post-sedation), the IV catheter was removed and thehorses' ability to ambulate at the walk wasevaluated. Lift Evaluation Subjective evaluation of lift quality as reported forother sling systems were performed using video re-cordings of the entire lift procedure for each of thesix subjects while suspended and while being low-ered. The lifts were scored as excellent, very good,good, or poor. If movement occurred while sus-pended it was displayed by tossing/shaking of thehead, twisting of the body, and moving of the limbsas if trying to gallop or buck. The length of themovement was recorded in seconds, and the timewhen the movement started during the suspensionwas recorded in minutes and seconds. Once thehorses' feet touched the ground, the duration of anymovement was recorded. Standing time was de-ned as the time between being lowered to the pointof hooves touching the ground until able to fullysupport weight in all four limbs. Data Analysis The data for each part of the study were summarizedand reported using descriptive statistics. Data weredisplayed in tabular form whenever possible.3. Results Loop Vertical Lift System on Live, Standing, Sedated Horses A summary of the sedation protocol for each horse is depicted in Table 1. The initial dose of detomidineranged from 0.005 to 0.009 mg/kg, whereas the sec-ond dose of detomidine ranged from 0.008 to 0.018mg/kg, with an average total dose of 0.02 mg/kg.The average time between the initial sedation andthe second sedation administration was 24 minutes. Loop Vertical Lift System Outcomes All horses were lifted, suspended for 3 minutes, andlowered successfully. Some brief movement/strug-gling behavior during the lifting procedure was dis-played by four of the six horses, and in two horsesduring the lowering procedure (Table 2 and Table 3).None of the horses moved for longer than 15 secondsout of the 180-second lifting period. One horse(Horse 2) was lowered for strap adjustment andthen resuspended. In this horse, the slight move-ment observed during the rst suspension and themarked movement during the lowering process waslikely due to the strap positioning. Once the strapswere adjusted, the horse remained quiet during sus-pension and during the lowering process. Tran-sient movement during suspension occurred once inHorses 3, and 6, and twice in Horse 5, and in allTable 2.

One horse (horse 1) kicked once during the loweringprocess. Overall, lift behavior was considered ex-cellent (n /H110051/6), very good (n /H110053/6) good (n /H110052/6) and poor (n /H110050/6). The rst test horse which re- acted poorly to the loops between its hind limbs wasretested using foam tubes placed over the loopstraps which created less pinch in the groin area(Fig. 1D). Horses 1 through 4 had a prior history of lameness and/or musculoskeletal problems noted in theirmedical records. Physical examinations prior tothe lifting procedure revealed no abnormalities inany of the 6 horses. No horses developed signi-cant changes on physical exam ndings post lifting.None of the horses had any signs of pain or edema inthe sheath, or in the axillary, xiphoid and inguinalareas before the lift. One horse (Horse 2) was notedto have a mild, inconsistent lameness at the trot(Grade 1) before the lift. All horses were able toambulate normally at the walk thirty minutes to onehour after the lift. Physical examinations after thelifting procedure revealed moderate sheath edemain Horse 3. The lameness on Horse 2 observedprior to the lift procedure was unchanged after thelifting procedure. The other subjects did not dem-onstrate any lameness before or after the lift. Loop System Placement for Vertical Lift System Timing The overall time for placement of the Loop VerticalLift System for the two-person team ranged from 43to 82 seconds (mean, 61 /H1100613 seconds), and for the three-person team ranged from 22 to 40 seconds(mean, 27 /H110066 seconds). The present study describes a novel vertical lift procedure using a simple lift device to be used inlarge animal rescue for quick and safe vertical lift ofstranded or recumbent horses and may be suitablefor mules or donkeys and other large animals.The major advantages of this novel vertical lift are:1) provides short-term full support using the skele-tal system of the horse without causing injury tomuscles, nerves, or vasculature; 2) placement is fastand safe for personnel; 3) system does not requireJ-hooks or knots; 4) is a compact and portable devicewhich can employ commercially available and rea-sonably priced equipment. The greater accessibil-ity of this novel system at an incident may facilitatethe rescue of stranded and recumbent equids, andexpedite the rescue thus having a positive impact onanimal welfare. The two-step protocol of sedation provided an ad- equate chemical restraint for the study. The initialdose of detomidine hydrochloride at 0.005 to 0.009mg/kg was adequate for the purpose of placing theintravenous catheter and the Loop System. Thesubsequent dose of detomidine appeared to providesedation with less struggling when higher doses of0.016 to 0.018 mg/kg were given. Furthermore, thetwo horses that received higher doses of sedationwere the ones that tolerated the procedure withoutany struggling. It is also possible that the horse's demeanor and temperament influenced the level ofsedation. This study evaluated the set time for vertical non- weight bearing lifting of the horses as 3 minutes.The 3-minute guideline used in this study was tosimulate extreme conditions and should be the max-imum time that a horse is allowed to hang non-weight bearing. On average, horses began somemovement while suspended within 100 seconds of be-ing lifted. When the horse rst began a movement, itwas interpreted as the point at which the horse be-came uncomfortable. As a result of the observationsin this study, it is of the authors' opinion that the LoopSystem is not designed for long-term support, and is tobe utilized for emergency lifting, the rescue of astranded or recumbent equid, or extraction from aconned space situation. Thus, it is not recom-mended to use the Loops System for longer than thetested 3 minutes when using it for complete off theground body support. Furthermore, studies shouldbe conducted with larger sample sizes, and with mulesand donkeys to conrm this conclusion. It should benoted that in other studies using more extensive bodysupport systems such as the UC Davis AndersonSling, horses while non-weight bearing exhibited somedegree of struggling and body movement as well. 11 While the study did not involve mules or donkeys, the similar anatomy for skeletal system supportwould suggest this system to be appropriate forthese equids. Different behavioral responses mightoccur with donkeys or mules and sedation protocolswould have to be adjusted for that species. Summary of Tips for Safe Use of Lifting of a Recumbent Equine 1. Obtain prior training before attempting use of the Loops System or any lifting system anduse the incident command system to run theincident response. 2. Make a plan of action.3. Recumbent or trapped horses can have unpre- dictable violent arousals and injure people. 4. Have a veterinarian administer sedation or general anesthesia as the incident demands. 5. Remember a sedated horse can arouse at any time and cause injury to people. 6. Have head control on the horse using two long lead ropes on the halter with experiencedpeople. 7. Establish a clear area around the horse in case horse leaps when trying to stand. 8. Secure a strong rope running from a solid object to the clevis above the horse to keep thehorse in the desired location if strugglingupon regaining standing. 9. Have additional sedation and venous access if the horse reacts adversely during loops place-ment or during lift. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 221BEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONSLastly, anyone working around a recumbent horse or attempting a vertical lift should be trained in safetymeasures for such a procedure before attempting theuse of the Loops System. Safety equipment such ashelmets and gloves should be utilized. These situa-tions are termed low-frequency high-risk events andthere is a substantial risk of signicant injury to hu-mans attempting to aid a horse, donkey, mule, or otherlarge animals that are in adverse circumstances. The placement of the Loops System for lifting of a recumbent horse is described step by step in Part2. Part 2\u2014Description of the Placement of the Loops System for Commonly Used Equine RescueProcedures Tactical large animal rescue is a eld that has evolved to aid animals in situations where the horseneeds to be moved or extracted from a compromisingsituation. 3,8The sooner a horse is moved to safety the less chance of secondary injury to the horse. Because of the hazards of the size and behavior ofequids, it is critical that those attempting to workwith recumbent or stranded animals have propertraining and have close access to equipment to aid inthe rescue process at the incident. We have found in recumbent patients that need moving, getting support under the horse and at-tached to the skeletal system is difcult with exist-ing equipment. Effective sling or lifting devices used in veterinary medicine for large animals utilize the core skeletalsystem for support due to the considerable weight ofthese animals. 5Veterinary hospitals use special - ized slings for compromised equines, but these de-vices are relatively expensive ($2000 to $5000 USD)and not widely available in many eld settings. 5,6 Therefore a simplied, less expensive (estimatedcost, $350 USD), easy to apply, rescue system wasdesigned for use only in the short-term movement orbrief lifting of the equine rescue patient to allow thehorse to be moved to a safer location or allowed to tryto stand. The loops round sling system referred to as the Loops System utilizes skeletal system support sim-ilar to the UC Davis Large Animal Lift and in hu-mans, full-body safety harnesses. 7,9The Loops System is highly portable, ts in a small duffel bag (9 kg weight and, 30 cm /H1100354 cm /H1100324 cm dimen- sions), simple to apply with written step by stepdirections, does not require knots or hooks, and canbe placed rapidly from a safe area behind the back ofthe horse away from the legs. The ultimate goal ofdescribing the use of the Loops System is to improveequine welfare. Here the paper describes the use of the Loops System for assisting rescue of recumbent equids bydescribing placement for ve maneuvers commonlyused in equine technical rescue-forward assist, rearassist, roll, rear drag, and vertical lift utilizing arecumbent life-size horse manikin model. 83. Materials and Methods Loop System The Loops System used in this study consists of four Lift-All Tuflex Green EN60 6 ft, Each of the Lift-All Tuflex Green EN60 round sling has a rated capacity rangegreater than 4,200 lbs. All items are readily avail-able via internet order. 10 Procedure for Placement of Loop System on a Recumbent Horse Model A life-size equine berglass mannequin model (height at withers, 170 cm; length, 270 cm) (in lat-eral recumbency was used in place of live animals,and two Lift-All EN6 0X6F T Green Tuflex polyester round slings were used for the manipulation proce-dures. The vertical-lift procedures have been per-formed in live horses. 14The steps of the methods are illustrated and described below. All participat- ing individuals exercised safe handling techniquesand stayed behind the horses' body, away from thelimbs, to mimic the live animal situation for safestanding position. The danger zone was dened asa semicircle area from the model's head, around the Fig. 1. Loops System. 222 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONSfeet, to the tail with a 3-foot safety radius. Not shown in all the illustrations is the placement of aperson near the head of the horse, a head bumper forprotection, and use of a skid to facilitate the move-ment of a recumbent horse. Placement of Loop System on a Recumbent Horse Model The method used was to have an assistant read thesteps to the person placing the loops in position forthe chosen procedure. All participating individualsexercised safe handling techniques and stayed be-hind the horses' body. The danger zone was de-ned as a semi-circle area from the model's head,around the feet, to the tail with a three-foot safetyradius. The procedures used were forward assist(Fig. 2), rear assist (Fig. 3), roll of a recumbent horse(Fig. 4), rear drag (Fig. 5), horizontal drag (Fig. 6),and vertical lift (Appendix 1). Vertical Lift Protocol\u2014See Appendix 1. 4. Results The loops system slid under the mannequin and wasplaced in position within approximately 3 minutesfor the forward assist, rear assist, rear drag, and rollprocedures. Placement of the 4 loops for the verti-cal lift was not timed but it takes longer than theother procedures and is illustrated in a step-by-stepmanner below. 5. Discussion Here, a novel compact system for the manipulationof the recumbent or stranded equid is described,using an affordable and portable device to be used in aiding weak horses and equine tactical large animalrescue. The signicant advantages of this novelrescue system are: 1) provides support by utilizingthe skeletal system for safely manipulating large Fig. 2. Forward assist. Fig. 3. Rear assist. Fig. 4. Rolling the down horse. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 223BEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONSanimals; 2) its placement is rapid and is accompa- nied by step-by-step directions; 3) it is simple, notrequiring J hooks or knots; 4) it is very compact andportable; 5) it employs commercially available, andreasonably priced equipment. The accessibility ofthis new system may facilitate the rescue for en-trapped, stranded, and recumbent equids, thus hav- ing a signicant impact on animal welfare. Placement of the Loop System was done by having one person reading the illustrated instructions tothe person applying the loops. This may aid thoseperforming technical rescue in difcult and tryingcircumstances. The application of the Loops Sys-tem may provide a compact tool for the rst respond-ers, veterinarians, and competent horse owners,thus greatly facilitating the success of the technicallarge animal rescue. Ready access to rescue equip-ment when a horse is trapped, and struggling willpotentially minimize secondary injuries as well aslessen exhaustion in the trapped equid. This sys-tem can be stored in a small duffle bag making itconvenient to have in stables or rst responder ve-hicles. The components are affordable (the LoopsSystem components are approximately $350 USD atthis time) compared to other alternatives. Manyexcellent support systems are found in veterinaryhospitals and in some communities where technicalrescue teams are part of emergency response. Un-fortunately, equine incidents often occur away fromsuch prepared teams. Instructions listed here could be printed and placed in the bag, so the steps in placement can befollowed quickly. Individuals should be trained insafety measures for equid technical rescue beforeusing this or other rescue systems. Injury to peopleis a substantial risk in equine technical rescue.The use of protective equipment such as helmetsand gloves and prior training in safe approaches isessential to prevent serious injury to people. Fu-ture studies are recommended to evaluate the elduse of the Loops System in the rescue of entrapped,stranded, or recumbent equids. Limitations of the study: Any studies involving mannequins instead of live horses have limitationswith regard to safety, animal tolerance to supportsystems, and unpredictable animal movements.The students performing the placement of the loopsare members of the student Veterinary EmergencyResponse Club and may have inherent skills thatallowed faster placement than a person who hasattended a single training. However, the presenceof illustrated guidelines, which can be read whileperforming the placement, and the lack of the needfor J hooks and knots, would suggest this placementwould proceed relatively quickly but not as fast asestimated in this brief study utilizing mannequins.Live horses present more difculties, and hence, theplacement time would be expected to be longer inreal emergency settings. The authors have usedthe procedures and Loops System in three live ani-mal eld settings to 1) forward assist to move arecumbent 300-kg body weight donkey into a horsetrailer, 2) rear assist for dragging a 500-kg body-weight mare with dystocia from a horse trailer, and3) lifting a 150-kg body-weight recumbent sow withextensive burns.

Conclusions The basic methodology for approaches for movement of a recumbent horse, and likely a donkey or muleusing a simplied rescue Loops System is illustratedfollowing placement on an equine mannequin. Thesteps of a forward assist, rear assist, rear drag, androlling the recumbent horse have been used previ-ously in equine technical rescue but involve morecumbersome, more complex, less affordable, and of-ten less readily available equipment close to an an-imal incident. The use of the Loops System forvertical lift is more complex and has been tested inlive horses (see Part 1). Specic training before useis required for personal safety.

Haussler, DVM, DC, PhD*; Melissa R. King, DVM, PhD; Kirk Peck, PT, PhD; and Steve Adair, DVM, MS Rehabilitation has become an important aspect of equine practice. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge or awareness of the general principles and methods used to develop safe and effectiverehabilitation programs. By following a few basic principles, appropriate rehabilitation programs can bedeveloped for individual horses with a wide range of injuries and sources of musculoskeletal pain ordysfunction.

Introduction There has been a recent proliferation of rehabilita- tion approaches and modalities with claims of effec-tiveness for treating musculoskeletal and neurologicdisorders in horses. There is a growing body ofevidence with some of these modalities that they dohave a level of safety and efcacy in specic appli-cations. Unfortunately, there has been a long his-tory of practitioners and lay people using variousforms of rehabilitation without a good foundation ofphysical therapy principles, knowledge of tissuehealing properties, or understanding of the basicmechanisms of action of the applied treatments.In addition, there is a tendency to treat all horsesthe same (i.e., one-size-ts-all approach) and torarely have clear outcome measures or goals for thetreatment program. There is a critical need to pro-vide general guidelines for the development of safeand effective rehabilitation plans based on the loca-tion, severity, and chronicity of tissue injuries with clearly dened rehabilitation issues and goals forprogressing (or regressing) in the program. Thisreview provides an outline of general guidelines tohelp practitioners interested in developing rehabili-tation programs or working with sports medicineand rehabilitation experts to provide the best possi-ble treatment for individual horses in differentstages of healing and levels of performance. 2. Rehabilitation Principles Developing an effective rehabilitation program re-quires teamwork and collaboration between the re-habilitation practitioner, regular veterinarian,owner/trainer, and the patient. If everyone is noton the same page with regard to time, costs, layup,risks for reinjury, etc., then there will likely be morechallenges to create and successfully execute an ef-fective rehabilitation program. The other impor- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 229BEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONS NOTEStant aspect of developing rehabilitation programs is that there is not a prescribed treatment approachthat meets all patient's needs (i.e., there is no recipeto follow in a cookbook). Unfortunately, many re-habilitation programs are designed as a one-size-ts-all approach and the individual needs or specictissue healing aspects are not fully addressed.Rehabilitation programs must also be based on cur-rent research and evidence-based practice. Whilethere have been substantial improvements in ourknowledge base with regard to equine rehabilitationand evidence of efcacy for some commonly-usedmodalities, we still have a long way to go to establisha broad-based foundation or understanding of all ofthe mechanisms of action and dened dosage pa-rameters for each of the physical modalities, thera-peutic exercises, and manual therapies that areroutinely used in equine practice. The clinicaldecision-making process for selecting appropriatemodalities for treatment is based on the acuity andstage of tissue injury, proposed mechanisms of ac-tion, and practicality of application based on indi-vidual needs. The progression through each stage of rehabilita- tion must be based on objective criteria and changesin the treatment plan modied accordingly. Thedetrimental effects of immobilization should beminimized or prevented at each stage of tissue heal-ing and injured or healing tissues should not beoverstressed. Immobilization has direct and imme-diate detrimental effects on muscle development,articular cartilage degeneration, joint stability andflexibility, and excessive brosis. 1While remobili - zation can prevent or reverse some of these negativechanges, the time required for tissue healing andeventual recovery is greatly prolonged. 2,3Medical and surgical advances have facilitated rapid returns to sporting activities; however, tissue healing andneuromuscular control must be addressed to pre-vent recurrence of injuries. If neuromuscular coor-dination, strength, or endurance is inadequate, thenligaments, muscles, and bones are exposed togreater or abnormal tissue loading that places re-paired tissues at risk of reinjury. 4Finally, clearly dened rehabilitation issues and goals need to be established and followed throughout the treatmentperiod. 3. Rehabilitation Protocol Development All treatment plans are based on a dened problemlist that has been created from a collection of dataregarding subjective and objective assessments ofindividual patients. From a functional perspective,the primary rehabilitation issues that are most evi-dent on the day of evaluation drive the treatmentplan for that session. Primary rehabilitation is-sues are often categorized into general areas of pain,proprioception, flexibility, strength and endurance.Within each of these categories, more specic as-pects can be dened, such as acute pain, chronicpain, soft-tissue pain, bone pain, or neuropathicpain, for which different pain management ap- proaches should be designed. The phase of tissuehealing also needs to be dened as acute, subacute,or chronic and if the tissue response falls more un-der an inflammatory, proliferative, or remodelingphase of healing. Specic modalities are then pre-scribed for each of these phases to promote or opti-mize tissue healing. For all stages of tissuehealing, the sports-specic aspects of training needto be considered and are typically categorizedinto exercises or modalities that focus primarily onstimulating proprioception, flexibility, endurance,strength, speed, or agility. Once the primary rehabilitation issue has been dened and the stage of tissue healing assessed,then the practitioner can reach into their tool boxand select specic physical modalities, therapeuticexercises or manual therapies to address the issueat hand (Table 1). A single treatment or modality(i.e., monotherapy) may be selected, but often a col-lection of different therapies with overlapping mech-anisms of action are used. The clinical reasoning orjustication for modality selection is critical for suc-cessful rehabilitation of most injuries. If the wrongtherapy is applied at the wrong time or for the wrongindication, then either the treatment is not going tobe effective or worse, the treatment will actuallyexacerbate the injury and delay tissue healing.For each modality, the physical properties and phys-iological effects need to be clearly identied andjudged appropriate to address the rehabilitation is-sue of interest. For example, cryotherapy is indi-cated for acute pain and inflammation and is knownto have analgesic and anti-inflammatory tissue ef-fects. 5Therefore, applying heat to already in - flamed tissues is likely a poor treatment choice.Unfortunately, there are not clear mechanisms ofaction or known physiologic effects for all knownmodalities used in equine practice and most indica-tions, contraindications and precautions are bor-rowed from human physical therapy research andclinical applications. The \"dosage\" for each specic treatment modality includes the intensity, frequency, duration, and pe-riodicity, which must be dened and based on thebest possible evidence for safety and efcacy. Thedosage of the applied treatment is an importantconcept to consider as if too low a stimulus is ap-plied, then it is less likely to be as effective as pos-sible. On the other hand, if too intense of atreatment is applied, then the risk for injury orsafety is increased. There is a need to constantlyassess if the applied treatment is both safe andeffective for the individual patient at their specicstage of tissue healing and phase of recovery. For each specic treatment modality, the inten- sity, frequency, duration, and periodicity must bedened and based on the best possible evidence forsafety and efcacy. As the treatment plan is car-ried out, regular clinical examinations and the use ofobjective outcome measures are needed to determine 230 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBEYOND PRIMARY CARE: HOW TO MANAGE UNCOMMON CONDITIONSif the desired progress is being made or if no changes or worsening of the condition is occurring. Basedon these functional measures, the treatment is mod-ied as needed to either increase, decrease, or con-tinue at the current level of intensity, frequency,duration, and periodicity. Diagnostic imaging mo-dalities are also used throughout the rehabilitationprocess to guide protocol development, monitor theprogression of tissue healing, and to ensure a suc-cessful outcome. Fin ally, the patient is assessed to determine if the overall treatment goals anddesired outcome of rehabilitation have been at-tained or not. When developing a rehabilitation program, the practitioner or team of providers must decide whatis most appropriate for the patient. The rst stageis often viewed as the theoretical stage where theoptimal treatment program with dened mode, in-tensity, frequency, duration and periodicity is deter-mined. The second stage is the practical stagewhen the practitioner determines what is actuallyfeasible for the owner to do. This includes discus-sions about time commitments, nancial concerns,owner receptivity and physical ability to follow thetreatment plan, and if the needed facilities, equip-ment and resources are available to accomplish the outlined treatment goals and perceived outcomes.The third stage is the realistic stage which is whatactually can be done or accomplished. Some horsesdo not tolerate the applied therapies, owners mayincorporate some treatments that are completely op-posite to what was discussed with the practitioner(e.g., ridden versus unridden exercise), and the in-dividual patient may be unable to physically or men-tally complete the assigned task due to pain,weakness, fear, or confusion. Home care instruc-tions are often needed as a means to provide consis-tent treatment, monitoring of progression, andlimiting costs for the owner. Careful selection ofmodalities or interventions is needed to ensurethat owners are applying the recommended ther-apies appropriately and monitoring for possiblecomplications. If multiple rehabilitation issues are identied and judged to be all signicantly important on a singlevisit, then the primary goals are prioritized andranked. For example, an open and chronically in-fected wound may require tissue debridement, painmanagement, antibiotics, and some form of immobi-lization, depending on the severity and location ofTable 1.

In this case wound management may take priority; however, pain management and im-mobilization cannot be ignored. A second principleis to use modalities with multiple mechanism ofactions so that more than one rehabilitation issuecan be addressed with a single modality. A goodexample is the use of underwater treadmill exercisewhere limb unweighting (tissue protection), in-creased joint range of motion (flexibility), and resis-tance (strengthening), all play important roles in therehabilitation of limb injuries. Ice massage is an-other example of combining mechanisms of action.When using a combination of therapies, they caneither be applied sequentially or simultaneously.A horse standing in ice immersion boots can alsoundergo weight-shifting exercises or even acupunc-ture at the same time, depending on the horse'stolerance and compliance. 4. Dosage Considerations The dosage of any component of a rehabilitation pro-gram is based on intensity, duration, frequency andperiodicity. The intensity or amplitude is dened ashow much of a stimulus is applied (Table 2). Thespeed of exercise (i.e., walk, trot, or canter) and theresistance or workload (e.g., unridden vs ridden exer-cise) are common determinants of intensity. Otherexamples include different temperatures of applied cold therapies (i.e., cold-water hose vs ice immer-sion) or intensity of electrical stimulation need to bedened given the rehabilitation goals and tissue-healing phase. Duration is dened as how long aspecic modality is applied (Table 3). Stretchingexercises are typically held for 20 to 30 seconds toallow for tissue hysteresis and creep to help support increased collagen extensibility. 6,7The frequency or number of repetitions are important features for some modalities, such as the number of shocks ap-plied during extracorporeal shockwave treatments(Table 4). Frequency is often based on desired out-come for an applied treatment (e.g., agility vs endur-ance) and the needed recovery time after the appliedexercise or therapy. The periodicity denes howoften the treatment is applied (Table 5). Sometreatment modalities may be applied 3-4 times aday (e.g., cryotherapy), others may be applied once aday (e.g., stretching) and others may be applied ev-ery 4-6 weeks (e.g., acupuncture or chiropractic). In addition to the above parameters, treatment can also be applied locally, regionally, or systemi-cally, depending on the disease process or needs ofthe patient (Table 6). For focal tissue injuries, localtreatment might be the most effective and econom-ical approach. For systemic disease processes orgeneral tness or conditioning, whole-body treat-ments are needed. Treatment of horses withmuscle dysfunction associated with defective poly-saccharide metabolism often require feedinghigh-fat, low-carbohydrate diets and consistent, low-grade exercise. 8Force-velocity relationships can also be considered in rehabilitation protocol devel- opment. H igh-force and low-velocity exercises (e.g., piaffe) to develop maximal strength.Medium-force and medium-velocity exercises (e.g.,jumping) help to Fi-nally, low-force and high-velocity exercises (e.g.,trotting over cavelletti) help to develop speed andagility.Table 2.

Rehabilitation Progression Unlike most medical or surgical approaches that incorporate a set treatment parameter (e.g., mg perkg of body weight) or single treatment event (e.g.,arthroscopic surgery), rehabilitation protocols oftenrequire progressive gradations in treatment inten-sity, duration, frequency, and periodicity to achievedesired outcomes and prescribed goals. This con-cept may be difcult for owners or trainers to fullyunderstand or accept as their primary desire is oftento get their horse back to ridden exercise or return toathletic performance as soon as possible. Veteri-narians may also fall into this trap as the painassociated with lameness may have resolved; how-ever, the proprioceptive, flexibility, strength, andendurance needs of the individual patient may nothave been acknowledged or addressed in anymeaningful way. An example is going from 0% to100% without any consideration of assessing if thepatient can perform adequately at 20%, 40%, 60%,or 80% effort or intensity. The analogy of theprogression through different levels of educationis helpful for some owners to understand stages ofrehabilitation or capabilities within individual pa-tients. A low-level skill or movement require-ment (e.g., walk in a straight line) would beconsidered a kindergarten-level exercise whereasjumping at 1 meter with rapid changes in speedand direction might be considered a college-levelexercise, depending on the physical capabilities ofthe rider or horse (Table 7). For each individual exercise, there is also a pro- gression in the speed or intensity, duration, fre-quency, and periodicity. Intensity can be scored aslow, medium, and high. Speeds can be slow, inter-mediate, or fast. Levels of difculty can be simpleor complex depending the strength or agility re- quired. Surface stability can be modied from rm,stable surfaces (e.g., asphalt) to unstable surfaces(e.g., proprioceptive pads) with static or dynamicperturbations (e.g., pushed off balance) added to in-crease levels of difculty for developing propriocep-tive, coordination, and balance skills. Selectexercises can also include limited or blinded sight tomaximize proprioceptive stimulation and balancerequirements. 9Early stages of rehabilitation should include exercises that are slow and simple, require minimal tissue loading, and are predictable(e.g., underwater treadmill exercise). Later stagesor more advanced exercises incorporate complexmovements at high velocity and high tissue loadsand are unpredictable (e.g., show jumping). 6. Rehabilitation Phases Rehabilitation programs can be simplied by cate-gorizing them into three basic phases based ontissue-healing properties (Table 8). In the acute orinflammatory phase of tissue healing, pain manage-ment, limiting tissue damage and maintaining somelevel of tissue or joint motion are the primary issuesdictating development of the rehabilitation pro-gram. Therefore, pain management and soft-tissueand joint mobilization are often incorporated inthis phase of healing. In the proliferative tissuehealing phase, enhancing tissue healing, limitingimpairment, and restoring function are importanttreatment goals. Exercises that stimulate proprio-ception and flexibility predominate in this phase ofrehabilitation. And nally, the tissue remodelingphase focuses on conditioning tissues to physiologicloading, restoring tissues to structurally and func-tionally meet sports-specic demands, and more im-portantly to prevent reinjury. Exercises thatstimulate endurance and strength are included inthis nal phase of recovery. 7. Outcome Measures Methods of measurement can be categorized intosubjective and objective outcomes. Subjective orqualitative measures may include lameness scores,dressage scores, changes in stride length, or assess-ing muscle tone. Objective or quantitative mea-sures include body weights, limb circumference, orjoint angles to assess flexibility. 10Another form ofTable 4.

Structural measures are often provided bybody condition scores, conformation evaluation, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, or diagnostic imagingmodalities (e.g., cross-section area of a tendon) andmay have little correlation to the actual functionalor pain status of the patient. 11Therefore, func - tional assessment tools have been developed in anattempt to capture the musculoskeletal and neuro-logic status of affected patients. Functional mea-sures include visual analog scales, behavioralscoring (e.g., grimace scores), postural and proprio-ceptive evaluation, assessing strength, and the over-all esthetics of movement. 12The most commonly used methods of assessing tissue injury and inflam- mation are the palpation of heat, swelling, and painresponses. These parameters can be objectivelymonitored with thermal imaging, circumferentiallimb or joint measures, and pressure algometry, re-spectively. 13Additional measures of pain or lame - ness can include limb flexion, hoof testers, groundreaction forces, and inertial sensor devices. 14 Measures of proprioception include neurologic examination, limb advancement, and placement,weight-shifting exercises, postural stability, and theability to navigate cavelletti or ground poles. 15 Flexibility can be readily assessed using goniom-eters to measure joint angles or baited stretches toassess both the quantity (range of motion) and thequality (ease and freedom of movement) of spinalmotions. 16Lameness is commonly assessed with visual observation, but can also be evaluated with motion capture systems, force platforms and electro-myography; however, the cost and time required forthis type of assessment is prohibitive in most reha-bilitation settings. Video-based software programsand pressure mat sensors are now available that areuser-friendly and can capture the basic movementpatterns of most gaits. 17Pedometers are very use - ful for counting steps and monitoring overall activityand have seen a recent growth in popularity. Ob-jective measures of strength continue to be a chal-lenge in equine practice. The most commonly usedmethod to assess strength is the resistance and abil-ity to correct after sudden, lateral traction on thetail. Basic levels of assessing strength include theability to stand unassisted, duration of activity, andthe distance traveled. Moderate challenges to as-sess weakness might include the ability to navigateincline and decline surfaces or the subjective assess-ment of impulsion or core stability. 18Advanced and more objective measures of strength and endur- ance include assessing jump heights, time for com-pleting events (e.g., evening or endurance) and racetimes for Standardbred or Thoroughbred patients.Measures of cardiovascular tness often includeheart and respiratory rates, core temperatures,Table 7.

When to Stop or Discontinue Therapy The same indicators that were used to determine theneed for rehabilitation are used to assess if the re-habilitation program was successful or not. Therate of recovery is variable between patients andoften dependent on the location, severity and chro-nicity of injury (Table 9). For pain, if there are nosigns of physical or behavioral issues related to pain,then that phase of treatment can be considered ac-complished and the next phase is pursued. Flexi-bility is judged as the restoration of normal jointmotion, which can be assessed from a local, regional,or whole-body perspective. Balance, coordination,and agility incorporate both proprioceptive (affer-ent) and motor control (efferent) mechanisms. Dy-namic perturbations (e.g., lateral tail pull exercises)require a fully functional proprioceptive system aswell as the strength and coordination required toresist the applied forces. Proprioception is judgedbased on repeatable foot and limb placement, gen-eral body awareness, posture, and core stability.Motor control includes aspects of balance, posture,coordination, core stability, strength, and endur-ance. Balance is dened as the ability to remainupright and steady. Postural control involves thesupport of the body against gravity. Coordinationincludes body movements that produce an intendedaction. Core stability stabilizes the axial skeletonduring movement. Strength is a measure of thecapacity to do work and endurance is the ability tocontinue that activity. Strength and endurance arefeatures that are constantly developed and requiredfor full athletic function. 9. Obstacles to Safe and Effective Rehabilitation The two biggest challenges to manage in any reha-bilitation facility or practice are the high costs andintensive, hands-on time required to successfully implement most treatment plans. Costs are notlimited to equipment needs, but also a dedicatedfacility or work-space, infrastructure, to support theequipment (e.g., hyperbaric chambers), availablehousing for prolonged stays, and stafng needs forapplying treatments and monitoring responses withobjective outcome measures. If dedicated rehabili-tation facilities are not available, then practitionerstypically have to provide repeated farm calls withadded time and travel costs. Compliance is oftenan issue with home care for both the owner and thepatient. What you as a practitioner are able to domay differ substantially from how the owner ortrainer applies the therapy. Some horses may beaffected with multiple disease processes (e.g., meta-bolic syndrome and laminitis) or multiple affectedlimbs. As with any medical or surgical approach,managing end-stage disease can be extremely chal-lenging and unrewarding at times. One of the mostsignicant obstacles to delivery of effective rehabil- itation is the lack of knowledge or awareness of thecurrent literature. Unfortunately, there is limitedresearch funding in this area and few individualsthat are able to conduct the studies needed to ad-vance the knowledge base. Many of the modalitiesused are based on unsubstantiated claims of effec-tiveness or indications for treatment. Visiting Websites of laser manufactures can be quickly over-whelming and extremely confusing for even themost educated individual. Rehabilitation centersmay also employ lay people without the needed vet-erinary oversight or rehabilitation expertise neededto create, implement, and monitor effective treat-ment programs. Other centers may have strongtreatment biases based on their perception that allhorses need underwater treadmill exercise, irrespec-tive of the tissue-healing phase or individual needsof that patient. If treatment is not progressing asexpected, then an incorrect diagnosis or selection ofthe wrong therapy or application (e.g., timing, dura-tion, frequency) need to be considered (Table 10).Finally, if objective outcome parameters are notused consistently throughout the rehabilitation pro-gram, then assessing the progression or need todiscontinue therapy for individual patients is notpossible. 10. Summary The development of safe and effective rehabilitationprograms requires extensive thought and planning,consideration of individual patient needs, and moni-toring of tissue healing and functional capabilities.Rehabilitation programs should be based on the needto address pain, proprioception, flexibility, strength,and endurance. The phases of tissue healing are im-portant drivers for both the creation and implementa-tion of treatment plans. Finally, objective outcomeparameters and specic treatment goals are needed toensure that horses are progressing appropriatelyTable 9.

Introduction Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is performed to ensure cultured bacteria are susceptible to the anti-microbials being administered as treatment. It is ameans of predicting efcacy by determining the an-timicrobial concentrations that inhibit growth ofbacteria and whether these concentrations areachievable in the plasma and tissues of the targetspecies, and for a long-enough period of time. Cul- ture and susceptibility testing is often underutilized inveterinary medicine, owing to time delays and theadded challenges in interpreting test results; instead,empirical drug choices are often made. This paperwill demonstrate that susceptibility data can aid in theselection of appropriate antimicrobials in equine prac-tice, in spite of time delays, and to simplify the inter-pretation of results. In most cases, antimicrobial susceptibility testing evaluates the concentration of antimicrobials thatinhibit the growth of bacteria, providing the mini-mum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC) is the concentrationof an antibiotic that kills or eliminates bacterial agentsin vitro ; however, this is used less commonly on a clinical level. The MIC is what is most commonlyreported by microbiology labs. Susceptibility (S) breakpoints are determined by the Clinical and Labo-ratory Standards Institute (CLSI). 1The susceptibil- ity breakpoint of an is the lowestconcentration of that antimicrobial which inhibits bac-terial growth and is achievable in the target speciesafter conventional dosing. 2,3Resistance (R) break- point means the concentration of the antimicrobialrequired to inhibit bacterial growth is not achievable in vivo or for a long enough duration to be effective. 2,3 The bacteria which have MIC values at this Rbreakpoint or above are considered resistant tothat particular antimicrobial. A designation of\"I\" for intermediate susceptibility is used for someantimicrobials. This means that efcacy may be achieved with ideal pharmacokinetics and phar-macodynamics, and possibly higher dosing thanwhat is normally done, but antibiotics with an \"I\"designation would be less reliably effective thanantimicrobials with an \"S\" result. Unfortunately, the number of antimicrobials for which the CLSI has provided guidelines for in vet-erinary species is limited; therefore, many of the \"S\"breakpoints used in veterinary medicine are fromrecommendations for humans and may be inappro- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 237LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEM NOTESpriate for horses, particularly for orally adminis- tered antimicrobials, which often have reducedabsorption and bioavailability in horses as comparedto humans. For drugs that do not have recommen-dations for horses specically, clinicians must relyupon knowledge of pharmacokinetic studies of thosedrugs in horses whenever available, as well as basicpharmacology and the type of infection beingtreated. The rationale for this how-to session is thechallenges clinicians face in interpreting MIC dataas they relate to infections in horses, especiallywhen the lab does not provide horse-specic break-points. The objectives are to help practitioners ininterpreting MIC data provided by the microbiologylab, and how to predict susceptibility to antimicro-bials for which there are no equine-specic CLSI ormicrobiology laboratory guidelines. 2. Materials and Methods Tests Available for Obtaining Antimicrobial Susceptibility Results Disk Diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) This is a qualitative test and as such does not pro- vide a MIC value. Instead, the results are reportedsimply as \"susceptible\" or \"resistant\" based on azone of inhibition of bacterial growth on culturemedia created by the antimicrobial contained in apaper disk. The disks contain a single concentra-tion of each antibiotic. They are placed on the agar plate, which was previously inoculated withthe bacterial isolate being tested. The antimicro-bial contained within the disk diffuses outwardconcentrically into the agar. After 24 hours ofincubation, the zone of inhibition of bacterialgrowth around each disk is measured. The bac-terial isolate is deemed susceptible, intermediateor resistant based on the diameter of this zone ofinhibition. The primary disadvantage of the Kirby-Bauer technique is that it only tests one concentration ofeach antimicrobial. Because this single concentra-tion is based on the drug disposition in humans, itmay not be pertinent to horses as this concentrationmay be unachievable in horses if the drug is notabsorbed well in this species. Therefore, the bacte-rial isolate would be considered resistant in vivo in horses, yet is reported as susceptible based on the in vitro result as it pertains to human concentrations. This would be misleading to equine clinicians, andpotentially result in therapeutic failure if the neces-sary concentrations are not achieved in the horse. Broth Microdilution This is a quantitative test in which the cultured bacteria are inoculated into wells on a plate contain-ing serial dilutions of the antimicrobials to be tested.For example, the wells may contain serial dilutionsof 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 /H9262g/mL for minocycline. The plates are examined after 24 hours with ananalytical instrument that detects bacterial growth. The MIC is the lowest concentration of antimicrobialthat inhibits bacterial growth. For example, ifgrowth is present in the wells containing 0.25, 0.5,and 1 /H9262g/mL of minocycline, but is inhibited in those with 2 /H9262g/mL or above, then the MIC of that microbe is 2/H9262g/mL. Besides being quantitative and testing a number of different concentrations of a specicantimicrobial, each plate tests a number of differentantimicrobial drugs simultaneously. E-Test The E-test method uses a strip that has the antimi- crobial impregnated on one side, at varying concen-trations. The strip is then placed on an agar platethat contains the bacteria of question. The MIC isread as the concentration on the strip where thezone of inhibition intersects the strip. In this way,the E-test is quantitative. The disadvantage isthat each strip only tests one antimicrobial. Sample Collection and Laboratory Submission Samples submitted for culture and susceptibilitytesting include transtracheal wash aspirates, bloodcultures, urine, uterine swabs, peritoneal or pleuralfluid, and abscess aspirates, among others. Opti-mally, these samples, except for blood cultures thatare submitted in blood culture vials, are submittedin commercial culturette swabs with transport me-dium. Whenever possible, the original sampleshould be submitted as well. These samples shouldbe refrigerated, whereas blood cultures should beplaced in an incubator or at least maintained atroom temperature. The samples are submitted to aveterinary microbiology lab for aerobic /H11006anaerobic culture and susceptibility testing. If the cultureincludes anaerobes, an anaerobic transport mediumshould also be submitted; these are kept at roomtemperature until submitted. Urine samplesshould be collected aseptically and placed in sterilespecimen cups. 3. Results The laboratory provides the results of susceptibilitytesting as \"S\" or \"R\" for each of several, often a dozenor more, antimicrobials. Ideally the actual MICvalue will be reported adjacent to the designation\"S\" or \"R\" as well, so that the clinician can interpretwhether the MIC can be realistically expected to bereached in horses for a long enough period of time tobe considered effective against that particular bac-terial isolate. For time-dependent drugs, the timeabove the MIC (T /H11022MIC) is important. This refers to the time that serum (and tissue) concentrationsremain above the MIC of the offending microbe.Ideally, the T /H11022MIC would encompass the entire dos- ing interval for time-dependent antimicrobials likepenicillin or cephalosporins; however, at a mini-mum, the T /H11022MIC should be /H1135050-75% of the dosing interval to be considered effective, depending on thetype of bacteria being treated. 238 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET as the serum concentration to MIC (Cmax/MIC)or the area under the curve to MIC (AUC/MIC)ratios should be evaluated, where Cmax is the max-imal achievable plasma concentration and AUC isthe area under the plasma concentration-timecurve. These values are obtained from pharmaco-kinetic studies of that antimicrobial in the targetspecies. The Cmax/MIC ratio for aminoglycosidesand fluoroquinolones, both concentration-dependentdrug classes, should be /H113508-10 in order to ensure maximal efcacy. For example, if the MIC of gen-tamicin for an E. coli isolate is 2 /H9262g/mL, then the peak concentration of gentamicin measured at 1hour post-administration after appropriate dosing(e.g., 6.6-8.8 mg/kg IV, daily) 16-20 /H9262g/mL for it to have maximal efcacy, largely based on datafrom human medicine. 4-6In evaluating the phar - macokinetics (PK) in horses, it is found that theexpected 1-hour peaks with such dosing are indeedabout 20 /H9262g/mL. Therefore, in this case, gentami- cin would be considered effective, and the isolatewould be considered \"S\" to gentamicin. Fortu-nately, therapeutic drug monitoring is feasible andpractical for the aminoglycosides. A 1 hour post-administration peak would be measured in the se-rum of the patient and compared to the MIC. TheAUC/MIC for enrofloxacin ideally should be /H11350100- 125 for optimal efcacy, and like the Cmax data,these ratios can be obtained from publications eval-uating the PK of enrofloxacin in horses. The interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing is determined by two major internationalbodies, the CLSI for the United States, and theEuropean Committee Antimicrobial Susceptibil-ity Testing whereasthe CLSI has separate recommendations for bothhuman and veterinary bacterial agents in a varietyof animals. Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in- clude susceptible (S), intermediate (I), and resistant(R). Interpretation of Results from the Laboratory Susceptible A microbe is dened as susceptible (S) when it is inhibited by a concentration of antimicrobial that isreadily achievable in serum after safe dosing of thatdrug in the targeted animal species, in this casehorses. The antimicrobial would be predicted tohave a high likelihood of therapeutic success. 2,3 Intermediate A microbe is dened as intermediate (I) in suscepti- bility when it is inhibited by antimicrobial concen-trations that may or may not be achievable in serumafter recommended dosing in horses. Therefore thetherapeutic effect is less predictable, and only if theinfection is in a site where the drug is concentrated (e.g., intracellular) or when a higher dose of the drugcan be administered safely. Hence, an antimicro-bial deemed \"I\" in susceptibility would be less desir-able for the tested microbe than one with an \"S\"designation. Resistant Resistance to an antimicrobial means the concentra- tion of antimicrobial required for inhibition is serum concentra-tions after recommended dosing protocols inhorses. 2,3The bacterial isolate being tested would not be inhibited by the usual achievable concentra- tions of the antimicrobial after normal dosing andintervals recommended for horses. In this casethere is a high likelihood of therapeutic failure ifthat antimicrobial is used. From the example usedabove for \"S\", if the MIC of the microbe for gentami-cin is 8 /H9262g/mL, then it would be considered resistant because a Cmax of 64-80 /H9262g/mL is not readily achieved after safe dosing in most horses.7In a study evaluating daily doses of 6.6 mg/kg IV of gen- tamicin administered daily to adult horses, 1-hourpeak concentrations of gentamicin ranged from 4.4to 42.6 /H9262g/mL, with a median value of 21.4 /H9262g/mL.7 4. Discussion Culture and susceptibility testing results are usefulfor maximizing therapeutic efcacy while beingmindful of antibiotic stewardship. Though there isa time delay of 3-5 days for results, they can ensurethat the early, empirical antibiotic choice that wasmade was an appropriate one. If it was not, thenan antibiotic change is in order, using data from thesusceptibility results. The other advantage of per-forming culture and susceptibility testing routinelyin a practice is that over time it will provide theclinician with data from which he or she can predictan effective antimicrobial for the specic type ofbacteria. For example, if cultures from horses withcellulitis commonly result in growth of staphylo-cocci, the clinician can accumulate susceptibilitydata over a few year period and use that informationto predict which antimicrobials would have the high-est probability of success for treating a staphylococ-cal cellulitis even before susceptibility results areavailable, or when a positive culture is not obtained.For example, if the previous 10 or 20 cultured Staph- ylococcus isolates were found to be susceptible to gentamicin, then gentamicin in combination with abeta-lactam antimicrobial for synergy and broad-spectrum coverage would be an appropriate prelim-inary antibiotic combination for cellulitis casesgoing forward. It is important to note that MIC results should be interpreted in light of the pharmacokinetic andpharmacodynamic data for the specic antimicrobialin horses whenever available, especially whenequine-specic CLSI guidelines are available.Some of AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 239LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEMbreakpoints for antimicrobials are extrapolated from human data, yet for many orally administeredantimicrobials the same plasma concentrations can-not be achieved in horses because of lower bioavail-ability. 1Therefore, the interpretation of a result of \"S\" for orally administered antimicrobials, without knowing the actual MIC value, should be made withcaution. Clinicians should ask the microbiology labfor actual MIC values to be provided in the results sothat they can compare these to results of pharmaco-kinetic studies for the specic antibiotic in horseswhenever available. For ease of reference, the au-thor has listed suggested susceptibility breakpoints for oral antibiotics for horses below, using the avail-able published PK studies for these drugs. An example of one of these differences in interpre- tation is for minocycline; the bacteria is /H113494 /H9262g/mL. This is the break- point used by many commercial veterinary microbi-ology laboratories when reporting microbes as\"susceptible,\" based on the human data. However,the pharmacokinetic studies of minocycline in adulthorses show the steady state plasma concentrationsto be far lower than that in humans. Based onthose data and the doses of minocycline used inhorses, the author feels the clinical susceptibilitybreakpoint for oral minocycline (and doxycycline) inadult horses should be /H113490.25 /H9262g/mL.8,9Bacteria with higher MIC values (0.5-4 /H9262g/mL) would not be expected to respond to oral minocycline in adulthorses at the doses used, even though they would be considered susceptible for human infections.This same caution in the interpretation of MICdata should be applied to other orally adminis-tered antimicrobials with variable or relativelypoor absorption in adult horses. This highlightsthe importance of asking the microbiology labs toinclude the actual MIC values, not simply thedesignation \"S,\" andminocycline. Relative decreases in the oral bio-availability of these drugs in adult horses makethe achievable plasma concentrations much lowerthan those in humans or small animals for whichmany of the CLSI guidelines have been developed.It should be noted that because foals absorb oraldrugs to a greater extent than adult horses, higherbreakpoints are likely appropriate for that agegroup. For these antimicrobials, based on resultsof oral pharmacokinetic studies in adult horses,the author recommends the following susceptibil-ity breakpoints be used for adult horses after oraladministration: 1. Chloramphenicol: ( /H113491 /H9262g/mL) after Enrofloxacin: ( /H113490.25/H9262g/mL) after dosing (in some in-stances /H113490.5 /H9262g/mL may be targeted afteradministration of enrofloxacin Equisul SDTa(24 mg/kg PO, 4 mg/kg PO, q12h.9 5.

Belgrave, DVM, MS, DACVIM Author's address: e-mail: dr_belgrave@midatlanticequine.com. \u00a9 2019 AAEP. 1. Introduction Inflammatory blood markers constitute a host of quantiable proteins that are produced by the bodyin response to inflammation and/or infection. Themajority of these proteins are classied as acutephase proteins (APPs), which are the mainstay ofthe acute phase response (APR), and respond ineither a positive or negative manner to the presenceof variety of stimuli that may be related to infection,trauma, neoplasia, inflammation, or stress. Nega-tive APPs include albumin and transferrin, whereasthe positive APP category comprised of hapto-globin, C-reactive protein (CRP), ceruloplasmin,brinogen, and serum amyloid a (SAA). The pos-itive APPs are further classied as major, moder- ate, and minor APPs. Major APPs maintain verylow plasma concentrations in healthy mammals;however, there may be as much as a 1,000-foldincrease in those concentrations in response toinflammation. To date, SAA is the only majorAPP identied in the horse. Moderate and minorAPPs are typically present in the plasma ofhealthy individuals, and for these APPs, only a 1-to 10-fold increase in concentration may be ob-served during the APR. Fibrinogen is classiedas a moderate APP, whereas both haptoglobin andCRP are minor APPs. 1The classication of these markers as inflamma- tory may be somewhat of a misnomer, as infectionand the proinflammatory cytokine production that itelicits is truly what gives rise to signicant hepaticproduction of these APPs. As a result, these mark-ers have become the mainstay of the diagnostic test-ing arsenal used to discern whether or not there isan infectious component to the condition being evaluated. 2. Materials and Methods Of the positive APPs, SAA and brinogen haveemerged as the most reliable hematologic indicatorsof infection/inflammation in the horse. Comparedwith plasma brinogen concentration or other he-matologic indices, such as total white blood cellcount, SAA concentration was found to be a morereliable indicator of inflammation or infection. 2 SAA has the added advantage of having a muchmore amplied response to infection than brino-gen. The wider range of values seen with SAAlends itself to being a more useful tool in monitoringthe clinical response to therapy. When using andinterpreting these markers, one must also take intoconsideration the timing of sampling relative to thestage of illness, as there is a stark contrast in thekinetics of these two reactants. Concentrations of 242 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEM NOTESmajor APPs, such as SAA, typically increase rapidly in response to inflammation (6 to 12 hours, with apeak of 48 hours) and decrease swiftly upon resolu-tion of the disease process due to their short halflives. 3,4In contrast, plasma brinogen concentra - tion may only begin to increase 24 to 72 hours afterthe inflammatory insult, peak between days 10 to14, and may remain elevated for weeks. 4The dis - parity in the kinetics should be used to the clini-cian's advantage when assessing the clinicalresponse to antimicrobial therapy, with more em-phasis placed upon the use of SAA during the initial stages of infection. The APR has often been de-scribed as the molecular thermometer of the body,and the inherent sensitivity of SAA has been dem-onstrated in the clinical setting, where increases inSAA have preceded the development of fevers inpatients. When rst evaluating the clinically illpatient, both SAA and brinogen testing should beperformed to establish baseline values prior to ini-tiating possible antimicrobial therapy. The authorrecommends using both diagnostic tests, as the cli-nician may not be accurately aware of the durationof illness. The author has observed many cases ofchronically walled-off lung abscesses in adult horseswith normal SAA values. Likewise, in foals withbronchopneumonia, SAA has been demonstrated tohave a low sensitivity. 5The normal SAA values seen in some foals with bronchopneumonia may also be reflective of the chronic walled-off nature of theassociated pathology; however, the exact reason forthis remains unknown. A SAA greater than 100mg/L or elevated brinogen greater than 400 mg/dl,with corroborating diagnostic ndings should promptconsideration of an infectious component. Once these baselines have been established and antimicrobial therapy instituted, the author recom-mends serial monitoring of SAA, every 24-48 hoursto determine the peak SAA attained during the ini-tial stages of illness. Establishing this peak is im-portant, as it gives an indication of the severity ofthe disease process. Misinterpretation of the ef-cacy of the antimicrobial regimen can also occur if asample is taken early on in the course of disease andthen again only 5 to 7 days later, when the result isstill higher than the original value. In this in-stance, the peak is missed, and although the value istruly on the decline, to the interpreter, it appears asthough the second sample is higher than the rstand is often interpreted as a failure of the treatmentregimen used.Once the SAA is on the decline, testing intervals may be spaced out to every 72 to 96 hours until theSAA is back to normal. Due to the short half-life ofSAA and the rapid decline seen with appropriateantimicrobial therapy, continued treatment beyondnormalization of SAA is recommended. This au-thor has observed many cases of bacterial pneumo-nia in which the SAA has returned to normal;however; visible pathology remains on ultrasound.Once the SAA has returned to normal, closer atten-tion should be paid to the brinogen concentrationin the patient, which may not peak until the 10-daymark of therapy. The brinogen should then befollowed throughout the remainder of the course oftreatment along with clinical and diagnostic assess-ment of the patient to determine the optimal time tocease antimicrobial therapy. 3. Discussion Inflammatory blood markers play a pivotal rolealongside clinical and diagnostic examinations, inthe diagnosis and monitoring of infectious diseases.SAA has been shown to be a more reliable indicatorof infection during the acute stages of illness. How-ever, the contrasting kinetics of SAA and brinogenmake them both useful monitoring tools that couldbe used throughout the course of treatment of infec-tious disorders. The use and interpretation ofthese markers should not supersede the clinician'sthorough physical and diagnostic examination.

The morbidity from these viruses can reach100% in a population of susceptible horses; however,the mortality is generally low. The diagnosis of IURTD relies on the combination of historical information, physical ndings, bloodwork, and antigen detection in respiratory secre-tions. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain re-action (qPCR) has supplanted conventional culture- based detection methods for the diagnosis of IURTD. 2qPCR is fast, reliable, cost effective, and more sensitive than conventional detection meth-ods. 2However, the high analytical sensitivity of qPCR can lead to false-positive results. Further,one of the drawback of qPCR is its inability to denethe biological status of a pathogen (viable versusnon-viable). There is a great need to improve theeld of molecular diagnostics in order to rene thedetection and interpretation of respiratory viruses.The goal of this how-to paper is to illustrate variousapplications of modern molecular diagnostics in or-der to more reliably interpret qPCR results for re- spiratory viruses. 2. Test Interpretation qPCR Testing for Lesser Characterized Viruses Parallel testing of multiple infectious agents in stan- dardized platforms is a central component of qPCR:it essentially allows several detections to happensimultaneously on a single sample for various patho-gen targets. This strategy allows an efcientworkup of complex clinical syndromes with generalsymptomatology. Furthermore, even though veter-inarians tend to make a single pathogen diagnosis,it has become more evident that syndromes can becaused coinfections. While EIV and represent thecore of qPCR viruses, lessercharacterized such equine rhinitis virusesand the gamma herpesviruses and in parallel testing. Equine rhinitis viruses (ERVs) have been given little attention by practitioners compared to otherrespiratory viruses, mainly because of the lack ofdiagnostic modalities. 3These viruses are common in horse populations but knowledge of their epide-miology, pathogenesis, and association with diseaseis poor. There are two namely equine rhini- 244 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEM NOTEStis A (ERAV), formerly known as equine rhinovirus 2. These important pathogensare capable of infecting both the lower and the upperairways. Both natural and experimental infectionof seronegative horses with been discharge,coughing, lymphadenopathy, and occasionally lowerlimb swelling. 4The diagnosis has remained a true challenge for ERVs until recently. The infection may be diagnosed by virus isolation, detection ofviruses by qPCR or demonstration of rising antibodytiters to ERVs through virus neutralization usingacute and convalescent serum EHV-2 and EHV-5 are widespread in horse popu- lations; therefore, the detection of any of these vi-ruses can occur in both healthy and sick animals. 5 These two /H9253-herpesviruses are optimally adapted to their host, which means that molecular detection ofEHV-2 and/or EHV-5 in nasal secretions of a horsewith respiratory signs can be challenging to inter- pret. However, since the /H9253-herpesviruses are known to immunomodulate the immune system,they may potentially increase the susceptibility ofhorses to other infectious pathogens. However,due to their high detection rate in healthy horsesand in order to avoid dilemmas with the interpre-tation of qPCR results, testing of EHV-2 andEHV-5 in horses with upper respiratory tract dis-ease is not recommended at this time. Assessment of Viability for Selected Viruses Most qPCR results are reported qualitatively, refer-ring to the absence (negative result) or presence(positive result) of the targeted pathogen. Whilethis strategy is adequate for the detection of non-persistent viruses such as EIV, this approach may be insufcient to reliably characterize virusesknown to cause persistent infection such as EHV-1and EHV-4. EHV-1 and EHV-4 are /H9251-herpesviruses that affect the equine respiratory tract and can establish life-long latent infection following exposure. The diag-nostic sample of choice is a nasal or nasopharyngealswab which should be taken early in the febrilephase of the disease. Due to the lymphotropism ofEHV-1, detection can also be attempted from wholeblood. qPCR assays used in the diagnostic eld are based on the detection of viral genomic DNA and aretherefore unable to distinguish between replicatingand nonreplicating virus. This information is rele-vant in order to assess the infectious nature of ahorse as well as environmental contamination viavirus containing nasal secretions. Discriminationbetween the different viral states is now possible by1) targeting several genes (e.g., glycoprotein, laten-cy-associated transcripts), 2) detecting viral genomicDNA and transcriptional activity of the target genesat the messenger RNA level, and 3) using abso-lute virus quantication. 6These molecular strate - gies are used diagnostically for EHV-1 or EHV-4-infected horses in order to discriminate betweenreplicating and nonreplicating virus, to determinetheir infectious risk based on viral load in nasalsecretions and to monitor their response to treat-ment. The absence of transcriptional activity cou-pled with a low viral load (thresholds are laboratoryspecic) for EHV-1 or EHV-4 would support a non-active infection at the time of sample collection. Assessment of Genotype for Selected Viruses EHV-1 myeloencephalopathy (EHM), a relativelyuncommon manifestation of EHV-1 infection, cancause devastating economical losses associated withquarantine procedures, cancelation of events, andfatalities. In general, a diagnosis of EHM is sup-ported by historical and clinical ndings and labo-ratory ndings of and identication of EHV-1 polymorphism (SNP) at 2254 (ORF 30) correlates withneurological disease. 7This SNP is responsible for a single amino acid residue at position 752 of the DNA polymerase with EHV-1 strains associatedwith neurological outbreaks involving a D 752geno - type (also referred as G2254), whereas most non- neurological outbreaks involve a N752genotype (also referred as A2254). However, the genotyping of eld isolates needs to be interpreted carefully as 14% to 24% of EHV-1 isolates from horses with EHM do nothave this neuropathogenic marker. Strain charac-terization may be important given that the potentialTable 1.

RecentEIV surveillance data has shown that Florida sub-lineage viruses from both clade 1 and 2 circulate inEurope, while clade 1 viruses have been primarilyreported from North America. With the increasednational and international transportation of equids,it is very important to monitor the spread of EIVusing timely, fast, and reliable molecular diagnosticplatforms. In past years, clade afliation of EIVstrains has been monitored using conventional nu-cleic acid sequencing techniques and more recentlypyrosequencing, both of which are time- and laborintensive. Recent advances in genomic analysishave identied various SNPs of the hemagglutininA1 able to of EIV eld isolates. presently offered by individual diag- nostic laboratories in order to determine EIV cladeafliation. The information pertaining to EIVclade afliation is important not only from anepidemiological standpoint but also to monitorand understand EIV outbreaks and update EIVvaccine strains in order to improve protectionagainst clinical disease. 3. Conclusion Quantitative PCR has without any doubt improvedthe accuracy and turnaround time for the detectionof respiratory viruses. Novel molecular approachesare presently available to complement the alreadyqualitative reporting of qPCR results for respiratoryviruses. These include the use of parallel testingfor well- and lesser-characterized respiratory vi-ruses in order to expand etiologies associatedwith IURTD, dene the contagious nature of aninfected horse by assessing the replicative status ofselected viruses, and by dening the genotype ofselected viruses in order to determine prognosticoutcome (EHV-1 in the context of EHM) and vaccineeffectiveness (EIV). However, while all these diag-nostic strategies add to a better interpretation ofresults, one must always keep in mind the biology ofthe suspected pathogen to be detected, the diseasestage of the animal (acute versus subacute orchronic), the collection of the most sensitive biolog- ical specimen (nasal versus nasopharyngeal secre-tions) to be used and test to be requested. Wheninterpreting qPCR results, one must remember thefactors listed above in order to be able to trouble-shoot and explain why a sample unexpectedly testednegative. In conclusion, novel molecular strategiessuch as absolute quantitation, detection of viraltranscripts and genotyping will expand the possibil-ity to better characterize selected viruses, determinethe level of environmental contamination and risk oftransmission and monitor treatment response andvaccine effectiveness.

Introduction Genetic testing typically involves the analysis of an animal's DNA to determine the individual's geno-type for an inherited disorder or trait. Genetictesting may be used for permanent individual iden-tication and parentage determination; many breedregistries now require such verication to ensurethe accuracy of their pedigrees. Genetic testing isalso used to test for specic diseases or traits. Tointerpret genetic testing results for future breeding,an understanding of the mode of inheritance is re-quired. Now, many of the genetic tests availablefor horses are for an autosomal recessive disorder todetermine whether an animal is a carrier. Carriersare phenotypically normal but have the potentialto produce diseased progeny. Dominant disordersalso exist in the horse and genetic tests may be usedto denitively diagnose affected horses. 2. Materials and Methods This presentation will focus on recently availablegenetic tests in horses, including cerebellar immune-mediatedmyopathy.3. Results CA CA affects Arabians and carriers have been identi- ed in Bashkir Curly Horses, Trakehners, andWelsh ponies, most likely due to Arabian ancestry.The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive.Clinical signs are consistent with a cerebellarataxia, including dysmetria, spasticity, wide-basedstance, intention tremors, and a lack of menace re-sponse with an age of onset around 2.5-6 months.The genetic etiology was discovered in 2011 as amissense mutation in TOE1. 1Interestingly, the mutation actually affects expression of a nearbygene, MUTYH, which is involved in DNA repair. 2 There is no treatment available. Breeding Breeding a carrier (N/CA) to another carrier (N/CA) results in a 25% chance of producing an affected foal(CA/CA) and a 50% chance of producing anothercarrier (N/CA). Breeding a carrier (N/CA) to a nor-mal horse (N/N) results in 50% chance of producinga carrier (N/CA). Breed Registry Regulations The Arabian Horse Association (AHA) requires dis- closure of a horses' SCID status. According to their AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 247LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEM NOTESpolicy, \"The AHA Code of Ethics requires members to disclose severe combined immunodeciency(SCID), cerebellar abiotrophy (CA), lavender foalsyndrome (LFS) and hyperkalemic periodic (HYPP) status, if known, for any horse capable ofreproducing that is being offered for breeding, sale,or lease. In addition, an owner of a mare that pro-duces affected SCID, LFS, CA, or HYPP offspringshould immediately notify the stallion owner.\" a Congenital Myotonia This affects the New Forest pony and is inherited asan autosomal recessive trait. Clinical signs includea well-muscled pony with bilateral dimpling ofthe hindquarter muscles. Recurrent episodes ofstiffness and weakness occur, and the pony maydemonstrate third eyelid protrusion when stressed.Severe muscle rigidity can result in decreased flex-ion of distal limbs. The mutation was discovered in2012 as a missense mutation in the chloride chan-nel, voltage sensitive 1 gene ( CLCN1 ). 3This is also the gene implicated in \"fainting\" goats. Breeding Breeding a carrier to another carrier results in a 25% chance of producing a foal affected with congen-ital myotonia and a 50% chance of producing an-other carrier. Breeding a carrier to a normal ponyresults in 50% chance of producing a carrier. Breed Registry Regulations Currently, testing is mandatory for breeding stal- lions within the New Forest pony Association andRegistry. Multiple Ocular Defects (Anterior Segment Dysgenesis or Congenital Aniridia) This condition affects multiple breeds, including the American Miniature Horse, Icelandic, Rocky Moun-tain Horse, Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse, Shet-land pony, and Morgan horse. It is inherited as anautosomal semi-dominant trait, where two copies ofthe mutation lead to more severe disease than onecopy. Clinical signs include a silver coat color and a wide range of eye anomalies (uveal cysts, cornea glo-bose, iris stromal hypoplasia, abnormal pectinateligaments, cataracts, may have the less severe cyst phenotype withcysts originating from the temporal ciliary body, iris,or retina. The genetic mutation was discovered in2013 as a missense mutation in the melanocyte pro-tein 17 precursor gene, PMEL17 . 4This mutation causes both the silver coat color phenotype and the ocular abnormalities. Breeding Breeding a heterozygous affected horse (N/Z) to a normal horse (N/N) results in a 50% chance of pro-ducing a heterozygous affected foal (N/Z). Breedinga homozygous affected to a normal horse(N/N) results in a 100% chance of producing a heterozygous affected horse (N/Z). Breed Registry Regulations Currently, there are no mandatory testing re- quirements within the Rocky Mountain HorseAssociation. CSNB This affects multiple breeds and occurs in homozy-gotes for the incompletely dominant allele that con-fers Leopard complex spotting. The mutation isautosomal semi-dominant; one copy of the mutationresults in the leopard complex spotting while twocopies leads to the CSNB phenotype. Clinical signs include non-progressive impaired vision in dark conditions. Electroretinogram ab-normalities include an absent b-wave and increasedamplitude of the a-wave. The genetic etiology wasdiscovered in 2013 as a retroviral insertion in thetransient potential cation channel, subfam-ily M, 1 ( TRPM1). 5 a heterozygote (LP/lp) to another hetero- zygote (LP/lp) results in a 25% chance of producing afoal that may become affected with CSNB (LP/LP)and a 50% chance of producing another carrier (LP/lp). Breeding a heterozygote (LP/lp) to a normalhorse (lp/lp) results in a 50% chance of producing aheterozygote (LP/lp). Breed Registry Regulations Currently, there are no mandatory testing require- ments for CSNB within the Appaloosa Horse Club. Dwarsm Dwarsm affects the American Miniature Horse and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Clini-cal signs include disproportionate dwarsm charac-terized by a severely shortened stature, shortenedlimbs relative to overall body size, bowed forelegs,shortened neck, a disproportionally large cranium,flat faces with prominent eyes, low nasal bridge,severe underbite, cleft palate, and large abdominalhernia. The genetic as 4 distinct variants in aggrecan ( ACAN ). 6 These have been labeled D1 through D4 and include missense and nonsense mutations. Breeding Genetic testing for all variants (D1 through D4) is recommended. Breeding of a carrier (N/D*, where* represents variants 1-4) to another carrier (N/D*)will result in a 25% chance of an affected foal (D*/D*) and a 50% chance of a carrier (N/D*). The dwarf phenotype has been reported with the following genotypes: D2/D2 D2/D3 248 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEMD2/D4 D3/D4 A lethal (aborted or resorbed phenotype) the following genotypes: D1/D1 D1/D2 D1/D3 D1/D4 Breed Registry Regulations There are no breed recommendations for dwarsm at this time. Warmblood Fragile Foal Syndrome (Type 1) fragile foal 1 (WFFS) isan autosomal affecting Hanoverians,Selle Francais, Dutch WB (KWPN), Oldenburg, andWestphalian horses. Clinical signs include hyper-extensible skin at birth, focal seromas, hematomasand lacerations, laxity of the fetlock, and floppy orbent ears. The genetic defect is a muta-tion equine lysyl hydroxylase gene orthologous gene responsible for human cases ofEhlers-Danlos syndrome VI. The disease is invari-ably fatal to foals. Breeding Breeding a carrier (n/FFS) to another carrier (n/ FFS) results in a 25% chance of producing a foalaffected with fragile foal syndrome (FFS/FFS) and a50% chance of producing another carrier (n/FFS).Breeding a carrier (n/FFS) to a normal pony (n/n)results in 50% chance of producing a carrier (n/FFS). Breed Registry Regulations The KWPN has recently decided to test all active KWPN-approved stallions for WFFS. As of this writ-ing, there are no other breed organizations perform-ing standard testing. HWSD HWSD is an autosomal recessive signs include splitting ofthe dorsal hoof wall shortly after birth. All fourfeet are typically affected. The genetic defects is a1-bp insertion in SERPINB11 , leading to a prema- ture stop codon. 7 Breeding Breeding a carrier (N/HWSD) to another carrier (N/ HWSD) results in a 25% chance of producing a foalaffected with hoof wall separation disease (HWSD/HWSD) and a 50% chance of producing another car-rier (N/HWSD). Breeding a carrier (N/HWSD) to anormal pony (N/N) results in 50% chance of produc-ing a carrier (n/FIS).Breed Registry Regulations As of 2016, all new Connemara pony registrations are tested for HWSD and the result is included intheir passport. Hydrocephalus Hydrocephalus in the Friesian horse is an autosomalrecessive trait, often leading to premature birth orstillbirth of affected foals and associated dystocia.In 2015, a nonsense mutation in B3GALNT2 was found to be associated with hydrocephalus in the Frie-sian horse. 8 Breeding Breeding a carrier (N/HCP) to another carrier (N/ HCP) results in a 25% chance of producing a foalaffected with hydrocephalus (HCP/HCP) and a50% chance of producing another carrier (N/HCP).Breeding a carrier (N/HCP) to a normal pony(N/N) results in 50% chance of producing a carrier(n/FIS). Breed Registry Regulations The Friesian Sport Horse Association strongly recom- mends testing any Friesians or Friesian-crosses thatare for hydrocephalus. b Immune-Mediated Myositis Immune-mediated myositis of Quarter Horse andQuarter Horse related breeds is a semi-dominanttrait leading to either widespread muscle atrophyfollowing an infection or vaccination or a nonexer-tional rhabdomyolysis. In 2018, a missense muta-tion in myosin heavy chain 1 ( MYH1 ) was associated with IMM in the Quarter Horse. 9 Breeding Breeding a heterozygous affected horse (N/MYH1) to a normal horse (N/N) results in a 50% chance ofproducing heterozygous affected foal (N/MYH1).Breeding a homozygous affected horse (MYH1/MYH1) to a normal horse (N/N) results in a 100% chance of producing a heterozygous affected horse(N/MYH1).

Discussion It is important to realize that no association or com-mittee evaluates quality control of DNA tests thatare available in animals. Most tests are publishedin the scientic literature not as tests, but as articlesdescribing the discovery of the mutation. Becausesome cases involve patent issues, some tests areoffered before publication. Much of the researchdone to identify the mutations involved in the testsis performed at universities and funded by grantingagencies that have both nancial and intellectual in- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 249LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEMterest in patenting the tests. Veterinarians should contact the laboratories to inquire about available ge-netic tests for horses because laboratories are licensedto only run particular tests.

Introduction Veterinarians are often faced with a horse suspected to have neurologic disease, manifested either by ob-vious signs of neurologic dysfunction or by enigmaticgait decits or poor performance. A limited num- ber of diagnostic tests are available to assist in di-agnosis, particularly in eld settings. Serologicaltests for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM)and Lyme disease are probably most commonlysubmitted tests for horses with neurologic disease,gait decits, or poor performance. Whether theseancillary tests are helpful or misleading depends onthe veterinarian's ability to interpret results accu-rately, with consideration of the specics of the case. 2. EPM Overview EPM is most commonly caused by the protozoanparasite Sarcocystis neurona , although infection with Neospora hughesi has also been reported. General proprioceptive ataxia is one of the mostcommon clinical signs of disease and is oftenasymmetric, with a mixture of upper and lowermotor neuron paresis. Lower motor neuron in-volvement leads to muscle atrophy, which is alsooften asymmetric.Antemortem diagnosis of EPM remains challeng- ing and is always presumptive. Many normalhorses are exposed to the parasites and develop an-tibodies in the absence of clinical disease. There-fore, performing serology, regardless of test chosen,will only reveal whether the horse has been exposedtoS. neurona and/or N. hughesi and does not indi- cate current disease status of the central nervoussystem. To achieve the best possible diagnosis inthe live horse, three criteria must be met: presenceof neurologic disease; exclusion of and conrmation of specic antibodies in theserum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or both. 1 3. EPM Test Interpretation All of the commonly used diagnostic tests for EPMassess whether or not the horse has antibodiesagainst the protozoa in serum, CSF, or both. Thedifferences among the tests include their methodol-ogies (Western blot fluorescent anti-body test [IFAT], or immunosorbentassay [ELISA]) as well as which antibodies are rec-ognized. Several commercially available tests de-tect antibodies against S. neurona , including WB, IFAT, SAG2, 4/3 ELISA, and SAG 5, 6 ELISA.All but the WBs are quantitative. IFAT and ELISA AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 251LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEM NOTESare available as testing options for antibodies against N. hughesi . General principles for interpretation of EPM test results are as follow: A positive serum test indicates exposure to the organism but does not conrm CNS infec-tion, regardless of the magnitude of the ti-ter. Therefore, particularly in areas whereexposure is common, a positive serum test willhave a low positive predictive value for CNSinfection and clinical disease. A negative serum test usually indicates that the horse has not been exposed to the organ-ism. Therefore, a negative serum test gener-ally has a high negative predictive value forclinical disease, meaning that a negative re-sult is very useful in excluding EPM as the cause of disease. Rarely, a recently infectedhorse might show clinical signs prior to sero-conversion, in which case repeated testing in10-14 days should be positive. A positive CSF test is more likely to correlate with an EPM diagnosis than a positive serumtest. However, false positives commonly oc-cur. Horses with low CSF titers are lesslikely to have EPM than horses with high CSFtiters. A negative CSF test usually means EPM is not the cause of disease. Rarely, as mentionedabove, a recently infected horse will show clin-ical signs prior to developing a measurableantibody level in CSF; re-testing 10-14 dayslater should be positive. The best way to diagnose EPM is to submit serum and CSF for quantitative testing andcalculation of a serum:CSF titer ratio (or spe-cic antibody index), which allows detection ofintrathecal antibody production. Validationstudies for the S. neurona SAG2,4/3 ELISA showed that the serum:CSF titer ratio in-creased overall accuracy to 93-97%, as op-posed serum alone, which had an overallaccuracy of 54-56%. 2,3 The author's current approach is to submit pairedCSF and blood samples for an S. neurona SAG2, 4/3 ELISA (or Neospora allows identication of best with active CNS dis-ease. IFAT titer ratio testing also shows high ac-curacy in the diagnosis of clinical disease. SAG 1ELISA was shown in one study to have unacceptablylow sensitivity (12.5%) and thus is not recommendedfor diagnosis: 4this stand-alone SAG 1 assay is no longer commercially available. The SAG 1, 5, 6 ELISA has not yet been validated using well-characterized positive and negative cases and thusits accuracy is unknown. 14. Lyme Disease Overview Horses living in endemic areas are frequently in- fected with Borrelia burgdorferi , the gram-negative spirochete that causes Lyme disease. As withEPM, one of the major problems in diagnosing Lymedisease is that many horses appear to have beenexposed to B. burgdorferi in the absence of clinical signs of disease. Exposure occurs when the horse isbitten by an Ixodes spp. tick-carrying B. burgdorferi , and the organism infects the horse. Some horseslikely eliminate the infection on their own, somehorses likely become chronically infected but remainsubclinical and some horses are chronically infectedand develop clinical signs. Several reports describ-ing Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) in horses havebeen published. 5-8Similar LNB can cause a variety of neurologic decits, including behavioral changes (ranging from dullness/obtun-dation gaitabnormalities, cranial nerve and tremors or fas- ciculations. Additional systemic signs might occurconcurrently, including weight loss, uveitis, cardiacarrhythmias, and dermal masses of LNB is best achieved by fullling several criteria, which might include po-tential B. burgdorferi exposure (via residence in or travel to an endemic area), presence of neurologicsigns, diagnostic testing to rule out other potentialdiseases, documentation of abnormal CSF, and iden-tication of the organism or immunologic evidence ofinfection. CSF cytological analysis is strongly rec-ommended for horses with suspected LNB; resultsare often abnormal with neutrophilic or lymphocyticpleocytosis and increased total protein. 8Although identication of the organism via culture, immuno- histochemistry, or PCR in tissue or CSF samplesfrom the patient provides strong evidence for activeinfection, positive results are uncommon even inhorses with conrmed LNB, and antibody testingremains the mainstay of laboratory diagno-sis. Similar criteria should be utilized to diagnoseother Borrelia -associated syndromes such as uveitis and pseudolymphoma; these criteria include poten-tial exposure, compatible clinical signs, exclusion ofother diseases that might cause similar clinicalsigns, evidence of prior or current infection with B. burgdorferi , and supportive cytology, histopathol- ogy, or antigen detection tests. 11 5. Lyme Disease Test Interpretation General principles of interpretation for Lyme testresults are similar to those for EPM testing, but theauthor nds Lyme diagnosis even more challenging.A positive test usually indicates past or present in-fection with B. burgdorferi , although vaccination can also cause positive results for some tests. Re-gardless of test utilized, clinical Lyme disease can- 252 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEMnot be conrmed, and there is no gold standard test. Horses living in an endemic area are frequentlyseropositive, so positive results will have a low pos-itive predictive value of disease. None of the testsprove causation of clinical signs or predict whetherdisease is likely to develop in the future. There isno known correlation between magnitude of titerand likelihood of disease. It is unclear how welltests that predict stage of infection perform withhorses that have had repeated exposures. Severaladditional caveats should be mentioned: Knowledge of vaccination history can aid in interpretation of results. There are four ca-nine vaccines that are occasionally used inhorses. Three a,b,care two-strain bacterins that could induce antibody production against multiple antigens, including OspA and OspC(to varying degrees). One dis a recombinant pure non-adjuvanted protein that only in- cludes the OspA antigen. Although, in theory, documentation of intra- thecal antibody production is recommendedfor the diagnosis of LNB, in practice it be-comes difcult. Unlike with EPM, there isno established optimal cutoff for LNB using aserum:CSF antibody ratio. Horses withLNB frequently have abnormal CSF cytologyand hence might have an abnormal blood-brain barrier, confounding results. Sampledilution can complicate interpretation of re-sults the Multiplex assay tests serumat a dilution of 1:400 whereas CSF is gener-ally run undiluted). Finally, at least for the diagnosis of LNB, the Lyme Multiplex shows poor discriminatoryability. Recent retrospective analysis Multiplex values for neurologic horseswith post-mortem diagnoses shows similarresults for horses with and withoutLNB. Horses with LNB can have negativeMultiplex results, and horses without LNBcan have positive Multiplex results (on se-rum, CSF, and CSF:serum ratios). 12Addi - tionally, the author knows of several horseswith concurrent diagnoses of neuroborreliosisand common variable immunodeciency; thesehorses, due to low B-cell numbers and hypogam-maglobulinemia, have unreliable serologic re-sults and might test negative for anti- Borrelia antibodies despite CNS infection. 13 The author's current approach to diagnosing LNB isto \"back into\" the diagnosis by testing for and rulingout all other plausible causes of the horse's neuro-logic signs. Abnormal CSF cytology, either neutro-philic or is supportive.Lyme Multiplex results are considered but negativeresults do not exclude the diagnosis, and positiveresults do not conrm it. PCR testing for B. burg- dorferi can be performed on CSF. A positive resultis highly suggestive of LNB but a negative result does not exclude the disease; the sensitivity of PCRis unknown and several of the author's conrmedcases have tested negative. 6. Conclusion As can be seen, the principles of diagnosis for EPMand Lyme are similar and complicated. The equinepractitioner must observe the presence of compati-ble clinical signs, use appropriate diagnostic testingto rule out other potential causes of the horse's clin-ical signs, and nally conrm that EPM or Lymedisease is a possible cause. Challenges arise whenclients cannot afford or refuse to pursue appropriatediagnostic testing for other potential diseases, andthe equine practitioner is left only with clinical signsand serological test results to interpret. In thesescenarios, it is important for the practitioner to useclinical judgment as well as knowledge of the prob-ability of various neurological diseases affecting thepatient (pre-test probability of disease) in interpre-tation. Discussion with the client regarding thelimitations of serological testing is imperative inpreventing misunderstandings, and in certain situ-ations might persuade the client to pursue moredenitive testing, which will benet the horse.

The rst line of defenseagainst S. equi infection is at the mucosal level whereas the SeM titer measures serologic titers. 2 Vaccination status and natural infection play a signicant role in serum antibody production result-ing in signicant overlap in interpretation of SeMiELISA results (Table 1). 3Due to the cross-reactiv - ity between SeM and the homologue of SzM ( S. zooepidemicus M), there is the potential for false- positive results. No published control studies havebeen performed examining the sensitivity/specicity of these tests or the true reliability of the associationof very high titers with metastatic strangles andpurpura hemorrhagica. A recent study showedthat some strangles horses maintainedprolonged increase in SeM antibody titers ( /H1135012,800 at 8 weeks post infection) which may not be associ-ated with complications such as purpura hemor-rhagica or metastatic abscessation. Despite this,horses with prolonged increased SeM antibody titersstill warrant further diagnostic investigation. 9 Vaccination is contraindicated in a horse with an SeM antibody titer of /H113503,200 due to the risk of developing purpura hemorrhagica.1,10In a nal multiple logistic regression model performed on blood samples in 188 healthy horses at the time ofroutine spring vaccines, older horses, horses otherthan Thoroughbreds and Warmbloods, and horsesvaccinated with an attenuated-live intranasal ewere to have an of /H113501,600 than younger horses, Thor- non vaccinates.10 When examining SeM- antibody titers in both healthy and S. equi convalescent horses, horses with a history of clinical strangles disease logicallywere more likely to have titers of /H113503,200. 10,11 Titer response will vary among individuals with SeM antibody titers /H113503,200 documented in horses for up to 20 months post-natural S. equi outbreak. Therefore, vaccination for S. equi is not recom- mended within 1 year of an outbreak without deter-mining the SeM iELISA titer for the specicanimal. 11 Combined SEQ2190 (antigen A) and SeM (an- tigen C) iELISAd\u2014This test is currently not avail - able in the United States and is to be used inunvaccinated populations based on the currentavailable vaccines at the time of writing these pro-ceedings.

Pigeon Fever ( Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infection) Introduction Pigeon distemper) is caused by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis in- fection resulting in external and/or internal ab-scesses. Although horses most commonly presentwith external abscesses seen in the pectoral region,external abscesses can also be found along the ven-tral abdomen, mammary gland, and inguinal/axil-lary regions. Internal abscessation can be found inthe viscera of both the thoracic cavity (lungs), andabdominal cavity (liver, spleen) as well as the retro-peritoneal space (kidneys). Clinical cases of Pigeonfever are most commonly seen in the western regionof the United States, but more recently have beenreported as far east as Kentucky and the Floridapanhandle. 13,14Although less common, C. pseudotu - berculosis has also been implicated to be the cause of ulcerative lymphangitis, a disorder recognizedworldwide. The organism has been found in soilwith various fly species considered to be responsiblevectors, which introduce the organism to brokenareas of skin. 15,16 Material and Methods Serum can be submitted for measurement of IgGantibodies to a C. pseudotuberculosis exotoxin via the synergistic hemolysis inhibition (SHI) test.The toxin produces a zone of hemolysis when a disccoated in the patient's serum sample is plate sensitized with Rhodococcus equi culture and incubated overnight. If the serum sample contains antibodiesto the C. pseudotuberculosis toxin, the hemolysis reaction is inhibited. Serial dilutions of the serumsample are measured and the endpoint titer is de-termined by the highest dilution for which there iscomplete inhibition of the hemolysis reaction aroundthe disc. 17 Results The presence of hemolysis /H110220.5 mm around the disc is considered a negative test result (no antibody toC. pseudotuberculosis toxin present). When hemo- lysis measures /H110210.5 mm, the presence of antibody is considered unlikely. 17Discussion Ideally, a positive culture should always be used to conrm C. pseudotuberculosis infection. Samples for culture can be obtained from aspiration of ex-ternal abscesses, ultrasound-guided ne-needleaspirations of internal abscesses, as well as from peritoneal, transtracheal, and pleural fluid samples.Risks of disease should be assessed prior to usingthe SHI titer, taking into consideration geographiclocation of the patient, history of exposure to dis-ease, and clinical presentation. Serologic testingvia SHI titers should always be interpreted in con-junction with the horse's clinical picture, a completeblood count, inflammatory proteins, and if possible,advanced imaging. Serology should never be usedas the sole method of diagnosing C. pseudotubercu- losis internal infection. 18SHI titer results overlap in horses with external abscesses, internal abscesses and exposed herdmates.18,19The SHI test is best used to assist diagnosis of internal disease in the absence of external disease.18 Horses with a SHI titer /H11350512 and concurrent ev- idence of chronic inflammation in the face of noexternal abscessation, are almost 11 times morelikely to have internal disease than horses with SHItiters /H11021512. 18Diagnostic imaging of the region of the body suspected to have an internal abscess is indicated in horses with clinical signs associatedwith that body part (for example chronic colic [ab-domen], coughing and nasal discharge Given that antibody titer results are likely to be low to negative early in the diseaseprocess, horses in which there is a strong suspicionofC. pseudotuberculosis infection should be retested 2-4 weeks later if the initial test is negative andclinical suspicion remains high. 18,20Horses with C. pseudotuberculosis infection of the thoracic cavity may show clinical signs earlier, resulting in lowerSHI titers compared with those with C. pseudotu- berculosis infection of the abdominal cavity. Ani- mals with a higher SHI titer have a higherprobability of active disease. SHI titers will remainincreased for many months due to IgG's long half-life of 21 days. Monitoring for decreasing SHI titervalues to determine resolution of disease is helpful,but should be performed in conjunction with normal-ization of bloodwork and, if applicable, cultureresults. 18 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Vet- erinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction The minimum duration of immunity (DOI) is known for most commercially available vaccines; however,the maximum DOI is rarely established during chal-lenge studies that form an important part of thevaccine approval process. Typically, the data gen-erated during the approval process is based on pri-mary vaccination of na\u00efve horses; therefore,challenge data is rarely available for persistence of immunity following \"booster\" vaccination, whichwould be expected to be more prolonged than afterprimary vaccination. Horse owners and veterinar-ians frequently question the need for annual revac-cination of horses against diseases such as rabiesand tetanus for which considerably more prolongedrevaccination intervals are recommended in otherspecies, including humans. This issue becomesmore of a concern when the horse has developed anadverse reaction to a particular vaccine in the past,prompting owners to ask whether the horse can betested to nd out whether he/she is resistant toinfection rather than \"blindly\" administering an-other booster. Although the American Associationof Equine Practitioners (AAEP) Vaccination Guide-lines strongly discourage this practice, questionswill continue to arise; therefore, veterinarians should be aware of important available informationregarding this subject. Because measurement ofantibody titers in blood is currently the only practi-cal method for assessing immunity to specic infec-tious agents in the eld setting, it is important tounderstand whether circulating antibody actuallypredicts susceptibility or resistance to infection orwhether another less readily measured componentof the immune response, such as mucosal or cell-mediated immunity, provides a better \"correlate ofprotection.\" The decision to revaccinate a horse that has pre- viously experienced a vaccine-associated, systemicadverse event will depend on the risk and conse-quences of infection, the interval since the last vac-cination, the titer level and trend compared to theprevious titer measurement, balanced against thepredicted risk and severity of an adverse event re-sulting from vaccination. 2. Correlates for Protection Vaccines of various types have been developed tomimic infection and stimulate protective immuneresponses without causing disease. In general, thecloser the response to vaccination mimics the re- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 259LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEM NOTESsponse to natural infection, the more effective the vaccine will be. Replicating modied-live virus orvectored vaccines generally mimic natural infectionwell and induce an array of local and systemic im-mune responses similar to those induced by naturalinfection, whereas inactivated vaccines typically in-duce a more limited array of responses. Commer-cially available vaccines for horses include vaccines typically contain an adjuvantto enhance the immune response. In general, theyare good inducers of systemic antibody responsesbut are generally less effective at inducing cellularand local responses. Attenuated parenterally ad-ministered live vaccines are generally effective atinducing both cellular and humoral responses,whereas intranasally administered vaccines may in-duce local mucosal responses without inducingsignicant increases in the level of circulating anti-bodies and effector T cells. For pathogens and Streptococcus equi ss.equi (S. equi) that infect the host via the respiratory tract, the major immune correlates of protection are thelevel of specic secretory antibody (typically of theIgA and IgG subclasses) and/or local effector T cellsat the level of the respiratory mucosa and, in thecase of S. equi , the local teric pathogens such as rotavirus, at the level of the enteric epithelium isimportant for protection against infection. If thesespecic mechanisms are in place, infection may becompletely prevented (i.e., sterile immunity); other-wise, infection occurs, the pathogen gains systemicaccess, and clearance of the pathogen is then depen-dent on systemic humoral and/or cellular immuneresponses. Under these circumstances, high levelsof circulating antibody and/or antigen-specic cyto-toxic T lymphocytes may quickly clear the pathogenand signicantly attenuate or prevent developmentof clinical signs (i.e., provide clinical protectiondespite not inducing sterile immunity). Whereasparenterally administered vaccines may be sub-op-timally effective in preventing infection with patho-gens such as equine influenza that gain access to thebody via mucosal routes, they are generally moreeffective in preventing infection and disease causedby pathogens that gain access to the body via sys-temic injection (e.g., tetanus toxin \"injected\" viapuncture wounds, rabies via bites, and viral enceph-alitides via mosquito bites). 3. Duration of Immunity In addition to understanding correlates of protec-tion, it is important to understand that some patho-gens are inherently more antigenic than others,which may result in a longer duration of protection.This is embraced in the concept of DOI. For manyrespiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens, the DOItends to be relatively short, even after recovery from natural infection. Because vaccines rarely inducethe full array of immune responses induced by nat-ural infection, it is not reasonable to expect thatimmunity following vaccination will be more com-plete or of longer duration than following naturalinfection. This is an important concept for veteri-narians and horse owners to understand so thatthey do not place unrealistic expectations on theeffectiveness of vaccines to prevent infections suchas EHV-1 and EHV-4, for which immunity followingnatural infection is short-lived and incomplete.Similarly, it is important to understand that immu-nity is not absolute and that a level of immunity thatwill protect against low-level challenge may be over-whelmed by a higher challenge dose. The minimum DOI is known for most commer- cially available vaccines, whereas the maximumDOI is rarely established during challenge studiesthat form an important part of the vaccine approvalprocess. In an attempt to ensure vaccine efcacy isdue to vaccination and not pre-existing immunity,the United States Department of Agriculture(USDA) typically requires vaccination and challengestudies to be completed on relatively young, healthy,na\u00efve horses that show no serologic evidence of pre-vious infection or the presence of maternally derivedantibodies. These horses tend to be at their peakregarding immune-competence and will show opti-mal immune responses. Additionally, with theexception of rabies, challenge studies are often per-formed 3 to 6 weeks after completion of the primaryvaccination series at a time when immunity andresistance to challenge infection are at their peak.Challenge studies are rarely done more than 6 or 12months after vaccination; therefore, maximum DOIis not established and the revaccination interval of 6to 12 months is typically approved and on the label,even though some vaccines undoubtedly induce pro-tection of more than 12 months' duration. Addi-tionally, because the approval process typicallyrequires na\u00efve horses, the duration of protectionafter subsequent booster doses, which one wouldexpect to be more prolonged than after the primaryvaccination series, is rarely established. Further-more, it is illegal for vaccine manufacturers to claima prolonged duration of protection beyond one yearunless they have conducted the studies and obtainedUSDA approval for such a claim, even though moreprolonged protection may have been documented forthe same disease in other species such as dogs andhumans. The only denitive method to assess whether an animal is resistant to infection is through natural orexperimental challenge. Clearly this is not a feasi-ble or desirable approach to testing immunity inclient-owned animals. Similarly, it is not practicalor affordable to assess systemic cellular immunity oreither local cellular or humoral protection at themucosal level. The end result is that serologic test-ing for levels of circulating antibody becomes the 260 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEMonly method available to the practitioner to attempt to assess levels of immunity to various pathogens.As noted above, this approach is only reliable forthose pathogens for which the key correlate of pro-tection is measurable antibody in the circulation andfor which published reports are available document-ing the level of antibody that reliably correlates withprotection against the disease in question, prefera-bly in horses. If data is not available for the horse,extrapolation of information from other species, in-cluding humans, may be appropriate for some dis-eases. In many vaccination challenge studies, thecirculating antibody titers in vaccinates and controlsat the time of challenge are reported. This infor-mation gives some clue as to the level of antibodythat may constitute a protective titer for those dis-eases for which circulating antibody titer is a goodcorrelate for protection. Of relevance here is thetype of serologic test used to determine vaccine re-sponses. For example, the serum virus neutraliza-tion test detects the presence of antibody that willneutralize a virus in vitro . This test would there- fore be likely to predict the ability of the antibodiesto neutralize the pathogen in vivo, whereas others(e.g., tertiary tests such as ELISA) may have lesspredictive value in terms of resistance to infection ordisease. Additional important constraints on theuse of serologic tests to predict the need to vaccinateare the limited commercial availability and cost ofrelevant serologic tests for many of the pathogensagainst which we vaccinate. 4. Rationale for Serologic Testing For many years, the recommended \"core\" vaccinesfor all horses in North America were tetanus, East-ern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), and Westernequine encephalomyelitis (WEE). The introductionof West Nile virus (WNV) to North America in 1999and subsequent spread across the continent resultedin WNV being added to the AAEP-recommendedcore. Soon thereafter, the public health risk asso-ciated with rabies caused the AAEP to add annualrabies vaccination to the list of core vaccinations.Owners often express concern regarding the neces-sity for frequent administration of vaccines, partic-ularly against diseases such as tetanus and rabiesfor which vaccines induce prolonged immunity inother species. This concern is heightened when in-dividual horses experience an adverse reaction to aparticular vaccine, prompting owners and veterinar-ians to ask whether it is possible to test the horse todetermine if it is protected rather than simply ad-ministering a booster dose of vaccine that may notonly be unnecessary but may also put the horse atrisk for an adverse reaction. Conversely, there is alegitimate concern among equine practitioners thatrecommending a vaccination interval that is longerthan the label recommendation, places the veteri-narian at risk of legal action if the horse becomesill with the disease in question. This dilemma isheightened by the following statement in the AAEPEquine Vaccination Guidelines: \" The use of anti- body titers or other immunological measurements todetermine if booster vaccination is warranted is notcurrently practiced in the horse as standardized testsand protective levels of immunity have not been de-ned for most diseases. A correlation between anti-body levels and protective immunity under eldconditions has not yet been identied.\" It is the author's opinion that when the risk of an adverse reaction approaches the risk from the dis-ease in question, it is rational to attempt to predictimmunity by serologic testing and extend the revac-cination interval for as long as possible, rather than\"blindly\" vaccinating the horse. In these situa-tions, it is also critical that the veterinarian workwith the horse owner to do a comprehensive diseaserisk assessment and consider eliminating vaccineantigens for which disease risk is minimal or non-existent. Additionally, serologic testing can provehelpful in identifying the subset (10% to 15%) ofotherwise-\"normal\" horses that are \"non-/low re-sponders,\" as well as in assessing immunity inhorses, such as those with pars intermedia dysfunc-tion, that might be suspected of having suppressedimmune responses. The following sections provide a disease-by- disease review of relevant immunologic consider-ations for the \"core\" diseases detailed above. Anti-body titers associated with protection, expectedduration protection and cautionary comments forvarious vaccine-associated equine pathogens andtoxins are presented in Table offer-ing serologic tests for the respective pathogens arepresented in Table 2. 5. Tetanus Levels of circulating tetanus toxin binding (To-Bi)antibody appear to correlate well with protection inhorses. 1To-Bi titers of 0.02 IU/mL or higher (i.e., /H110220.01 IU/mL) are considered to be protective.1-3 Whereas the duration of persistence of vaccine- induced antibody levels above the 0.01 IU/mLthreshold for protection varies somewhat dependingon the adjuvant system used, the age and maternalantibody status of the horse at the time of primaryvaccination and the vaccination schedule, tetanustoxoid is considered to be a potent antigen that in-duces a robust serologic response in immune-competent horses. For horses that receive the two-dose primary series of tetanus toxoid after 6 monthsof age, protective antibody levels persist for at least12 months. A third dose of toxoid administeredmore than 2 months and up to 17 months after thesecond dose in the primary series has been shown toinduce antibody titers that persist above the thresh-old for protection for periods ranging from 2 years tomore than 10 years. 2-8It is likely that subsequent doses of toxoid could protect for even longer, as is the case in people; however, duration of protection hasnot been conrmed in challenge studies in horsesvaccinated with products licensed in North America. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 261LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEMA challenge study conducted in Europe almost 50 years ago found that three doses of tetanus toxoidinduced protection lasting for at least 8 years, andperhaps for life, even when antibodies could no lon-ger be detected. 1These results suggest that, for a horse that has previously been vaccinated using a 2- or 3-dose primary vaccination series followed by atleast one subsequent booster dose, the revaccinationinterval could be extended for as long as To-Bi an-tibody levels remain above 0.01 IU/mL. This pe-riod could be 1 year to more than 8 years and shouldbe conrmed by monitoring To-Bi titers at least onceannually, depending on the magnitude of the mea-sured titer (the higher the titer, the longer it willtake to decline to levels of 0.01 IU/mL or less).However, a word of caution is warranted based onthe nding that tetanus has been documented invaccinated horses in North America, althoughsurvival was strongly associated with previousvaccination. 9 In earlier studies, antibody levels were measured using the expensive and time-consuming TTANA inmice. 1,6,9More recent studies have microsphere bead assay.12A stall-side immunochromatographic dip - stick testathat can be used on whole blood or serum is commercially available in Germany and was recently shown to be robust and reliable for assess-ing tetanus immunity in horses, yielding resultsthat correlated well with those generated usingELISA. 8,13,14Unfortunately, none of the above tests are yet available commercially in North Amer- ica, although testing using the microsphere beadassay in a multiplex format may be offered in thefuture. 12 6. Rabies Research in several species indicates that the pri-mary correlate of protection against rabies is thepresence of rabies neutralizing antibodies(RVNA) in rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT) is currently the standard and reference technique usedto measure the titer of RVNA induced by vaccina-tion. The RFFIT assay is available commerciallythrough the Kansas State Veterinary DiagnosticLab, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS.An RVNA level of /H113500.5 IU/mL is considered by the World Health Organization to be the threshold ofseroconversion, and a predictor of protection, forhumans. A RVNA level of /H113500.5 IU/mL (as mea- sured using the semi-quantitative fluorescent anti-body virus neutralization test or the RFFIT) is alsothe level recognized by regulatory authorities frommost rabies-free areas as evidence of an adequateresponse to vaccination for importation of cats anddogs. 16It should be noted, however, that post- vaccination serologic test results in dogs were not found to be completely predictive of resistance tochallenge exposure during tests performed with cer-tain inactivated vaccines. 17 The level of RVNA needed to confer protection in equids is not known at this time; however, it seemsTable 1.

This guideline is supported by the ndings ofa study in which 4-month-old foals were vaccinatedwith one dose of an inactivated rabies vaccine band challenged 14 months later when their RVNA level had declined to below 0.5 IU/mL.18All vaccinated horses were protected against rabies disease after virulent rabies challenge, whereas 80% of unvacci-nated horses developed rabies. In another rabieschallenge infection study in horses, clinical signs ofrabies occurred in some of the vaccinated horsesafter a challenge; however, none of the affectedhorses had RVNA levels above 0.5 IU/mL. 19The test vaccine used in this study was not specied. Although rabies was reported in vaccinated horsesin one retrospective case study, the RVNA levels andaccurate vaccine history were unavailable for af-fected horses. 20 The AAEP vaccination guidelines designate ra- bies as a core vaccine for all horses in North Americaand recommend annual revaccination after comple-tion of a single primary dose in adult horses or a2-dose primary series in foals of mares previouslyvaccinated against rabies. The annual revaccina-tion recommendation reflects the federal require-ment for documentation of a 12-month minimumDOI in challenge studies for licensing. Most horsesshow a serologic response that can be detected for 1year or longer after administration of the rst doseof vaccine, and almost all show a robust and durableresponse following the second dose. The response of horses to inactivated rabies vac- cines is of similar magnitude and duration to thatseen in people and small animals for which revacci-nation intervals of 3 or more years are now standardpractice for most rabies vaccines. Revaccination ofpreviously primed horses reliably resulted in a rapidand robust increase in RVNA antibody levels thatpersisted above the 0.5 IU/ml threshold for at least36 months. 21Considering that horses are signi - cantly less likely to pose a public health risk fromthe standpoint of rabies transmission than are smalldomestic animals, 22it is, therefore, reasonable to extend the revaccination interval beyond the recom- mended one year for horses that react adversely torabies vaccine, provided that they have previouslyreceived at least 2 (and preferably at least 3) doses ofrabies vaccine after reaching 6 months of age andhave circulating RVNA antibody levels of at least 0.5IU/mL. The retesting interval will be dependent onthe magnitude of the RVNA titer but should notexceed 2 years, pending further research. It is im-portant to understand that a revaccination intervalof more than 1 year does not reflect the data sheetand, therefore, the horse will not be considered to becurrently vaccinated. 23If a horse that has not been vaccinated within the past year is exposed to rabies, it will be subject to quarantine and handlers willlikely be subject to post-exposure protocols involvingserologic testing and, depending on antibody titer, rabies vaccination. 7. EEE and WEE Correlates of protection against EEE and WEE arenot well established; however, circulating virus neu-tralizing antibodies likely play a prominent role be-cause infection is acquired by vascular injection(mosquito bites) and current inactivated vaccinesappear to be efcacious if administered sufcientlyfrequently. 24,25Considering the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with EEE infection and the purported need for frequent revaccination (2or 3 times annually) to prevent this highly fataldisease in areas such as the southeastern US withyear-round risk, it would not be prudent to attemptto extend the revaccination interval based on mea-surement of circulating antibody titers in EEE-endemic areas, unless the predicted risk of an ad-verse reaction is high. Whereas horses residing inthe Western United States are at very low riskfor EEE, they are at risk for infection with WEEand should be revaccinated annually. Because theavailable encephalomyelitis vaccines are bivalent(EEE plus WEE plusVenezuelan equine encephalomyelitis [VEE]), it isinevitable that many horses will receive \"unneces-sary\" antigens against diseases to which they areunlikely to be exposed. A positive plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) titer against EEE or WEE in serum pro-vides evidence of previous infection or vaccination.Although the magnitude of the titer does not reliablypredict protection, the degree of susceptibility can beinferred. Horses with PRNT titers of /H1102110 are likely to be susceptible and should be revaccinated ifconditions of risk exist, whereas those with titers of/H11022100 are unlikely to be susceptible. cHorses with PRNT titers between 10 and 100 are likely of inter- mediate susceptibility. Revaccination of horses inthis category should be recommended; however, thedecision to do so will depend on the risk of infection,the interval since the last vaccination, the titer leveland trend (up or down) compared to the previoustiter measurement. The PRNT test is available through the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, IA.A multiplex microsphere bead assay that detectsIgG antibodies was recently described to assess theantigen-specic responses of foals to vaccinationwith a multivalent not yet commerciallyavailable. 12 8. WNV Comments regarding immune correlates of protec-tion against infection with equine alphaviruses(EEE, WEE, VEE), as well as the serologic testsavailable to document recent infection or prior expo-sure through natural infection or vaccination, also AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 263LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEMapply to WNV. Of the various serologic assays used for detection of WNV-specic antibodies in se-rum, the PRNT is specic for WNV. 26Neither the PRNT nor a recently developed highly and specic fluorescent microsphere im-munoassay incorporating recombinant WNV en-velop protein (rE), differentiate infected fromvaccinated horses. 25The most commonly used neutralizing antibody test formats are classic PRNT, more recently developed in a microwell format,available through the NVSL in Ames, IA. Research a minimal tive NVSL runs the PRNT at serumdilutions of 10 and 100 and reports results as /H1102110, 10 to 100, and /H11022100. cUse of PRNT titers to assess disease susceptibility follows the same general principles as described above for EEE and WEE.Because many WNV infections are subclinical, se-rological evidence of exposure is widespread, evenin nonvaccinated currently available inactivated and recombinant WNV vac- cines are highly effective in preventing clinicalWNV when used according to label directions, vac-cinated horses may become infected and experi-ence a \"boost\" in immunity, evidenced by anincrease in circulating antibody levels despite nothaving been revaccinated. 26 9. Conclusion Minimum DOI after primary vaccination of horses istypically determined during the licensing processthrough challenge studies; however, maximum DOIafter primary vaccination, and DOI after boostervaccination, are rarely established. Therefore, la-bel directions for revaccination interval are oftensimilar to the minimum DOI established after pri-mary immunization (typically 6 months to 1 year),despite the likelihood that protective immunity fol-lowing revaccination will persist longer than afterprimary vaccination. Immune responses to naturalinfection and vaccination are often complex and typ-ically involve varying combinations of systemic andlocal humoral and cellular mechanisms. Of these,measurement of systemic humoral (circulating anti-body) level is the only practical option available topractitioners. Of those diseases included in thecore vaccination program for horses, circulating an-tibody level appears to correlate well with protectionagainst tetanus and rabies, at least in other species,whereas protection against EEE, WEE and WNV isless well predicted by circulating antibody level.For both tetanus and rabies, antibody levels afterbooster vaccination persist above the \"protective\"titer for considerably longer than the recommended1 year revaccination interval, suggesting that stra-tegic revaccination based on measured antibodylevel may be a viable alternative to annual revacci-nation, particularly for horses that have shown anadverse local or systemic reaction to tetanus or ra-bies vaccines in the past.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Intoxications or su spected intoxications of horses occur less often than for other species but arefrequently more time consuming and challengingto manage. 1-3In many cases, animals are found dead without any evidence of prior illness. Clin-ical histories are often incomplete, while at thesame time horse owners, veterinarians, trainers,and feed mills push for a quick answer. A rapidresponse is often necessary if multiple animals areaffected or at risk in order to help guide casemanagement for sick animals that are still alive.If feed is a suspected source for toxicant exposure,regulatory actions might be necessary with rapidcollection and testing of representative samplescritical. Given the likelihood of litigation for many poison- ing or suspected poisoning cases, it is critical thatdocumentation is complete and that a paper trailcan be retrospectively followed, perhaps years afterthe event. For this reason, appropriate chain-of-custody procedures should be followed for everysample. The aim of the paper is to provide a roadmap for clinicians to properly investigate suspected toxicantexposure and intoxications. A proper diagnosis ofintoxication often involves attention to detail and appropriate sample collection and analysis. 2. Materials and Methods Diagnostic laboratories vary in terms of their tox- icologic testing capabilities. The list of tests of-fered by individual diagnostic laboratories cangenerally be accessed through their respectiveWeb sites. In situations where a specic analyteis of interest, but a test is not found, it is useful tocall the laboratory since diagnosticians are oftenaware of other laboratories that offer the test ofinterest. Toxicologic testing can be as simple asvisual inspection (e.g., examining forages forweeds or blister beetles) to sophisticated massspectrometry techniques. Targeting screening using a variety of analytical approaches is common. For example, screens de-signed to detect ionophores in feeds generally in-clude 4 or more specic compounds. Screens fororganophosphorus or carbamate insecticides mightinclude several dozen different compounds. Mod-ern analytical approaches can detect multiple met-als in a single sample. This avoids the need totest for individual metals and lessens the chanceof missing the presence of a potentially toxicmetal. Contrary to common perceptions, it is 266 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND HOW TO INTERPRET THEM NOTESpossible to screen samples for a broad array of chemicals in cases in which there is insufcientinformation to suggest exposure to a specic toxi-cant. Screening techniques generally rely onmass spectrometry in which the mass spectra orunique \"ngerprints\" for an unknown compoundare compared to commercial or laboratory-speciclibraries of known mass spectra. In many cases, the detection of any amount of a potential toxicant is sufcient for a diagnosis. Forexample, the qualitative detection of oleandrin orcantharidin in a urine sample is most likely signif-icant. In other cases, it is critical to determine thequantity of a chemical of interest in the samplebeing tested. Quantication is particularly impor-tant when testing feed samples since that is essen-tial information for doing an exposure assessment tosee of a potentially toxic dose of a chemical wasingested. Common antemortem samples for toxicologic test- ing include urine, serum or plasma, whole blood, andstomach contents. Common postmortem samplesinclude liver, kidney and/or brain tissue and urine,and stomach or gastrointestinal contents (see Tables 1 and 2 for a complete list of recommended antemor-tem and postmortem sample types, amounts, andpreservation conditions). Knowledge regarding thetime of onset of clinical signs vs the time of samplecollection antemortem or time to death can be criti-cal to selecting the most important samples for test-ing. If an animal dies within a few minutes to a fewhours after the onset of clinical signs or is founddead without warning, analysis of stomach contentsis often performed rst. If an animal has beensymptomatic for longer than a day, it is unlikely thatany toxicant will remain in the stomach. In suchcases, analysis of urine might be more appropriate.Testing often focuses on samples obtained from sitesof exposure (e.g., skin or gastrointestinal contents),sites of metabolism or excretion (e.g., liver, kidneys,or urine), or sites of accumulation (e.g., fat or bone).While other samples such as hair or feces might beuseful, in most situations they are not typicallytested. Attention needs to be paid to the optimal amount of a sample required for analysis. Al-Table 1.

For example, ifa given test require s1go f liver tissue, but only 0.5 g is available, the sensitivity of the test de-creases by half (e.g., if a toxicant can be detectedat 1 ppm or greater wit h1go fs a m ple, it might only be detected at 2 ppm or greater if 0.5 g isprovided). The other consideration is that for agiven case, multiple tests might need to be per-formed to address toxicants on a differentiallist. There is nothing more frustrating to every-one involved in an unsolved case than runningout of samples to perform additional analyticaltests. One of the most difcult aspects of obtaining an accurate history relates to feeding and feed man-agement. Details regarding the introduction ofnew feeds should be obtained. The sources of allfeed components should be determined. Detailsconcerning feed mixing need to be assessed. Iffeed mixing occurs off site, it is important to de-termine whether feeds for other species are alsomixed at the facility. If so, inadvertent contami-nation with potentially toxic feed additives couldoccur. Feed should be examined closely for quality and the presence of unusual feed components or foreignmaterial. Samples of feed, both as purchased andas fed, should be obtained and stored appropriately.Dry feeds can be placed in paper bags and stored atambient temperatures while moist feeds should berefrigerated or frozen pending submission for test-ing. Although only a small amount of a feed sampleis processed for analysis, it is recommended that atleast 0.5 to 1.0 kg of a representative sample besubmitted for testing. Hay and pasture should be examined for the presence of weeds or other contaminants such asblister beetles or clippings from plants such asoleander. The presence of mold growth can be animportant nding in grains or forages, althoughthe presence of molds in feeds is often incidental tothe actual problem while the absence of obviousmold growth does not rule out a possible myco-toxin problem. Obtaining representative feed samples for testing can be a challenge, particularly when large amountsof feed are present, since many toxicants can belocalized to a restricted portion of the availablefeed. 4Unfortunately, in some cases, contaminated feed might already have been consumed and there- fore unavailable for testing. It is important to keepin mind that diagnostic laboratories typically pro-cess only a few grams of sample to be tested; thesefew grams might have come from several tons ofsuspect feed. Although many tests routinely take from a few days to two or 3 weeks to perform, some laboratoriesmight offer STAT analyses. In some cases, partic-ularly those involving multiple animals or feed con- tamination, laboratory testing is prioritized toprovide test results as quickly as possible. 3. Results Finding a chemical in a sample does not necessarilymean that it is the cause of the problem. A com-plete toxicologic investigation, including a thoroughhistory, description of clinical signs, clinicopatho-logic testing, including a postmortem examination,collection of appropriate samples, and analyticaltesting should be undertaken in a careful and sys-tematic manner. Proper documentation of samplecollection and processing is crucial because the po-tential for litigation is high in poisoning cases.An established relationship with an accredited diag-nostic laboratory providing advanced testing and aboard-certied toxicologist to help guide testing andinterpret results will increase the chances of makinga correct diagnosis. In many cases, animal ownersand veterinarians prematurely conclude that a tox-icant is responsible for illness or death when animmediately obvious cause for the illness or death isnot evident. 4. Discussion While relatively uncommon, equine clinicians areperiodically involved in cases of suspected intoxica-tion. Such cases often require special effort andearly consultation with diagnostic laboratories toassure the appropriate collection of useful samplesand selection of toxicology tests. In ad dition to making a diagnosis and instituting appropriatetreatment (situations where animals are stillalive), clinicians often need to address the emo-tional needs of clients, potential media curiosity,and medico-legal issues that often arise. Unfor-tunately, although analytical screening for toxi-cants has become more comprehensive throughthe use of mass spectrometry and other sophisti-cated techniques, there is no one test that can berun to rule out all possible toxicant exposures.As a result, a systematic approach to case inves-tigations with careful history taking and thoroughpostmortem examination is critical to successfulcase resolution. Analytical testing should be done by an appropri- ately accredited veterinary diagnostic laboratory.A list of all laboratories accredited by the AmericanAssociation of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosti-cians (AAVLD) can be found on the AAVLD Web site (https://www.aavld.org/accredited-laboratories). Notall diagnostic laboratories perform toxicologic testing,but collected samples can be forwarded to laboratoriesoffering such service.

Clinically, the authors suspect that the he-matologic parameters of certain breeds of horsesdiffer from other breeds, and may affect clinical de-cision making. 2. Materials and Methods Prospective, observational cross-sectional study. Onehundred six healthy horses were grouped based onbreed (Thoroughbreds, Warmbloods, and others).Horses were included based on normal physical exam-ination, breed, and having no illnesses or administeredmedications. A sample of ethylenediaminetet- raacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated blood was col-lected through venipuncture for complete blood cellcount analysis. 3. Results Warmbloods had a statistically signicantly lower P/H11021.01) and ( P/H11021.01) than the other two groups. Twenty- seven percent of Warmblood and less than 8% of Thor-oughbred lymphocyte counts were below the lower reference interval. Thoroughbreds had a statisticallysignicantly higher red blood cell count ( P/H11021.01) and lower mean corpuscular volume ( P/H11021.05) than Other breeds. Mean cell hemoglobin was higher in Warm-bloods and Other breeds than in Thoroughbreds ( P/H11021 .01). Mean cell hemoglobin concentration was higherin Warmbloods and Thoroughbreds than the Otherbreed group ( P/H110210.001). 4. Discussion Warmbloods have decreased total nucleated cell count and lymp hocytes when compared to other breeds.

Introduction Fibrinogen and serum amyloid A (SAA) are the most commonly measured acute phase proteins (APPs) inhorses. Limited data are available on the normalresponse of SAA and brinogen after combinationvaccination protocols in horses. The hypotheseswere that SAA and brinogen would signicantlyincrease after combination vaccination and that im-ported horses would have a stronger response thanhorses native to the area. 2. Materials and Methods Horses on two farms that were routinely vacci-nated with a combination vaccination protocolwere included. SAA, brinogen concentration,and temperature were obtained at time points af-ter vaccination (0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168 hours). 3. Results Nine recently imported horses and 21 native horseswere included in the study. No difference in breeddistribution between groups was noted, but a signif- icant difference was noted in age, with importedhorses being younger. Fibrinogen and temperaturewere mildly elevated after vaccination, but valueswere not signicantly different from baseline. SAAwas signicantly increased from baseline at 24, 48,72, and 96 hours after vaccination in both groupsbut returned to normal at 168 hours. The importedhorses had a signicantly higher SAA at 72, 96, and168 hours after vaccination than the native horses. 4. Discussion The rst hypothesis was partially proven, with SAA but not brinogen signicantly increased after vac-cination. The second hypothesis was also proventhat recently imported horses have a stronger re-sponse than native horses. This increase may bedue to the na\u00efve immune system to the diseasesvaccinated for or to the novel adjuvant contained inthese vaccines.

Authors' addresses: and Associates, 5474 Youngs Rd, Vernon, Introduction The term \"biomechanics\", can be used in a casual way to describe movement, but the specics of thiseld of science are based in engineering and physics.The denition of biomechanics is the fundamentalphysical mechanics (physics) responsible for a givenaction, reaction or result in a biological system. When an injury occurs, the problem solving begins with a clinical examination by the veterinarian lead-ing to a diagnosis, which is a description of theinjury. Then, the biomechanist offers expertise toevaluate the kinetics and kinematics that may beinfluencing factors. Together, the team devises anexercise protocol to alter the mechanics of move-ment, which will address the long-term changes thatneed to occur to improve healing and minimize re-injury. In addition, prevention of injuries is possi- ble when the understanding of how an injury occursis improved.This paper will look specically at the role biome- chanics plays in injury and recovery from injuryusing several musculoskeletal examples. Humanand equine biomechanical research will be reviewed,followed by a discussion of how that research may be applicable in equine physical rehabilitation to de-velop healthy movement patterns. These discus-sions are intended to offer a framework for anequine rehabilitation protocol development so thatother professionals can add to this discussion andrene the concepts introduced. 2. General Biomechanical Terminology Denitions of biomechanical concepts can be ex-tremely detailed. However, in most circumstancesa general understanding of the terminology is ap-propriate. The following is a list of some of themost common biomechanical terms for reference. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 273DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSES NOTESVelocity and Speed\u2014In general, these two terms can be used interchangeably for practical purposes.However, there are distinct differences between thetwo concepts: velocity is a vector quantity, and isthe rate at which an object changes its position in aspecic direction, while speed is a scaler quantity,and refers to how fast an object is moving regardlessof direction. For example, an object's velocitywould be 3 mph East, while the speed of an objectwould be 3 mph. Acceleration\u2014The change in velocity of an object with respect to time. For example, the accelerationof your car is determined by how fast it can go from0t o6 0m p h . Momentum\u2014Is the product of mass and velocity, and it is the quantity of motion that a body pos-sesses. The greater the momentum of a movingobject, the more pronounced an effect the momen-tum produces on other bodies in its path. It re-quires more force to change the direction of an objectthat possesses large momentum. Force\u2014Is the product and mass and acceleration (gravity). It is what alters a body's state of rest(i.e., inertia) or state of uniform motion. Internalforces are within the body and external forces areoutside of the body. In addition, structures in ad-jacent regions of a body will slide (see Shear Forces)relative to one another while under load. Torsion, Shear, Bending, and Compression\u2014Fig- ure 1 shows the differences between these loadingpatterns. Bending is the combination of tensionand compression, and in the example of bone load-ing, is often superimposed on axial compression.Torsion is twisting, and it produces shearing forceswithin the body. Rotation\u2014Also called angular motion. Move- ment along a circular path about some line in space.This line can be within the body or external to thebody. 3. The Biomechanics of Sports Injury Injury occurs when stress (amount of force/area ap-plied) and/or strain (degree of deformation in re-sponse to stress) is higher than the tissue canwithstand. In addition, the direction the force isapplied is related to injury. For example, a limbbone can handle a higher level of force when it isapplied during compression, than when that sameforce is applied during torsion. To reduce injury,the forces need to be managed in a variety of ways toreduce breakdown. Breakdown can occur as atraumatic injury, such as what happens when ahorse falls or is kicked, or injury can occur over timeas a chronic injury. The focus of this paper will beon the biomechanics of injury and rehabilitationtechniques for chronic injuries. Recently, the understanding of the events leading to sports injury have greatly improved due to theease of obtaining high-speed video showing the oc-currence of the actual injury. Matching the post-injury diagnostics with video data of the injury in areal-world situation has helped to rene the knowl- edge of how injury occurs. 1In addition, research has shown that data from previous cadaver studies are not reproducible as good predictors of injury.2 Some muscles seem to be more prone to injury than others and eccentric (lengthening) muscle ac-tion is frequently the cause of injury. 3In humans, the hamstrings are a common site of muscular inju- ries with the m. biceps femoris being the most fre-quently injured. In one study, the m. bicepsfemoris was injured in 83% of 154 hamstring inju-ries. 4It has been proposed that this high injury rate, in part, could be due to the biarticular function of the muscle (the long head), whereby its length isdetermined by the coaction of both the hip and kneejoints. 5For example, with the combination of hip flexion and knee extension, the hamstrings are placed in a maximally lengthened state predisposingthem to injury. 6In addition, the role of the ham - strings to decelerate the limb prior to ground contactmay make the m. biceps femoris more prone to in-jury. 6The high incidence of injury to the m. biceps femoris in comparison to the mm. semitendinosus and semimembranosus led researchers to discover,through the use of functional magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI), a synergistic muscle recruitment Fig. 1. Forces and the direction of action.

The lack of fa- tigue resistance of the m. semitendinosus and m.semimembranosus, when compared to the long headof the biceps femoris, may cause overuse of thismuscle leading to injury. 7This is similar to what has been proposed for the differential rates of in- jury between the equine deep and supercial dig-ital flexor muscles of the forelimb which will bediscussed further in the section describing themuscle/tendon complex. Additionally, proximaland lateral injuries to the long head of the bicepsfemoris muscle belly is common in humans, 8and it remains to be seen if this is also true in horses. The development of protocols is a long process and there are always those horses that fall outside of theaverage response to rehabilitation. However, thesecaveats should not stop the development of protocoldesign. The formation of a rehabilitation protocol\"skeleton\" onto which practitioners can begin to pintheir research and expertise seems to be a usefulexercise, and the following discussions are meant topromote that collaborative process. 4. Human Biomechanics and the Relationship to Equine Biomechanics in Developing PhysicalRehabilitation Protocols Joint Flexion In one study evaluating the effects of falling in hu- mans, subjects were told to \"keep their hands as faraway from the ground as long as they could\" (in-creasing elbow flexion) during falling, and the re-sults were compared to the forces measured whenthe subjects were allowed to \"arrest the fall natu-rally.\" Subjects were able to reduce the force ofimpact by 27% by flexing their elbows, 9which re - duced the velocity (and impact) of the hands hittingthe ground as a result of increasing the time overwhich force was applied. This is a phenomenonexplained by Newton's Second Law of impulse-momentum. When subjects were then told to fallwith \"stiff-arms\" the forces increased by 40% rela-tive to falls where the elbows were flexed. 9If changes in movement patterns can reduce impact forces this signicantly, the reduction in injury riskcould also be large. Also, the authors cited thatflexing the elbows during falling was so signicantthat this movement pattern change was more im-portant than bone strength in reducing injury. In another human study, knee angle upon landing was correlated with impact forces. It was foundthat the angle of the knee at contact signicantlyinfluenced both peak ground reaction forces (GRFs)and acceleration of the tibia, thigh, and trunk bodysegments. In addition, the peak forces and acceler-ations increased more rapidly when the angles ofthese body segments were close to full extension,and this is related to the decreased period of timeduring which the force was applied. 10 Translating these concepts to equine rehabilita- tion would indicate that evaluating the degree offlexion of joints during ground contact is important. Developing exercises that improve joint flexion willnot only help reduce impact forces, but may alsodevelop a movement pattern to reduce futurechances of injury. Examples of exercises that couldhelp lower landing velocity, include slowing thespeed of the gait of the horse and then, to increasejoint flexion, encouraging elevated carpal and hockaction. Elevated carpal and hock action is also amore natural reaction when the gait is slower.In addition, greater flexion of the carpal and hockjoints results in an associated increase in the flexionof the fetlock in the distal limb. In jumping, tightening the distances between the fences to help slow the horse, while choosing theappropriate height of the fence to obtain the desiredjoint flexion could prove helpful. Another examplewould be using gymnastics such as bounces, one-strides, or two-strides in a gymnastic series, at ap-propriate jumping heights for the skill of the horse,while keeping the speed slow to encourage moredistal joint flexion when compared to joint flexionobtained on the flat. The slower speed will alsolower the magnitude of the impact forces. Evalua-tion of the degree of flexion of distal limb joints atstance in both the fore- and hind limbs during aclinical examination could be a valuable tool in alameness exam. Stride Elevation Emphasizing stronger shortening of the m. quadri-ceps femoris and m. tensor fascia latae, iliacus and psoas muscles in exer-cises to flex the hip (while not unbalancing themovement) rather than emphasizing hamstringshortening exercises may also improve \"spring,\" orthe ability to quickly increase vertical acceleration.Contraction m. rectus group and m. tensor will flex the hip and pull the patella upward.Co-contraction of the cranial-lateral muscles of theleg, specically the m. peroneus tertius, must alsooccur so that the flexion of the hock is achieved atthe same time as flexion of the hip. In addition,lumbosacral flexion will allow more distal limb jointflexion to occur. 11Examples of exercises would in - clude hindquarter flexion movements such as piaffeand passage tendencies of the trot, and slower, morestationary canter strides. For both of these gaitpatterns, conceptualize exercises that produce a\"duck walk\" position in the horse's hindquarters.Backing up exercises may also be of some help toactivate the specic coordination of muscles respon-sible for improving appropriate weight bearing ofthe limbs. However, the horse must not be allowedto drag the hind limbs backward, and if a brisk,elevated stride is not possible, this exercise wouldmost likely not be benecial. Of course, sustainingthis amount of limb joint flexion for too long of aperiod of time, will be detrimental. Walk ap-proaches to low jumps, if possible, or very slow trot AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 275DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESapproaches would be more supportive than long, low strides on the approach to the jump. Shorter dis-tances between jumps would also be indicated. Jumping Height and Ground Reaction Forces In another study of human athletes, GRFs werecompared to vertical jump height. When forces onthe athlete were evaluated, landing impact could beas high as 8 times the body weight of the jumper.However, in this study, there was no correlationbetween jump height and peak vertical GRF. 12 Translating this concept into equine rehabilita- tion could indicate that other issues rather thanfence height may be important contributing factorsto injury. If higher fence height improves the otherbiomechanical aspects of the horse's position duringjumping, such as distal limb flexion, on approach,take off, flight, and landing, then a higher fenceheight may be appropriate in the earlier stages ofrehabilitation. However, increasing fence heighttoo much will override any positive outcome by in-creasing GRF above acceptable levels. In addition,as stated previously, combining the appropriatefence height with an emphasis on increased jointflexion and slower speed, to reduce the impact forcesof landing, may be useful. Speed and Stride Length If speed is the major consideration, research hasshown that the fastest athletes have the lowest ver-tical acceleration of the center of mass (CoM) (i.e.,strides remain close to the ground) and the highestpropulsive impulses (the ability to push hardestagainst the ground in the shortest period of time). 13 The propulsive force of the push-off by the footagainst the ground accounted for 57% of the vari-ance in the speed of sprinters. 14Additionally, en - couraging the athlete to not take strides longer thantheir natural stride length, and emphasizing a moreactive foot touchdown (reduced braking duringtouchdown) with no excessive hip extension and norapid knee flexion, were also associated with fastersprinting speeds. The authors cited that the run-ner's \"normal,\" or preferred stride, which is not ar-ticially lengthened, assists in the maintenance ofbalance during sprinting. The reduction in brakingforces during foot contact, which produced a higherforward-directed GRF indicative of greater \"push-off,\" also allowed for higher running velocity withoutincreasing fatigue. Lastly, flight time should onlybe long enough for a repositioning of the limbs, andthe height of the foot from the ground should beminimal to increase forward acceleration. A longerflight time will decrease the percentage of total timethe feet spend in contact with the ground. Thereduction in foot contact time reduces speed becausethe main means that an athlete has to apply propul-sive impulse is when the foot is in contact with theground. 14Therefore, increasing the total number of foot contacts by increasing stride frequency will ultimately be more important to absolute sprintspeed than increasing stride length. However, this stride parameter will be limited by the contractilephysiology of the athlete's muscles. Translating these concepts to equine rehabilita- tion would indicate that if the swing phase of thestride remains closer to the ground with less overalljoint flexion, this may increase speed. Steps and/orstrides that are too short or too elevated are not ashelpful to increase speed. However, increasingstride length past the horse's normal range will notnecessarily improve top speed and may push thehorse out of balance. Poles placed on the groundover an extended distance to encourage a longer,repetitive stride that is close to the ground but notbeyond the natural stride length of the horse may bebenecial to increase speed. In addition, graduallyasking the horse to cover the same distance with thesame length of stride, but at a faster rate, could helpto improve speed by encouraging a more active pushoff of the hoof from the ground. Increasing thedistance between poles to become progressively lon-ger, past the point of the horse's natural balance, inan attempt to improve speed would not seem to beuseful. Emphasizing lengthening of the hamstrings in ex- ercises to protract the hind limb, 11while not unbal - ancing the movement, may also improve speed.Also, greater shortening activation of the m. gluteusmedius to retract the hind limb could prove helpful.Examples of exercises to train these muscles wouldinclude working the horse in longer, but lowerstrides 15while not unbalancing the horse to the forehand. More forward approaches to multiple low jumps emphasizing long, strides that are close tothe ground on the approach and longer distancesbetween jumps would also be indicated. Stifle Stability Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries have beenstudied extensively in human rehabilitation. Theknee joint is a complex combination of rotational,rolling, and gliding movements, therefore the actualcause of the injury can be multifaceted. 16ACL in - juries have been found to occur at the highest ratewhen two factors are present: deceleration andchanging directions. Internal femur and compressive landing were correlated with a higherrisk of injury. 17 Equine biomechanical research on the muscle- tendon stresses and elastic energy storage showedthat changes in gait increased both tendon and mus-cle stresses more steeply than did steady-state trot-ting. 18These data also support the concept that changes in gait should be minimized during early rehabilitation. Translating these concepts to equine rehabilita- tion would indicate that quick starts and stopsshould be reduced during rehabilitation. Ratherthe riders should be instructed to slow or speed upthe horse's movement until the horse almost makes 276 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSDIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESa gait transition and then ask the horse to gradually resume the original speed without changing gaits. Knee adduction (genu valgum) or abduction (genu varum) and the role of muscle interaction as a indi-cator of human ACL injuries, has been debated inthe literature. 19However, the current research is trending in the direction that landing with the knee in an abducted position (typically seen in the lateralrotation of the femur), due to a lack of neuromuscu-lar control of the associated thigh muscles, is a riskfactor for ACL injury, 20and training programs to reduce abduction of the knee have also reduced ACL injury.21Reducing abduction by as little as 2\u00b0 has been shown to be protective.22 Translating these concepts to equine rehabilita- tion would indicate that to reduce the pathologicalrotational joint movement and torsion at the stifle,straight lines should be emphasized and turnsshould look more like an octagon than a curve.A series of straight lines connected by shallow turnswould be a better strategy than performing a con-stant arc during movement after injury. Uponlanding from a jump, the rider should allow thehorse to take a minimum of three straight stridesbefore turning to the next jump to reduce the decel-eration and rotational combination. Human re-search has shown that during walking, people needthree strides to reach a steady state of balance. 23 Therefore, three strides would be a reasonable num-ber of strides to remain on a straight line beforechanging directions so the horse will have time torebalance before the turn. Muscle/Tendon Complex Distal limb injuries are frequent in equine athletes.Muscles of the distal limb in humans and horseswere once thought to generate the power for move-ment. However, research has shown that thesemuscles perform little-to-no net mechanical workduring level, steady-speed locomotion 24-26while the tendons of these muscles experience high levels of strain. A consensus from these pioneering worksand related studies is that when evaluating thefunction of the tendon, it is essential that the actionof the associated muscle must also be evaluated, 27 and that muscular imbalances likely affect tendonfunction. 28 Research on horses has shown that in the fore- limbs, one muscle head of the massive and complexdeep digital flexor (DDF) muscle flexes the fetlock inlate swing, and although it is largely a joint posi-tional control muscle, its fast-twitch ber type char-acteristics render it susceptible to fatigue. TheDDF muscle/tendon complex stabilizes hyperexten-sion of the fetlock, as well as assists the supercialdigital flexor (SDF) muscle to support the horse'sbody weight during ground contact of the forelimbs,in particular during running gaits with single fore-limb support. 29 In comparison, the SDF muscle is more resistant to fatigue than the DDF and undergoes lengtheningactivation, resulting in elastic energy storage and recovery by its tendon.27Its long, thin tendon (SDFT) complements the short, pennate bers of the SDF muscle belly and allows this muscle/tendoncomplex to be the main source of bouncing duringrunning gaits. This \"spring\" effect is best realizedat the trot, and it helps horses save energy, therebyreducing fatigue. The authors noted that when theDDF muscle fatigues, this requires the SDF to bearconsiderably more load (to the point of overload),especially during fast galloping. 27 Looking at the differences in distal tendon loading across gaits, research found an increase in theseparameters on the DDF tendon (DDFT) with achange from walk to trot and trot to canter. 27The strain, stress, and force resisted by the DDFT roughly doubled when the walk was compared to thecanter. In the SDFT, the loading parameters wereoverall greater than those in the DDFT at all gaits. 30 However, in the SDFT, the strain, stress, and forcedecreased by 14% from trot to canter, although it isimportant to emphasize that the amount of loadingof the SDF muscle/tendon complex is still overalllarge. 27Other research supporting these data found the same 14% reduction in average vertical GRF when horses transitioned in gait from trot tocanter. 31 Translating these concepts to equine rehabilita- tion would indicate that a progressive increase be-tween gaits from walk to trot and trot to canter maynot be appropriate for all injuries. For example,rehabilitation protocols for injuries to the SDF mus-cle/tendon complex could introduce the slow canterbefore the trot to reduce muscle and tendon strain.Whereas the addition of the trot into the rehabilita-tion protocol may help to achieve greater strain forgreater elastic energy savings by the SDF muscle/tendon complex. For DDF muscle/tendon complex rehabilitation, the canter should be utilized at a later time than forSDF muscle and tendon injuries. Activating asso-ciated muscles, which could reduce the load on theflexor tendons could prove useful. In addition,when limb acceleration is reduced, the ability toposition the foot for correct foot contact with theground is increased. 32 Triceps Development Equine research has also shown that the m. bicepsbrachii (and lacertus brosus), is an elbow flexorthat has a large joint torque capacity due to its longproximal muscle moment arm, thus making the bi- ceps a strong contributor to shoulder movement.To counter this strong action of the m. bicepsbrachii, the m. triceps brachii is thought to have animportant stabilizing role during stance. 33The de - velopment of the strong lateral head of the tricepsbrachii to help control the flexion of the elbowjoint 34,35could be of assistance to complement the tension in the SDF and DDF muscle/tendon com- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 277DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESplexes. This tension could then help support the carpus and control hyperextension of the digit.27 Translating these concepts to equine rehabilita- tion would indicate that during rehabilitation of theSDF DDF muscle/tendon complexes, normalfunction of the m. triceps brachii would be of initialimportance. If instability is found in the m. tricepsbrahii and at the elbow joint, improved function ofthis muscle would be indicated, followed by evalua-tion of the normal function of the m. biceps brachii.Generating a more powerful movement through ini-tial elbow/shoulder flexor strengthening withouthaving the ability to stabilize that movement couldprove to be detrimental. The authors of this revieware not familiar with research that has determinedexercises for the horse that primarily develop theelbow extensors. However, observationshowing hypertrophy of the inracing trotters would suggest that extended periodsof trotting with a gradual increase in stride lengthwould be useful. Also, to support this theory, clin-ical observation of horses with DDF and SDF mus-cle/tendon complex injuries shows decreased muscledevelopment in the m. triceps complex injurieswhen compared to Thoroughbred racehorses. 36 Sacroiliac Joint Finally, the sacroiliac joint is a gliding joint and itsmost important function is for stability, thereforethe joint is more susceptible to shearing than tocompressive forces. 37,38Pain in the sacroiliac joint has been associated with instability of the joint,39 although movement in the sacroiliac joint is rela- tively small, and this movement is accompanied bymovement of the lumbosacral region. 40In addi - tion, the sacroiliac joint is responsible for lateralmovement and rotation. 37,38 One study found that the activity of the muscles of the back increased with an increase in speed at thetrot and showed a decrease in flexion, whereasextension remained unchanged as speed increased.This is an indicator that the back muscles have moreof a stabilizing role at the trot as speed increases,rather than inducing movement. 41Additionally, one preliminary study of 3 horses found that the greatest magnitude of segmental vertebral motionoccurred during the canter and the least amount ofmotion occurred during the trot. 42The trot is such a stiff/stabilizing gait that, even when compared to the walk, the trot was found to produce more verte-bral stability than the walk. Another equine studyevaluated motion at the equine sacroiliac joint usingpin-mounted sensors and found that the mean walkvalues for flexion/extension, axial rotation and lat-eral bending were signicantly ( P/H11021.05) greater than the values at the trot. 43 Interestingly, in jumping a similar result was found as described above, where too much flexion atthe lumbosacral junction as the hind limbs clear thefence can be an indicator of poor performance. Good jumpers show increased extension at the lum-bosacral junction. In poor jumpers, increased flex-ion at the lumbosacral junction and of the thoraxwas noted before takeoff and during flight. There-fore, lumbosacral extension was less over fences andresulted in poor jumping performance. 44Another equine study supported these ndings and addition- ally found that the rearward extension of the hindlimbs, produced through extension at the lumbosa-cral junction, was one of the kinematic variablesfound in good jumpers. 45 Translating this concept to equine rehabilitation would indicate that exercises to develop trunk sta-bility and extension in the lumbosacral region, and perhaps the thorax, would be useful for jumperswith back spasms (i.e., hypertonicity). These ex-ercises would include trotting at faster speeds toactivate the muscle groups that support trunkstability. A lower and longer frame of the horsewill position the CoM further forward and, in theauthors' opinion, to counter this the horse willincrease muscular tension in the lumbar region,which would be benecial for lumbar stability.However, if the CoM is pushed too far forward,then this position may increase the forces on theforelimbs, overstress the lumbar muscles and im-balance the horse detrimentally. 5. Conclusions Combining the elds of veterinary medicine, biome-chanics, kinesiology, anatomy, and physical therapyto produce equine rehabilitation protocols is impor-tant. Evaluation of the whole-horse mechanics isnot only a means to obtain quality of healing, but itis also a way to prevent injury from occurring.The problem solving begins with a thorough exami-nation and diagnosis of the horse, which is followedby an organized rehabilitation plan. Some guidelines for equine rehabilitation incorpo- rated from human rehabilitation are listed below. 1. The whole-horse body mechanics must be evaluated even when the diagnosis of pathol-ogy is a specic bone, muscle, tendon, orligament. 2. Muscles that are in a lengthened state are more prone to injury. 3. Exercises that improve joint flexion will help reduce impact forces include: a. On the flat i. Slow the speed of the gait ii. Elevated carpal joint and hock action b. During jumping i. Tighten the distance between fences to slow the horse ii. Use gymnastics to slow the horse iii. Select fence height that increases joint flexion. 4. Exercises that improve stride elevation include: 278 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSDIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESa. On the flat i. A \"duck walk\" appearance through piaffe and passage tendency work at the trot ii. Slower more stationary canter stride iii. Backing up exercises not dragging hind limbs b. During jumping i. Very slow approaches to fences with shorter strides ii. Shorter distances between fences iii. Increase joint flexion. 5. Exercises that improve speed include: a. On the flat and during jumping i. Strides that remain close to the ground ii. Less joint flexion iii. Discourage excessively long strides iv. Encourage faster repetitions of the stride v. Poles placed on the ground over an ex- tended distance at the horse's \"natural\"stride length that are covered at a gradu-ally faster rate 6. Quick starts and stops should be reduced dur- ing rehabilitation with the emphasis on: a. Changes of speed within the gaitsb. Gradual changes of speed between the gaits 7. Steady curves should be avoided in the early stages of rehabilitation with the emphasis on: a. Turns should look more like octagonsb. Turns should be a series of shallow turns and straight lines. 8. Fence height should be selected to promote good jumping form. 9. When evaluating distal limb tendon injuries, function of the whole muscle/tendon complexmust be considered. 10. Canter work could be introduced earlier in the rehabilitation of the SDF muscle/tendon com-plex than during rehabilitation of the DDFmuscle/tendon complex. 11. Exercises for triceps strengthening which can support SDF and DDF rehabilitation include: a. Extended periods of trottingb. Gradually increasing the speed of the trot. 12. The trot is a more stable gait, than the walk or canter, and can be used to improve trunk andlumbosacral stability. 13. The canter produces more vertebral move- ment than the trot, and can be utilized toimprove flexibility in the top line. 14. Exercises for rehabilitation of back spasms (hypertonicity) include: a. Exercises to improve trunk stability i. Lower, longer frame of the horse will in- crease lumbar tension to help providetrunk stability ii. Lower, longer frame may also increase forces on the front limbs and overstressthe lumbar muscles if the center of gravityis positioned too far forward b. Trotting at faster speeds.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of Vet- erinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Rehabilitation modalities are commonly used in equine athletes following musculoskeletal injury.However, there is often much confusion as to theappropriate application and the effects of these mo-dalities. The following review provides a summaryof the current human and equine peer-reviewed lit-erature for commonly used rehabilitation modali-ties. The goal of this review is to provide equinepractitioners with objective information to helpguide rehabilitation programs. 2. Laser Therapy Background and Mechanism of Action Light Amplication by Stimulated Emission of Ra- diation (Laser) is created when energy from a powersource excites a lasing medium. Energy is thenreleased as photons. The laser medium typicallycreates light with one wavelength (monochromatic).Biostimulating lasers are those used in rehabilita-tion patients and are categorized into classes 1-4. 1 Class 1 and 2 lasers have no adverse effects on eyesand skin (laser pointers, laser used for laser disc).Class 3 lasers are those used for low-level lasertherapy (LLLT) that operate at a power level /H11021500mW and include mid-power lasers that are safe on the skin but carry a risk for eye injury (cold lasersused for therapeutic purposes). 2Class 3 lasers are further subcategorized into Classes 3a and 3b.Class 3a lasers consist of lasers from 1-5 mW inpower and pose moderate ocular hazard. Class 3blasers consist of lasers from 5-500 mW power outputand pose greater ocular hazard than Class 3a. 3 Class 4 lasers are used for high-intensity laser ther-apy (HILT) and carry a risk to both eyes and skin(used for therapeutic purposes). 1,2The effect that occurs in the tissue depends on the wavelength andpower that is used, as well as the absorption poten-tial of the tissue itself. 2 Evidence in Humans and Laboratory Animals Both LLLT and HILT have been shown to reduce musculoskeletal pain, increase range of motion, andreduce neuropathic pain. 4-7Laser therapy has been shown to accelerate tissue healing by improv-ing broblast function, enhancing local microcircu-lation and oxygen supply, aiding in the removal ofwaste products, 7increasing neovascularization, and promoting angiogenesis.8In addition, laser ther- apy signicantly reduces inflammation by decreas-ing the production of prostaglandins, tumor necrosis AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 plasminogen activa- tor, and cyclooxygenase.9Laser therapy has also been demonstrated to improve motor and sensory nerve conduction by enhancing myelin produc-tion, 10,11as well as improving collagen ber align - ment within injured tendons.12 There is also evidence that laser therapy may im- prove muscle strength and recovery in human ath-letes. LLLT applied to people before an eccentrictraining session improved muscular strength gainand the hypertrophic muscle response. 13LLLT per - formed in elderly women resulted in increased numberof knee flexion-extension repetitions compared tothose who received sham treatment. 14In a study of university athletes with a variety of musculoskeletal injuries, those who received LLLT had a signicantlyshorter return-to-play duration than those who did notreceive laser therapy. 15 HILT may be more effective than LLLT for certain conditions. HILT is able to reach and stimulatelarge and/or deep structures that are difcult toreach with LLLT. In a study comparing HILT ver-sus LLLT for patients with knee osteoarthritis,HILT was more effective than LLLT at reducingpain after 6 weeks of treatment. 16HILT was also shown to signicantly increase range of motion, de- crease pain, and improve functional disability inpatients with cervical and shoulder pain. 17,18For patients with chronic low-back pain, HILT combined with exercise was more effective at reducing painand improving function than exercise and HILTalone. 19 Evidence in Horses Laser therapy in horses has not been as extensively researched. However, studies show that equine pa-tient preparation is essential to having adequatelaser energy penetration. Clipping and cleaning ofthe limb results in signicantly greater energy pen-etration than in unclipped limbs. 20,21In horses with unclipped hair, only white or cream-colored hair allowed laser energy to penetrate throughequine skin. In horses with gray, brown, chestnut,and black hair, /H1102299% of laser energy is blocked if unclipped. Better penetration occurs in all horsesafter clipping; however, energy penetration is stillgreatest in non-pigmented skin and is greater formedium-colored than dark-colored skin. While alonger wavelength is meant to result in greater en-ergy penetration, skin color has been shown to havea greater effect. In horses with moderate/dark pig-mented skin, laser energy penetration was greaterat a wavelength of 980 nm compared to 800 nm.However, in horses with nonpigmented skin, energypenetration was greater at 800 nm than at 980nm. 21Therefore, adjusting laser setting based on skin pigmentation is critical if targeting deeper tissues. One retrospective equine study is available show- ing the benet of laser therapy in horses with ten-dinopathy/desmopathy. In a study of 150 sporthorses with tendinopathy/desmopathy were signicantlyimproved after 2 weeks of HILT. 22A single study of chronic back pain in horses that applied laser therapy (904 nm) over 9 acupuncture points weeklydemonstrated clinical signs of back pain were alle-viated in 10 of 14 horses. 23 In addition, laser therapy may enhance stem-cell applications. In an in vitro study using equine mesenchymal stem cells combined with the additionof growth factors, LLLT influenced the differentia-tion of stem cells towards the tenogenic fate. 24 An additional in vitro study evaluated the safety of using HILT with stem cells. This study showed nonegative effects of HILT on the stem cells in vitro , and stem cells showed increased expression of IL-10,which has anti-inflammatory action, and vascularendothelial growth factor (VEGF), which positivelyregulates angiogenesis. 25However, caution should be taken in combining laser therapy with stem cells until in vivo studies have been performed.

In the horse, clipping andcleaning of the limb is paramount for effective laserenergy penetration, and laser protocols should beadjusted based on equine pigment. 3. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Background and Mechanism of Action Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) uses electrical current applied via surface electrodesto preferentially stimulate peripheral nerves and isused primarily for pain modulation. 29,30There are two proposed mechanisms for the antinociceptive effects of TENS: 1) gate control theory: TENSstimulates arestimulated during movement. These bers syn-apse within the spinal cord at the same location assmall, unmyelinated C-bers that transmit pain. 282 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESBecause A-beta bers are large and myelinated, their signal transmits faster than the signal fromC-bers, thereby blocking pain. 2) Opiate-medi-ated pain control: TENS stimulates release of en-dorphins and their precursors into the cerebrospinalfluid. Three applications of TENS have been de-scribed: 1) conventional TENS, which consists ofapplication of high frequency, low intensity current;2) acupuncture-like TENS, which consists of appli-cation of low frequency, high intensity current; and3) intense TENS, which consists of application of ahigh frequency, high intensity current and is typi-cally painful in its application. 30 Evidence in Humans TENS is commonly recommended for use in patients with chronic pain in addition to medication. Bene-ts have been reported in 60% of patients during therst few months of use. However, this effect isnoted to diminish over time. 29Conflicting results are present when evaluating the ability of TENS to diminish pain. In some studies, TENS has beenshown to relieve chronic musculoskeletal pain com-pared to placebo. TENS has also been shown toalleviate procedural pain during dental procedures(minor tooth extractions, cavity preparations, intra-oral injections) and to reduce postoperative pain,analgesic consumption, nausea/vomiting, and speedof recovery. 30TENS was shown to be effective for reducing acute postoperative pain if electrodes were placed close to the incision and a strong, de-nite, subnoxious (maximal tolerable) sensation wasachieved. 29However, in a randomized study eval - uating use of TENS for chronic lower-back pain,there was lack of support for its use even whenpatients were educated of how to correctly use theTENS unit. 31In addition, conflicting results are present when evaluating pain modulation for rota- tor cuff tears, sciatica, and bromyalgia.29Use of TENS is contraindicated for patients with cardiac conditions, pregnancy, and epilepsy.29,30 Evidence in Horses While there is no evidence of the effectiveness of TENS use in horses, there may be some overlap inthe mechanisms of action, clinical indications, andsimilar effects reported for electroacupuncture. 32 If used on the horse, it is recommended to clip thehair and apply a small amount of ultrasound gel tothe application pads in order to maximize contact.

Therapeutic Ultrasound Background and Mechanism of Action Therapeutic ultrasound converts mechanical energy into sound waves through the piezoelectric effect\u2014passing an electric current through a crystal. Thesonic waves produced are transmitted by propoga-tion through molecular collision and vibration,which results in generation of heat if a continuouspulse wave is applied. 33,34The thermal effects of therapeutic ultrasound are dependent on the amount of tissue heating that occurs. Increasingtissue temperature by 1\u00b0C from baseline tissue tem-peratures will increase the regional tissue metabolicrate, a 2-4\u00b0C rise in tissue temperature reduces pain and inflammation and increases blood flow,and a tissue elevation /H110223\u00b0C is necessary to im- prove tissue elasticity. 35-37Nonthermal effects also occur, which include induction of cavitation and acoustic microstreaming. These effects altercell membrane structure and function, resultingin stimulation of tissue repair, brinolysis, colla-gen synthesis, tissue regeneration, and bonehealing. Other nonthermal effects demonstratedin vitro include earlier resolution of inflammation, heightened broblast recruitment, accelera-ted angiogenesis, and increased tissue tensilestrength. 34,38Nonthermal effects occur during both application of a continuous and pulsed duty cycle application. Penetration and absorption ofthe ultrasound waves are dependent on the inten-sity applied and the frequency used. Use of 1MHz results in absorption at a depth of 3-5 cm,while use of 3 MHz results in absorption at 1-2cm. Low absorption of ultrasound waves occursin tissues of high water content, such as fat, whilehigh absorption occurs in tissues rich in protein,such as skeletal muscle. 34Therapeutic ultra - sound can also be used to deliver low-molecular-weight drugs transdermally, a process known asphonophoresis. 34,39 Evidence in Humans Therapeutic ultrasound has been shown to be effec- tive at reducing pain (average reduction of 47%) andincreasing functional scores in patients with kneeosteoarthritis when compared to placebo. 33It has also been shown to increase the effectiveness of iso- kinetic exercise for functional improvement in knee AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 283DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESosteoarthritis (range of motion, walking speed), par- ticularly when a pulsed duty cycle was used.40 However, therapeutic ultrasound showed no signif-icant reduction in pain when used for conditionsaffecting the lower limb. 41Thermal application of therapeutic ultrasound was shown to increase tissue temperature by 5\u00b0C in the triceps at 3 MHz. Thistemperature increase, however, was short-lived,lasting 3.3 minutes. 42Therapeutic ultrasound has been used with mixed success to stimulate bone growth and fracture healing in both animal modelsand human clinical trials. In humans, low-intensity pulsed therapeutic ultrasound has beenapproved by the FDA to treat acute and nonunionfractures. Low-intensity pulsed therapeutic ultra-sound targeting fracture healing has established anoptimal intensity of 30 mW/cm 2at 1.5 MHz for 20 minutes in both human and nonhuman models. Success rates of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound forthe treatment of human delayed unions and nonunions range from 67% to 90%. 43,44 Evidence in Horses A study performed in 2013 evaluated the ability of therapeutic ultrasound to heat the SDFT, DDFT,and epaxial musculature to therapeutic levels.The mean temperature 3.5\u00b0C in the SDFTand 2.5\u00b0C in the DDFT after 10 minutes of applica-tion using 1.0 W/cm 2at 3.3 MHz with a continuous wave. No signicant increase in heat production occurred when the intensity was increased to 1.5W/cm 2. Cooling of the SDFT and DDFT occurred at 2.5 minutes and 1.5 minutes, respectively.45Simi - lar results were found in a canine study, whichshowed that cooling of the caudal thigh muscle aftertherapeutic ultrasound occurred in less than 10 min-utes. 46Therefore, if stretching is to be performed following heating of the tissues, it should be per- formed immediately after application of therapeuticultrasound. A 20-minute treatment was applied to the epaxial musculature of horses using an intensity of 1.5W/cm 2at 3.3 MHz. Tissue tem perature was mea - sured at three different depths\u2014signicant differ-ences in mean temperature rise were seen whencomparing 1-cm vs 4-cm depths and 1-cm vs 8-cmdepths. No difference was seen between 4-cm vs8-cm depths. 45While therapeutic ultrasound was ineffective at heating the deeper epaxial mus- cle, the use of a frequency of 3.3 MHz versus 1MHz, likely resulted in lack of penetration of theultrasound waves, as acknowledged by the au-thors. Therefore, further studies are needed todetermine if therapeutic ultrasound can heatdeeper tissues. Additionally, although a statisti-cally signicant difference was seen between 1-cmand 4-cm depths, the rise in tissue temperature at1 cm was only 1.6\u00b0F, and therefore unlikely to beclinically signicant. 45Equine Regulations FEI Restricted supportive therapy: Can be performed by the person responsible (owner, trainer) for thehorse and/or supportive personnel, but prior writtenpermission by the permitted treating veterinarianmust have been obtained. 26 USEF No specic regulations in place.

Ifstretching is to be performed following therapeuticultrasound application, it is recommended that thisbe performed immediately, as tissue cooling occursrapidly. 5. Radiofrequency Diathermy Background and Mechanism of Action Microwave and shortwave radiofrequency radiation is used to heat tissues situated deep in the bodywhile minimizing a rise in skin temperature. Mi-crowave diathermy units operate at a frequencyhigher than that used for shortwave diathermy.Heating occurs by production of electromagnetic ra-diation that is absorbed in the tissues, creating vi-brational energy that results in heat production.Tissues with high water content absorb microwavesstrongly with muscle and joint effusion heated pref-erentially. 47The tissue effects are determined by the degree of tissue heating that occurs, similar to that described for therapeutic ultrasound above. Evidence in Humans Radiofrequency diathermy has been shown to signif- icantly improve shoulder pain, range of motion, andbetter performance in activities of daily living inpeople with frozen shoulder. 48In addition, radio - frequency diathermy had a small but signicant ef-fect on pain and muscle performance in patientswith knee osteoarthritis. 37However, another study demonstrated no additional benet of radio- frequency diathermy for knee osteoarthritis whenisokinetic exercises were performed. 49This modal - ity must be used with caution, as negative effects,such as burns/scalding at the application site andteratogenic effects in pregnant animal species havebeen described. Radiofrequency diathermy is con-traindicated in humans with metal implants (exces- 284 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSDIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESsive heating can occur) and those with a cardiac pacemaker.50 Evidence in Horses Currently, no studies are available in the horse.

Elastic Therapeutic Taping Background and Mechanism of Action Elastic therapeutic tape is an elastic, woven cotton tape with heat-sensitive acrylic adhesive. Unlikeother athletic tapes, elastic therapeutic tape has anavailable tension of 40% to 60% in its overalllength 51and allows full range of joint motion when applied. Elastic therapeutic tape is thought to have multiple modes of action including reducingpain, enhancing proprioception, and improvingmuscle activation. These actions are thought to oc-cur by providing a lifting action at the skin level todecompress underlying vasculature, lymphatics,and sensory nerve bers, en-hance underlying muscle activity/proprioceptionand reduce nociception (gate control theory). 52 Evidence in Humans Conflicting evidence is present for a pain-reducing effect of elastic therapeutic taping with positive ef-fects seen when used for knee osteoarthritis, 53elbow pain,51lower back pain,54and myofascial trigger points.55However, when comparing elastic - peutic taping to other forms of athletic/placebo tap-ing, no signicant differences have been shown. 52,56 Multiple studies have shown improved range of mo-tion, muscle strength, and motor function im-mediately after application. 51,53,57-62These effects were shown to last for up to 24 hours after tape application.59However, elastic therapeutic taping has not been shown to provide any additional benet when used in conjunction with physiotherapy63and spinal manipulation.64One study on using elastictherapeutic taping in patients following orthog- nathic surgery showed a signicant reduction inswelling postoperatively. 65It has been suggested that the direction of the taping over a muscle can either activate (taped from origin to insertion) orinhibit (taped insertion to origin) muscle activity.However, multiple studies demonstrated no signi-cant differences in muscle function or timing basedon taping direction. 66-68 Evidence in Horses Currently, no studies are available in the horse. Equine Regulations FEIOnly permitted in the FEI stable area; prohibited outside the stables area. 26 USEF Only permitted when horse is unmounted in the stable area; prohibited while horse is mounted atany time during competition. 27 AQHA No specic regulations in place. Recommended to contact AQHA prior to use.28 Take Home While no studies are available in the horse, elastic therapeutic taping shows moderate evidence forpain reduction in humans, along with strong evi-dence of enhancing proprioception, increasing mus-cle activation, and reducing swelling. 7. Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy Background and Mechanism of Action Pulsed electromagnetic eld (PEMF) therapy is cre- ated when an electrical current is driven through acoiled wire that generates a magnetic eld. This magnetic eld creates small currents inside the tissue.PEMF utilizes a low-frequency and short-phase dura-tion, which results in a current generated within thetissues without heat production. 68PEMF is most commonly used to aide in bone healing. When bone deforms during weight bearing, it becomes electricallypolarized and generates a very low electrical current.This explains Wollf's law of functional adaptation within bone, in which this electrical signal regu-lates the osseous elements and maintains bonemass. PEMF also generates a weak electriccurrent in the tissue similar to those generated bybone in response to mechanical deformation,thus stimulating osteogenesis. 69-71PEMF has also been shown to help reduce pain and inflam- mation, mainly through its stimulation of nitricoxide, which results in vasodilation and enhancedcirculation. 72 AAEP PROCEEDINGS 65 /H114082019 285DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESEvidence in Humans and Laboratory Animals PEMF is approved by the FDA for treatment in humans with long-bone fracture nonunions and asan adjunct treatment following lumbar/cervicalspine fusion surgery. 73PEMF has been shown to accelerate fracture healing in both skeletally mature normal rats and in rats with induced osteoporosis.74 PEMF signicantly improved the success rate inpeople with delayed-union fractures with77.4% of the PEMF treated fractures healing com-pared to 48.1% in the sham group at 4 months. 75 PEMF has shown to increase bone volume fraction,trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and sup-press trabecular separation in a rat model of in-duced knee osteoarthritis. In this same study,PEMF was shown to promote Wnt gene expressionin the subchondral bone. Activation of Wnt indi-rectly suppressing and osteoclastdifferentiation. 76In a rat model of rotator cuff tearing and repair, PEMF improved early tendon healing and bone quality.73PEMF has also been shown to reduce pain in patients with low back pain77,78; however, caution must be taken in inter - preting these ndings, as in some studies patientswere not blinded to treatment or no control groupwas present. 79,80One study showed PEMF was not effective in reducing pain, stiffness, or improving function in women with bromyalgia.81However, more information on device settings for specic con- ditions is needed. One human study showed that a small change in the dose of PEMF energy appliedhad a signicant effect on patient outcome. 77 Evidence in Horses Limited equine studies have been performed. One study from 1987 looked at the effect of PEMF forincorporation of cancellous bone grafts but statistically signicant positiveeffect. 71A more recent canine study showed signif - icantly faster recovery of load bearing, signicantlyincreased new-bone formation, and higher mechan-ical strength of healing treated with PEMFfollowing mid-diaphyseal tibial osteotomy. 82An equine study assessing tendon healing in 1985 evaluated use of PEMF in surgically createddefects in the SDFT. This study showed no signif-icant differences in PEMF vs control limbs mature bers, increased vascularity, and morepoorly organized and differentiated cells comparedto controls. This study suggests that PEMF mayactually delay tendon healing. 83However, signi is needed to determinethe efcacy of PEMF for a variety of conditions.Given the wide variability in available device pa-rameters, 72specic information regarding device settings is necessary.Equine Regulations FEI Nonrestricted supportive therapy: can be carried out by person(s) responsible for the horse and/orsupportive personnel. 26 USEF No specic regulations in place.

However, PEMF should beused with caution for tendon healing until furtherresearch can be performed. 8. Underwater Treadmill Background and Mechanism of Action Underwater treadmill (UWT) training has been uti- lized in humans and horses for rehabilitation ofacute and chronic injuries. 84-86UWT training is used because of effects from multiple water charac- teristics, including buoyancy, hydrostatic pressure,viscosity, drag force, and temperature. 84,87The ef - fect of buoyancy decreases the vertical ground reac-tion force, 88and allows partial weight bearing, which alleviates stress and pain on the lower- extremity joints. It also allows patients to train toimprove gait when they may be decient in musclestrength, postural control, and motor coordination. 84 Hydrostatic pressure and water viscosity providepostural support to patients with impaired balanceor motor control, 84,89while the drag force (resis - tance) of the water allows functional strength train-ing. 90Underwater resistance has been shown to be 12 times greater than overground resistance.91 Water temperature can be utilized to provide one of two effects\u2014warm water can help improve the levelof comfort during training, 92while use of cold water provides cryotherapy effects, including reduced pain and swelling.87Decreased pain has also been sug - gested to occur due to stimulation of sensory recep-tors by the water. 93 Evidence in Humans UWT training has been shown to reduce body weight by 50% with the water level at the waist, 70%to 75% with the water level at the chest, and 90%with the water level at the neck. 94The effect of water depth has also been shown to affect stride length, stride cadence, and range of motion. In-creased stride length and decreased stride cadencewas seen with water at the level of the neck com-pared to water at the level of the waist and chest.An increase in ankle range of motion and a decrease 286 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSDIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESin hip range of motion were seen as the water level was progressively increased.84UWT training has also been shown to increase muscle strength91,95 and improve balance.95,96 Evidence in Horses UWT training has been shown to have signicant effects in horses with experimentally induced carpalosteoarthritis. In the horses undergoing UWTtraining compared to those walked on an overgroundtreadmill, a signicant decrease in synovial mem-brane inflammation was seen. In addition, theUWT group showed signicant improvements insymmetric limb loading, muscle activation, and jointrange of motion, 85indicating a benet of UWT train - ing in horses with carpal osteoarthritis. UWTtraining was also shown to signicantly improvepostural sway characteristics compared to horsesexercised on an overground treadmill with car-pal osteoarthritis. 86However, UWT training was shown to have no signicant effect in adaptation of the supercial digital flexor (SDF) and gluteal mus-cles or muscle metabolic response compared tohorses undergoing overground treadmill training. 97 As in humans, water depth has also been shown to have a signicant effect on joint range of motion aswell as limb protraction/retraction. The greatestrange of motion of the carpus has been shown tooccur with the water at the level of the tarsus.The greatest range of motion of the tarsus occurswith the water at the level of the stifle, while thegreatest range of motion of the metacarpo/tarsopha-langeal joints occurs with the water at the level ofthe metatarsophalangeal joint and tarsus. 93Over - all forelimb range of motion has been shown to bethe lowest with the water at the level of the stifle.While the greatest overall hindlimb range of motionoccurs at the level of the stifle. Walking in theUWT resulted in lower forelimb protraction with thewater at the level of the tarsus and stifle comparedto dry treadmill. Hindlimb retraction was signi-cantly greater in the UWT compared to dry tread-mill, and retraction was greater with water at thetarsus and stifle compared to the fetlock in theUWT. A slower walking speed on the UWT re-sulted in decreased forelimb and increased hindlimbprotraction-retraction compared to a normal walk-ing speed. 98Increased overall flexion-extension of the back and lumbar flexion occurred as the water depth was increased to the level of the sti-fle. Horses showed increased cranial thoracic ex-tension and increased thoracolumbar flexion inhigher water depths. 99Because of this, horses with back and sacroiliac joint pain should be monitored closely for worsening discomfort if undergoing UWTtraining at high water depths. In addition, UWTtraining should be used with caution in horses withrespiratory and cardiovascular disease. The in-creased hydrostatic pressure has effects on lung vol-ume, which can result in inadequate ventilation. 100 A higher water depth also results in increased VO2,tidal volume, and heart rate.101UWT training should also be avoided in horses with surgical inci- sions, open wounds, fever, myositis, and in animalsthat are fearful or panicky. 87 Equine Regulations FEI No specic regulations in place.26 USEFNo specic regulations in place. 27 AQHANo specic regulations in place. 28 Take HomeUWT training has multiple benecial effects, includ- ing improving muscle strength, postural stability,motor control, and joint range of motion. Theeffects of water buoyancy allow partial weight-bearing, which can be benecial in rehabilitationpatients. However, careful consideration of waterheight should be performed based on the patient'sindividual rehabilitation issues and goals. Not allequine patients are ideal candidates for UWT train-ing. Patient selection should be carefully consid-ered before instituting UWT training. 9. Whole-Body Vibration Therapy Background and Mechanism of Action Whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy is performed with the goal of improving muscle and core strength.In addition, vibration stimuli provide mechanicalloading that is necessary to facilitate mechanotrans-duction in bone and thus osteogenesis. The trans-mission of mechanical oscillations initiates rapidlyand repeating alpha-motor neu-rons. 102,103These oscillations lead to physiological changes by stimulation of skin receptors, muscle spindle cells, and joint mechanoreceptors.103 Evidence in Humans and Laboratory Animals WBV therapy has been shown to improve muscle strength,102,104-106as well as improve postural sta - bility107,108and power.104,109,110WBV therapy has also been shown to improve bone strength in hu- mans106-108and improve fracture healing in a sheep model.111Peripheral blood blow and tissue oxygen - ation in people has been shown to be positivelyinfluenced by WBV. The mechanical oscillationstransferred from the vibration plate to elderly indi-viduals has improved postural control and thus hasreduced the risk of falling within the elderly popu-lation. Furthermore, there is modest evidence thatsupports the use of vibration therapy to reduce painperception in osteoarthritic individuals. Lastly,there is an emerging prole for application of vibra-tion therapy as an exercise modality for people. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 287DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESVibration training for human athletes appears to have a rapid and energy-sparing warm-up effect andhas demonstrated increases in jump height andmuscle power. 95-98However, other studies demon - strate no change in bone density or microstructureafter patients used a low-magnitude vibration platefor 6 months. 112In addition, the timing of applica - tion of WBV therapy has been shown to be impor-tant. In one study, increased upper body powerwas seen 10 minutes after cessation of WBV ther-apy; however, decreased power was seen 1 minuteafter cessation of WBV therapy. 104Therefore, ex - ercising immediately after WBV therapy may bedetrimental. Additional detrimental effects of WBV therapy may be seen in patients with osteoarthritis. In arat model of knee osteoarthritis, rats treated withWBV therapy showed accelerated cartilage degener-ation and further functional deterioration than con-trols. 113Changes in machine parameters (i.e., frequency and oscillation type) have been shown to have signicant effects114therefore, exact parame - ters need to be determined for specic conditions.For example, both closed and open fracture-repairmodels in rodents demonstrate that vertical vibra-tion at a frequency of 45 Hz negatively impairs frac-ture healing while vibration frequencies of 35 Hzand 50 Hz enhance fracture healing. In contrast,horizontal oscillatory vibration therapy regardlessof frequency demonstrates no positive or negativeeffects on fracture healing in rodent models. 115-116 A similar study found no signicant difference be-tween application of horizontal versus vertical vi-bration on jumping force. 102 Evidence in Horses A translational comparison within the human liter- ature to the horse becomes very difcult as a num-ber of different WBV platforms are commerciallyavailable. Anecdotally, WBV has been applied tohorses with various claims of effectiveness. Acutehematologic and clinical effects of horses undergoingalternating horizontal and vertical vibration ther-apy have been recently described, noting no adverseeffects following vibration sessions exposed to a fre-quency of 15-21 Hz. 117Within the rehabilitative setting, there has been recent interest in the effects of prolonged vibration therapy on the cross-sectionalarea and symmetry of the multidus muscle. Asignicant increase in multidus muscle cross-sectional size and symmetry was found following 60days of twice-daily, 30-minute, 40-Hz vertical WBVsessions. Known for its role in spinal stabilizationand postural muscle acuity, development of the mul-tidus muscle is thought to have potential as anosteoarthritis deterrent. 118Only one study has been conducted in the horse evaluating the effects of vibration therapy on bone density in stalled pa-tients. Twelve horses were conned to stalls for 60days with half the group exercised daily on a me-chanical walker and the others underwent verticalWBV therapy at 50 Hz for 45 minutes, 5 days a week. WBV therapy in stalled horses maintainedthe same bone mineral content to that of horses thatreceived daily light exercise and therefore should beconsidered for horses restricted to stall rest only. 119 However, to date no direct comparison studies onvibration direction, frequency, duration or magni-tude in the horse have been conducted.

WBV therapy may be benecial for in-creasing muscle strength, postural stability, and pow- er; however, signicant research needs to beperformed to determine the exact effect on the horse. 10. Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Background and Mechanism of Action Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) uses a low-level electrical current that through stimula-tion of the alpha motor neurons, allows recruitmentand muscle contraction after orthopedic or neurolog-ical injury. NMES therapy has been successfullyused by human physiotherapists to increase musclestrength, maintain muscle mass during prolongedperiods of immobilization, and control edema afterinjury. This therapy assists neuromuscular func-tion by enhancing the force capacity, or the ability ofthe muscle to contract, as compared with a truestrengthening of the muscle. It is unclear ifthe role of electrical stimulation in improving mus-cle function is actually related to increased musclestrength, improved voluntary contractions, restor-ing motor control, or possibly due to proprioceptiveactivation within injured or atrophied myofascialtissues. 69,120 Evidence in Humans The combination of electrical stimulation and exer- cise has been reported to be effective in alleviatingpain and improving voluntary activation in humanosteoarthritis patients, but in one study did not en-hance muscle strength or functional performance. 288 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSDIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESHowever, other studies showed signicantly im- proved muscle strength and functional performancefollowing NMES. 121-123The use of NMES can also aid in the reduction of edema and swelling as the direct current drives the charged plasma proteinions within the interstitial spaces to move in thedirection of the oppositely charged electrode, facili-tating movement into the lymphatic channels. 124 Evidence in Horses The difculty in applying this modality to the horse is the lack of standardized protocols and no vali-dated treatment programs due to large variations inmethodology that include treatment parameters,the frequency and duration of treatment, the diseasestage and severity, and patient selection. One re-cent equine study used functional electrical stimu-lation in horses with induced injury to the recurrentlarygneal nerve and cricoarytenoid muscle. Horsesthat received electrical stimulation showed im-proved muscle strength and geometry and had anincreased type I:II ber proportion than controls. 125 NMES is typically conducted 3-5 times a week, in-ducing 8-15 contractions within a treatment ses-sion. The electrodes are placed in a bipolar fashionwith the muscle at resting length or slightly length-ened at the time of electrode placement. The restcycle should be 5-6 times as long as the contraction,typically in a 1:6 ratio. The hair coat may need tobe clipped depending on length and should becleaned of dirt and debris with water and couplinggel applied.

Benoit, CA 92007 (Benoit); Equine Sports Medicine of Introduction Axial skeletal pain and pathology are signicant problems in the equine athlete. Evaluation of theaxial skeleton should be part of a \"whole-horse\" ex-amination, but this paper will focus on the tho-racic and lumbar back. Back pain can be a veryinsidious \"performance problem\" and as such, canbe a very difcult to specically diagnose.Back problems are signicant across all equinesport disciplines and have a signicant effect onthe wellbeing of our patients, as well as the eco-nomics of the overall horse industry. After local-izing a clinical problem in the back, combinedimaging (radiography and ultrasonography) isused to elucidate any associated pathology towarddiagnosis and treatment. Imaging of the equineback was quite difcult in the not-so-distant past,especially for the average practitioner. Signi-cant improvement in radiograph and ultrasoundequipment and techniques has signicantly ad-vanced veterinarians' abilities and veterinarysports medicine to diagnose back problems in theequine athlete. When pursuing ultrasound of thethoracic or lumbar region of the horse, a completesurvey of muscles, tendons, ligaments, as well asbone and joint surfaces, should be performed. This paper will specically focus on how to evalu-ate and diagnose thoracolumbar multidus mus-cle (MM) lesions. 2. Anatomy of the MM The MMs in the horse are very similar to those inhumans. They are a series of overlapping fasciclesgrouped into 5 distinct segmental bands. 1,2The most supercial band is also the most dorsal, over-lying the others. It originates from the caudal edgeand lateral surface of each spinous process andcrosses 2-4 spaces. The caudal edge ofeach spinous process to the lamina and they cross 4,3, and 2 vertebral spaces (Fig. 1 ). The deepest shortest fascicle originates from the lamina and onlycrosses 1 vertebral space. The fascicles are multi-pennate with both a fleshy body and tendinous por-tion that run the length of the muscle. The mixture of muscle and tendon ber ll the groove on either side of the spinous processes. Theinsertions of the fascicles are on the mammillary and articular processes, as well as the zygapophy-seal joint capsules. This helps protect the joint cap- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 293DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSES NOTESsule from being caught inside the joint during the movement executed by the multidus (Fig. 2).1 In the lumbosacral region the sacrocaudalis dorsalismedialis as caudal The overlappingpattern of multidus bers provides support andstabilization to the back. The MMs have a highdensity of muscle spindles, allowing proprioceptivefeedback and input. Multiple spindles are stretchreceptors within the body of a muscle that detectedchanges in muscle length. They convey this lengthinformation to the central nervous system via affer-ent sensory nerve bers. It is processed by thebrain to determine spinal position and motion.Responses to changes in length regulate contractionby activating motor neurons to resist muscle stretchvia the stretch reflex. The interlocking of the ver-tebrae in the spine cannot bend laterally without also rotating. These movements require the entirespine and very little bending at any single joint.Understandably, when learning normal anatomy,practitioners should then look for associated patho-logical changes. The challenge in sports medicineis to then directly relate these abnormalities to theclinical problem at hand, allowing for successfultreatment and management of the problem. It isnot always easy to know the signicance of patho-logic anatomical changes. In human sports medi-cine, the focus has opened beyond abnormalanatomy, to include abnormalities in neuromotorcontrol. The MMs are one of the most importantstructures related to spinal function and dysfunc-tion. The ability to gauge the size and function ofthe MMs has been a key component in managementof back pain and man. Atrophy and dysfunction ofMMs occurs as a result of back pain and may pre-dispose to recurrence of back pain. 1In horses, it has been shown that the combination of severe pa- thology and multidus muscle atrophy or asymme-try gives a strong indication of the signicance of thepathology found. 2 3. Materials and Methods A total of 22 horses have been selected in the au-thors' practices with signicant ndings in theirMMs. This muscle, because of its pennate struc-ture, has a strong core property. In the clinical presentation, horses having a MM abnormalityshow signicant focal or diffuse spasm at the level ofinjury. This spasm tends to remain after warmingup, and the horses in hand or under tack present apoor elevation of their mid-back, and a restrictedthoracolumbar motion. Fig. 1.

For diag-nostic purposes, most of them (15/22) underwent alocal block of the spastic area and responded well.Unfortunately, the next day these horses tend toworsen signicantly. A careful evaluation with ultrasonography was done to evaluate the soft tissues involved with thisabnormal region of the back. Two different por-table devices (Figs. 4A and B) were used for this study with a linear probe (7.5 Mhz) offering amoderate penetration but a good detail of the mul-tidus structure, and a large convex probe (2.5MHz) giving opportunity to go deeper with lesserdetails, but also being able to evaluate largerhorses and the caudal insertion of the MMs on thevertebral body. This paper will rst review thetechnique of evaluation of the MMs and then dis-cuss its abnormal ndings found in 22 horses. Fig. 4. A, Probe placement, sagittal view.

Ultrasonographic Evaluation of the MM Due to the anatomical location of the MMs, they cannot be evaluated manually. Ultrasonography isthe only imaging tool available in adult horses toevaluate the large back muscles, and in particularthe MMs. Most decent-quality ultrasound ma-chines with proper transducers are able to providegood imaging. In smaller, leaner horses, a 7.5-MHzlinear transducer can provide high-quality images ofthe MMs. With larger horses, a 2.5/3.5-MHz macroconvex transducer is required for diagnostic-qualityimages. Images should be created in 2 planes,transverse (cross sectional) and sagittal (longitudi-nal). Imaging is performed methodically and se-quentially at every vertebral segment starting justcaudal to the scapulae ( /H11011T11). Images are created in a paired fashion, right on the right side of thescreen and left on the left side of the screen sequen-tially through L6. For each image, the transduceris held just off midline, rst, perpendicular to the midline to create the transverse image and then in acranial caudal orientation to create the sagittal im- age. The sagittal image is created with the caudal aspect of the transducer angled very slightlylaterally. The transducer for both types of images is also angled toward the median plane. Figures 3and 4 show probe orientation/placement and the pictures of normal reference images. If the survey views detect abnormalities, go back and focus spe-cically on those areas, orienting the transducerthrough a variety of angles and distances from mid-line. A complete thoracolumbar sonographic sur-vey is time consuming and requires multiple methodical images and measurements. However,it is worth the time and effort toward knowing howto treat, manage, and prognose patients goingforward. Fig. 5. Six-year-old Thoroughbred Steeplechase gelding with severe acute back pain.

MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESUltrasonography was found to be a repeatable and reliable tool for measurement of the equineepaxial muscle size. 2When examined in clinical cases of equine back pathology, there was a clear effect on the epaxial muscle size at the level of andclose to areas of signicant injury or pathology. 2 A number of papers have focused on this MMasymmetry as it relates to other back pathology.The authors acknowledge this association, butthere are also many horses with primary MM pa-thology. This paper will review a number ofthese ndings. 5. Ultrasound Images of MM Pathology (Figs. 5-10) Both authors claim a large amount of consulta-tions for back pain over the last 7 years and triedto evaluate the MMs on certain cases where therewas a reluctant pain spasm before and after exer-cise, an absence of signicant x-ray ndingsaround the spinous processes or epaxial joints, and a positive block when realized at the level ofthis spastic area. Major ndings have been categorized as follows: Change in size and shape: This has been as- sessed mostly by doing the transactional im-ages as described already by Mc Gowan et al 2. Amyotrophy unilateral or bilateral of the MMs has been considered as pathologic and poten-tially induce a loss of core.

On transectional views these lesionsoften look like \"white\" spots and have beenrelated and found closer to the spinous pro-cesses, and somehow in the body of the MMs.When taking into account the history of thehorse, some of these ndings seem to t with past injections of long-term steroids or localblisters. On the other hand, the combina-tion of imaging with the longitudinal axisconrms an avulsion or enthesophytes fromeither the spinous processes or caudal attachment on the mam-millary process (MP; more rare). 6. Discussion The MM ultrasonography was found to be veryuseful in equine sport medicine. This techniqueis really noninvasive and easy to realize for prac-titioners already used to practice ultrasound.This technique can be done using portable devices,and the back preparation of most athletic horsewith short hairs gives a rapid, easy-to-read image.In the authors' experience, it seems that this eval- uation shall be made in cases of chronic back pain andcounter performance.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H114082019 299DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESscintigraphy can often be frustrating. This method allows soft-tissue assessment, including MMs, for po-tential pathologies that today might be strongly un-derdiagnosed in daily practice. 7. Conclusion Overall, this ultrasonographic evaluation hashelped diagnose some clinical cases of focal backpain where other imaging has not been relevant.The MM being one of the most important core mus-cles of the mammal's body, its assessment in athletichorses has a high clinical relevance. Back prob-lems have been recognized for the last 3 decades, butimaging has been mostly based on x-rays and bonescintigraphy. Modern ultrasonography initiatedby Denoix 3in the 1990s, has been more accurate with diagnostics of soft-tissue and bone-surface ab- normalities in several areas of the spinal axis.This paper about MM ultrasonography is an earlyreview of more soft-tissue structures that could beeasily evaluated by ultrasonography.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Standardized instruments for measuring patient's activity limitations and participation restrictionshave been advocated for use by rehabilitation pro-fessionals for many years. The practice of evi-dence-based veterinary medicine requires theimplementation of functional outcome measuresto provide credible and reliable justication forrehabilitation therapies. Equine rehabilitation plays an important role in restoring function following injury, in injuryprevention, and in performance enhancement.Many of the therapeutic exercises and rehabilita-tion protocols that are used to target variousailments are not routinely objectively measured,resulting in a failure to track the progressthroughout the rehabilitation program. Throughthe use of various objective mography, malleable circumference, the progress of a patientcan be closely scrutinized. Incorporating func-tional outcome measures allows the therapist to ob-jectively determine the baseline function prior to treatment initiation and allows follow through withthe same instrument to determine if protocols needto be altered to gain the desired effect on the targettissue. 2. Materials and Methods Goniometry Clinical measurement of joint motion is a fundamen- tal evaluation method in determining the influenceof joint pain on passive joint range of motion. Go-niometry is a reliable and objective method of deter-mining joint range of motion and is often used toassess articular responses to physical therapy. 1 The repeatability and reliability of goniometry hasbeen well documented in human, canine, and felinepatients. Similarly, equine studies have demon-strated that goniometry is a promising tool in docu-menting passive flexion of the fetlock, carpus, andhock if used by the same investigator. 2 The joint in question must be measured at the center or axis of joint rotation (COR) for accurateand consistent measurements. A traditional goni- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 301DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSES NOTESometer is a protractor with extending arms. The fulcrum of the goniometer should be aligned withthe center of joint rotation to be measured, and thearms of the device should radiate out to the proximaland distal joint's center of rotation. If using a go-niometer without extendable arms, the center line ofthe arms should be aligned along the center of thebony column. The center of rotation for each jointis found using previously described anatomical land-marks while taking the joint through the full rangeof motion. 1 Goniometry has been proven to be a useful and easy tool that allows veterinarians to measure prog-ress in joint mobility. Rehabilitation protocols thatare designed around increasing passive joint rangeof motion include muscle stretching and passivejoint mobilization. Each protocol is aimed at en-hancing soft tissue extensibility to restore normaljoint mobility. Previously determined anatomical landmarks are used to locate the center of joint rotation. Knowl-edge of the location of the center of joint rotation iscritical for evaluating the accuracy of joint angula-tion measurements. 2 Center or axis of joint rotation (COR): Scapulohumeral/Shoulder- COR: Distal and caudal to the the humerus. The proximal and distal arms ofthe goniometer are aligned with the spine of thescapula and the longitudinal axis of the humerus,respectively. 3 Humeroradial/Elbow-COR: Lateral collat- eral ligament where it attaches on the lateralepicondyle of the humerus. 3 Carpus-COR: Dorsal half of carpal bone in extreme flexion.3 Metacarpophalangeal/Metatarso phalangeal- COR: Attachment of the lateral collateral lig-ament on metacarpal/tarsal III. 3 Cofn-COR: Attachment of the lateral col- lateral ligament on the middle phalanx. Coxofemoral- COR: Greater trochanter. The proximal and distal arms of the goniometer arealigned with the body of the ilium and longitudinalaxis of the femur, respectively. Femorotibial/Stifle-COR: Caudal to the fem- oral attachment of the lateral collateralligament. 3 Tarsus-COR: Attachment of the lateral col- lateral ligament of the tarsocrural joint on thetalus 3(Fig. 1 ). Pressure Algometry Pain is characteristically the primary complaint in hu- man patients suffering from musculoskeletal injury.However, as the equine patient cannot verbally ex-press their level of discomfort, the assessment of painis typically subjective based on clinical presentationand examination. Often, the localization of the pri-mary source of pain can be difcult due to increasednociceptive plasticity (i.e., behavioral and cellular modications produced by activation of nociceptors)causing radiating and referred pain. Mechanical no-ciceptive threshold (MNT) assessment has been inves-tigated in numerous human clinical studies and morerecently used to establish normal reference valuesin the horse, as well as assessing equine axial andappendicular musculoskeletal pain. The use of assess MNTs provides a repeat-able, objective quantication of pain, allowing changesin stimulus intensity to be compared. Importantly,human studies have demonstrated not only thatMNTs are decreased over the injured region but alsothat lower thresholds are often found over sites remoteto the primary source of pain. Similarly, experimen-tally induced osteoarthritis in the equine carpus re-sulted in lower MNT values recorded from sites testeddirectly in the region of the carpus, as well as de-creased values in sites both distal and proximal to theosteoarthritic joint. MNT testing can be used toquantify the degree of pain associated with the pri-mary injury, to identify and localize referred musculo-skeletal pain, and may assess nociceptive changesrelated to rehabilitative therapies. Using a pressure algometer allows for objective, repeatable numbers to be tracked as to the paincoming from specic structures, including both softtissue and bone. 4Applying localized pressure to specic areas causes the horse to withdraw from the focal pressure. The lower the MNT when a with-draw response is noted, the higher the pain level.If secondary muscle pain is also present, these spe-cic locations should be chosen for repeatable mea-surements. For example, coexisting muscle pain ina forelimb lameness could be tracked through theuse of pressure algometry typically over the distalbrachiocephalicus muscle. The pressure algometermay be used in axial skeletal pain to differentiatebone from muscle pain (measured directly over spi-nous processes [Fig. 2] and/or along the epaxial mus- Fig. Tarsal with a goniometer. 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSDIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSEScles). Hind end issues are typically monitored using points within gluteal or bicep femoris muscles. Sites chosen for pressure algometry must be able to be easily identied for repeat measures in thesame location over time for accurate repeatability.The device is pressed perpendicularly against thedesired landmark until the horse withdraws fromthe pressure and the number is then recorded. 4 The ideal rate of pressure has been found to be 1kg/sec for the best and most accurate results. 4 Recordings should be taken no more than threetimes per site per time to ensure that the numbersare accurate. Multiple attempts at the same sitecan skew results based on the horse anticipating thepressure and, therefore, the pain that follows. In astudy measuring MNTs in the equine axial skeleton,values increased as more measurements were ob-tained, indicating that measurements taken in ex-cess of three times at a particular location will givefalse results as the horse habituates to the noxiousstimuli. 4As a horse progresses through the reha - bilitation program, the MNTs should increase, dem-onstrating that more pressure (less pain) is requiredto elicit the same response. Horses are able to ha-bituate to pressure algometry if measurements aretaken multiple times per week. It is, therefore, notuseful or accurate to perform measurements morethan once weekly. 4 Thermography Heat is a mainstay in the inflammatory process.Measuring surface temperatures in tissues has beenshown to give an accurate representation of the in-creased or decreased blood flow throughout a partic-ular region. 5Increased blood flow results in an increased thermal skin temperature, whereas de- creased blood flow results in a decreased thermalskin temperature. 5Although thermography has typically been used for color picture representa- tion of the varying temperatures along with thetemperature that is related to the skin, hair coat, and gradient between the surface of the skin andthe external environment, a digital laser ther-mometer can also be used 6(Fig. 3 ). The digital laser thermometer is held at a set distance from thetissue in question and the temperature is recorded.This measurement must be taken at similar ambi-ent temperatures and under the same conditionseach time (i.e., after the same amount of work hasbeen completed by the horse). 6A change in ambi - ent temperature has been shown to statisticallyalter surface temperature readings with no otherinciting causes identied. To account for thechanges in ambient temperature, the opposite limbmust always be measured as well. This allows forthe difference between the two limbs to be recordedrather than just the temperature of the limb inquestion. Thermography can be used throughout the reha- bilitation process with injuries that involve thesoft tissue structures. The injury can be monitoredthrough serial measurements of the thermal tem-perature prior to and after work. If the rehabilita-tion protocols are successful (particularly ifcryotherapy and other anti-inflammatory tech-niques have been applied) then a trend of decreasingtemperatures toward the normal limb should befound. When repeat thermography measurementsare made, a consistent location and distance mustbe measured. A consistent distance can easily bemade by measuring the distance between the bodypart and the thermography unit. This can be per-formed with a ruler or by using a capped needle (ofthe same gauge and length every time) to measurethe distance. Fig. 2. Pressure algometry over the spinous processes. Fig. 3. Thermography. AAEP PROCEEDINGS 65 /H114082019 303DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESMalleable Ruler Human medicine has demonstrated that taking measurements of the thoracic and lumbar spinewith a malleable ruler (Flexicurve) spinal measurements taken directly fromradiographs. 7The malleable ruler is positioned along the thoracic and lumbar spine directly against the skin and then the internal contour of the ruler istraced onto graph paper and subsequently mea-sured. 7No signicant differences have been found between measurements taken from radiographs ver- sus measurements taken from the traced malleableruler. 7 The malleable ruler is routinely used in equine rehabilitation programs to trace the contour overthe thoracic spine, lumbar spine, and gluteal mus-culature (Fig. 4). Similar to human spinal measure-ments, the contour of the region in question can betraced and changes in muscle development overtime assessed as changes in contour of the tracingoutlines. The horse should be standing square onconsistent flat footing each time the measurement istaken. Traced lines on a piece of paper from themalleable ruler can then be used to show an im-provement in the musculature that is gainedthrough rehabilitation exercises. Exercises such assternal lifts, baited cervical ventral, and lateralbending core the thoracic andlumbar epaxial musculature, whereas lumbosacraltucks and tail pulls can improve the gluteal muscu-lature. Other core strengthening and propriocep-tive exercises (such as use of the Equiband/Pessoa system and proprioceptive pads) can also be evalu-ated through changes in the musculature in thethoracolumbar/gluteal region. It is important thatrepeat measurements be taken at the same location.Anatomical landmarks (for example, over the tubersacrale or tuber coxae) are the most useful for con-sistent measurements. Lateral Bending The degree of lateral bending throughout the axialskeleton of the horse varies widely throughout thelength of the spine. Areas with the greatest degreeof lateral bending are found in the cranial and cau-dal cervical spine. 8Exercises that place the chin of the horse at different target areas along the body were found to engage different regions of the spineand subsequent muscle groups. Bringing the chinto either the hip or tarsus focuses the exercise on thethoracolumbar region. 8Bringing the chin to the girth area engages the cervical spine and associated musculature.8The further caudal the horse was asked to bring their chin, the more core musculature was also engaged, indicating that lateral bendingexercises incorporated into equine rehabilitationprograms can have a positive effect on not only flex-ibility but also on core strength. 8 Lateral bending can be measured and tracked in the horse through multiple ways. The horse canbe evaluated through measuring the distance fromchin to the girth, hip, and/or tarsus. The mea-surements can be taken from the point of maximalreach from the chin to the desired landmark.Photographs can also be taken from slightly aboveand behind the horse and then measured. If pho-tographs are taken, then the photographer andhorse must be positioned in the same orientation dur-ing each measurement. Progress can be trackedthrough the amount of space the horse has betweenreaching the chin to the girth, hip, or tarsus. As thehorse gets closer to these desired landmarks, improve-ments in both flexibility and core strength should beappreciated. Retraction Length Retraction of the forelimbs is frequently used toassess pain, stiffness, or restriction within the bra-chiocephalicus muscle (a primary protractor of thelimb). Distal palpationhas been associated thatoften results in a reduction of forelimb retractionlength. Measuring the passive retraction lengthover time gives a numerical value demonstratingimprovements in brachiocephalicus muscle re-sponses to rehabilitation. If the passive retractionlength is decreased, then under dynamic conditionsthe stride length, specically the caudal phase, ismost likely decreased as well. While standing square, the toe of forelimb to be retracted is marked on the ground surface. Thelimb is then placed in a maximally retracted position Fig. 4. Measurement of the gluteal muscles with a malleable ruler. 304 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSDIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESand the location of the toe is marked again at the ground surface (Fig. 5). The distance between thetwo lines is then measured and recorded andtracked for an increasing pattern, suggesting thatthe retraction length is improving throughout therehabilitation program. Joint/Limb Circumference The objective assessment of joint inflammation, limbedema, and changes in muscle mass can be deter-mined using circumference measurements. Whenapplied consistently, circumference measurementsprovide an accurate and reliable assessment ofchanges in soft tissue injury, synovitis, and musclemass over time. To be accurate and consistent in joint/limb circum- ference measurements, a tension monitor should beapplied to the end of a flexible measuring tape.This allows the analyzer to keep consistent tensionon the measuring tape through multiple readingsover the course of the injury and rehabilitation pro-cess. The joint and area of the limb in questionshould be measured at reliable bony landmarks thatcan be easily identied through the damaged andeffusive joint and tissue (Fig. 6). 3. Discussion Equine rehabilitation programs are tailored to-ward each patient, their specic injuries, andassociated comorbidities. Having reliable and con-sistent methods of measuring the outcomes of theseprograms are important to objectively monitor pa-tient progress. The methods described above givenumerical or pictorial data that provide evidence-based support to protocol design and development.Noninvasive direct measures of the injured tissueallow the techniques to be more readily used inprivate practice. The equipment needed to makethese accurate measurements is easily obtained andstraightforward to use. Objective measurementsdo not take a long period of time to obtain, and the results can be easily traced and recorded. Theseoutcome measures can be used in conjunction withroutinely used imaging modalities to track the heal-ing progress throughout the rehabilitation process.Implementing objective measurements to track in-jury progression in equine rehabilitation programsallows for more data to be gathered on differentexercises relating to specic injuries. Serial objec-tive measurements will demonstrate critical pointsin time in which measurable differences were appre-ciated. This information can then be incorporatedinto future rehabilitation protocols. These techniques were initially developed, vali- dated, and performed in human medicine and rehabil-itation and were then extrapolated for use in equinerehabilitation. Since the initial use of these tech-niques in equines, goniometry and pressure algometryhave been validated in equines. Although many ofthese techniques have not been validated in horses,they are frequently used in practice.

Introduction Stem-cell therapy for orthopedic injury has grown in popularity over the last 10 years. Ongoing re-search focuses on the efcacy and indications forstem-cell therapy. In addition to working to pro-vide evidence-based indications for the use of stem-cell therapy, there has also been a growing researchfocused on delivery methods of stem cells and whatmay be most efcacious, depending on the locationand type of disease or injury. 1In both the human and veterinary eld, intra-articular administrationof stem-cell therapy has gained attention as a viableroute of delivery. 2,3Specically in the equid, there is some evidence that regional intra-arterial stemcell injection may improve delivery when compared to intravenous regional limb perfusion for treat-ment of orthopedic injuries of the lower limb. 4,5 Early work examining the use of intra-arterial in-jections of stem cells in the horse found a risk ofthrombus formation, and thus the technique wasinitially not recommended. 6However, with further experimentation the researchers found that by elim-inating the use of a tourniquet this risk was remark-ably reduced. The publication of a description of intra-arterial stem-cell injections in the median artery of thestanding horse paved the way for this technique. 7Our practice has routinely been performing ultrasound-guided intra-arterial bone marrow-de-rived stem-cell (BMSC) injections in the median ar-tery for treatment of orthopedic injuries of theforelimb since 2015 with few complications. Thedescription of the approach comes from the experi-ences of the authors who routinely perform this pro-cedure. This paper will review the process of howto perform ultrasound guided intra-arterial injec-tions of BMSCs in the median artery of the horse tomaximize operator safety and minimize potentialcomplications. 2. Materials and Methods Preparation is the key element to the success of thisprocedure. Unfortunately, the artery is relativelyunforgiving and, if the injection is not performedproperly the rst time, often the artery spasms andmay not be amenable to a second attempt at injec-tion. Optimizing sedation, local analgesia, and theergonomics of the person performing the injectioncan greatly increase the chances of success. Indications and Dose In our practice, ultrasound-guided injections ofBMSCs are most commonly utilized in cases of dif-cult to access injuries (such as in the hoof capsule) AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 309DIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSES NOTESand in cases in which there are multiple lesions, both for bone and soft-tissue injuries. This tech-nique is also used for injuries that are partiallyhealed (e.g., a partially healed supercial digitalflexor tendon core lesion), in which directly reinject-ing the injury site risks damage to healing tissue butaugmentation of lesion healing could be benecial. Our typical dose of BMSCs for intra-arterial injec- tions of the medial artery is 30 million cells, rangingfrom 20 to 30 million.

This site is typically just proximal and dorsalto the chestnut, although this can vary slightly fromhorse to horse. The ultrasound probe is placed inlong axis to the limb. The flexor carpi radialis mus-cle is a good landmark as triangular-shaped echo-genic tissue on the proximal aspect of the image inthe near eld (Fig. 1). The median artery is deep tothe muscle belly. The injection should be per- formed proximal to the bifurcation of the medianand radial arteries. 7Once this site is located, the region is clipped for best visualization of the artery. During the prescan, the machine settings should be optimized for best visualization of the injectionsite so that this is complete and does not need to beadjusted at the time of the injection. Prior to theinjection, a sterile cover or sterile glove should belled with ultrasound gel and placed over the ultra-sound probe. Regional Analgesia A subcutaneous line block should be performed in acleaned site approximately 5 cm proximal to theinjection location (Fig. 2). This generally providessufcient desensitization. In some cases, horseswill twitch slightly as the needle enters the artery,but we have not found the need to perform a median-ulnar nerve block for analgesia. It is important notto block too close to where the ultrasound probe willbe placed to minimize gas and fluid artifact. Fig. 1. A, Transverse gross image at the level of the chestnut.

The reason for this is 2-fold: to minimizethe hemodynamic effects of the sedation as well as toprevent flexion (\"buckling\") of the carpus. If thepatient is overly sedated and flexes the carpus orfetlock during the injection, this can cause the nee-dle to move and may result in perforating thefar wall of the artery or other inadvertent misdirec-tion of the needle tip. A combination of detomidineand butorphanol works well for sedation\u2014the exactdose depends on patient size and temperament.Acepromazine can also be used as adjunct sedation.In our experience, xylazine is unreliable and shouldbe avoided for this purpose. Generally, we sedateprior to performing the line block; this provides timeto evaluate how the patient is settling into the se-dation prior to the injection and to adjustaccordingly. A twitch is not essential but can be benecial, particularly in higher-energy or uncooperative pa-tients that become unstable when sedated moreheavily. The injection is best performed without the use of stocks as they hinder the operator's movementand the view of the ultrasound screen. The ideallocation to perform the procedure is a clean roomwith a smooth floor, free of excess noise and otherdistractions. Preparation of Stem Cells for Injection The following steps are performed using sterile glovesand a sterile eld: The BMSCs are thawed and drawn into a 3-cc syringe using an 18-g needle. The 12-mL syringe the of BMSCs. Three mililiters of LRS should beadded over 10 seconds with gentle mixing intothe syringe Another 3 mL of LRS should againbe added to bring up the mixture to 9 mL over10 seconds, again with gentle mixing. Thelast 3 mL of LRS should then be added overanother 10 seconds to then have a total of a 12mL volume. This slow addition of LRS is toensure minimal \"shock\" to the BMSCs byslowly changing the osmotic gradient of thecells. Have a second syringe of 20 mL of LRS. The extension set is primed with LRS. A 19-g (or 20-g) 1.5-inch needle is placed on the end of the extension set and at the other end ofthe extension set is the 3-way stopcock and the20-mL syringe containing solely LRS. Injection Approach For the sake of simplicity, this will be described asthough injecting the left forelimb. The oppositewill apply to the right fore: The patient should be standing with the left forelimb placed caudal to the right.The person performing the injection will sit on a low stool or crouch on the horse's right sideto have access to the medial aspect of the limb.The author prefers a low stool for comfort andstability. The ultrasound machine is placedcranial to the left limb and the screen is low-ered so as to be easily visible. We do notrecommend placing the ultrasound machine onthe same side as the operator is sitting as thiswill require twisting to see the screen andmakes the approach more difcult. The assistant, also wearing sterile gloves, will go the patient's left side and hold the needle,extension set, and both syringes. Once theultrasound operator has identied the artery,the assistant will pass the needle to the oper-ator to perform the injection (Fig. 3). The probe is once again placed in long axis to the limb and the injection site again visual-ized. The needle is injected at an approxi-mately 55\u00b0 angle into the artery. It isessential that the needle tip be visible at alltimes to avoid misdirection. When the needle is through the vessel wall and in the artery lumen, there will be a flash ofblood in the extension set. At this point, theassistant will inject the syringe containing theBMSCs through the extension set. The injec-tion can be seen on the ultrasound screenas hyperechoic swirling in the artery lumen(Fig. 4). The injection should be watched Fig. 3. The ultrasound operator is on the opposite side of the limb being treated. The ultrasound probe is placed in longaxis to the limb and the needle with the extension set attached isinserted proximal to the ultrasound probe. The assistant holdsthe syringe containing only LRS and the syringe containing LRSand stem cells and administers the injection after conrmationthat the needle is within the artery lumen.

After the syringe containing the BMSCs is injected, the line is flushed with the syringe ofLRS. Additional LRS can be administeredbut not at the risk of vasospasm or othercomplications. When the injection is complete, the needle is removed and pressure placed on the artery. Acompression bandage comprised by severalrolled gauze sponges are applied to the injec-tion site and held in place with elastic adhe-sive tape. This is followed by a cottoncombine, brown gauze, and vet wrap bandage. Challenges and Difculties These common pitfalls can result in a frustrating,or worse case, unsuccessful injection. Recognizingthese common challenges will help ensure an un-eventful injection and improve outcome. There are variable cranial or caudal median veins that are located close to the medianartery that need to be distinguished from theartery to avoid inadvertent intravenous injec-tion. Place probe pressure over the vessel\u2014veins will compress whereas the artery doesnot. Passing the needle tip into the side wall of the artery but not fully entering the lumen is acommon error. In this case, there will be noflash of blood in the extension set. The risk ofextravasation or spasm increases with this er-ror. Constantly making sure that both the tipof the needle and the artery lumen are in theultrasound image and xing the needle trajec-tory if not will optimize the approach and de-crease the risk of this occurring. Extravasation occurs when the wall of the vessel is inappropriately punctured, or, lessoften, if the needle bevel is incompletely in the lumen. Fluid and gas will appear outsidethe vessel wall. If this occurs, the injectionshould be terminated. Vasospasm can occur even with a perfect injec- tion although is more likely if there is move-ment of the horse's limb or if the needle getscaught in the vessel wall. If there is severevessel spasm, it is possible to try to inject againslightly distal to the previous site. In some particularly difcult cases, the artery will spasm or there will be extravasation thatprecludes another attempt at injection. Inthese rare cases, because the BMSCs are al-ready thawed and distended, we will perform atraditional intravenous regional limb perfu-sion with the stem cells. Our clinical impres-sion is that vasospasm tends to happen moreseverely in horses that have previously under-gone an intra-arterial stem-cell injection. 3. Results Since we began doing this procedure, we have injected26 horses. The majority of the injections were per-formed by two board-certied veterinary radiologistsspecialized in equine imaging; a board-certied equinesports medicine specialist with advanced training inequine diagnostic imaging performed three of the in-jections. Three horses had bilateral injections and 6horses had repeat injections. Complications include2 injections in which due vasospasm and extravasa-tion the injection could not be completed; in both casesthe patient had previously had intra-arterial injectionsat this site. In these two cases, intravenous regionallimb perfusions were performed instead. Two horsesexperienced cellulitis after extravasation of injectate.In the remaining cases, there were no observed orreported complications and the horses tolerated theprocess well. 4. Discussion Ultrasound-guided injections of the median arterywith stem cells is a process that is both simple andtechnically challenging. When all goes well, theprocess is straightforward and, because there is notourniquet to cause discomfort, the patients typi-cally tolerate this procedure better than an intrave-nous regional limb perfusion. However, there arepitfalls that can be frustrating and difcult, such asarterial spasms or extravasation. Being fully pre-pared and having a back-up plan if the injectionfails, such as intravenous regional limb perfusion,will minimize stress and increase the chances ofsuccess. Terminating the injection immediately ifthere is evidence of extravasation will decrease therisk of complications such as cellulitis. There are knowledge gaps regarding this technique. Currently the ideal dose of BMSCs and dilution of theBMSCs and how much additional LRS injection, ifany, is unknown. The BMSC dose in our practice isdetermined by the treating clinician and the amount of Fig. 4. The needle is within the median artery (parallel with the red bar). The injection is monitored as hyperechoic material withinthe lumen of the artery originating from the needle tip (arrow). 312 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSDIAGNOSING, MANAGING, AND RESOLVING LAMENESS IN HORSESadditional LRS administered will vary depending on the state of the artery and patient compliance. To theauthors' knowledge, there are no published studiesevaluating the efcacy of stem-cell injec-tions for orthopedic injuries in the equine patient.Research into the indications and outcome of this pro-cedure for orthopedic injury compared to other treat-ment regimes is warranted. 5. Conclusion Ultrasound-guided injections of the median arterywith stem cells can be accomplished successfully withpractice and patience and offer an alternative ap-proach to treating orthopedic injuries of the lowerlimb.

Introduction Equine Shivers is a progressive movement disorder in which diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatmentremain as challenges. Three-dimensional (3D) mo-tion analysis has advanced the study of equine loco-motion and has characterized multiple human andcanine movement disorders. We hypothesized that3D kinematic assessment of Shivers horses wouldidentify key parameters to further promote under-standing of this disorder. 2. Materials and Methods Four nonlame and three Shivers client horses thatmet inclusion criteria were part of the study. Mea-surements were obtained with an infrared-based au-tomated gait analysis system and software. a,b,c,d Hindlimb joint angles, gait metrics, abduction angle,centroidal motion, and hoof elevation and separationwere averaged across all recorded takes for eachhorse. Statistical signicance of means was testedwith one-way RM ANOVA e(P/H110210.05).3. Results Multiple parameter differences were found in the Shivers horses at the walk, during backing, andwhen asked to pick up their hindlimbs. Most signif- icant changes were a wider hindlimb stance (0.39 /H11006 0.15 m) and an angle(48.7\u00b0 /H110067.52\u00b0) and hoof elevation (0.77 /H110060.08 m left and 0.94 /H110060.11 m right). Control horses could back easily in a straight line with symmetrical hoof separa-tion and could maintain their center of mass and bal-ance when picking up their hindlimbs in completecontrast to the Shivers horses. 4.

Introduction There is a perception in the equine industry that West- ern performance horses have a worse prognosis forstifle arthroscopy than other breeds. The objective ofthis study was to characterize the outcome for horsesin Western performance disciplines undergoing stiflearthroscopy and to determine factors associated withinitial presentation, preoperative imaging, intraoper-ative ndings, or postoperative therapies that mayinfluence return to work. 2. Materials and Methods Medical records for horses in work/training for var-ious Western performance disciplines and undergo-ing arthroscopy for lameness localized to the stiflewere reviewed. Follow-up was obtained /H113502 years postoperatively. Pertinent case information wasanalyzed with return to work as the primary out- come of interest.3. Results The most common disciplines represented were cutting ( n/H1100538), Western pleasure ( n/H1100513), and reining ( n/H1100513). Approximately 40% of horses (32/82) returned to work after surgery. Increased age, higher degree of lameness, longer duration oflameness, and the presence of partial-thicknesscartilage lesions decreased the odds of returningto work. 4.

Introduction Fatalities are a recognized consequence of prolonged endurance exercise, but fatality mitigation was dem-onstrated in 100-mile rides by changes in veterinaryprotocols. 2. Materials and Methods Numbers of starts and fatalities were obtained fromthe American Endurance Ride Conference (AERC)website, and details about fatalities were obtainedfrom attending veterinarians. Annual incidencerates (deaths/1,000 starts) for horses participatingin 100-mile rides were calculated (2002-2018). 3. Results For the 2002-2014 ride seasons, 18 fatalities wereidentied for 10,946 starts in 100-mile rides (1.64deaths per 1,000 starts). For the 2015 ride season,veterinary rule changes mandated the following:1) initial triage and treatment at all rides, includingintravenous fluid therapy; 2) 30 minutes to meetrecovery pulse at the nish line for completion in all distances with few exceptions; and 3) rides have atleast two control judges, one of whom is able toprovide treatment as required by Rule 1. Also, a2-hour safety check following ride nish (but notimpacting completion status) became more popularfollowing its long-time mandatory practice at Cali-fornia's 100-mile Tevis Cup ride. For the 2015-2018 ride seasons, 3 fatalities were recorded in 2,584100-mile starts (1.16 deaths per 1,000 starts). 4.

A fundamental knowledgeand understanding of the biomechanical properties of the hind limb and pelvis including the lumbo-sacral area can help improve treatment and rehabilitation outcomes in equine athletes and may are a common problem in equine athletes. Althoughequine practitioners are well educated in diagnostic investigation to gure out causes of lameness, littleis known about the predisposing biomechanical fea-tures of the involved anatomical structures beforelameness occurs. Given the appropriate stimulusand sufcient timeframe, musculoskeletal tissuehas the ability to adapt to mechanical demands.Failure of musculoskeletal structures happens as aresult of loading that exceeds their mechanicalcapacity or as chronic fatigue overload through re-petitive microdamage over time. Biomechanicaldysfunction leading to abberant gait or mechanicalrestriction in movement can evolve into clinicallameness. In-depth knowledge regarding the func-tional anatomy and segmental biomechanics is cru-cial to identify biomechanical or dysfunctionand prevent lameness in the equine athlete. Thisessay aims to provide insight of the functional anat-omy and biomechanical properties of the hind limband pelvis with regard to lameness.2. Generic Biomechanics of the Pelvic Limb Biomechanics are dened as the science concernedwith the action of forces on the living body. Therelationship between external forces (e.g., bodyweight) and internal forces (e.g., muscle contraction)will affect the anatomical scaffold of the body, de-pending on stride phase of gait. The horse's stridecan be divided into a weight-bearing stance and anon-weight-bearing swing phase. Both phases canbe subdivided into stride segments with typical bio-mechanical patterns. 1The weight-bearing stance consisting of load absorption (loading), mid-stanceand propulsion (breakover: heel lift) phases, andthe non-weight-bearing swing phase of retraction(breakover: toe-pivot), mid-swing and ground con-tact (landing) phases. 2 The equine limbs have evolved to decrease the energy expenditure required to move the legs duringlocomotion. The heavy musculature is conned tothe proximal limb While the forelimbs \"show a pillar-likeconstruction specialized for weight bearing, the hindlimbs provide leverage for generating propulsion 324 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE joints\"3and the preemi - nence of the proximal pelvic limb musculature4 demonstrates its importance for the body's for-ward motion. During loading of the limb all extensor muscles get involved and the forward thrust is mainly pro-vided by energetic contraction of the hip, stifle, andtarsal extensors. These muscles, namely M. glu-taeus medius, M. quadriceps and M. gas-trocnemius, represent the main components ofmuscle levers primarily involved in generation ofpropulsion, described as trochanteric, andcalcanean lever. 1They all represent rst-class le - vers, with the joint as fulcrum being located betweenthe muscular force application site and the movingextremity. The forward propulsion is supported by the \"caudal femoral lever system,\" 1another rst-class lever. membranosus, M. semitendinosus, M. biceps fem-oris), the stifle is pulled caudally and the stifle andtarsal joint are simultaneously extended while thebody is vigorously pushed forward over the hind leg throughout mid-stance. While the limb is ex-tended through muscle activity, the flexor tendonsreceive full tension and force the solar plane of thehoof onto the ground throughout the propulsionphase. The heel lifting off the ground marks theend of the propulsion phase and the swing phase isinitiated as soon as the hoof breaks over the toe-pivot point. During the non-weight-bearing swing phase, an- other type of lever system comes into action. Theflexors of the hind limb predominantly representthird-class levers, with the muscular force applica-tion site being located between the moving extrem-ity and the joint as fulcrum. By activation of thehind-limb flexors, the lower extremity is lifted offthe ground in a flexed manner as limb retraction andthe mid-swing phase is initiated. Since the me-chanical advantage of a third-class lever is low, theextremity moves further than the force. This for-ward swing is supported by The iliopsoas muscle (assisted by the deeper small pelvic muscles) then actively pulls the extremityforward in an oblique craniolateral direction. Con-traction of the iliopsoas muscle is considered veryimportant to the overall engagement of the hindlimb at the end of swing phase and determines theoverall amount of flexion of the hip joint as well asflexion at the lumbosacral junction. The forward swing of the hind limb is passively limited by the elasticity of the medial thigh muscles(M. sartorius, M. pectineus, M. gracilis), which leadsthe extremity back toward midline, immediately be-fore ground contact of the hoof in the landing phaseoccurs and another stride begins.3. Energy-Saving Mechanisms and Efciency of Movement Equine locomotion shows synergistic combinations between sprint performances and high endurance.5 However, as the horse is a flight animal, decrease ofenergy expenditure during movement is imperative.Equine evolvement has brought forward someunique biomechanical features and energy-savingmechanisms. By a series of muscles and ligaments,interacting as locking mechanisms to x the joints inposition, the horse is capable of constant prepared-ness for flight, as well as to stand upright with aminimum of muscular effort and relax or even sleepin a standing position. Since horses as herbivores need to carry consider- able weight and be able to cover long distances intheir natural habitat, economic locomotion is cru-cial. From a biomechanical point of view horses areequipped with extremely effective energy saving aswell as shock-absorbing mechanisms within theirlocomotor apparatus. 6 The extremity movements are well synchronized with pelvic and spinal motion to minimize the ex-penditure of energy. 7The limbs can be described as pendulums \"hanging from the body,\" which get clenched between the body weight and ground reac-tion forces while the extremity is loaded. The pen-dular movement is considered an extremely efcientmanner of motion, which can be compared to thenatural oscillation of an isolated pendulum withequalized mass distribution (resonance vibration) inwalking horses. With increasing speed of movement the swing phase proportion of stride decreases, thus leaving anoptimum range of energy efciency. In trot this iscompensated by spring mechanisms of the extremi-ties which enable higher resonance frequencies. By stretching and tensioning of tissues under limb loading, they accumulate potential energy, 6also de - scribed as a \"pogo-stick-phenomenon.\"8By eccen - tric contraction during elongation, muscles areprovided with power through stored potential en-ergy, 1which can be released almost free of losses when the tension decreases.6Forward movement is characterized by eccentric (lengthening) contrac- tion of muscles in stance phase followed by concen-tric (shortening) contraction in swing phase. In gallop tissue elasticity is even more important for the efciency of movement, since temporarily three legs contact the ground simultaneously, thusshortening the resonance vibration phases com-pared to the other gaits. The high capacity of potential energy retention in elastic tissue enables the horse to keep an optimi-zied \"overall energetic efciency\" level. 8The ratio between \"mechanical energy transport effort divided by metabolic energy transport effort\" ranges onhigher levels in horses compared to small animals(0.25 in horses vs. 0.03 in mice). 8 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 325IN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNBesides the elastic resilience of the extremities the elastic properties of the spinal structures andsurrounding tissue are responsible for the overallenergy efciency of equine locomotion. Rhythmicflexion and extension of the spinal bow by rhythmicantagonistic contraction of the epaxial back muscles(e.g., M. longissimus, M. iliocostalis) vs the hypaxialback iliopsoas, M.rectus abdominis, Mm. obliquus abdominis) lead topotential energy retention and release in the \"backbow.\" 8The spine swings in a sine wave manner. Furthermore, horses usually avoid non-economic gaits and speeds in freedom of movement. \" Eco- speeds\" within the range of gait-speed10to metabolism on an optimum and equal level.11Any other speed/gait combinations are considered less efcient, e.g., higher gait in slower speed as well asslower gait in higher speed 8and gait parameters are selected in a manner to minimize the energy ex- pense of locomotion within the set of specicconditions. 12 4. Segmental Biomechanics and Functional Anatomy Biomechanics as well as the functional anatomy willbe described segmentally from distal to proximal.It was shown that the loading of the limb happensconsecutively from the distal to proximal and thusshock absorption is facilitated. An experimentalcomparison of the loading of a movable limb vs astiffened leg revealed that ground contact of themoveable equine limb is longer and the impactforces are lower. 8 From Toe to Tarsus In a standing position, the horse's fetlock is nevermaximally extended. 13Only by full loading of the hind limb during stance phase in movement (or in the supporting leg during equine resting position)the fetlock is \"hyperextended\" and will lead to en-gagement of the suspensory apparatus to x thelower limb in extension. In the early load absorption phase, 1the fetlock is partly extended, while the cofn, tarsal, and stifle joints are still flexed. Subsequently the hindlimbshows rapid loading and deceleration in the initial10% of stride. 14The flexor tendons receive full ten - sional load and are pulled tight in mid-stance phase,stretching the check ligaments and bringing pres-sure to the sesamoid bones, thus stabilizing the dis-tal extremity joints and preventing them fromoverextension with a minimum of energy expense.It was shown that the profound digital flexor muscleof the hindleg creates four times as much force com-pared to the front leg 4in propulsion phase, hence highlighting the functional specialization of the hind leg to achieve forward thrust.8 If tendons are too long or too compliant to prevent overextension, the distal passive stay apparatus isdysfunctional15and unable to lock, leading to bio - mechanical stress on the distal limb structures andjoints. During walk, the greatest biomechanical forces occur in the beginning and at the end of the stancephase, 16while placing and lifting of the extremity. During trot, the middle support phase is biome- chanically more strenuous. The greatest forces are exerted due to muscular action.16In the rst part of the support phase, the activity of the hindlimb retractors (hamstrings and gluteus medius muscle) generate the rst peak inthe acceleration curve. At the end of the weight-bearing phase, while \"activity in the retractors de-creases towards zero, the dynamic effect of themomentum of weight together with the elastic resil-ience of the muscular tissue is responsible for thepush-off.\" 16 From Tarsus to Stifle The special anatomy of the tarsus with several smalltarsal bones forming the joints contributes to dimi-nution of concussion and loading shocks. 6The small ligaments connecting the tarsal bones absorb peak forces by stretching between the single bones6 while the hindleg is loaded in the early stance phase. The unique adaption to high-speed movements is very much represented by the equine reciprocalapparatus, composed of two entirely brouscomponents\u2014the bularis (peroneus) tertius mus-cle and the supercial digital flexor Supported by the other cranial tibial muscles andthe caudally located gastrocnemius muscle, thetendinous reciprocal the load-ing forces on the tibia during locomotion whilereducing the bending strain on the bone. 16 Toward the end stance phase, when the limb is retracted beyond the midstance position, the tarsaljoint is still extended, while the stifle begins toflex, 14which results in stretching of the brous per - oneus tertius.16 As soon as the hoof starts rolling over, the tarsus is passively flexed due to the tensional preloadingand elastic resilience of the reciprocal apparatus andthe push-off is initiated. 16Speaking in terms of efciency, the preload of the peroneus tertius muscle leads to highly efcient energy transfer from onesegment of the limb to another by passive move-ment, especially at higher speed of gait. 17 The tarsal joint is considered one of the most important joints for forward propulsion as well asfor impact force compensation. 8But the stifle is also involved in impact force and shock absorption. The femorotibial joint is always orientated in aflexed position. Even in the standing horse thecaudal stifle joint angle measures approximately150\u00b0. The femoral condyles of quadrupeds show anincreasing curvature of bending in caudal direction. 2 This leads to increasing preload of the collateralfemorotibial ligaments in stifle flexion and enablesthem to act as motion decelerators. 326 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNWhen the stifle joint is loaded, the cup-shaped menisci diminish part of the loading forces. Due totheir broad contact surfaces to the condyles of thefemur and tibia plateau, axial compression is turnedinto circumferential meniscal extension. 18The menisco-tibial ligaments take an important role in this force transmission.19It was shown that forces occurring during different degrees of stifle move- ment lead to differential tensile loading of the indi-vidual ligamentous structures. In full stifleextension (160\u00b0) the tensile the medialcranial meniscotibial ligament was four timeshigher, predisposing this structure and the medialmeniscal anterior horn to structural tear. 18Since these structures incorporate a high density of mechanoreceptors, tear or distruction can lead toproprioceptive dysfunction 20and repetitive damage. While the stifle extends, the tibia slightly rotates externally and the center of joint contact moves cra-nially on both tibial condyles, with the lateral mov-ing a greater distance than the medial. 21A study revealed that the articular contact area in the me- dial femorotibial compartment decreases in exten-sion, as well as the area of highest joint contact onthe medial tibial condyle, whereas both increase in the lateral compartment. 21 To resist caudal translation of the tibia in exten- sion, restrict ligamentis supported by the meniscofemoral meniscus to-wards the medial femoral condyle. In horses a substantial structurerelated to the caudal tibial slope and size ratio be-tween the meniscofemoral and caudal cruciate liga-ment is proven to be greater in quadrupedscompared to human knees. 22 In a resting position, the patella can be hooked over the medial ridge of trochlea. ligamentous loopconstruction built of heavy ligamentous structuresin the front of the stifle together with the parapatel-lar cartilage. This leads to engagement of theframesaw construction of the reciprocal apparatus,thus stabilizing the hindleg in a stretched position. 6 The required muscle activity for stabilization is con-sidered less than 2% compared to the amount offorce that would be required without a patella mech-anism 23and the quadriceps femoris muscle is relaxed in this position.2 In the mid-stance phase of movement, the rectus femoris part of the quadriceps muscle prevents stiflejoint collapse. At the end of stance phase, the mus-cle activity is replaced by activation of the vastuslateralis portion, leading to lateral rotation of thepatella around a longitudinal axis to prevent it fromhooking on the medial ridge of the femoral trochleain movement. 16To raise the distal limb in protraction, flexion cycles of the stifle and tarsal joints are well coordi-nated during the swing phase by the reciprocal ap-paratus. 14Even synchronous movements between stifle, tarsal, and fetlock joints have been demon- strated.24As soon as the calcaneus receives hori - zontal orientation in swing phase, the supercialdigital flexor tendon is tensioned, leading to passiveflexion of the digital fetlock and interphalangealjoints. 1 From a biomechanical point of view, perfect syn- chronization of individual muscle activity is crucialfor an energy-efcient stride and joint protectivemuscle stabilization, thereby preventing biome-chanical dysfunction, which may lead to long-termlameness. From Stifle to Hip The coxofemoral joint is built as a primary weight-bearing ball-and-socket joint, and is held in aslightly flexed position (115\u00b0) by the activity of thehamstrings and gluteal muscles. Stabilization re-quires only a minimum of energy, since it is mainlyprovided by heavy ligamentous structures. Therm femoral head ligaments, in particular the prom-inent accessory femoral head ligament, xate thefemur onto the acetabulum and give partial origin tothe pectineus and gracilis muscle before blendinginto the prepubic tendon. 2 Even though being built as a universal joint, rotation as well as ab- and adduction are ratherlimited by the preeminent surrounding musculartissue and rm ligaments, and the primary move-ment occurring is flexion and extension in thesagittal plane. 2 Flexion and extension around the hip joint as a pivot point are responsible for protraction and re-traction of the entire limb. While maximum pro-traction occurs shortly before the end of the swingphase, maximum retraction occurs during break-over. 14The motion of the hind limb in the sagittal plane appears to be pendular around a rotation point in the acetabulum.24 Following complete limb extension at the end of propulsion, the non-weight-bearing swing phase isinitiated. The moment the hoof breaks over toe-pivot point, the retraction of the hindlimb starts byjoint flexion and shortening of the distance betweenhoof and tuber coxae, to facilitate lifting of the leg. 1 Even though the shortening distance between hoofand stifle measures approximately 11 cm 17in the mid-swing phase of an average horse, overall the limb is only shortened about 6 cm in length, sincethe distance between the stifle and tuber coxae elon-gates 8through hip extension in protraction prior to ground contact in the landing phase.1 While hip flexion during the swing phase is mainly provided by concentric contraction of the il-iopsoas muscle together with activation of the tensorfascia latae and rectus femoris muscle, flexion of thejoint in phase is by eccentric contrac- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 327IN-DEPTH: HIND LEG and caudal femoral muscles.1 Pelvis and Lumbosacral Junction Since the spine is suspended under the pelvis, thesacroiliac joint is never fully weight bearing in thestanding horse. 3The sacroiliac joint can be com - pared to a cardan shaft, with strong ligamentousstructures rmly attaching the sacrum to the ilium,to enable force transmission from the hindlimbs tothe axial skeleton in movement. Unlike most other joints, the articular cartilage is rarely exposed to direct orthogonal compressiveforces and the joint morphology indicates that it isdesigned to withstand shearing forces exerted bygliding movements. 25Nevertheless, bony patholo - gies26as well as cartilage changes25can commonly be seen in specimens and the sacroiliac junction is often incriminated as the source of perfomance-limiting pathology 27and as a reason for back pain issues. Unfortunately, the accessibility of the sacroiliac joint is very limited and the range of motion de-scribed as small, requiring advanced skills for exam-ination and segmental motion palpation. 28 Motion in the sagittal plane, namely sacroiliac flexion and extension, is thought to cover only arange of 1\u00b0 around a transverse axis located close tothe caudomedial aspect of the sacroiliac joint. 29 In humans, these movements are also referred to as\"pelvic pitch\" or nutation and counternutation, de-scribing (posterior-superior) or ven-trocaudal can be somewhat misleading inquadrupeds' biomechanics. Besides movement in the sagittal plane, \"pelvic roll\" as axial rotation around the sacrum and \"pelvic yaw\" as movementaround a vertical axis through the base of the sa-crum (similar to lateral bending of the spine) aredescribed. Both are assumed to be approximatelyin the range of 2.5\u00b0. 27 However, other studies reported average values for motion in the sagittal plane of 2.08\u00b0 /H110060.35\u00b0 and axial rotation of 1.70\u00b0 /H110060.48\u00b0, when manual forces were applied.30Ex vivo studies range of m otion measurements revealed bone displacements in all planes between 3 and 10 mm27in sacropelvic specimens. During gait the overall sacroiliac range of motion was bigger compared to standing measurements,accentuating the influence of hind limb movingforces on the sacroiliac joint. 16Motion between the sacrum and pelvis could be demonstrated directly by implanted Steinmann pins27as well as indirectly by changes of ultrasonographic measurements of cross- sectional areas of the dorsal sacroiliac ligament inmoving equines. 27 Nevertheless, studies revealed that the sacroiliac range of motion decreases from walk to trot, indicat-ing that increased muscle recruitment and neuro- motor control of the surrounding musculature leadsto increased stabilization of the sacroiliac joint. 6 Similar to the principles of muscular solidication ofthe vertebral column, the sacroiliac joint is also sta-bilized by surrounding tissue and is not assumed aspassively hanging by its ligaments. 6 Regarding the lumbosacral and sacroiliac junc- tion, the iliopsoas muscle is of special interest.Since it is located along the ventral aspect of the lastthoracic and lumbar vertebrae as well as insertingon the will affect lumbosacral the ilium, ischium, and pubis in equines usually happens at the age of 10 to 12months, 2but the pelvic bones themselves maintain capacity for dynamic deformation and cannot be seen as rigid structures.32Furthermore, the pelvic symphysis remains partially flexible, even though slowly progressing ossication during the aging pro-cess will turn the brocartilage into a synosthosicstructure. 5. Discussion Musculoskeletal pathologies and lameness are acommon problem equine theanimal's welfare and economic efciency. Identi-cation of predisposing factors to the development oflameness is therefore desirable to help prevent or-thopedic issues. The equine musculoskeletal apparatus owns a high capacity to adapt to mechanical demands.However, besides macrotrauma, external as well asinherent internal forces, will affect the functionaland structural integrity of the body. Whenever dis-crepancies occur, impact force vectors will be modi-ed, potentially leading to repetitive microdamageand changes in structure or energy efciency, orboth. Even though being considered as subclinical at times, 25gross and histopathological changes of ar - ticular surfaces in joints are commonly seen in spec-imens and may be interpreted as either phyiologicalchanges due to aging or tissue adaption or asphathological damage. Postmortem studies of cadaver stifles revealed a variety of pathologies, including meniscotibial liga- ment shape irregularity, ber separation, and ar-ticular cartilage brillation, with or withoutosteochondral over coarseness of the auricular surface in humans was viewed as a nonpathologic adaptation to forcesexerted at the sacroiliac joint, leading to increasedstability 34and similar ndings were described for equine sacroiliac26as well as for other joints. Nevertheless, biomechanically correct and unre- stricted movement of the individual motion seg-ments seems essential to not overstress the adaptivecapacity of musculoskeletal tissues. An intimate 328 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNunderstanding of the functional anatomy and the normal kinematics is hence crucial to reveal biome-chanical stress or dysfunction. The knowledgeabout forces occurring at articular joint surfacesduring different stages of joint movement may pro-vide insight into the etiology of common orthopedicissues. 21 From a biomechanical point of view, joint stabili- zation through perfect neuromuscular synchroniza-tion is crucial to maintain persistent physicalintegrity of the body. Studies in dogs have clearlydemonstrated, that the epaxial musculature glob-ally stabilizes the spinal articulations against theexternal and internal limb forces acting on the pel-vis and trunk during walking and trotting. 35Pre- suming optimal muscle activation at the right timeand frequency in movement, joints \"float in the softtissue\" and shearing forces within the joint 36are assumed to be less than compared to melting ice cubes.37 The high incidence of pathological ndings in ar- ticular joint cartilages without a history of lamenessin equine athletes seems to underline the capacityand importance of muscle stabilization during move-ment. In human sports medicine, optimization ofneuromuscular joint stabilization is already consid-ered as a state-of-the-art procedure in orthopediccase management. Rehabilitation programs andprevention measures are routinely accompanied bymuscle building and proprioceptive training andshould be reconsidered in equine sports medicineand rehabilitation. This seems particularly important for the stabili- zation of the equine lumbosacral and sacroiliac junc-tion. While poor performance in sport horses isoften related to lameness issues, biomechanical dys-function of pelvic and spinal structures are still un-derestimated as possible causes, or contributingfactors, for performance reduction or pain. 3This is probably partially because the pelvis and axial skel- eton are not easily accessible to thorough diagnosticexamination and their clinical relevance is still notfully understood. Biomechanical concepts such as the \"bow-and- string\" of the equine back try to explain the highlycomplex biomechanical features of the spine. 38 Yet they fail to represent the full complexity, nordescribe the interactions between spine, pelvis andhindlimb biomechanics. 27 Longstanding hindlimb lameness may lead to de- velopment of visible pelvic asymmetry due to asym-metric muscular and ligamentous loading or pelvicbone remodeling. 27Such asymmetries may also lead to changes in lumbosacral flexibility and rota- tional motion of the pelvis. Fluoroscopic exploration of three-dimensional mo- tions of the pelvis and the lumbar spine in walkingand trotting dogs clearly demonstrated the tightlylinked pelvic and lumbar intervertebral movementpatterns. 35The ranges of motion occurring at the lumbosacral junction were signicantly higher com-pared to the other lumbar intervertebral motion segments,39indicating the importance of the lumbo - sacral area for force transmission of the hind limbsto the axial skeleton. An increased understandingof the structural and functional components andbiomechanics of the equine axial skeleton is alsoinevitable 3to better understand their relationship to poor performance and hindlimb lameness issues. The use of a kinematic approach to sacroiliac dys- function causing pain, borrowed from the humanneuromotor control model, has advanced the knowl-edge of the equine sacroiliac joint and its kinemat-ics. 6Increasing muscular control of movement in trot was shown to lead to smaller ranges of motion between the pelvis and sacrum compared to walk.40 It is postulated that loss of the neuromotor control ofthe musculature surrounding the sacroiliac jointwill lead to sacroiliac joint and initiatepathological processes as in humans 6since bony morphological changes are commonly seen in equine specimens. Pathological articular changes may bea response to altered forces transmitted to the joint,either through joint movement limitations or in-creased mobility due to lack of stabilization. Sodespite the sacroiliac joint being a structurallystrong joint, it seems susceptible to altered move-ment patterns and injury 6in the horse and \"al - though motion in the sacroiliac joint may be overalllimited, proper functioning of this joint is crucial tounhampered locomotion.\" 41 Considerable left-right asymmetry in pelvic mo- tion, as well as pelvic bone asymmetry, is thought tobe a common feature in horses suspected of havingchronic sacroiliac dysfunction or injury, 27even though it is also seen in horses without any history of pelvic lameness.29It seems evident though, that difculty stabilizing the hindlimb on the affected side while lifting the non-affected leg is a consistentfeature of patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunctionand can be used as a diagnostic aid to the equinepractitioner. Furthermore, with the thoracolum-bar fascia blending mediocaudally via the supraspi-nous ligament sacroiliac ligaments, 29 ultrasonographically detectable left-to-right dorsalsacroiliac ligament asymmetry can also support thepractitioner's diagnosis. Vertical displacement asymmetry of the pelvis has been demonstrated in induced hind-limb length dif-ferences. 42The pelvic downward movement was increased on the side of the shorter limb during stance, whereas increased pelvic upward movementduring and after stance of the longer limb was mea-sured. 42Similar to human studies, limb length dif - ferences and movement asymmetry is associatedwith ground reaction force asymmetry, increasingthe weight supported with the shorter limb as wellas the pushoff forces of the longer limb. Especially when being ridden, a horse must be able to move its legs closer to the center of gravityand lower its neck in order to achieve a posture of aconvex back curvature. This permits the horse to AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 329IN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNcarry the additional weight of the rider, without experiencing dysfunctional harm. It is essential to consider the unrestricted and correct functionality of hindlimb, pelvic, and spinalbiomechanical details to protect the horse frombiomechanical dysfunction and injuries, especiallyif performance requirements demand certain bio-mechanical articulations, and their surrounding struc-tures can predispose to development of clinicallyrelevant lameness. A fundamental knowledge and understanding of the biomechanical properties of the hindlimb andpelvis including the axial skeleton can help im-prove treatment and rehabilitation outcomes inequine athletes and may help to prevent hindlimblameness. 28 6. Conclusion The efciency of movement is dependent on unre-stricted and correct functionality of the individualmotion units and tissue elasticity together with op-timal synchronization of the individual segments.Changes in biomechanical function of one structurewill lead to biomechanical adaptions and implica-tions of other structures and joints. Biomechanicaldysfunction of hind-limb motion units as well asspinal articulations and surrounding structures cantherefore predispose to development of clinically rel-evant lameness. A fundamental knowledge and understanding of the biomechanical properties of the hind limb andpelvis including the sacroiliac joint and the lumbo-sacral region is expected to help the equine clinicianto prevent hind-limb lameness and improve treat-ment outcomes. Rehabilitation procedures mayalso be more effectively applied in equine athletes,as well as helping to protect horses from injuries.This may be especially true in performance sporthorses that undergo considerable biomechanicaladaptions.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS THE PELVIS DOWNExamination and Treatment of Lameness from the Stifle Through the Foot Cooper Williams, VMD, DACVSMR Lameness diagnosis and treatment should be a series of methodical steps: 1) an anatomy-based, \"whole-horse\" clinical examination; 2) localization; 3) combined diagnostic imaging of radiographyand sonographic surveys; and 4) patient management, which includes treatment, rehabilitation, andfuture management/prevention. An intimate knowledge of anatomy, functional anatomy, and thedirect relation to imaging anatomy is essential to accurate lameness diagnosis and treatment. Au-thor's address: Equine Sports Medicine Hind-end lameness is a broad subject to cover in such a conned time, so the focus will not be onreview of every possible cause of hind-end lameness.It will be based on the author's philosophy and per-sonal approach. Even though this topic is centeredon the hind end, in the author's lameness referralpractice, the approach in almost every case is a\"whole-horse\" examination. This involves palpa-tion, manipulation, and mobility testing of neck,back, pelvis, and all four limbs in intimate detail.For the purposes of this discussion, the focus will beon the hindlimb from the stifle through the foot.Equine athletes, like human athletes, are collectionsof repetitive trauma. It is the practitioner's job tobe a detective and gather all evidence of the pa- tient's issues. A thorough baseline clinical exami-nation allows veterinarians to judge the evolutionof patients over time, and the conditions affectingthat patient over time. This clinical examination isbased around detailed anatomy and functional anat-omy. Localization of primary areas of interest isthe goal. The clinical examination, sometimes in combination with diagnostic analgesia, guides to-ward the next step, imaging. Imaging leads to adiagnosis and ideally, the clinical ndings link thetwo together. Diagnosis leads to treatment, anddepending on the injury, rehabilitation. In addi-tion to the immediate, practitioners should alsothink toward the future and help clients \"manage\"patients. A large percentage of the equine veteri-nary profession approaches hind-end lamenessand performance issues with a cursory \"shotgun\"approach of intra-articular injection of tarsi and/orstifles. In addition, many horses are placed on\"routine\" intra-articular maintenance withoutthought to clinical monitoring. Client education isone of the many jobs of an individual practitionerand the veterinary profession has the ability to shiftthis injection paradigm to one of examination rst. 2. \"Whole-Horse\" Clinical Examination (Hind-Limb Portion) As with most veterinary cases, this starts with his- tory. In this phase, be cognizant of trying not to 332 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWN NOTESevolve into a case with pre-conceived ideas regard- ing diagnosis. Age, breed, discipline, training, com-petition history, plus previous lameness history,treatment, and diagnostics are all important. Al-ways make sure the horse being examined is notpresently on any drug that would be an analgesicaffecting the examination. Always examine the foot rst to rule out the very basic hoof abscess. As evolved as veterinary medi-cine has become in lameness diagnostics, realizethat these are quite common. This can segue into adiscussion of hoof testers. They are not a highlyadvanced tool, but it is worth noting they can beused to discern between two types fast conducting,transmitting sharp localized pain. 1For example, the immediate pain obtained around the periphery of the foot with hoof testers with an abscess orbruise. Protopathic bers are C-bers that are un-myelinated, small diameter, and slow conducting,transmitting poorly localized, dull, aching pain. 2 For example, the type of pain elicited with sustainedpressure of hoof testers across the heels with \"heelpain\" syndrome. Step back to get a visual examination of the pa- tient-conformational abnormalities, muscling, pos-ture, body score, and any evidence of metabolicissues. A thorough assessment of body symmetry is essential, this is a history book of how thehorse has been using and abusing its body.Make sure the patient has a square stance on levelground. Kneel down in front of the horse and lookup to gauge neck structure and muscle symmetry.Standing in front of the horse, lower the head toevaluate cranial, poll, and neck symmetry fromabove. From behind, evaluate pelvic symmetry,hind-end muscle symmetry, back and shoulder sym-metry. Pelvic asymmetry should be judged care-fully-are the bony protuberances bilaterally similar(height, width, and contour)? For instance, if thetuber sacrale are different heights, there are threemain causes: a true pelvic traumatic shift, enlarge-ment of one dorsal sacral ligament (funicular por-tion), or a side ofthe higher tuber sacrale (biomechanically, the soundside will be driven higher over time). Asymmetricstructure causes asymmetric function and asymmet-ric function over time will create its own repetitivetrauma. Kneel down again, to evaluate feet forsymmetry and condition. The author's approach from here is to palpate, manipulate, and perform mobility testing of theneck, back, pelvis, and all four limbs (only hindlimbsfor this presentation). In the author's opinion, per-forming the same exam every time, will reduce thelikelihood of missing valuable clinical information.The axial skeleton can directly affect hind-endmovement, so it is ideal to start here. The neck andassociated abnormalities can certainly play into ab-normal hind-end movement, including a range ofneurologic dysfunction, which when subtle, can be dif- cult to distinguish from lameness. Careful staticpalpation and palpation during movement are impor-tant. The author prefers baited carrot tests to assesscranial, mid range, and caudal lateral mobility bilat-erally, as well as flexion and extension. Then move tothe back, palpating the dorsal midline and epaxialmuscles bilaterally, observing sensitivity, fascicu-lations, and textural differences. Mobilization of theback (flexion, extension, are Completing performcareful palpation and mobilization (flexion and exten-sion) of the pelvic region. Stallions should have tes-ticles palpated and geldings should have castrationsites palpated. These are not common sources, butabnormalities can be associated with hind-end lame-ness. It is also possible for ovarian pain in mares tobe related to abnormal hind-end movement. Proxi-mal limb structures and muscles should be palpatedcarefully for sensitivities and abnormalities in tex-ture. Classic brotic myopathy is well known; whatis mild clinicalbrotic myopathy. Signicant pressure should beused when palpating the region of the greater andthird trochanters. Continuing down the limb, the stifle should al- ways be palpated in a squared, full-weight-bearingposition rst. Start with collateral and patellar lig-aments and their associated bony insertions. Jointrecesses should be palpated for both fluid disten-tion and joint capsule quality. The stifle shouldalso be palpated as the limb is rocked in and out ofthe locked position, as a test for upward xation ofthe patella. Apply caudal pressure to the anterioraspect of the patella. This is a good test for femo-ropatellar joint inflammation. Don't forget thegaskin or crus region, palpating bone surfaces, mus-cles, and especially the calcanean tendon region. Continuing distally to the tarsus, carefully palpate joint surfaces, joint capsules, tarsal tendon and plantarmetatarsal soft metacarpophalan-geal joint and digital tendon sheath distension andcapsule quality. Are and distal interphalangeal joint sur-faces, recesses and of joints and the plantar pastern soft tissues.Are there signicant digital pulses or heat in feet?The feet should be evaluated in both weight bearingand in hand, paying attention to shape, angles, toes/heel length, symmetry, breakover, horn quality, coro-nary band sensitivity/texture, flexibility of collateralcartilages, alignment with limb, and if wearing shoes,shoe-wear distribution patterns. Continue with unweighted palpation. Is the pa- tient willing to pick up the limb and are they com-fortable holding it flexed and extended? Do thejoints have normal range of motion and is there anypain during this manipulation? When holdingup a limb, evaluate the metacarpophalangeal joint AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 333IN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNsupport of the opposite weight bearing limb, horses with poor suspensory support will exhibit a hyper-extension of this joint. Two unweighted tests fordistal tarsal joint pain are the \"Churchill\" test andthe \"Cunean\" test, both developed by Dr. EdwinChurchill. 3The Churchill test is performed by placing ngers caudal to proximal MTII and pulling anteriorly, being careful not to put pressure on theadjacent proximal suspensory ligament. The medial distal tarsal joints mediallyto insert on the proximal aspect of over theunderlying bone. Dynamic metatarsal soft tissues should be palpatedagain in the unweighted limb. A dynamic test forsuspensory branch insertion pain is the \"apical\" test.Place thumb metacarpophalangeal simultaneously.There is some crossover pain there is signicantinflammation of the metacarpophalangeal joint ordigital tendon sheath. Careful palpation thejoint joint inboth the weightbearing and unweighted positionsshould be used to elucidate restrictive capsulitis.The author has added a dorsal pressure test to theunweighted metacarpophalangeal joint to causehyperextension of the joint. A basilar test can be performed in similar fashion at the origins ofthe sesamoidean ligaments from the basilar aspectsof the sesamoids. Careful of pastern soft-tissue structures is important in the unweightedlimb. A good test for deep digital flexor tendon(DDFT) and digital annular ligament pain is directplantar pressure on the pastern from sesamoids tothe heel region. Finally, perform a pelvic tilt testwith lateral excursion of the entire hindlimb, shift-ing the weight to the opposite side of the pelvis,evaluating for flexibility and reactivity. There is alearning curve with this test and there will also bebreed variations. It is essential for practitioners to have an intimate detailed knowledge of anatomy and functional anat-omy for the exam above. Many of the tests willhave a learning curve to know what is a normal vsan abnormal response. Many of the tests may needto be repeated to evaluate consistency of response. 3. Movement Evaluation in Hand Upon completion of palpation, manipulation, andmobility testing, proceed to observation of move-ment in hand, on a longe line, and under tack.Observe movement in hand on a rm surface on asmall gure-of-eight and on a straight line. The au-thor prefers to see the same gait, going away andcoming toward, observing both forelimb and hindlimbmovement in both directions. Judge length of stride, symmetry of weight bearing, head and neck move-ment, and straightness of tracking. Many people ob-serve and compare bilateral vertical excursion of thetuber coxae when evaluating hind-end lameness.This can become a problem for the patient that haspelvic asymmetry, skewing the observations. Toeliminate this possibility, the height of the point of thecroup can be observed as each limb bears weight.The point of the croup will be higher when a lame limbbears weight. Always evaluate movement on thestraight line from the side as well. This allows eval-uation of the \"arc of flight,\" or height of the foot as ittravels over the ground. Does the horse tap or draghind toes during the cranial phase of the stride?When evaluating hindlimb lameness, it is important tolook for forelimb lameness as well. Obviously, therecan be more than one limb with lameness, but with a3/5 or greater anipsilateral \"head nod\" forelimb lameness. 4. Movement Evaluation in Hand after Dynamic Stress Tests Dynamic tests are those used to gauge any possible effect on baseline soundness. \"Flexion\" tests arethe most well known. The reciprocal apparatus ofthe hindlimb makes it difcult to isolate joints of thehindlimb in flexion. Because of peroneus ter-tius and the supercial digital flexor tendon attach-ments, the hock and stifle always flex together.When initially lifting the limb, this apparatus can betested for integrity by picking up the limb fromabove the hock. If damaged, the stifle will flex andthe hock will not flex simultaneously. Flexion testsare not highly scientic and responses may not di-rectly relate to a particular cause, but they canprovide benecial information. At least proximaland distal limb flexions should be performed sepa-rately. The author performs the following tests:proximal limb with neutral position, proximal limbwith stifle emphasis, cross limb flexion, and distallimb flexion. Note the response of the horse duringthe holding phase, initial limb weighting, severity ofresponse, and duration of response. The amount oftime that the limb is stressed is quite variableamong practitioners. It is more important that anindividual practitioner be consistent over time.Additional dynamic tests that can be performed area proximal suspensory pressure test, wedge boardtest, and dynamic hoof testing (sustained pressureacross heels and then trotting). 5. Movement Evaluation on Longe Upon completion of \"in-hand\" evaluation, the au-thor prefers to evaluate movement on a longe line.There are circumstances where longeing is notappropriate. The horse should be able to longesafely and under control. Longeing a severelameness is not advisable; the practitioner shouldnot risk making a lameness worse for examinationpurposes. When possible, it is good to compare 334 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNlongeing movement on both rm and soft ground. Evaluate walk, trot, and canter, as well as gait tran-sitions in both directions. As with any movementevaluation, length of stride, symmetry of stride length,symmetry of weight bearing, arc of flight, and track-ing, are all important. The canter should be judgedfor its \"depart,\" the ability to maintain canter leads,and proper \"dissociation\" of hindlimbs. An additionalcomponent of movement evaluation on a longe lineinvolves body position. Normal body position is a \"ba-nana shape\" around the person longeing. An altera-tion in this normal position usually belies painsomewhere in the axial skeleton. 6. Movement Evaluation Under Tack The next step in movement evaluation is performedunder tack. Many lamenesses do not require ahorse to be ridden, but there are some that are bestrevealed with a rider. All of the same gaits andparameters are evaluated under tack, that wereevaluated on the longe line. Some lamenesses mayneed to be elucidated with performance of thepatients' discipline (i.e., dressage, jumping, etc.).Occasionally, the author's practice evaluates move-ment videos. These include competition videos andvideos of horses with intermittent or variable lame-ness, capturing lameness often at optimal moments.It may be easier to view these on a laptop instead ofa cell phone screen. 7. Neurologic Evaluation Again, not all lamenesses require neurologic evalu-ation, but there are a percentage of hind-limb lame-nesses that appear to have a neurologic component.In these situations, it is best to perform a series ofstandard neurologic tests to further elucidate thispossibility. These include spin tests, reverse, tailtone, tail sway tests, placement tests, etc. 4 8. Localization The list of primary ndings from the clinical phaseof the examination (static and dynamic), shouldbe fed into a virtual funnel to make decisionsregarding further diagnostics. The key word is\"localization.\" Localization allows more focusedimaging diagnostics and therefore, a more accu-rate lameness diagnosis. In the eld, localizationcan be made through clinical ndings, diagnosticanalgesia (\"blocking\"), or a combination of the two(conrmatory blocking to reinforce imaging nd-ings). Diagnostic analgesia can be approachedin different ways, regional blocking, blocking of spe- cic synovial structures, or a combination of thetwo, until the lameness is improved signicantly(\"blocked\"). A practitioner may choose to blockfrom the ground up, step by step, or proceed to\"shortcut elimination\" blocking. An example of shortcut elimination blocking is to start with an ultra-sound-guided tibial and bular (peroneal) nerve blockand eliminate causes of lameness from the hock down.This type of blocking has the possibility of saving timeand money, but if the block is positive, it requires starting over more distally on a different day. Block-ing can also interfere with same day sonographic im-aging, so if clinical signs localize a region, blockingmay best be used as post-imaging conrmation. Didthe clinical examination allow you to localize to a likelyregion of interest? A good percentage of the time,clinical signs allow us to proceed directly to imaging.However, when localization is attained, this leads todiagnostic imaging of the localized structure. Occa-sionally, the author comes across the \"unblockable\"lameness (i.e., enostosis). In these situations, the au-thor will incorporate nuclear scintigraphy. Nuclearscintigraphy can give a lot of false-negative and false-positive information, but can be quite useful revealingareas of active inflammation. 9. Combined Imaging (Radiography and Sonography) This is a good time to reinforce the concept of \"com-bined imaging.\" Most veterinarians have radiogra-phy and sonography available, and when usedtogether, they can aid in elucidating most lame-nesses, without the aid of advanced diagnostics.This is also the time to introduce the concept of thesonographic survey. When clinical signs designatea region of interest, for example, the pelvic region,perform both a transrectal sonogram of the pelvicmusculoskeletal structures and an external sono-gram of the pelvic bones, hip joints, and trochanters(greater and third). Remember, ultrasound is themost sensitive tool for bone \"surface\" detail. Theclinical signs direct the area of survey, but the majorregions are stifle, tarsus, plantar metatarsal softtissues, ankle/digital tendon sheath complex, andpastern/foot. Emphasizing the word \"survey,\" as itis not unusual to have more than one nding, don'tstop after the rst abnormality. There are alsomany tools in the ultrasound tool chest: compara-tive imaging (i.e., between limbs), combining tran-sectional and longitudinal views, image blending(with split screen), weighted and unweighted imag-ing, angle contrast imaging (ACUST) ultrasoundtechnique, and dynamic imaging to judge tissuerelationships during movement. The author con-siders ultrasound as or more important than radi-ography for elucidating every part of the body, butas stated before, they are best used together ascomplements to each other. 10. Combined Imaging of the Stifle With the stifle, the author usually starts with a\"flash\" sonogram of the 4 major joint recesses, usingthem as \"canaries in a coal mine\" or indicators,judging fluid amounts and quality, as well as thesynovial membrane/joint capsule quality. Theseare the medial medialand lateral There arevarying degrees of communication between theserecesses. 5In the complete survey, ultrasound elu - cidates associated bone and cartilage surfaces,menisci, and the 14 ligaments and tendons associ- AAEP PROCEEDINGS 65 /H114082019 335IN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNated with the stifle. To be com plete, the stifle should be scanned in both standing and flexed positions.Flexed imaging of the stifle allows imaging of the fem-oral condyles and associated cartilage, the cranialmeniscal attachments to the tibia, and the cranialcruciate attachments. Radiographically, it is impor-tant to take high-quality radiographs. The author'spractice oblique,caudomedial-craniolateral oblique, flexed lateral, andskyline of patella. 11. Combined Imaging of the Tarsus The tarsal region is also a complex region for sonog-raphy and includes the bone surfaces, all associatedligaments and hockallows the deep collateral ligaments and gastrocne-mius tendon (relaxed when fully weight bearing),to be viewed in tension, and exposes the caudalcartilage surfaces of the talus. Most practitionersare familiar with evaluation of radiographs of thetarsus. Again, it is important to take good-qualityradiographs, with exposures that allow evaluationof distal tarsal bone densities. In addition to thestandard 4 views, the author's practice frequentlyadds a flexed lateral and a skyline of the calcaneus. 12. Combined Imaging of the Metatarsus Structures of the metatarsal region are a commonsource of lameness and should be evaluated care-fully. Evaluate the entire metatarsal region whenthis is the localized region. Sonographically, sur-vey the plantar metatarsal soft tissues from theproximal metatarsus Again, good-quality radiographs of themetatarsal region are essential. addition tothe four standard views (lateral, DP, DPLMO, andDPMLO), the author will also take a 15\u00b0 plantarol-ateral to dorsomedial oblique view suspensory enthesis. Theproximal hind suspensory is one of the more difcultand controversial structures to evaluate. That iswhy it is important to use every ultrasound toolavailable when there are concerns about this struc-ture. Always compare it to the opposite limb,always scan in both weighted and unweighted posi-tions, always perform ACUST imaging in standingand flexed positions, and always evaluate associatedbone surfaces carefully. Flexed imaging allows thetendons to deform side by side and serve as a stand-off to elucidate all borders of the structure. ACUSTimaging allows visualization of the ultrastructure ofthe ligament (revealing the proper percentage of ligament to fat and muscle). Enlargement of the lig-ament compresses these fat/muscle bundles. En-largement also lls the normal anterior space betweenthe suspensory and MTIII and changes the contour ofthe plantar border. Cross-sectional and longitudinalviews need to be compared to elucidate ber densityand ber pattern. The axial aspects of the metatarsalbones can be fully elucidated for the proverbial \"blind\"splint, utilizing ultrasound and its ability to elucidatebone surface detail. The distal metatarsal region willbe covered in the next section. 13. Combined Imaging of the Digital Tendon Sheath/ Metatarsophalangeal Joint Complex This is another very complex region and a very common source of lameness. Clinical signs canoverlap between the joint and tendon sheath, so bothare imaged simultaneously. Radiographs of the DPMLO,flexed lateral, and flexed DP views. Sonography isa very good tool for evaluating articular cartilage, subchondral bone, and joint margins. This shouldbe done in both standing and flexed positions toexpose more articular surface. Continuing with ul-trasound of the metatarsophalangeal joint compo-nents are the supercial and deep components ofthe medial and lateral collateral ligaments andcollateral sesamoidean ligaments. straight, and alsopart the complete metatarsophalangeal joint ul-trasound survey. The digital tendon sheath the of lesions within thesestructures, highlighting scar tissue. Dynamic flex-ing imaging elucidates the tissue relationships be-tween these structures. For example, many horseswith chronic digital tendon conditions will havethickening and adhesions involving plantar -brocartilage orientationallow \"symmetrical\" imaging to dene the mannicaflexorum brocartilagelayer of the SDFT, the plantar annular ligamentattachments on the sesamoid bones, and the bordersof the SDFT.

Combined Imaging of the Pastern and Foot The crossover of clinical signs and diagnostic anal-gesia direct us toward imaging the pastern and footsimultaneously. When radiographing this region,pull the shoe and thoroughly clean the foot prior toimaging. The best image possible should be ob-tained. The author's practice usually includes lat-eral, DPLMO, DP, and DPMLO views of the regionand then performs views with the horse standing onan enclosed dorso the pastern shouldstart the base of the sesamoid bones and (plantar band interphalangeal(PIP) recesses, and associated bone surfaces.Always perform standard and ACUST imaging, asACUST imaging will allow more nite denition oflesions and their chronicity.

Hind feet usually havelower heel angles, allowing for optimal imaging. Thissonographic survey should be performed in a normalstance, standing on a reverse wedge block, and thenflexed to access through the frog tissues. Just prior toscanning through the frog, use a broad sharp hoofknife to pare down to a softer and smoother layer foroptimal imaging. In regions of the country wherehorses have very dry and hard feet, the foot may needto be bandaged overnight with a water-soaked wrap tosoften the tissues. MRI allows superior elucidation oftissues in this region, but a combination of radiogra-phy and a sonographic survey can diagnose the major-ity of issues. These basic imaging tools should befully utilized before proceeding to advanced imaging. 15. Treatment, Rehabilitation, and Patient Management Once a patient has been diagnosed, proceed to de- veloping a plan for treatment, rehabilitation (whenapplicable), and case management. Obviously, it isimpossible to discuss all treatment and rehabilita-tion avenues for all the different hind-limb condi-tions, so this portion will be discussed primarily ingeneralities. Treatment is surgical, medical, or acombination of the two. If a patient has multipleproblems that need to be managed, it may be bestnot to treat everything at once. This also dependson the mindset of the client, but if treatments aredivided up, it allows the practitioner to discern which help most. Response to treatment and theduration of response can help conrm a diagnosisand aid in prognosis. There are a wide variety of surgical procedures that involve structures of the hindlimb. The stifleis an interesting area surgically, in that it is notuncommon to perform arthroscopy for diagnostic,prognostic, and therapeutic reasons simultaneously.Another interesting area surgically is the proximalsuspensory region. Surgeons seem to be split ontheir recommendations toward fasciotomy, neurec-tomy of the deep branch of the lateral plantar nerve,or a combination of the two. The nal region tobe discussed from a surgical perspective is the digi-tal tendon sheath. The author has seen the major-ity of veterinarians treat the digital tendon sheathby intrasynovial injection, almost always withoutproper imaging. Most would respond favorably,for variable periods of time, whereupon they wouldperform repeat injections. Eventually, many ofthese become signicant chronic proliferative re- strictive tenosynovitis cases. Many of these casesare then referred for tenoscopic surgery, most be-yond the point that surgery is of much benet. By performing complete sonographic surveys of theregion, diagnosing the reasons for inflammation,and referring for early surgical intervention (whenwarranted), administering post-surgical intrasyno-vial medication (primarily autologous products) andsensible rehabilitation, the chronic restrictive teno-synovitis sequela can be avoided. Medical treatment has evolved signicantly over time, especially regarding joints/tendon sheaths andsoft tissue. Intrasynovial hyaluronic acid and ste-roids are still used, but more and more frequentlyautologous treatments like interleukin receptor antag-onist protein, platelet-rich plasma, and in more severecases, stem cells are being used. Performance medi-cation rules have driven this to a certain degree, espe-cially in the racing industry, but a huge side benet isthat these products are much better for long-term jointand tendon sheath health. Another category of prod-ucts that have become very useful in treating chronicjoint issues are the polyacrylamide gels. These drugsneed more research, but are proven disease-modifyingosteoarthritis drugs. 6 The author nds the best approach for most liga- ment and tendon injuries is ultrasound-guided in-tralesional injection of regenerative medicine. Theauthor primarily uses an extracellular matrix prod-uct, but uses stem cells (both adipose and bone mar-row derived) and platelet-rich plasma as well. Incorporation of treatments with medical devices such as extracorporeal shockwave therapy, laser,and functional electrical stimulation, have been ofsignicant benet in treating a wide variety of con-ditions. There are many other modalities availableto the equine practitioner (i.e., Pulsed Electromag-netic Field therapy and Vibration plates) and more AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 337IN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNresearch needs to be performed to demonstrate ben- ets and develop optimal protocols for their use. Rehabilitation is not required for all cases, but when required, it is as important as treatment.Controlled exercise is the core of the author's reha-bilitation program, the preferred method being theAquatread (underwater treadmill). The water sig-nicantly decreases limb load, but the resistanceof the water and the additional current jets, allowincreased effort. The work is all straight line, sothere are no torque stresses to aggravate asymmet-rical injuries. Depending on the injury, low-gradetorque stresses are incorporated later with circularmechanical exerciser activity. At some point, pa-tients need to be transitioned to work under tack,and this is often a critical time. Proper shoeing/trimming and adapting to specic biomechanical re-quirements is important throughout rehabilitation.Optimal riding surfaces are another factor to con-sider. Each case is different and needs to be handtailored and monitored during the rehabilitationprocess. Management of a patient in the future isan important part of the veterinarian-client rela-tionship and demonstrates a practitioner's willing-ness to be part of a team approach. Depending onthe condition/injury, help advise the horse ownerand/or trainer on how to best manage the horse forthe future (training/competition schedules, altera-tions in how a horse is ridden, periodic clinical ex-aminations and treatments, etc.). 16. Conclusion Lameness diagnosis should be based upon a very thor-ough clinical examination of the \"whole horse\" usingan intimate knowledge of anatomy and functionalanatomy toward \"localization\" of areas of interest.Sometimes further localization is needed through\"Diagnostic Analgesia .\" Then proceed Sur-veys\" and Radiography . surveys also require an intimate knowledge of anat-omy. \"Anatomy\" is at the center of all of lamenessdiagnostics. Treatment should require a diagnosisunless response to treatment is being used diagnosti-cally. When required, rehabilitation is as important as treatment, and controlled exercise is the core of rehabilitation. As practitioners, \" patient manage- ment \" is an important service provided to clients, dem- onstrating veterinary teamwork.

Introduction In sport horses, back and neck problems have been taken more into account in the diagnosis of counter-performance and potential discomfort. The \"painin the rear\" has been part of the practitioner assess-ment, but still remains in a grey area in terms ofnal and precise diagnosis, and therefore treatmentoptions. Traditionally, discomfort in the low back and pel- vis has been considered as compensatory from hind-limb lameness problems. Nowadays we know that axial issues can be a primary source of discomfort or pain, and the goal ofthis paper is to remain focused on primary issues ofthe lower back (caudal to the thoracolumbar junc-tion) and pelvis, with their clinical presentation, andpotential treatments. 2. Clinical Exam of the Lower Back and Pelvis This exam includes a thorough observation andphysical palpation on a standing horse, and then aseries of tests to evaluate the lower back movementwith or without a rider. The physical exam should take place in a quiet stall or room, and includes a careful palpation of theneck, withers, thoracic spines, and lumbar on the more caudal aspect of theback, the practitioner should pay particular atten- tion to: Conformation: posture of hind limbs Muscles: symmetry Lower-limb ndings such as joint distension, soft-tissue swelling, and weight-bearing ab-normalities or disorders This exam can be completed by looking from the top down, or the opposite. All the ndings should bereported carefully in order to do an objective followup. It is also important to develop a timeline forrehabilitation, with or without medical treatments,in order to get an idea of the condition improvementor deterioration. 4-6 Palpation is the next step, with appreciation of fas- cia/muscle tension, soreness, abnormal heat, or con-tractures. Mobilization by segments of the lowerback and pelvis will give an idea of the range of motionof the thoracic, thoraco-lumbar junction, and lumbarvertebras. This part includes movements and tests ofthe fore and hind limbs. These are mobilization testsof distal and upper joints of the four limbs, in order toevaluate range of motion and pain to compression,flexion, or extension of the segments. After exercise, and in order to assess deeper source of pain specic to the pelvic area, the trans- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 339IN-DEPTH: HIND LEG palpation of the caudal lumbar area, psoas muscles, pelvic bones, and other structures is part ofa full evaluation. 5 3. Dynamic Exam The dynamic exam should be done without any tackin order to see spontaneous movement of each partof the lower back. This exam begins with a horsewalking on a straight line, and then on a gure 8.This allows the practitioner to check normal sym-metry of the gait, and the way the horse can bend onboth sides. At the trot, the horse should show a good latero- flexion of the thoracic part, and a nice axial move-ment of the pelvis. Restriction of motion of somespecic part should be noted by the practitioner. At the canter on a lunge line, the horse should bend both ways and progressively show a symmetricand top-line range of motion and dissociation of hindlimbs on both reins. Changing the back and pelvis motion can be ini- tiated with a couple of tests that have interest topromote a defect of motion or gait asymmetry: Surcingle test: A surcingle is placed on the horse and tightened and the horse canters on acircle. If the horse decreases immediately itsgait, get stiff in his top line and shows a poorpelvis flexion, or bucks, the test is consideredas positive. 4 Under saddle evaluation: At the trot in both directions on circles of various diameters tosee and assess the natural bending of the horse.The rider is asked to do circles and a gure 8while posting on the correct and incorrect diag-onal on both reins. The rider sitting on the correct diagonal will over- weight the inside hind limb, therefore helping withthe diagnosis of overloading anatomical structureson the same limb (e.g., suspensory apparatus, stifle,sacroiliac joints), and promoting either a lamenessor shorter gait (decrease load phase of the stride). When cantering, the rider is asked to show vari- ous transitions and change of lead to see how thedissociation and collection of the hind limb is ac-cepted by the horse. Any gait asymmetry or defectof collection, lead change, or uneven canter is notedas a potential discomfort. The last step is to dis-cuss the ndings with professional riders and watchthe horse in competition. This can also be donethrough videos in order to see related disciplinecounter-performance issues. 7-9 Imaging Different imaging techniques have been developedto diagnose back problems including bone scintigra-phy, radiography, and more recently since late1990s, ultrasound examination. Upon the different structures of interest in- volved in this topic, the clinical presentation, theimaging of choice, and the potential treatments will be described. All the ultrasound-guided needle placement pre- sented in the treatment paragraph are made witha large convex probe 60 mm wide, and 2.5 MHzfrequency. The transrectal pelvis imaging has been done using a linear transrectal probe of 7.5 MHz frequency. 11 4. Potential Sources of Pain in the Lower Back and Pelvis Epaxial Joint Disease of the Lumbar Facets Clinical Presentation The longissimus and gluteus muscles are often sore and tight when palpated The horse may walk and jog with hind limbs in abduction There may be poor low-back longitudinal flex- ion or extension (since lateroflexion is biome-chanically poor in this area) Potential symmetric or asymmetric amyotro- phy of the epaxial dorsal muscles and middlegluteus mm may be appreciated On circles, the horse may tend to have his hind quarters shifted to the inside and drag the toesof his hind limbs Flexions of both hind legs are normally nega- tive; however, the horse may have restrictedrange of motion in the axial movement of thelower back. 4,6,9 Imaging Radiographic examination may evaluation ofthe lumbar facets from T18/L1 to L5 (dependentupon width of muscles in this caudal part of theback). Facet remodeling and foramen size at thislevel can be assessed. Ultrasound (US) imaging is interesting for its lower cost and portability. The parasagittal imag-ing can help to detect local epaxial joint remodelingand any irregular surface of the vertebrae body. 11 When active, a bone scan would normally show IRU at the level of the facet joints, but this canalso be confused with ventral spinous processesimpingement. 7 Treatment Options With US guided injections it is now possible to tar- get the affected joints with a parasagittal approach.The probe is perpendicular to the main axis and theneedle is placed between the probe and the spinousprocess on the left and right side (both sides areusually injected at level of facet remodeling) 12,13 (Fig. 1, A and B). Most of the muscle spasm affecting the same segment is treated with mesotherapy or local physio-therapy. This can include local shock wave, thera-peutic ultrasound, laser, or other alternativemedicine. 4,5,12 340 2019 /H11408Vol. /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWN5. Sacroiliac Joint Disease Clinical Presentation The horse with sacroiliac pain tends to have a pos- ture with it's hind limbs in adduction and they areoften willing to lean with their hind quarters againstthe wall of the stall. Their psoas might be con-tracted and sore, which brings tight gait is short, with a poor cranial and caudal phase of the stride of both hinds, with more adduc-tion. The horse seems to walk on a single line withit's hind feet. 8When only one side is affected the horse may show more clinical sign of lameness in- stead of bilateral \"short\" gait. Local blocks have been described but can enhance hind-limb weakness or paresis and therefore shouldbe avoided. Imaging Nuclear scan is the preferred imaging where theIRU may be seen in the parasagittal aspect of thetop line. Most of the views of interest are madecaudolaterally from the main axis of the lower back. Ultrasound protocols using the dorsal and trans- rectal examination have been recently publishedand allow the practitioner to have a portable devicethat will provide information with regard to theshape, size, and joint margins. These ndings aremost of the time signicant, the absence of ultra-sound ndings could be considered as a false nega-tive if there is a \"positive\" bone scan. 11 Treatment Cranial Approach. This approach can be done by moving the probe from the lumbar cranial to caudalpart of the pelvis, on a parallel line approximately 8cm from the midline, until the edge of the ilium wingis seen. The cranial part of the probe is gently lifted in order to maintain the previous image and see thepenetration angle of the needle. Anatomically, thesacroiliac joint is under this wing, and the probe isplaced in order to guide the needle cranially to the edge of the ilium and should penetrate ventrallyand caudally as close as possible from the sacroiliacand intertransverse lumbosacral area. 14The nee - dle has to contact bone before injecting. Note thatthis technique is half \"blind\" since the ilium shaftwill limit the beam penetration and the tip of theneedle will not be seen (Fig. 2). Caudal Approach. By moving the probe on a longitudinal axis, caudally from the ilium wing tothe sacrum, the image will show the junction be-tween the caudal shaft of ilium wing and the sa-crum (Fig. 3). The needle is inserted caudally tothe probe with a 30/45-degree angle and pene-trates in a vertical line going through the caudaledge of the ilium wing and its intersection withthe sacrum and comes to contact bone at the verycaudal edge of the ilium shaft 14(Fig. 3). 6. Lumbosacral Pain Clinical Presentation The lumbosacral space involves essentially the discs and the surrounding structures at the level of L5, L6,and S1. This area differential diagnosis may in- Fig. 1. A, Epaxial facet joint injection site; and B, example of facet remodeling as seen using ultrasound (2 white arrows). Fig. 2. Ultrasound image with placement of a needle cranially to the cranial ilium border to inject the sacroiliac joint. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H114082019 lumbosacral or local soft tissues(ventral, dorsal intervertebral ligaments). Mostof the other structures that might be involved aredifcult to evaluate both clinically or usingimaging. The manipulation of the pelvis on a standing horse is restricted, so the passive flexion of hindlimbs might be difcult to perform. 3-6 The horse will have difculty rotating his pelvis axially and this might be difcult to differentiatefrom caudal facet epaxial joint pain (L1 to L6).The horse tends to walk and trot with signicantabduction of his hind limbs. If other structures likesacroiliac joint are involved, the adduction maypredominate. 8 If the horse at canter has a poor range of flexion/ collection then the rider will feel a lack of push, andthe canter can be \"stabby,\" with difculty changing leads at the canter. On the lunge line these horses often counter can- ter or change leads only behind. When dynamic flexions of hind limbs are possible, it is difcult to elevate the limb signicantly, butmost of these horses flex sound (independent ofother distal limb issues). Imaging The bone scan does not seem to be the imaging ofchoice because of the involvement of soft tissue, andthe anatomical position of that joint \"hidden\" by theilium wing. Radiographs to evaluate the lumbosacral space must be done under general anesthesia with thehorse in dorsal recumbency. The best technique remains the transrectal ultra- sound exam. This technique is able to show thelumbosacral and L5/L6 disc easily, the intertrans-verse joints, the transverse processes, the sciaticroots, the ventral blood vessels, and the ventral lon-gitudinal ligament. 11,15 Treatment Similar to the cranial approach of the sacroiliacjoint, the needle is placed parallel to the midlineat the level of the last 2 lumbar spinous processes.The probe is parallel to the midline (Fig. 4, A andB). The needle is then guided under the iliumwing. The rst part is seen on the screen (left pic-ture) and disappears under the ilium shaft. Le-sions associated may involve transverse spineskissing lesions, nerve root inflammation, radiculitis,or just deep muscle pain. 11,12 7. Psoas Pain Clinical Presentation The psoas tension is assessed by transrectal palpa- tion. It is a clinical nding similar to longissimus Fig. 3.

The practitio- ner can follow the caudal part of the muscle (startingat level of L3/L4 to its insertion on the cranial aspectof the ilium wing). Imaging There is no signicant apartfrom evaluating the ilio-psoas tendon abaxial edge of the ilium body usingultrasound. Treatment The aim is to inject over the transverse processesparasagittal to the lumbar spines. The author usesa 15-cm/20-G needle, which can also be ultrasoundguided in order to inject in between transverse pro-cesses (the convex probe is placed parallel to themain vertebral axis; Fig. 5). 8. Ilium Wing/Pelvis Fracture Clinical Presentation When acute, the horse presents a signicant lameness from 3/5 (American Association of Equine Practitio-ners scale) nonweight bearing. Any movements ofthe affected-sided limb are difcult and sometimesthey are nearly impossible to pick up. There is astrong spasm of the gluteus medius, and in transrectalpalpation, even if the fracture cannot be felt consis-tently, there is a b ilateral psoas muscle tension and soreness. 16Most of these horses barely move at the walk and position the opposite side limb in adduction. Imaging The bone scan is always highly relevant with a veryfocal IRU on the site of fracture. More recently, astudy from Whitcomb et al 16,21reveals that most of the fractures appear on the ileal wing or rim of the coxo-femoral joint acetabulum.17,21 The ultrasound diagnosis is quite reliable for the ileal wing or body fracture, or tuber ischiae, tubercoxae fragmentation, or acetabular rim fracture.These last two types of fractures show mostly avul-sion with local muscles insertion (respectively in-volving semi-membranous and tensor fascia latamuscles, respectively). 17,18Treatment The follow up is based on stabilization of the pelvisand therefore connement in a stall. Different sys-tems of cross ties have been described to prevent thehorse from lying down and creating more damage tothe fractured area. 19 The healing period is always a minimum of 6 to 12 weeks depending upon site and gravity of fracture. 9. Hip Joint Disease Clinical Presentation Horses suffering from coxofemoral joint problems are often lame if there is only one limb affected.However, bilateral pain may occur and may mimiclow-back sources of pain such as sacroiliac joint dis-ease. In this eventuality, the horse shows a lack ofpush, a short-strided trot and canter, but may warmup from this discomfort. The hind limbs may travelmore in abduction. 4,6 Imaging For hip joint disease diagnosis, the bone scan hasbeen a signicant help on horses that do not block toany upper limb structures. The ultrasonography is again a good tool to eval- uate the hip joint, local capsule distension, and evenacetabular rim fracture. 19,20Radiographs are lim - ited to smaller-sized equids and foals. X-rays couldalso be done under general anesthesia, but are coun-terindicated in case of a suspicion of fracture sincethe horse will have potential issues to recover andstand up after this procedure. Treatment A couple of articles describe ways to approachthe joint using ultrasound guidance. The blindtechnique is not as accurate and therefore is notrecommended. Injection of corticosteroids or re-generative products should be considered uponndings and chronicity. 21 10. Trochanteric Bursa\u2014Third Trochanter Fracture The trochanteric bursa (also mentioned as \"whorl- bone\") is on the caudal aspect of the greater trochan- Fig. 5.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 343IN-DEPTH: HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNter of the femur (Fig. 6) and can be the cause of a moderate 1 to 2/5 lameness.7The diagnosis is uncommon, and seems to affect standardbreds and warmbloods more commonly. For a third trochanter fracture, there are similar clinical signs of mild lameness, but history oftrauma or fall to the side should be considered anddifferential diagnosis with anything around the hipjoint. This is more common, and local pressure isoften painful. 6,7 Imaging The diagnosis of trochanteric bursitis is rare, a littlemore common is the third trochanter fracture.There is sometimes history of local trauma on thearea, and potential heat or swelling since thesestructures are quite supercial. The imaging ofreference is the bone scan (sometimes an incidentalnding) and ultrasonography. Radiographs can betaken but are more challenging due to the musclemass of the horse. Treatment To\u00b4 t he ta l22have described different techniques of injection of the trochanteric bursa. The one they consider to be optimal recommends putting the hipjoint in light extension with the foot resting in aHickman block. The needle (15-cm/20-G) is in-serted using ultrasonographic guidance. Afteridentifying the most proximal aspect of the cranialpart of the greater trochanter with ultrasonogram,the spinal needle is aimed 1 cm distal to the mostproximal aspect of the cranial part of the greatertrochanter and approximately 1 cm caudal to thecranial most limit of the cranial portion of thegreater trochanter. 22 11. Rehabilitation Program For most of the back and pelvis injections, the followup includes 2 days of hand walking. If the horseshows a signicant amyotrophy, or any side effects, the practitioner should adjust the period of rehabil-itation, and make sure that the horse improves hiscore before getting back to light work and ridingexercise. 5 Alternative Treatments With these medical treatments, the author recom-mends combining rehabilitation with some comple-mentary treatments such as massage, physiotherapy,external shockwave treatments, chiropractic, oracupuncture. 12. Conclusion Low-back and pelvic pain may be the source of anacute lameness when it involves fracture or poten-tial hip pain, but more commonly is a reason formild discomfort and progressive poor performancewhen dealing with more chronic issues in sporthorses. A careful differential diagnosis starting with a thorough clinical evaluation remains paramount. The outstanding progress in recent imaging al- lows us to be more sp ecic once an area of interest becomes suspicious. More precise diagnosis al-lows for more targeted treatments, especially withthe improved technique of ultrasound-guidedinjections.

AAEP HIND LEG FROM THE PELVIS DOWNHow to Understand the Clinically Relevant Aspects of Oocyte and Fertilization Katrin Hinrichs, DVM, PhD, DACT Author's address: Departments of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology and Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University,College Station, TX 77843-4466; e-mail: sperm injec- tion (ICSI) followed by in vitro culture of embryos to the blastocyst stage is becoming a commonly usedclinical procedure in equine practice. Initially,ICSI and embryo culture (referred to as in vitro embryo production, or IVP) was aimed at providinga mechanism to produce foals from mares that havepathologies of the tubular tract that prevent embryoproduction or from aged or deceased stallions thatare no longer producing quality semen, and havelimited stores of frozen semen. However, improve-ments in techniques for oocyte recovery, ICSI andembryo culture have resulted in increased efciency(number of blastocysts produced per oocyte recoveryattempt) to the point where in some situations, ICSI is being used clinically to produce foals from fertilemares and stallions. The number of laboratories capable of performing equine ICSI effectively, thatis, producing a clinically meaningful blastocystrate per injected oocyte, has increased in the last5 years, and thus the technique is becoming morewidely available. Establishment of methods forholding immature equine oocytes overnight atroom temperature, before culture, 1have made it possible for oocytes to be recovered by the practi-tioner and then transported overnight to the ICSI laboratory. All of these developments have increased the de- mand for veterinarians in practice to be able tomonitor mares for optimum follicle populations, per-form the oocyte recovery procedure, typically bytransvaginal aspiration(TVA), effectively identify, handle, package, andship oocytes to the ICSI laboratory. When a clienthas these procedures performed with a mare or stal-lion, the veterinarian also serves to explain to theowner the physiology behind the procedures, and tointerpret the results of the in vitro maturation, ICSI, and embryo culture that is performed. The purpose of this how-to paper is to serve as a reminder of the events of follicle growth, oocyte mat-uration, fertilization, and early embryo developmentas they relate to clinical oocyte recovery and ICSI.This basic biology also sets the stage for more com-plete understanding of the techniques presented inthe rest of this session on equine assisted reproduc-tive technologies (ART). 2. Follicle Growth Equine veterinarians are fortunate to have themeans (transrectal ultrasonography) and the de-mand (breeding management of mares being insem- 346 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES NOTESinated with valuable semen) to perform frequent evaluations of follicle development in the mare.Thus, most equine veterinarians are familiar withthe basic ovarian changes seen on ultrasonogra-phy throughout the estrus cycle. In general terms,these can be described as waves of follicle growththat occur over the cycle. Mares typically have onlyone follicle wave through the cycle, although about30% of mares have an additional follicle wave indiestrus. 2If a follicle wave occurs in diestrus, a cohort of follicles grow to a diameter of /H1101120 mm, then the follicles regress; they eventually becomeatretic (die). Alternatively, during diestrus, folli-cles can grow to 10-20 mm and then become static,staying this size over the entire cycle. 2During es - trus, as follicles in a growing wave reach about20-25 mm diameter, one follicle deviates from therest, and goes on to grow to a diameter of /H1101140 mm, becoming the dominant preovulatory follicle. Theremaining follicles growth and from preovulatory follicle occurs about 36-42 hours afterthe LH stimulus is received by the follicle. Logically, as has been shown in other species, it could be thought that the best time to recoveroocytes for ICSI use would be as follicle waves aregrowing, to ensure that oocytes are collected fromhealthy, viable follicles. However, this is not thecase in the horse, as it is complicated by severalfactors: 1. In young growing follicles, the oocyte can be considered to be \"juvenile\"\u2014it does not havethe competence to complete meiosis (i.e., itlacks meiotic competence) or to make a normalembryo (it lacks developmental competence). 2. In horses, it appears that this \"juvenile\" period of the oocyte lasts until the growing folliclereaches about 20 mm in diameter. Oocytesrecovered from viable growing follicles lessthan 20 mm in diameter have a low maturationrate when cultured in vitro . 3 3. As a follicle starts to become atretic, the oocyte within the follicle actually gains meiotic com-petence. 4Whether it gains developmental competence (has a greater ability to make a normal embryo after fertilization) is unclear,but these oocytes are capable of making blas-tocysts after fertilization at rates at least equalto that for competent oocytes from viablefollicles. 5 Because of these factors, recovery of oocytes inmares from growing follicles /H1102120 mm in diameter will provide oocytes that may not mature in vitrobecause they are juvenile. In contrast, recovery of oocytes from follicles that are undergoing regres-sion/atresia, even in follicles /H1102120 mm, may provide oocytes that have a high maturation rate in vitro and can yield blastocysts. There is evidence of em-bryo production from oocytes recovered from folli-cles/H1102110 mm diameter. Because individual mares have different patterns of follicle development, atany one examination, a specic visualized folliclecould be growing, static, or regressing. In evaluating factors associated with timing of oocyte collection that could be related to enhancedperformance of the oocytes in an IVP system, fewmeaningful associations have been found. There issome evidence that oocytes recovered from subordi-nate follicles 24 hours after gonadotropin stimula-tion, at the time that a dominant preovulatoryfollicle is being aspirated for recovery of a matureoocyte (see below), appear to have slightly increasedrates of in vitro maturation and blastocyst formation after ICSI compared to oocytes recovered from sub-ordinate from mares practice also nd that the number is lower when subordinate folliclesare aspirated during estrus, vs aspiration of imma-ture follicles in diestrus, so the blastocyst productionper aspiration is not different. Currently, there isno time of the cycle that is known to be the \"best\" forrecovering oocytes for in vitro embryo production. Many people want to avoid large follicles or corporahemorrhagica, as they make the ovary difcult tomanipulate. In addition, people may wish not to, orcannot, perform the monitoring and timing neededfor aspiration of a dominant stimulated follicle.In these cases, oocyte recovery for collection of im-mature oocytes is done during diestrus. Otherslike the chance to recover an in vivo -matured oocyte (which typically has a higher potential to form ablastocyst after ICSI) from the dominant stimulatedfollicle, as well as immature oocytes from the subor-dinate follicles, and so perform oocyte gonadotropin stimulationof the dominant preovulatory follicle. A related aspect of this is the influence of follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) on follicle aspiration.The author is often asked whether administeringFSH to a mare would increase the number of folliclesavailable for aspiration. While it appears no onehas yet evaluated this, theoretically it should not.In the mare, the follicle does not appear to be re-sponsive to gonadotropins until it is over 15 mm indiameter. This is visible in anestrus, when gonad-otropin levels are low, as follicles will grow to about15 mm, then regress. Additionally, during develop-ment of superovulation regimens in the mare, ad-ministration of FSH was relatively ineffectiveunless given to mares when the largest follicle wasat least /H1101120 mm. Since for TVA, the oocyte recov- ery rate decreases as follicle diameter increases, theoptimum diameter follicle for TVA is /H1102120 mm. Thus, in the mare, administration of FSH theoreti- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 347HOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIEScally will only make the follicles already visible on the ovary grow larger, it will not aid in increasingthe number of follicles available for TVA. However,this needs to be conrmed by an actual study. 3. Oocyte Maturation In the above discussion, the term \"oocyte matura-tion\" was used. When performing IVP, \"oocytematuration\" refers to nuclear maturation, or thestage of meiosis of the oocyte. A mature oocyte is inmetaphase II (MII) of meiosis, the stage at which itis ovulated and can be fertilized. An oocyte at anearlier stage of meiosis is an immature oocyte. The oocyte enters meiosis when the follicles are formed, around the time the lly is born. Withinthe developing oocyte's nucleus, the chromosomesreplicate and homologous chromosomes nd eachother and cross over. It is at this stage of meiosis,prophase, that the oocyte is arrested around thetime of birth. In this oocyte, the nucleus is intact.Early scientists evaluating these oocytes saw thenucleus and thought maybe this was the source ofthe generating power of the oocyte; they called thenucleus the \"germinal vesicle;\" and the Thus, mei- osis are termed \"germinal vesicle-stage oocytes.\"This indicates that they have an intact nucleus.They are also appropriately called immatureoocytes. The oocyte remains in prophase of meiosis (at the germinal vesicle stage) through the years of waitinginside a primordial follicle, for the months duringwhich the primordial follicle grows through the dif-ferent stages of follicle growth to nally form anantrum, and the weeks during which the antralfollicle grows larger as part of a follicle wave. If theoocyte is lucky enough to nd itself in a follicleselected to become the dominant preovulatory folli-cle, it remains in prophase of meiosis during growthof this follicle to ovulatory size. It is only when thedominant preovulatory follicle has received the ovu-latory LH stimulus, ovulation,that the oocyte within the dominant preovulatoryfollicle resumes meiosis and progresses from pro-phase, through metaphase I, and reaches MII,where it is again arrested. This resumption of mei-osis is exquisitely timed to occur so that at ovulation,a perfect MII (mature) oocyte is released into theoviduct for fertilization. In the horse, the dominant preovulatory follicle is the only follicle with the capacity to respond to LH,and only the oocyte within the dominant, LH-stim-ulated follicle resumes meiosis and progresses toMII. The oocytes in all other follicles stay in pro-phase, even as the follicles eventually regress.Thus, oocytes recovered from essentially any folliclethat is NOT the dominant stimulated follicle will beimmature (in the germinal-vesicle stage). To provide mature (MII) oocytes for ICSI, there two possible the dom-inant preovulatory follicle immediately before itovulates (typically done by timing aspiration after administration of gonadotropins) to recover the in vivo-matured oocyte, or B) aspirate immature oocytes can be called \"immature\" follicles),and stimulate these oocytes to mature in vitro . Of these two options, the latter has been shown to bepreferable for equine ICSI programs, because of thehigh number of immature follicles, and thus thenumber of oocytes, available at any one aspirationattempt. Even though only about 50% of theoocytes recovered from immature follicles will ma-ture when placed into in vitro culture, this still provides more MII oocytes for ICSI, and more blas-tocysts, than does one dominant stim-ulated follicle. 6Owners often ask, \"Why do only 50% of recovered immature oocytes mature in cul- ture?\" It should be remembered that some of theseoocytes may have been recovered from young grow-ing follicles, and may be too juvenile to be able tomature, and some may have been recovered fromfollicles so far into atresia that the oocyte isnonviable. In vitro maturation is performed by putting the immature oocytes into culture in the presence ofgonadotropins. The oocytes will actually start tomature in any culture system, because they haveleft the suppressive environment of the follicle, LH or a combination, ortheir analogs) are needed to help them mature nor-mally. During maturation, the immature oocytesbreak down their nuclear membrane, condense thechromosomes on a metaphase plate (metaphase I),then divide and cast out half of these chromosomeswith a minimum of cytoplasm as a tiny daughter cell(polar body), and immediately reform the remainingcondensed chromosomes on another metaphaseplate (MII), and arrest. The polar body that is castout as the oocyte completes the rst meiotic divisionis visible under a microscope and serves as an indi-cator that the oocyte is at MII and thus mature. Another aspect of the oocyte that is of utmost importance, but is poorly understood, is \"cytoplas-mic maturation,\" i.e., the changes that the oocyte'scytoplasm undergoes to prepare it to make a normalembryo after fertilization. This refers to the samething as does \"developmental competence.\" The per-fect oocyte, that is, in vivo -matured oocyte re- leased from the follicle at ovulation, has optimalability to make a normal embryo (optimal develop-mental competence/cytoplasmic maturation). Thiscompetence is gained by the oocyte slowly duringfollicle growth and is nalized during preovulatoryfollicle growth, during which time all the proteins,fats, RNAs, and pathway components needed for theoocyte to respond to fertilization, cleave, and grow toabout the 8-cell stage are acquired and stored withinthe cytoplasm. When oocytes are recovered fromimmature follicles, the oocytes may not have had thetime and stimulation to become fully developmen-tally competent (i.e., may not be cytoplasmically ma- 348 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIESture). Gonadotropins and other compounds in the maturation medium are known to aid the oocyte ingaining developmental competence during in vitro maturation, but this is still an imperfect system.Thus, an oocyte can be recovered from an immaturefollicle that has meiotic competence (it reaches MIIafter in vitro maturation), but does not have devel- opmental competence (it does not form a normalembryo after fertilization). Interestingly, in the author's laboratory, there is little difference in in vitro embryo production after ICSI between MII oocytes recovered from immaturefollicles and matured in vitro (/H1101130% blastocysts). This small difference is seen in the clinical data inthe author's practice as well. The question here is,why is the blastocyst rate so low for the in vivo-matured oocytes? These are oocytes with optimaldevelopmental competence, and the blastocyst rateshould be /H1102270%, the rate seen for embryo develop- ment in vivo . One paper did report a ICSI of in vivo -matured oocytes, 7but even the rst author of this paper nds that in his clinical work the blastocyst rate after ICSI of invivo-matured oocytes is much lower, close to oocytes (R. Foss, personal commu- nication, 2017). suggests that there is a majorlimitation of our IVP system in supporting the fullcompetence of in vivo -matured oocytes. 4. Fertilization and Early Embryo Development In vivo , the MII oocyte exits the follicle at ovulation, and is picked up by the oviduct. Sperm are hope-fully waiting in the oviduct, where they have become\"capacitated,\" that is, they have gained the ability torespond appropriately to an oocyte and fertilize it.The capacitated sperm react to the oocyte and/or itssurrounding cells (the cumulus cells) and undergothe acrosome reaction, then penetrate through thezona pellucida, and come to lie adjacent to the oocyteplasma membrane. The sperm and oocyte plasmamembranes bind and then fuse, and the contents ofthe sperm mix with the cytoplasm of the oocyte.This delivers not only the sperm nucleus to theoocyte, but also crucial factors that are carried inthe sperm cytoplasm. These factors signal theoocyte to \"activate\"\u2014to develop into an embryo. Activation entails completion of meiosis by theoocyte, decondensation of the male and female chro-mosomes (forming the male and female pronuclei inwhich the chromosomes replicate), condensation ofthe male and female chromosomes onto a mitoticmetaphase plate, and division of the oocyte into twocells, forming a 2-cell embryo. When ICSI is performed, several aspects of this progression are altered. Mature oocytes can be se-lected after in vitro maturation culture, based on the presence of a polar body. However, the cytoplasmicmaturation status of these oocytes is unknown.A sperm is then selected that is neither capacitatednor acrosome reacted. To ensure that the contents of the sperm will mix with the cytoplasm of theoocyte when it is injected, the sperm's plasma mem-brane is ruptured when it is selected within thesmall sperm droplet on the ICSI dish. Because thisresults in communication of the sperm cytoplasmwith the external media, the ionic balance withinthe sperm cytoplasm is immediately lost, and thesperm becomes immotile. For this reason, the rup-ture of the sperm membrane before ICSI is alsotermed \"immobilization\" of the sperm. For the immobilization and microinjection, either conventional manipulation (a sharp micropipette) orpiezo-driven microinjection (a blunt micropipettethat is driven forward by minute vibrations from apiezoelectric unit) can be used. The author's labo-ratory recently reported that these two techniquesprovided a similar rate of blastocyst production inthe horse, but that embryos produced by conven-tional micromanipulation underwent a delay in de-velopment of pronuclei after sperm injection, andwere lower quality at the blastocyst stage. 8Thus, the technique used for micromanipulation can affect embryo development. After ICSI, the injected oocyte is monitored to determine if it cleaves. Failure of the oocyte tocleave could be related to the oocyte\u2014lack of cyto-plasmic maturation making it unresponsive to thesperm's signal; to the sperm\u2014poor quality or lowamounts of activating factors either intrinsic to thatstallion or related to the processing the sperm hasundergone; to the ICSI procedure\u2014inadequate rup-turing of the sperm plasma membrane during im-mobilization, or of the oocyte plasma membraneduring injection; or to the culture environment inwhich the injected oocyte is placed after ICSI. On top of these variables, there is the overarching question of: Is there a sperm selection mechanismin vivo bypassed when the operator chooses which sperm to inject, which is important to the normalityof the embryo or offspring? This question currentlyhas no answer. Studies in humans have found thatchildren born after ICSI do have increased incidenceof some disorders, including imprinting disordersand autism, but whether this is due to the ICSIprocedure, or due to the population of people under-going ICSI, is controversial. There are a myriad ofmethods proposed in humans to allow selection of\"better\" sperm for ICSI, but a 2014 meta-analysisconcluded that there is not enough evidence to sup-port that any of them actually give better results. 9 Factors affecting oocyte cytoplasmic maturation, and \"tness\" of sperm for fertilization after ICSI, arecurrently major areas of research interest in hu-mans and in other mammals, both domestic andnondomestic. The horse may serve as an excellentmodel for human ICSI, as it is one of the few speciesbesides humans in which ICSI, both with conven-tional (as typically used in human ART) and withpiezo-driven microinjection, is successful in produc-ing a reasonable rate of transferrable embryos.

Introduction The early 2000s represented an exciting decade in equine reproduction with increased investigationand subsequent implementation of new proceduresinvolving a variety of assisted reproductive tech-niques (ARTs), not yet utilized commonly in thehorse. Subsequently, the following decade has fo-cused on ne tuning these procedures. Reduction incosts and improving efciency has allowed more pri- vate practices the ability to implement many ofthese procedures in both hospital or eld scenarios.These ART opportunities can include removal ofovaries from a client's deceased mare for gameterescue to establishing a private practice-based in-tracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) laboratory.Undoubtedly the costs and personnel involved withthe more advanced procedures and laboratory maylimit the execution for many practitioners, but avariety of techniques that can be applied in a privatepractice setting remain available and are of interestto horse breeders. This article describes the neces-sary equipment, personnel, and techniques for prac-titioners interested in harvesting oocytes from boththe standing/sedated mare and the postmortemscenario.2. Materials and Methods Obtaining Oocytes from the Standing/Sedated Mare There are a variety of reasons for in vitro embryo production in the mare, which have become evenmore popular as new scenarios arise. Some ofthese include infertility (both mares and stallions),the ability to continue reproductive procedures andstore valuable genetics during the \"off-season,\"scheduling conflicts with competition events and tooptimize the use of limited amounts of availablefrozen semen. 1Ovum pick-up (OPU) procedures in women seeking fertility assistance were developedin the early 1980s, which were quickly adopted bythe cattle industry, boasting a /H1102270% oocyte recovery rate per follicle. 2In the mare, a flank approach to collecting maturing oocytes from preovulatory folli-cles stimulated with gonadotropin 36 hours prior, was reported in the late 1980s with a 63%-72%recovery rate. 3,4This procedure is still utilized by some laboratories to collect mature oocytes fromlarge preovulatory follicles in the mare ( /H1102235 mm) to be utilized in oocyte transfer procedures requiringminimal specialized equipment and decreasedamount of time. 5Throughout the 1990s, the devel- opment of a transvaginal approach (TVA) provided a AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 351HOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES NOTESnonsurgical option of obtaining equine oocytes, which was improved even further in 1998 with theimplementation of the double-lumen needle and ac-cessibility to smaller follicle collections. 6-9In gen - eral, most practices offering commercial OPU in themare utilize this approach for both methods of har-vesting equine oocytes: 1) collection of the matur-ing oocyte follicle, or 2)collection of multiple immature oocytes from smallerfollicles along either ovary. Personnel Regardless of the method chosen, it is imperative tohave experienced personnel available to assist withthese procedures to ensure the safety of all humansand animals involved. Many laboratories with ahistory of this practice, report the need of 3-4 peopleto perform these procedures effectively. The rstperson, often the lead veterinarian, will appropri-ately position the ultrasound probe and is responsi-ble for manipulating the ovary per rectum. Thesecond person is responsible for advancing and ma-nipulating the needle (or rapid removal in the eventof an emergency) and simultaneously operates thefoot peddle of the vacuum pump. The third personprovides inflow of media via manual syringe opera-tion and maintains records during the procedure. 5 The author's team also utilizes a fourth memberresponsible for monitoring how the mare is reactingto the procedures. This person keeps an eye onsedation quality, head position in relation to thestock door placement and has been instrumental inan emergency situation, which is especially impor-tant when performing these procedures on valuableclient-owned mares. Medication (Pre, Prior, Post Procedure) Administration of medications for these procedureshave been described with some variability depend-ing on the type of procedure utilized, but is similarin practice. The author's team administers flunixinmeglumine a(300-500 mg, IV) approximately 15 minutes prior to entry into the stocks although some labs administer directly following the conclusion ofthe collection procedure. 5Studies in other species have found compromised fertility with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administered before TVA.It is possible this issue is only a problem with dom-inant stimulated follicles, but could potentially beapplicable to smaller follicle aspiration proceduresas well. 10The author's team has also found admin - istration of acepromazineb(10-20 mg, IM) approxi - mately 15 minutes prior to entry into the stockshelpful in relieving the \"tightness\" associated withthe reproductive tract in some mares; however, itmay increase the risk of pneumovagina. 11 Immediately prior to the aspiration, N-butylsco- polammoniumc(100-150 mg, IV) is administered to aid in relief of rectal contraction during the proce- dure. Additionally, butorphanold(5-10 mg, IV) is administered for both sedative and pain-relievingproperties at this time. Sedation for the procedure is typically dependent upon the individual mare andthe type of procedure being utilized. For shorter(one preovulatory follicle) type collections, xylazinehydrochloride e(150-400 mg, IV) is paired with the butorphanol and can be re-dosed if necessary. For longer (multiple follicle) collections, detomidine hy-drochloride f(5-7 mg, IV) paired with butorphanol is the sedative of choice. Particularly young or ner- vous mares may benet from an initial dose ofdetomidine hydrochloride (2-3 mg, IV) withintheir stall to settle down prior to walking into thestocks and are re-dosed for the aspiration. Theauthor's lab maintains records of each OPU pro-cedure on individual mares to ensure appropriateanalgesic and sedative levels are achieved andadjusted accordingly. With stringent aseptic and sterile technique, the administration of routine antibiotics is typically notincluded in day-to-day OPU procedures. In theevent that a particular mare has struggled with adifcult aspiration or maintains a history of previ-ous bacterial endometritis, ceftiofur crystalline freeacid g(3000-3600 mg, IM) will be administered at the conclusion of the procedure with a second dose administered 4 days (96 hours) later, as per manu-facturer recommendation, to provide a full 10-daycoverage of broad spectrum systemic antimicrobials. Preparation As with any medical procedure, preparation is keyto safety, efciency, and ultimate success. Lab per-sonnel responsible for setup will ensure all equip-ment, supplies, and media that contact the oocyteare prepped and warmed as needed. Open dialogueand consistent communication are important be-tween all parties to ensure the lab receiving theoocytes is prepared for the mare to enter the stocksand for procedures to commence. Once the mare issafely restrained within the stocks, the handler at-taches the halter to cross-ties providing support dur-ing sedation and remains at her head throughoutthe duration of the procedure. The tail is wrappedand secured to the side. An initial cleaning ofthe perineal surface occurs via gloved hand andpovidone-iodine scrub hto allow for clean placement of several 4 /H110034 gauze squares within the posterior ves- tibule for collection of lube or fecal contamination.Any and all manure is removed manually and rectalair may be evacuated at this time via hand assistanceor suction with a dose syringe or equivalent device.The perineum is cleansed more thoroughly with agloved hand, once again utilizing povidone-iodinescrub and warm water. The 4 /H110034s are gently re- moved from the vestibule and examined to identify ifadditional vestibular cleaning may be warranted withrolled cotton and warm water. Typically, a micro-convex or linear ultrasound probe utilized for TVA procedures are encasedwithin a long plastic handle to facilitate the lengthyvaginal vault in the mare (Table 1). These TVA 352 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIEShandles usually have a needle guide along the top and are of varying lengths. Preference for eitherprobe type depends upon the individual user (Fig. 1),but the micro-convex has gained popularity forsmaller follicles and the ability to manipulate theovary to gain access to a greater population at vary-ing angles. In the author's lab, the TVA handle/probe is placed on a cart (Fig. 2) next to the preppedmare encased in a plastic tail-bag to remain cleanwhile the operator introduces the TVA needle (Table2) into the needle guide while wearing a sterilepalpation sleeve. Once placed, the tubing attachedto the needle is secured to both a suction system ileading to a 250 mL sterile plastic container and the apparatus utilized for media inflow by the secondassistant. The TVA probe is removed from theplastic sleeve and nonspermatogenic sterile lube ap-plied to the transducer face. Utilize a clean palpa-tion sleeve to cover the probe at this point, as thereare often more than one OPU procedures scheduledfor the day. Prior to placement in the mare, theneedle is advanced out of the needle guide and flushmedia pushed to prime the needle and tubing, re-ducing the amount of air within the system. The needle is retracted back into the guide and the probeis gently inserted through the vulva to the anteriorvagina, taking care to minimize the amount of airintroduced preventing pneumovagina. The probeis positioned such that it is lateral to the cervix andipsilateral to the ovary being aspirated. The oper-ator removes their sleeved hand from the vagina,applies non-sterile OB lube and replaces rectally tomanipulate the ovary being aspirated such that it isflipped over to rest upon the dorsal aspect of thebroad ligament and gently pulled caudally towardthe ultrasound transducer head against the perito-neal surface of the vaginal wall. This position al-lows for ease in palpating the ovarian surface to notonly identify the follicle of interest but to ensurethere are no other structures in line with the pathof the needle (bowel, oviduct, ovulation fossa, etc.).These and additional ovarian movements duringthe process should be achieved without irritationto the rectal mucosa and the operator should dil-igently check their sleeve at the conclusion of eachprocedure. 11 Dominant/Preovulatory Follicle Collections The advantages and disadvantages of utilizing themare to perform in vivo maturation of an oocyte are discussed elsewhere in this series; however, ease ofTable 1. Currently Available TVA Handles/Probes Extender/Probe Handle II Honda HS-1600V, Honda HS-2200VPGI Exago, EXAPad Customizable Fig. 1. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 353HOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIEScollection makes this procedure appealing to begin- ners just becoming comfortable with the equipmentand gaining condence in skill level. In practice,routine palpation and transrectal ultrasonographyof the mare's reproductive tract to follow her cyclic-ity and identify a dominant follicle is necessary.Once the mare has selected a dominant follicle atleast 33 mm in diameter and demonstrates uterineedema associated with estrus, ovulation inductionagents should be administered. It is important toadminister these when luteinizing hormone recep-tors are ready thus the age of the oocyte is generallyunderstood but not so late that she has advanced herown luteinizing hormone surge. If the follicle doesnot respond to ovulation induction medications, therecovery rate of the oocyte is decreased ( /H1101120%) 12 and the oocyte will likely need in vitro maturation as the cumulus cells will be compact. The author's labtypically administers both human chorionic gonado-tropin and a GnRH analogue (deslorelin acetate,k0.9 mg, IM) at the same time, but variations of administration have been de- scribed. The oocyte collection procedure will thentake place 20-24 hours later or even closer to theprogramed ovulation time, 36-40taking care to avoid natural ovulation. Once the timing is selected, the mare is prepped, ready, and equipment primed, the team is assem-bled to perform the transvaginal aspiration proce- dure. The operator performing the procedure haspositioned the ovary such that the large dominantfollicle is identied via ultrasound and the needle isadvanced with assistance well into the antrum.Immediately upon satisfactory positioning, suctionis initiated (120-150 mm Hg) and amber coloredfollicular fluid collected within the warmed collec-tion bottle. Upon follicular wall collapse, the influxof warmed media begins, utilizing an all-plastic sy-ringe under manual pressure connected to a con-trolled flushing set land bag of prewarmed (37\u00b0C) chosen flush mediamwith the addition of heparin (5-20 IU/mL). The process of suction and influx of fluid generally occurs simultaneously while the op-erator gently massages the follicular wall althoughother labs report lling the follicle back up andflushing out contents individually up to 10 consecu-tive times during follicle massage. 13As the proce - dure fluidtransitions with an influx of hemorrhagic coloredfluid becoming evident. This is due to the neovas-cularization occurring during dominant follicularmaturation and im pending ovulation. Sheets of granulosa cells can often be observed floating throughout the tubing and collection bottle. Oncethe follicle has been thoroughly rinsed and contentscollected, the suction/inflow is ceased and the needlewithdrawn back into the guide. The TVA probe isremoved from the vagina and replaced into the plas-tic sleeve to await cleaning in between mares. Alltubing is disconnected as needed and the cleaning process of the needle and TVA probe initiated almostimmediately upon conclusion of the procedure.Meanwhile, the collection bottle is carefully carriedinto the lab for searching purposes.

Remove all hay andfeed from the stall to allow recovery from sedationwithout the potential for esophageal choke and pro-vide a small re-feeding protocol throughout the after-noon/evening. Staff should be very attentive of fecaloutput following a procedure and rectal temperaturesare taken for at least 3 days following to provide earlyintervention in a pyretic event. Upon arrival into the laboratory, all equipment in contact with the oocyte should be warmed to bodytemperature (37\u00b0C) with the use of heating platesand stage warmers on microscopes. The aspiratefluid is poured out into several large polystyrenePetri dishes n(150/H1100325 mm) utilizing both the lids and bases to thinly distribute the fluid. It is not recommended to utilize a ltration system whenevaluating this collection technique as the fluffy ma-ture granulosa cells will often get stuck and hinderthe process. The cumulus oocyte complex (COC)can be visualized via the naked eye due to the clarityof cumulus directly surrounding the oocyte, dispers-ing the more hemorrhagic fluid, facilitating rapididentication especially if a light is shined under-neath the dish. If the COC is not immediately rec-ognized, thorough searching of the dishes involvesutilizing a dissecting microscope at 10-20 /H11003magni- cation, with several sets of experienced eyes bene-cial. Any debris or clots can be explored throughthe use of two 22-gauge needles. Once identied,handle the COC with a 0.25-mL, gamma-irradiatedsemen straw oattached a 1-mL tuberculin syringe. The COC is trimmed of excessive granulosa tissue with the two 22-gauge needles and transferred to a smaller Petridish to be washed. Washing media is either a com-mercially available embryo-holding medium qor Tis - sue Culture Medium (TCM) 199 with Hank salts,10% fetal calf serum, pyruvate and 25 /H9262g/mL gen- tamicin. Gently picking up the COC and deposit-ing within several clean locations of the Petri dishwith wash media is intended to remove as muchblood as possible. Once washed, the COC is quicklybut gently transferred into a smaller polystyrenePetri dish (35 /H1100310 mm) with TCM 199 and Earle's salts media that has been preequilibrated within a7% CO 2incubator due to the bicarbonate buffering of Earle's salt to avoid pH disruption. Oocytes that are collected from maturing follicles and that arehandled correctly almost always extrude a polarbody, indicating maturation into metaphase II.When this maturation process is delayed or failscompletely, it typically happens repeatedly from in-dividual problem mares. 13,14 Small/Immature Follicle Collections The personnel, medications, and mare preparationare similar between both styles of performing trans-vaginal aspiration procedures and can be renedwith preference. Small or immature follicle collec-tions are conducted at various timepoints within a mare's cycle and the oocytes collected are typicallywithin an immature stage of development and willoften require in vitro maturation. For these proce- dures, placement of a urinary catheter prior to thestart may prove benecial to provide improved ovar-ian manipulation. The ovary is positioned in thesame manner as described previously, to not onlyvisualize a desirable follicle, but to maximize theaccessibility of several follicles with one puncture ifpossible. This will minimize the repeated traumato ovarian stroma throughout multiple proceduresperformed over the lifetime of the mare. Onceagain, the needle is advanced well into the antrumof the follicle of choice with assistance; however, inaddition to the aforementioned suction/inflow offlush media, the assistant will also twist the needlerapidly in an effort to exfoliate the interior follicularwall. As discussed, the immature equine physical dislodgement to achievecollection. Many labs utilize a method of alternating lling and suctioning of the smaller follicles whichmay be repeated 8-10 times per follicle, providingconstant turbulence and encourage displacement. 5 Once the collection is satisfactorily completed, the nee-dle is guided to another follicle (hopefully adjacent inlocation) and the procedure is repeated. If the goal isto collect all antral follicles visible upon both ovaries,the total number will vary according to individual ses-sions and is typically reported between 4-12 oocytesper mare, 2,13,15,16but may depend upon breed of the mare.16,17 Due to the increase in follicle number, these proce- dures typically last between 45 minutes to an hourdepending upon the individual mare. Equipmentand postprocedural mare management are the sameas described for dominant follicle aspirations. Uponcompletion, the collection bottle is returned to the laband poured through a 75- /H9262m ne mesh lter while simultaneously spraying with clean flush media togently wash the cells back into the collection cup.Typically, a sterilized embryo collection cup ris utilized as this step will prove benecial in the searching pro- cess to decrease the volume of fluid and concentratethe smaller cells to be identied. The author's labprefers using the embryo flush cup to facilitate thesearch process, although the ltrate can be poured intoanother Petri dish if needed. Most of the oocytes col-lected will be broken from their cumulus layer andonly demonstrate the surrounding corona radiata. 18 These oocytes are generally described as the same embryos ( more a homog - enous gray color surrounded by the clear zona pellu-cida and should be maneuvered with a sterile needle toensure they are not an air bubble. These oocytes aremore easily manipulated using a pipettor with a largeenough tip to accommodate their size and will undergoa similar wash process. Ensure to rinse the pipettortip ahead of time and allow for a small amount of clean AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 355HOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIESfluid to enter prior to the oocyte to decrease the chance of it sticking to the sides. Immature oocytes collectedin this manner will either be placed directly into mat-urational medium with hormones or a holding me-dium until being transferred into maturation mediumthe next day. The choice will be based upon collectiontiming along with the anticipated time for sperminjection. Complications Although the procedures described above are becom-ing more common as private practices implementthem within their reproductive programs, it is im-portant to remember that they are invasive andshould not be taken lightly. A few reports havedescribed various complications including ovarianhemorrhage, peritonitis, colic, rectal hemorrhage,and ovarian abcesses 19-22following transvaginal as - piration procedures. As discussed previously, theperitoneal cavity is accessed during this procedure,therefore all equipment should be sterilized and theenvironment kept as clean as possible. Utilizationof uterine or vaginal culture may be warranted insome cases as mares with an active bacterial endo-metritis, urine pooling problems and/or pneumova-gina are at particular risk for iatrogenic bacterialcontamination during the TVA process. If a mareis encountered with a brotic cervix or cervical ad-hesions, and a small amount of anechoic uterinefluid, the author prefers to avoid endometrial cul-ture as to not introduce bacteria to a closed uterineenvironment. Originally, these procedures weredevised for older problem mares without the inten-tion of continual embryo donation or carrying afoal to term. More research is needed to under-stand the longer-term effects on fertility, broticchanges to ovarian stroma, and overall effects of theprimordial follicle pool in a younger population ofmares with varied reproductive procedures intendedin their future. 23,24 Obtaining Oocytes from the Mare Postmortem When a mare dies of natural causes or is euthanized,her ovaries can be removed and oocytes collectedfrom identiable antral follicles. These oocytes canbein vitro matured and undergo sperm injection to create embryos, thus preserving valuable genetics.Postmortem ovary shipment has been availablecommercially since the early 2000s and pregnanciesand subsequent foals have been successfully bornfrom both oocyte transfer and ICSI produced em-bryos. 25,26The current practice is for referring vet - erinarians to remove the ovaries as soon as possibleand ship them directly to a facility offering ovarianscraping and ICSI procedures. Occasionally, theeuthanasia is coordinated, as with a chronic condi-tion such as laminitis so that the mare is within anideal follicular phase. For these cases, it is recom-mended to provide prostaglandin administrationand wait 4 or 5 days later for humane euthanasia inorder to capitalize on the late diestrus/early estrusfollicular phase. More often than not, euthanasia occurs as an emergency and coordinating the last-minute logistics of immediate ovary removal, pack-aging, and shipping can be overwhelming andsometimes impossible. It has been suggested thatpractitioners adept with oocyte handling can effec-tively remove the ovaries and harvest oocytes attheir facilities for shipment of just the oocytes to alab offering ICSI services in a less emergent man-ner, achieving oocyte removal from the decayingtissue quicker than shipping the whole ovary. Pilotdata collected recently has demonstrated signi-cantly improved maturation rates in oocytes col-lected within 2 hours of ovary removal and \"shipped\"in holding media compared to a control ovary\"shipped\" in routine fashion prior to oocyte collection(72% vs. 22%; Hatzel JH, unpublished data, 2018).Therefore, the author does feel it will be benecialfor practitioners to learn the process of oocyte har-vesting at their location in order to ship just thecollected oocytes for improved success. Regardlessof the method chosen, early and continual commu-nication with the owner and ICSI team will helpease some of the stressors involved with ensuringnot only the ovaries/oocytes are transported cor-rectly, but also that appropriate semen (eithercooled or frozen) arrives no later than the day afterthe ovaries/oocytes. The process of ovary removal, packaging and ship- ping has been previously described in detail 27and will not be described here. In general, ovaries be- ing shipped in close proximity to the receiving lab(within 2 hours) should be kept close to body tem-perature (37\u00b0C). More often than not, ovaries areshipped from a further location ( /H110222 hours) and it is recommended to ship them at a cool room tempera-ture (17-22\u00b0C). It is never recommended to shipthem on ice. Any container that will consistentlyhold the temperature for the length of travel willsufce including: a Styrofoam box, a passive cool-ing device utilized for semen transport, or a thermo-regulating portable incubator. Approximately halfthe population of oocytes collected from ovaries willmature in vitro for ICSI. From that group, 30%- 50% will typically begin forming an early embryoand about half of the early embryos that begin form-ing will continue to develop to a transferrableblastocyst. 27 Personnel The most common method currently utilized by lab-oratories offering this service is scraping individualfollicles to collect the oocytes by hand. In general,with a team of 3 people, it usually takes the author'sgroup about an hour to complete the entire proce-dure with an additional 30 minutes of cleanup.However, performing this technique can be achievedby a single person, which requires devotion of atleast 2 hours of time. With a team, one or twomembers adept at scraping can process the ovarieswhile a third member with experience in identify- 356 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIESing oocytes can receive dishes and search from a single follicle. If scraping alone, it is helpful toutilize a 50-mL conical tube lled with /H1101125 mL of the same commercial flush media mused for TVA. Upon physical scraping, rapidly stir the bone cu- rette within this media, encouraging all cellulardebris to collect in the tube. All follicular scrap-ings will be collected in one tube and the entirevolume will be spread amongst large Petri dishesfor oocyte identication. Technique Scraping ovarian follicles to harvest oocytes is nottechnically challenging and does not require a vastamount of specialized equipment. Prior to initia-tion, a clean location within a lab is chosen and thesurface covered with a sterile surgical drape or clean absorbent draping material. The instru-ments should be sterile and organized on the tableahead of time (Fig. 3) along with a large Petri dishfor holding the ovary, several smaller Petri dishes to scrapings from individual follicles (or conicaltube lled with /H1101125 mL 4), several all-plastic 60-mL syringes pre-lled withthe flush media, and sterile or clean exam gloves.Rinse the ovaries with ample amounts of flush mediaat room temperature in order to remove any grossdebris and blood from the ovarian surface. Then, uti-lize sterile Metzenbaum scissors to trim excess tissuein order to completely visualize the ovarian surfaceand maximize the palpable surface area during scrap-ing. The ovary is placed into the base of a large Petridish with a small amount of flush media. Donning sterile or clean exam gloves, the surface of the ovary is palpated to identify larger follicles.A small incision utilizing a new sterile #10 or #20scalpel blade is made across the surface of the folli-cle and follicular fluid is allowed to run out into thelarge holding Petri dish. Generally, the largestbone curette size is chosen that will comfortably occupy the greatest surface area of the interior por-tion of individual follicles to effectively scoop outgranulosa cells, focusing on the medial aspect wherepresumably the oocyte resides. The bone curettecontaining the cellular population is either rinsedinto the smaller Petri dish or stirred into the conicaltube, depending on the personnel available. Con-tinue scraping an individual follicle until granulosacells are no longer identiable within the bone cu-rette. If collecting in a conical tube, continue to thenext follicle.

If the oocyte is found, it can be washed and placed inholding media immediately, and if not it is recom-mended the person scraping continues to attemptcollection on the same follicle. Once all palpablefollicles are explored, the process of \"bread-loang\"the ovary begins. The author typically begins bysystematically making a sagittal incision along thelong axis of the ovarian tissue, pausing, and scrap-ing any identiable follicles as described above.Upon leting open the two halves, transverse inci-sions are made along both sides at /H110115 mm-intervals until all identiable antral follicles have been ex-plored. Once complete, the ovary is aggressively\"power-washed\" with flush media in a syringe toencourage any last-minute oocytes to be collected inthe large Petri dish utilized for holding. It is rec-ommended to also maintain one or a portion of oneovary frozen for potential identication require-ments at a later date. Handling these oocytes is similar to the process described above for immature oocytes. We utilizeeither a sterile 0.25-mL straw owith adapterp(if large expanded cumulus cells are evident) or a pi- pettor with appropriate tip size (if compact cumuluscells are evident). In addition to searching individ-ual small Petri dishes or the entire conical tubevolume, always search the large Petri dish utilizedfor holding and processing the ovary, as often anoocyte or several are found in this loca-tion. Oocytes are placed immediately into a mediaforin vitro maturation or held overnight. If being shipped to a facility offering ICSI services, oocytesare maintained during transport within either acommercial or lab prepared embryo-holding mediaas described previously for rinsing purposes 13or premade lab EM medium (40% M199 utilize a 1-mL borosilicate glass vials secured with Paralmtlled with either medium to either hold or transport the collection of oocytes. Another option is for private practitioners to simplyship the entire conical tube of collected scrapings atroom temperature if no microscope or trained per-sonnel are available to locate individual oocytes. 5 Additional methods for harvesting oocytes from equine ovaries have been described, especially whenlarger volumes of ovaries need to be processed.For example, when research on slaughterhousespecimens was available. Direct follicular aspira-tion with a syringe and needle or a needle attachedto a pump increases efciency and represents a more\"closed\" system when contamination is a concern.However, reports have indicated this method leadsto stripping of the majority of cumulus cells whichcan lead to difculty in oocyte identication. 28 The scraping method has been directly compared toaspirating follicles with an 18-gauge needle and sy-ringe, showing no difference in maturation or fertil-ization rates. 29,30However, a needle and syringe isnot recommended for aspiration as the oocytes are often completely denuded of cumulus cells with thistechnique. 29,30The utilization of ultrasound to identify and aspirate follicles (using the in vivo col- lection setup) prior to dissection and subsequentlyseparating the two populations throughout the col-lection process, may represent an alternativemethod, increase efciency and maintain a stricterlevel of hygiene (Metcalf L, Sherwood, OR, personalcommunication, 2018). 4. Discussion As more researchers and clinicians become aware ofand are interested in ART procedures in the horse,more questions will undoubtedly surface. Theequine industry worldwide is participating in theseprocedures and striving to nd answers to thesequestions and creative ways of handling pitfalls.Ultimately, dedicated clinicians and researchers de-pend upon the foundational knowledge ampliedwithin the past two decades to build upon and im-prove the safety, efcacy, and efciency of theseprocedures for greater application.

Introduction With the increasing success of in vitro production (IVP) of equine embryos, more horse owners opt forthis reproductive procedure as a means of preserv-ing valuable genetic lines. In response to theirrequest, transvaginal aspiration (TVA) of equineoocytes is gradually becoming a procedure morecommonly offered in reproduction private practices.As well, recovery of oocytes from the dissection ofovaries, following elective ovariectomy or death ofa mare, represents a valuable veterinary serviceto horse owners. Although there are only a fewcenters that have the equipment and expertise to perform intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)on shipped oocytes, more and more veterinaryclinics that have offered reproductive services inthe past now include oocyte recovery proceduresas well. The successful recovery of oocytes via TVA is used in many mammalian species for genetic preserva-tion. In almost all species except the horse, theovaries of the donor female are hormonally stimu-lated so that multiple preovulatory follicles areavailable for oocyte aspiration close to the time of ovulation. The oocytes from these dominantstimulated follicles (DSF) have proceeded to meta-phase of meiosis II (MII) by the time aspirationtakes place. The mare, however, represents aunique challenge in that, to date, a reliable andrepeatable protocol for ovarian stimulation of su- perovulation does not exist. Ovaries from maresare capable of producing only 1-2 DSFs per es-trous cycle; therefore, in recovery of few DSF oocytes. Theymust rely then on the smaller supporting follicleson the mare ovary that contain immature oocytesarrested at the MI stage of development. Oocytesrecovered from equine DSF's have been shown tohave greater developmental competence to theblastocyst stage than immature oocytes fromsmaller follicles, and yet the immature oocyteshave greater availability, especially if collected ona 2-week rotation. In equine ovarian follicles, immature oocytes are maintained at prophase I meiotic arrest until eitherendogenous follicular recruitment or aspiration,at which time there is a resumptionof meiosis. This follicular period of oocyte mei-otic is gapjunction signaling that includes cyclic nucleotidesand natriuretic peptides. Therefore, much re-search is presently focused on handling and mat-uration of equine immature oocytes. This paper provides guidelines for handling and shippingboth DSF and immature oocytes that will optimizetheir developmental competence, ultimately,live foal rate. 360 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES NOTES2. Materials and Methods Procedure Under transvaginal ultrasound guidance, cumulus- oocyte complexes (COCs) from both the dominantand immature follicles equine ovaries are aspi-rated using a 12-gauge double lumen ovarian aspi-ration needle aand flushed with a commercial complete flush mediumbthat has been warmed to 38\u00b0C. The oocytes are recovered into a 250-mL sterile centrifuge vessel placed in a 38\u00b0C water bath. Because the recovery fluid is usually hemorrhagic following the needle scraping of the follicular wall,heparin cis added to the flush medium (5 IU/mL) to avoid blood clots that can obscure visualization of oocytes in the search dish. It is benecial to have a person on the aspiration team who is qualied to handle and identify theCOC from the DSF, so that as soon as the aspirationof the DSF is completed, the collection vessel can beimmediately moved into a lab with controlled tem-perature. The aspiration fluid is ltered using anembryo transfer lter dand rinsed with warmed complete flushbmedia until the remaining fluid in the search dish is clear enough to identify the COC. In an attempt to maintain the COC at 38\u00b0C, this procedure is ideally performed in an incubator or on a heated stage. As soon as the COC is identiedunder dissection microscopy, it is transferred to pre-warmed overnight shipping media. e The immature oocytes recovered from small sup- porting follicles appear to be more resilient to de-creasing temperature than those recovered from theDSF; in fact, the developmental competence of im-mature oocytes appears to be compromised if theyare kept overnight at 38 \u00b0C following aspiration.1 Although collected in a 38\u00b0C waterbath, as well as rinsed and ltered using 38\u00b0C compete flush medi - um,bthe immature oocytes are brought to room tem - perature gradually. The heated stage is turned offduring the search for oocytes and the overnight me-dium is removed from the 38 \u00b0C waterbath and set on the laboratory counter as it cools to room tempera- ture (/H1101120\u00b0C). The immature oocytes are identied, placed /H1100320-mm sterile Petri dish of embryo hold- ing mediaeand brought to room temperature, until they are washed through several drops of holding media and placed in an overnight media. The recovered or received oocytes are manipu- lated, washed, and/or transferred between dropsof holding medium and lab dishes using either aStripper with a 600-u sterile handling pipettefor sterile borosilicate glass thumb-roller pipette handle. The latter pi- pette is better suited for handling the DSF oocytesince a large sticky cloud of expanded cumulus cellsoften surrounds it. One can also use a sterile0.25-mL straw for the DSF COC. This straw how-ever is not ideal for handling the immature COCswith compact granulosa cell layer because a largervolume of media is potentially transferred with the COCs, thereby reducing efciency of washing andtransfer. It is important that all vessels used for collection, searching, holding, washing, and shipping oocytesare tested for toxicity to gametes. In many IVPlabs, especially those involved in the commercialproduction of media, labware is tested not only forsterility, but for toxicity as well, using mouseoocytes. Although not nearly as rigorous of a testfor toxicity, other labs will evaluate extended semenlongevity held at room temperature over 24 hours.In the author's lab, an aerobic culture is performednot only on all media made in house, but also ontransport media and dishes after they are receivedand recovered COCs have been moved to otherdishes. The author's lab recommends individually steril- ized screwcap hvials for transport. There is con - cern that the snaptophvials are not as secure as the screwtop vialshand they may leak. Once the oocytes have been transferred to the overnight me- dium, and the lid secured, and a layer of Paralm Mi is wrapped around the lid and vial. Media The optimal overnight shipping media for recoveredoocytes has not yet been determined. To meet theassumed metabolic requirements of the DSF oocyte,the medium used in the author's laboratory for over-night shipping of the DSF oocyte DSF oocytes equilibrated M199Earles2with the addition of 10% newborn calf serum and have re- ported success in blastocyst production. With respect to overnight holding of immature oocytes, the author's lab prefers to use an in-housemedium consisting 40% M199 with Hanks salts(M199Hanks), been equilibrated in 5% CO 2.A s a more available alternative, commercial embryo holding mediaemay be used for overnight shipment of immature oocytes even for as long as 48 hours.1 In an attempt to reproduce the physiological maturation that occurs in vivo, the author's labo- ratory cyclic adenosine 3/H110325/H11032-monophosphate (cAMP) modulators to our pre- in vitro maturation (preIVM) overnight shipping me- dium. It was reported that the addition of devel- opment rates.3 The expiration date of commercial media or com- ponents of in-house media should be followed inorder to avoid pH, composition, and osmolarity AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 361HOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIESchanges of the media. Most media to which oocytes and developing IVP embryos are exposed is at alower pH ( /H110117.2) than the mammalian oviduct (/H110117.4). It has been reported in many species that compromising pH or osmolarity can result in im-paired developmental competence of oocytes. 4,5 Furthermore, freezing and thawing of media maycause detrimental changes as well. Shipping Containers An optimal oocyte overnight shipping containermaintains a core temperature of 38.2 \u00b0C for the oocytes recovered from DSFs and room temperature or lower for immature oocytes. The author's labo-ratory h olds and ships oocytes in the MicroQ TM incubatork, which provides precise temperature con - trol at ambient temperature between /H1100220\u00b0Ct o /H1100150\u00b0C. With simultaneous heating and cooling, the incubator temperature in the MicroQ can be programmed to a specic holding temperature thatranges from 4 \u00b0Ct o4 2\u00b0C and maintains the temper - ature for at least 3 days. The MicroQinsert has been designed to hold multiple 4-6-mL tubes for shipment. Shipping containers are also available from other commercial vendors. The Equitainerlhas been used to ship DSF and immature oocytes. The coolant cans, and isothermalizing equipment are brought to a tem-perature of 38 \u00b0C in either a waterbath or an incubator. The oocytes can be packed according to their instruc- tions and this device cools slowly. The conditions arenot optimal, especially for the temperature-sensitiveDSF oocyte. Another alternative for shipping immature oocytes is the Equocyte lthat is designed to hold the oocytes during transport at a preselected temperature (15\u00b0C, 18\u00b0C, 22\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C) provided that the container and contents are maintained and equilibrated at that temperature for 24 hours prior to transport.This 24-hour requirement can be challenging tomaintain the cooler temperatures. Creative solu-tions using a designated refrigerator that can be setto maintain 15 \u00b0Co r1 8\u00b0C, or using a household re - frigerator with a waterbath placed inside set towarm to 15 \u00b0C, 18\u00b0C, or\u00b0C have been tried. Temperature The developmental competence of equine oocytes re-covered from DSFs is compromised when these MIIoocytes are exposed to temperatures outside of theoptimal body temperature. The stability of themeiotic spindle as well as chromosome segregationappears to be impaired under conditions of evenminor temperature fluctuations. 6 On the other hand, immature oocytes, aspirated from small follicles while in the prophase phase ofMeiosis I, appear to be more resilient to coolingtemperatures than the oocytes recovered from DSFs.Furthermore, the developmental competence of im-mature oocytes improves when they are graduallycooled from the 38.2 \u00b0C media temperature usedfor flushing. Studies have shown that immature oocytes held at 25\u00b0C overnight remained at the ger - minal vesicle stage of development, and did notspontaneously resume meiosis, as opposed to oocytesheld at 37 \u00b0C that resumed meiosis.7 This preIVM period has become an area of im- mense interest, not only because it allows overnightshipment of recovered immature oocytes to an IVPlaboratory that is capable of performing ICSI andembryo IVP, but also with careful management oftemperature and media, the developmental compe-tence of the oocytes improves. Two recent studies from the author's laboratory 8 have focused on determining the optimal preIVMshipping temperature for immature oocytes. Be-cause the Equitainer lis readily available at low cost, in Experiment 1, overnight shipment of immature oocytes at 20\u00b0C (room temperature) held in the MicroQkversus 5\u00b0C held in the Equitainer was com - pared. In Experiment 2, overnight holding of im-mature oocytes at 20 \u00b0C versus 16\u00b0C, in the MicroQk, was compared. In both experiments, immature equine oocytes obtained from ovarian follicles byTVA (n /H1100556, Experiment 1; n /H11005161, Experiment 2) were divided equally and maintained at either 20 \u00b0C or 5\u00b0C/16\u00b0C overnight in holding mediaebefore un - dergoing incubation at 38.5\u00b0C in equilibrated matu - ration media as described by Foss.1After 28.5 hours, mature MII oocytes were fertilized by ICSI with thawed stallion spermatozoa that had beencentrifuged through a single-layer colloid gradient m and resuspended in warmed flush medium.bFer- tilized oocytes were cultured as described by Foss1 and blastocyst development was recorded. Datawere analyzed using the /H92732test (for binomial data) and P/H11021.05 was considered statistically signicant. 3. Results In Experiment 1, immature oocytes incubated over- night in preIVM holding medium at signicantly there in blastocyst percleaved embryo rates (66% versus 37%, respectively;P/H11005.16). immature oocytes incubated over- night in preIVM holding medium at 16 showed but there no difference found in blastocyst percleaved embryo rates (43% versus 55%; P/H11005.217). 4. Discussion The environmental conditions provided for equine oocytes following collection play a critical role in the 362 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIESultimate outcome of the IVP production of embryos. From nontoxic labware to media to temperature ofthe overnight shipment, all steps require vigilanceto create the optimal environment. Results from experiments in the author's labora- tory suggest that modulation of either preIVMmedia or temperature, or both, to delay the sponta-neous resumption of meiosis following oocyte retrieval can improve blastocyst production. Man-agement of oocyte and cumulus cell cAMP level priorto IVM appears to be an effective means to enhanceequine oocyte competence and blastocyst develop-ment. Studies in other species have demonstratedthat a similar system of simulated physiologicaloocyte maturation, designed to reproduce the phys-iological maturation that occurs in vivo by using the cAMP modulators prior to in vitro maturation (IVM), improves oocyte developmental outcome. 9 Studies to determine the optimal preIVM temper- ature for equine oocytes suggest that the a temperature of 5\u00b0C is not appropriate for ship-ment of equine oocytes. In the author's study,there was a signicant drop in embryo cleavage andblastocyst development rate when compared to thestorage temperature of 20 \u00b0C. Earlier studies sup - port this result. Other researchers have reportedthat a reduced number of blastocysts formed fromimmature oocytes been held overnight at5 \u00b0C10or 7\u00b0C11prior to maturation; furthermore, there were no pregnancies following transfer of the few blastocysts that formed. However, the developmental competence of equine oocytes appears to im prove by cooling them over- night to temperatures below room temperature.The study from the author's laboratory showed im-proved blastocyst development when oocytes wereincubated at 16 \u00b0C versus 20\u00b0C. Because there was no difference in blastocyst development rates follow- ing cleavage, these results suggest that maturationand cleavage functioned as the determining devel-opmental benchmark affected by this temperaturedifference. The preIVM period of immature oocytes sets the stage for cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation, andfollowing maturation fertilization, the developmentof the embryo. This paper has presented practicalguidelines for the handling and shipping of equineoocytes.

Introduction Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been useful in producing embryos from subfertile maresand stallions that otherwise would not be possible.Whether the oocytes were collected at the institutionperforming the ICSI procedure, or shipped to the labfrom the location where they were collected, thehandling of the oocytes once received is essentiallythe same. This paper provides a description of theevents that occur in an equine in vitro fertilization laboratory from the time that the oocytes are re-ceived through maturation, ICSI fertilization, andembryo development to the blastocyst stage. Prac-tical knowledge of these events not only aids practi-tioners in their expectations for success, but alsoallows better communication with their horse breed-ing clients. 2. Maturation Oocytes in non-preovulatory antral follicles are in adictyate (relatively static) state of meiosis, and socan be aspirated at any stage of the mare's estrouscycle. Recovered oocytes are generally placed in aholding medium, either commercial embryo holdingmedium or a mixture of Medium 199 with Earlessalts and Hanks salts (E/H). 1The time present in holding medium can provide convenience for bothcollection and ICSI schedules. Simply removing oocytes from the suppressive action of follicles willresult in oocytes attempting to resume meiosis.Holding them at a cooler temperature (usuallyaround 22\u00b0C) suppresses the resumption of meiosisduring shipment or holding at the lab. The matu-ration process is intended to initiate resumption ofmeiosis as normally as possible, advancing oocytesfrom the germinal vesicle nuclear stage they arerecovered in, through metaphase I and into meta-phase II (the stage in which the oocyte is ready forfertilization). For maturation, oocytes are incu-bated in a 30-50- /H9262L droplet of a bicarbonate buffer system based maturation medium under a mineraloil overlay, in a humidied atmosphere of 5% CO 2, O2, and 90% gas) at 38\u00b0C for 28-36 hours prior to ICSI. During the maturation processboth nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation shouldtake place and the tightly bound cumulus cells sur- rounding the oocyte (Fig. 1) will begin to expand,loosening the bond holding the cells together (Fig.2). Unfortunately, not all recovered oocytes aremeiotically competent to mature completely to meta-phase II and be viable for fertilization. The oocyteswhich do not reach metaphase II are either atretic,degenerate, or not developed enough at the time ofcollection to resume meiosis. The rate of oocytes 364 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES NOTESmaturing completely to metaphase II varies but gen- erally 60-70% of the oocytes placed into maturationmedium reach this state for most mares. Meta-phase II oocytes also vary in their degree of devel-opmental competence, the ability to develop into aviable embryo. Oocytes recovered from dominant stimulated pre- ovulatory follicles have already resumed meiosisand are typically at metaphase I when recoveredapproximately 24 hours after gonadotropin stimula-tion. Since maturation was initiated in the mare,follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or other hor-mones are not necessary in the culture medium tocomplete maturation. Mares are set up to aspiratea dominant follicle similarly to a timed insemina-tion, but the oocyte is recovered to ovulation. Dom-inant stimulated preovulatory follicle oocytes, due totheir large expanded cumulus masses (Fig. 3) are not cultured in micro-droplets under an oil overlay,but are placed in a 35-mm culture dish containingDMEMF-12 and TCM-199 based culture medium inhumidied triple gas, and incubated at 38\u00b0C. ICSIis performed 16-20 hours later, 42 hours followinggonadotrophin stimulation of the donor mare. 3. Denuding and Evaluation During both in vitro and in vivo maturation, the cumulus oocyte will expand due to extracellular ma-trix synthesis by the cumulus cells with hyaluronicacid being a major component of the matrix. 2The cumulus cells provide some support for the oocyte, but their physical presence interferes visually withoocyte evaluation and the ICSI process itself. De-nuding is a mechanical stripping of the cumuluscells away from the oocyte by passing the oocytecumulus mass through sequentially smaller pi- Fig. 4.

The process is aided by and performed in medium containing 0.1% hyaluronidase, an enzymethat aids in breaking down hyaluronic acid, 35-mm dish on a stereoscope. sequen- tially smaller pipettes are either glass or plasticmaterials, and typically range from diameters of 200 /H9262mt o1 3 5 /H9262m to fully denude the approximately 160-micron oocyte. After denuding, all oocytes MOPS or HEPES buffered me-dium under mineral oil on the injection plate forevaluation using an inverted microscope at 200 /H11003 magnication (Fig. 4). Although there is not a uniform grading scale for equine oocytes, after denuding the oocytes are eval-uated to determine if they are ready for injection.The extrusion of the rst polar body is the sign thatthe oocyte has reached metaphase II and is ready forfertilization. The extruded polar body is locatedbetween the oolemma and zona pellucida (Fig. 5),and is the unused chromosomal diploid cell into Mature equine oocytes will with areas of both darkness,caused by lipids, and clarity. It is not unusual forequine oocytes to be misshapen, have vacuoles, drop-lets, and/or varieties of uniformity through the cyto-plasm. Many oocytes that have some of thesedifferences will develop into transferrable earlyblastocysts, pregnancies, and healthy foals after in-jection. Due to these variances, generally anyoocyte with a visible polar body is selected for fertil-ization. The remaining oocytes fall into two cat- egories. Oocytes that were too immature torespond to maturation, are still in the germinalvesicle stage or at metaphase I, is the rst cate-gory. The others are atretic, which have begun todegenerate and often have very dark cytoplasm,thin zona pellucida, and a large amount of periv-itelline space. Fig. 5.

Sperm Processing Equine embryos have successfully been produced using spermatozoa from semen sources of varyingdegrees of quality and processing styles, even in-cluding dead sperm and lyophilized sperm. 4Most commonly, spermatozoa derived from cryopreserved semen are used for the ICSI procedure. Since onlya small number of spermatozoa are needed, a smallportion of the frozen straws is cut while under liquidnitrogen. The cut portion of the straw is placeddirectly into a thawing medium at 38\u00b0C. Thethawed semen is further processed by either wash- ing and centrifugation or a swim-up, allowing sper-matozoa to swim up from the bottom of the tube for15 minutes. Two microliters of sperm suspension,collected either from the centrifuged sample or fromimmediately above the straw in the swim-up tube,placed in a 5- /H9262L drop of a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution under mineral oil on the ICSI manip- ulation plate. The water soluble polymer PVP'shigh viscosity slows the sperm cells down, aiding intheir evaluation and manipulation and eases thesperm injection process. Prior to sperm cell selec-tion, the sharp injection pipette is rinsed in PVPsolution to decrease adhesion of sperm to the pi-pette. The injection pipette is lowered into the PVPsolution containing the sperm sample, and after anevaluation of the sperm population, a single spermcell is chosen subjectively based on its vigor andmorphology. The selected sperm cell is immobi-lized by dragging the injection pipette over the tail ofthe sperm, essentially trapping it between the pi-pette and the bottom of the dish. After immobili-zation of the sperm, the bevel of the injection pipetteis used to fracture, but not completely sever, the tailin mid-shaft. Fracturing of the sperm tail breaksthe cell membrane of the sperm, aiding in release ofcytosolic sperm factors which are important inoocyte activation. 5The sperm cell is loaded broken tail rst into the injection pipette and the pipette is then moved to the droplet containing the oocytes(Fig. 6).

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 367HOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES5. Injection The suction of a holding pipette is used to capture and stabilize the oocyte for the injection procedure.The injection pipette is used to manipulate theoocyte's orientation on the holding pipette such thatthe polar body is arranged so the injection pipettewill not pass in the same plane as the polar body.This is to decrease the chance of the injection dam-aging the chromosomes that are usually relativelyclose to the polar body. Once oriented appropri-ately, the injection pipette is driven with the aid of apiezo drill through the zona pellucida, oolemma, andinto the cytoplasm, where the sperm cell is deposited(Figs. 7 and 8). 6. Culture After sperm injection, oocytes are moved to dropletsof embryo culture medium under mineral oil in apetri dish maintained in triple gas at 38\u00b0C for cul-ture. Equine embryo culture medium is usuallybased on human embryo culture medium with addedglucose or DMEM/F12. The rst cleavage shouldoccur around 24 hours after injection (Fig. 9), andthen approximately every 24 hours after. As thecells continue to divide, the loose association of cellswill begin to compact 5-6 days after injection (Fig.10) to form a compact morula. The majority of em-bryos that compact during this period will progressto blastocyst within 2 days. Embryos are removedfrom culture to be transferred into a recipient mareor vitried at the early blastocyst stage once a tro-phoblast layer begins to form (Fig. 11), which canoccur as early as 6 days or as late as 10 days follow-ing injection. The relative rate of progression tothe early blastocyst stage is indicative of the overallvitality of the embryo, and pregnancy rates correlatewith the development rate. There are many factors that affect the development of cultured embryos thathave not been identied. 7. Conclusion As with most assisted reproductive techniques, ICSIcomes with many challenges that affect the ultimatesuccess of producing live foals. Not all mare andstallions will be successful candidates for the proce-dure. Nevertheless, ICSI can be used to producefoals from many subfertile horses that otherwisewould not be possible. Fig. 9.

E. Stout, Authors' address: of \u00a9 2019 AAEP. 1. Introduction The last 5 years have witnessed a rapid growth in interest in producing horse embryos in vitro via the combination of ovum pick-up (OPU) and intracyto-plasmic sperm injection (ICSI), not least because ofthe high mean number of blastocysts per treatmentcycle and promising pregnancy results reportedfrom the rst commercial programs. 1,2The ability to salvage the genetics of subfertile animals, usescarce or expensive semen very efciently, and/orproduce embryos from competing mares withouthaving to put them through a full insemination andembryo recovery cycle has proven attractive to sporthorse breeders, and triggered many practices to con-sider offering OPU-ICSI as a commercial service.While acquiring the experience to perform OPUsafely and successfully should be achievable, estab-lishing a laboratory to perform oocyte maturation,ICSI and embryo culture at a commercially viablelevel is more challenging. It can therefore be pru-dent to focus, at least initially, on collecting oocytesand shipping them to a laboratory with a proventrack record of producing horse blastocysts by ICSI;this appears to have little negative effect on results. 3 Even then, given the initial focus and planning re-quired just to perform OPU and/or ICSI success- fully, it is easy to overlook the importance of givingclients a realistic indication of both the risks and thelikelihood of success, so that they can make a bal-anced decision as to whether OPU-ICSI is the bestoption for a given mare and situation, or whetheranother assisted breeding technique may be moreappropriate. Ultimately, client satisfaction de-pends on an adequate understanding of the stepsinvolved, and having realistic expectations of thelikelihood of success for each of those steps (i.e.,oocyte recovery, oocyte maturation, blastocyst devel-opment, establishment of pregnancy in a recipientmare, risk of pregnancy loss, birth of a live foal).This paper uses the experiences and results gener-ated over a 4-year period of offering OPU-oocyteshipping-ICSI commercially, to give an idea of whatis possible, and to identify factors that influence thelikelihood of success, or may lead to a mare ownerdeciding not to use OPU-ICSI. 2. Materials and Methods Between early September 2014 and late June 2018, OPU was performed 879 times on 475 differentWarmblood mares (aged between 18 months and 29 370 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES NOTESyears old), and subsequent ICSI was performed us- ing frozen-thawed semen from 147 different stal-lions. OPU was performed year round, except forJuly and August, at Utrecht University (the Neth-erlands) using a described by Claes et al. 4 Follicles larger than 5 mm were punctured and thefluid aspirated into collecting bottles, using a vac-uum pump adjusted to aspirate 20 mL of fluid inapproximately 1 minute. After emptying, follicleswere flushed 5 to 12 times (depending on the num-ber of follicles present) with a follicle-size dependentvolume (0.5 to 7 mL) of either a commercial embryoflushing medium a,bsupplemented with 20,000 IU/L heparin sodium,cor a commercial recovery medium.dRecovered fluid was passed through a 75-/H9262m lter, and the contents of the lter were washed and the cumulus-oocyte-complexes locatedusing a dissecting microscope. Recovered oocyteswere packaged into 1-mL cryovials in modiedHepes-buffered Synthetic Oviductal Fluid and to Avantea (Cremona,Italy) at 22 \u00b0C in prewarmed polystyrene boxes de - signed for the transport of organs for transplanta-tion, an Equitainer eor a temperature controlled incubator.f In vitro oocyte maturation (24 hours), ICSI, and in vitro culture of embryos were performed as de- scribed previously.4After IVM, ICSI was per - formed on all oocytes with a visible polar body (i.e., at the metaphase II (MII) stage) using frozen-thawed semen from a stallion selected by the mareowner. A small piece (one third to one tenth) of a0.5-mL straw was cut off and thawed were then selected either byswim-up or by centrifugation through a 45-90% Per-coll density gradient, and ICSI was performed usinga Piezo drill. In vitro blastocyst formation was as- sessed daily on days 6 to 8 (day of ICSI /H11005day 0). Resulting blastocysts were cryopreserved immedi-ately after recognition by controlled rate freezing inmH-SOF containing 10% glycerol, and stored in liq-uid nitrogen. Embryos were transported back to Utrecht in liq- uid nitrogen. Approximately 30 to 60 minutes be-fore transfer into recipient mares, embryos werethawed and the glycerol was washed out by sequen-tial 5-minute washes in mH-SOF containing 8, 6, 4,2, and 0% glycerol. 4Transfer to recipient mares was performed in mares sedated with 4 mg detomi- dine hydrochloride (IV) using a Polansky type spec-ulum and Wilsher forceps on days 3 to 6 afterovulation; day 4 after ovulation was consideredideal, and deviations from this were to avoid week-ends or for other practical reasons. Recipient mares received no additional treatments, and sub- sequent examination for pregnancy was carried out7 to 10 days after transfer. If no pregnancy was seen, mares were reexamined 2 to 4 days later.In the case of pregnancy, mares were reexamined 23and 37 days after embryo transfer (ET). A combination of ANOVA and logistic regression was used to examine the influence of procedural,donor mare (mares submitted for OPU /H113505 times) and stallion (stallions used for ICSI on /H113505 mares) factors that influenced the success of blastocyst for-mation in terms of the likelihood of producing ablastocyst, and the mean number of blastocysts perOPU or per injected oocyte. Similar statistical ap-proaches were used to examine the influence of do-nor and recipient mare, and embryo characteristicson the likelihoods of pregnancy and pregnancy loss.To minimize any mare-related bias, when examin-ing stallion effects only the results for the rst OPUper mare were included. 3. Results An average of 24 follicles per mare were aspirated(range, 6-72), yielding a mean of 13.4 oocytes(range, 0-55; 56% recovery). Somewhat surpris-ingly, the efciency of oocyte recovery did not im-prove markedly with experience, although thenumber of follicles punctured did increase duringthe rst few months as a result of improved techni-cal prociency. Follicle number was affected bymare age, with years) presenting fewer follicles (mean /H11006SD, and yielding fewer oocytes /H110064.7 oocytes), with a lower efciency of recovery (48%). Overall, the percentage of oocytes that success- fully matured to MII and were injected was 57%.Of these, 68.5% cleaved and 14.1% yielded a blasto-cyst on days 6 to 8; with an average of 1.09 blasto-cysts per OPU (range, 0-10), and with 56% of allOPUs yielding at least 1 embryo. For 31 OPUs, noICSI was performed because either no oocytes wererecovered (once), the oocytes were found to be con-taminated after IVM (once), no oocytes made it toMII (8 times; 0.9%), or transport of the oocytes wasdelayed by 24 hours and the oocytes arrived at/H1102116\u00b0C (21 times). On other occasions, transport was delayed by 24 hours (i.e., 48 hours total transittime) but it was decided to proceed with ICSI be-cause the percentage of oocytes reaching MII wasunaffected. When examining mares submitted repeatedly for OPU ( /H113505 times) or stallions used on multiple mares (/H113505), it became apparent that while there was a stallion effect on parameters of ICSI success, therewas a more marked mare effect. In this respect, forthe most frequently used stallions (n /H1100521) and mares (n /H1100530), the percentage of blastocysts per injected oocyte ranged from 4.4% to blastocysts OPU ranged 1.08) for stallions compared to 0to 3.29 (mean, 1.39) for mares and the percentage ofOPUs yielding at least 1 embryo ranged from 25% to AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 371HOW TO INCORPORATE REPRODUCTIVE (mean, 56.3%) for stallions compared to 0% to 100% for mares (mean, 66.7%). Overall, maresthat yielded an embryo at the rst OPU had a 70%likelihood of yielding embryos at subsequent at-tempts, whereas those that did not yield an embryoat the rst treatment had only a 30.5% likelihoodof producing embryos at subsequent attempts.In short, mare identity was a more important pre-dictor of blastocyst production than stallion. Sur-prisingly, the mare effect was not primarily an effectof age. Indeed, although mares older than 20 yearsyielded fewer oocytes and blastocysts (mean 0.8 perOPU), the percentage of blastocysts per injectedoocyte (13.7%) was no different to that in youngermares. Of the rst 419 embryos transferred, 270 resulted in a pregnancy 7 to 10 days later (64.4%). Thirty-ve of these pregnancies (13%) were lost in the pe-riod up to day 37 after transfer (equivalent to day41-42 of gestation since, based on vesicle size 7 daysafter transfer, the in vitro produced (IVP) embryos behaved like day 5 or 6 in vivo embryos). 4The likelihoods of pregnancy and pregnancy loss were independent of donor mare age. On the other hand,there were signicant effects of year of production/transfer on likelihood of pregnancy and pregnancyloss, with results improving over time. This was atleast in part due to identifying the ideal stage of therecipient mare's cycle to transfer a frozen-thawedICSI embryo. In this respect, the likelihood ofpregnancy was higher after transfer to recipientson days 3 and 4 after ovulation (72% and 73%, re-spectively) than on days 5 or 6 (57% and 42%,respectively). 4. Discussion Setting up a commercial OPU and/or ICSI programinvolves a considerable learning curve, with resultsimproving over time, sometimes due to subtleexperience-related changes and sometimes becauseof planned changes in protocol. For example, whileblastocyst production rates in our program have im-proved over time (from approximately 0.9 in 2014 toaround 1.4 per OPU in 2018), this period has alsoincluded changes in oocyte transport systems (fromEquitainer to programmable incubator to organtransport boxes) and follicle flushing solutions (fromembryo flushing medium supplemented with hepa-rin sodium, to a commercial oocyte recovery mediumincluding reagent grade heparin). However, sincethese changes were not randomized, it is difcult toprove the suspicion that, for example, the preserva-tives in the heparin solution were compromisingresults. In addition, the realization that there is astrong mare effect, and communicating this to cli-ents, has led to an increasing bias to \"reliably pro-ducing\" mares, which will in itself have contributedto an improvement in overall results. The authorsalso advise clients to avoid using refrozen semensince, although there are reports of satisfactory re-sults in other programs, they have produced only 1blastocyst and saw very low cleavage rates ( /H1102110% compared to 68.5%) when using refrozen semen from4 different stallions on the oocytes from 9 mares. In terms of expectation, with the right equipment and an experienced team, average oocyte recoveryfrom immature follicles should be around 50%; how-ever, low recovery is not necessarily a predictor ofpoor blastocyst production. Importantly, oocytescan be shipped overnight at 22\u00b0C to a dedicatedequine ICSI lab, with little or no loss of fertility 3as long as the temperature is maintained. Moreover, embryo production ( /H110221 blastocyst per treatment cy- cle) and pregnancy after transfer of ICSI embryos(70%) are, respectively, better than or only a littleworse than for conventional ET. This is particu-larly true for aged mares ( /H1102220 years) that, although they yield fewer oocytes, still achieve blastocyst pro-duction per injected oocyte and likelihoods of preg-nancy and pregnancy maintenance after transfer ofthose embryos similar to young mares (i.e., they donot suffer from the age-related losses seen for otherbreeding techniques mating, articial in-semination (AI), ET]). In addition, OPU-ICSI of-fers a route to producing embryos from some poorlyfertile stallions, and for making efcient use of lim-ited semen. On the other hand, ICSI embryos seemto be more exacting in terms of the synchrony of therecipient mare (day 3 and 4 after ovulation are bet-ter than days 5 and 6), while pregnancy losses aftertransfer of ICSI embryos are currently higher (8-15%) than for other breeding techniques, such thatapproximately 50% to 60% of transferred ICSI em-bryos can be expected to result in the birth of a livefoal. 2Finally, while major complications of OPU are uncommon, around 20% of mares suffer from post-procedure abdominal discomfort, fever or distallimb edema mostly for only 1 to 2 days but occasion-ally for longer. Although the symptoms are usuallymild and can be countered by administration ofNSAIDs and moderate exercise, this can be a reasonfor owners of actively competing sport horses to de-cide not to use OPU.

Ferris, DVM, presenting author. \u00a9 Obtaining a pregnancy from equine oocyte aspira- tion has changed signicantly from 1990s. 1,2Initially this technology uti- lized oocyte transfer in which the oocyte from adominant follicle was surgically transferred into theoviduct of a recipient. 3This recipient mare would be inseminated to the stallion of choice resulting ina pregnancy in the recipient mare from the donormare's oocyte. With the addition of intracytoplas-mic sperm injection (ICSI) and embryo culture tech-niques, today it is common to aspirate either or evenboth dominant and immature oocytes for fertiliza-tion via ICSI and culture until a blastocyst stageembryo can be transferred via traditional nonsurgi- cal transfer. 4-6 With the large expense and time commitment to adding an ICSI lab to an existing facility very fewprivate practices have added this technology to theirclinical programs. As technology has advanced it iscommon today to aspirate immature follicles at asatellite facility and ship the recovered oocytes to anICSI laboratory of choice for fertilization. 7-10The resulting embryos can be either transferred to recip-ient mares at the ICSI lab, shipped back to thesatellite aspiration center for transfer into a recipi-ent mare or frozen for later transfer.The goal of this article is to discuss the costs associated with adding oocyte aspiration to yourclinical program. Also discussed will be the poten-tial prots that can be generated by adding thisservice to your clinical program, especially if your service already provides reproductive work includ-ing embryo transfer. Immature follicle aspirationwill mainly be discussed as this will be likely themost convenient aspect to add to a clinical program. 2. Costs to Add Oocyte Aspiration to Your Practice Facilities While many general broodmare exams can be per- formed in client stalls or very simple stocks exposedto the weather, oocyte aspiration necessitates anupgrade to a facility which temperature can be con-trolled. Facilities for oocyte aspiration range fromsterile surgery suites to exam areas with doors thatcan be closed for climate control. At a minimum,facilities should consist of a room with doors thatcan be closed to minimize airflow, that are routinelycleaned and able to be kept warm. The idea is tohave a room that is able to minimize contaminationof equipment/media and help with temperaturemaintenance of the media used in oocyte collection.Additionally, a climate-controlled lab is necessary 374 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES NOTESfor performing the initial search, washing, and pack- aging of the oocytes. A set of stocks is crucial for success in an oocyte aspiration program. It is ideal for the mare to bestable during the aspiration process. The stocksshould either have moveable panels or ability to addfoam blocks alongside the mare to help stabilize themare. This becomes especially important when as-pirating both small (Quarter Horse, Arabian) maresand large (warmblood) mares. It is difcult in these proceedings to include the costs of facility upgrades necessary to add oocyteaspiration to your program. Some facilities mayalready have existing facilities that can be utilizedat no or minimal additional cost as compared toother facilities that will have signicant nancialinvestments. Equipment Ultrasound A micro convex probe with needle guide is required to perform immature follicle aspiration. For mostreproductive practices at a minimum, this will re-quire purchase of the probe and a needle guide (Ta-ble 1). If the practice's current ultrasound machinedoes not have a micro convex probe available it maybe possible to invest in a new ultrasound machine toperform oocyte aspiration. Aspiration Pump A vacuum pump with pressure release valve capable of maintaining a negative pressure of 150 mm Hg.These pumps can range from those used in human invitro fertilization (IVF) labs to being available at a hardware store 10(Table 1). Microscope Practitioners who are interested in adding oocyte aspiration typically already have a moderate to highcaseload in equine embryo transfer. The same ste-reomicroscope likely can be utilized for the identi-cation of equine oocytes. Note that equine oocytesare typically around 120 microns in size as com-pared to embryos at 250 to 1000 /H11001microns in size. Depending on the microscope the magnication ca-pabilities may have to be upgraded to allow easyidentication and evaluation of equine oocytes. A warming stage for the microscope is ideal to prevent excessive cooling of the media recoveredfrom the mare (Table 1). Warming Plate A warming plate is helpful to be able to keep media, lters, and recovery oocytes at a stable temperaturewhile searching and not having to keep these itemsin an incubator away from the microscope (Table 1).While the warming stage for the microscope can beutilized for this, it is easy to accidentally knock overa dish of recovered oocytes while continuing tosearch the aspiration fluid for additional oocytes. Oocyte Shipping Device Immature oocytes require maintenance of tempera- ture at around room temperature during shipment.This can be achieved using a battery-powered incu-bator for shipment or passive cooling devices.

Incubator An incubator to maintain the temperature of fluids used for the aspiration procedure, lters or flasks(Table 1). Staff A brief overview of the oocyte aspiration procedureto highlight stafng requirements for this proce-dure. During the aspiration the mare will be heav-ily sedated and kept at this plane of anesthesiaduring the oocyte aspiration procedure. During theoocyte aspiration procedure, the veterinarian willposition the ovary transrectally in alignment withthe aspiration probe in the vaginal vault. The nee-dle will be advanced into the follicle, the follicularfluid removed, and the follicular wall will be scrapedand then rinsed. Depending on the training eitherthe veterinarian will manipulate the needle toscrape the follicular wall or an assistant will manip-ulate the needle and rinse the follicle. In eithersituation a second assistant is necessary, in additionto the person maintaining sedation, to rinse thefollicle regardless to who manipulates the needle. While most reproductive procedures do not re- quire personnel with signicant training, it is idealin the authors' opinion to have at least 2 trainedpersonnel to assist with oocyte aspirations. Atleast 1 trained person is necessary to continue main-taining the level of sedation/analgesia in the mare,helping to assist in positioning the mare. It is ex-pected from setting up to nal cleaning after theaspiration to allocate 90 to 120 minutes per session.A trained assistant can prove invaluable simply set-ting up the equipment and media for the procedure. A second person is strongly recommended to flush media into the follicle as the follicular wall isscraped with the needle. This allows one staffmember to assist the veterinarian while performingthe aspiration and one staff member to maintainsedation and position the mare. This person's ex-perience level will depend if the veterinarian is po-sitioning the ovary and spinning the needle or if theassistant is spinning the needle while the veterinar-ian positions the ovary. In the authors' clinical program a technician is available to help keep the mare positioned and toadminister sedation as required per the veterinari-an's instruction. A second veterinarian assistsduring the procedure by spinning the needle andflushing the follicle. In the authors' program, thisarrangement of one veterinarian positioning theovary against the transducer and a second veteri-narian handling the needle to puncture the follicle,scrape the follicular wall, and rinse the follicle hasled to the highest oocyte recovery rate in the au-thors' program. This may be due to the veterinar-ian expertise in visualizing the ultrasound screenand ability to better assess positioning of the needle within the follicle. Additionally, by having anotherstaff veterinarian assist with the procedure, it pre-vents the practice from having to have additionaltechnicians on the payroll for a limited number ofprocedures each year. Each practice will have to evaluate their individual needs and stafng to eco-nomically justify adding more staff members. Training Most practices interested in adding oocyte aspira-tion services will require some training in the oocyteaspiration technique. This should be performedthrough a combination of continuing educationcourses, working with the ICSI lab that the clinicplans to ship the majority of the oocytes and prac-ticing on nonclient mares (Table 1). When the authors' practice started an oocyte as- piration program, the combined team for oocyte as-piration had a good understanding of the procedurebut had not aspirated many mares together. Theentire aspiration team traveled to an ICSI facilityfor training. This allowed all aspects of the proce-dure to be covered for each specic team member.In addition to training in the aspiration, oocytesearching, and packing procedures, additional as-pects such as items that were required in inventory,facilities, and set up for the procedure, and cleaningas well as maintenance of equipment after the pro-cedure is performed. After initial training, approx-imately 12 practice sessions were performed beforeperforming a client mare aspiration (Table 1). Tokeep the aspiration team in sync for performingaspirations a mare is aspirated (client or practiceowned) every 2 weeks at a minimum. This sched-ule allowed for streamlining the process and prepa-ration for any client aspirations that presented. At the end of the 12 practice sessions, the recov- ered oocytes were sent to the ICSI lab to conrmthat blastocyst rates were within the expectedrange. This nal conrmation allows the practitio-ner to feel condent that clients are receiving theappropriate level of service with this new clinicaltechnique. Disposable Items There are numerous disposable items utilized dur-ing the aspiration procedure. This paper will notdiscuss the cost individually of disposable items incontext of this manuscript. In 2018, the averagecost of an oocyte aspiration in the authors' practicewas approximately $220 (labor not included). Thisincludes the antibiotics and non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), media,fluid new aspiration search dishes,and pipettes. This gure represents the entire costfor the procedure to place the oocytes into a shippingcontainer for transport to an ICSI lab. While somefacilities will have better purchasing power or willsterilize some of the disposable items for addi- 376 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIEStional uses, this price will be realistic for the av- erage small to medium reproduction center. 3. Prots Oocyte Aspirations The easy number to calculate prots from is the number of oocyte aspiration sessions performed peryear. Looking at facilities that offer oocyte aspira-tion as a service, the price to the client ranges from$300-1450 with an average of $992.25 per oocyteaspiration session. For the remainder of the dis-cussion a simple $1,000 price per aspiration willbe used. This price includes the nal price to theclient for the mare management of the cycle, aspi-ration procedure, sedation, antibiotics (as adminis-tered), NSAIDs (as administered), as well assearching and packaging the oocytes for shipment.These prices do not include the rental of the incuba-tor for shipment or the cost of the shipment itself. Other Revenue Streams Processing Deceased Ovaries With the ability to perform oocyte aspirations, the facility should also be comfortable handling ovariesfrom deceased mares and have the required equip-ment for collection of oocytes. Oocytes are morestable than whole ovaries for shipment, and whenpossible, the referring facility should dissect the ova-ries to obtain the oocytes for shipment. To optimizeoutcome, the recovered oocytes can be shipped to anICSI laboratory for fertilization. The average costto process ovaries is $700 not including shippingdevice rental or shipping fees. A note on offering this service: in theory it may seem that you can offer this for a signicant regionof your area; however, due to travel times it mayactually be faster for horse owners/veterinarians be-yond a 2-4-hour drive time to ship the ovaries di-rectly to an ICSI facility for processing, because theshipping time to you and to the ICSI facility may besimilar. Clients' Other Mares for Traditional Breeding/Embryo Transfer In the authors' practice's experience, if a client uti- lizes this program for oocyte aspiration services,they will typically utilize services for breeding othermares and embryo transfer. This was found to betrue in 65% of the owners of the practice's oocytedonors. This resulting increase in caseload maynot have been available without offering oocyte as-piration as a service. This is a difcult revenuestream to track and may vary extensively dependingon location and year-to-year variability. Marketing Many clients are investigating ICSI as an option for their mares. Once the overall costs of ICSI andexpected outcomes are explained, many owners rec-ognize that their mare does not warrant performing these advanced techniques. However, when clientscall to investigate these services they ask questionsabout other options such as embryo transfer or in-semination; these discussions often provide an in-creased revenue stream from the initial phone callregarding oocyte aspiration services. 4. Return on Investment The costs to add oocyte aspiration will be approxi-mately /H11011$14,000 to $58,000 plus potential upgrades to facilities to allow the service to be offered. Theaverage cost per procedure in disposable equipmentis $220 plus labor. The authors' practice gures 3equivalent veterinary hours ($200 per hour) and 3equivalent technician hours ($15 per hour) are uti-lized on every aspiration resulting in a total of $645dollars in labor for each aspiration procedure. Thetotal cost for an aspiration session in the authors'practice is /H11011$865. With the average cost of an oocyte aspiration to the client of $1000, this leaves anet prot for the practice of $135. If a break-even return is assumed on investment over a 5-year period for the $14,000 initial invest-ment in equipment and training to add oocyte aspi-ration to the practice, $2,800 in prot will need to begenerated each year. With $135 prot per aspira-tion, this equates to approximately 20 aspirationsessions per year to pay off the initial investment. 12 5. Discussion The ability to have satellite facilities that can per-form oocyte aspirations and ship the oocytes to cen-tral ICSI laboratories is of interest to the horse andveterinary communities. This technology, muchlike shipped cooled semen, allow owners to utilizecutting edge services without having to transporttheir mare to a distant facility for both the oocyteaspiration and ICSI procedure. The ability to shipoocytes for ICSI may be a signicant considerationin older mares or mares with severe musculoskeletalissues (i.e., laminitis) that prevent the horse frombeing hauled a signicant distance. For the practitioner, the ability to ship oocytes allows for the addition of high-end services withoutthe added expense of also adding an ICSI facility.For many practitioners with an established practiceand embryo transfer clients, the cost investment toadd oocyte aspiration is minimal. For the ambula-tory practitioner with a high reproduction caseload thecost of adding facilities and equipment may be too highto warrant adding this service. A thorough evalua-tion of the practice and client base should be consid-ered to determine the practice's exact cost to addoocyte aspirations and if there are enough clients look-ing for this service to warrant the investment. In the authors' practice, oocyte aspiration is a protable investment but not as highly protable astraditional breeding or embryo transfer. However,due to the increase in revenue from other servicesgenerated from either additional mares that accom- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 377HOW TO INCORPORATE ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIESpany an oocyte donor or from a marketing aspect, offering oocyte aspiration has proven to be a soundnancial investment by the authors' practice. Manyclients comment that they wish they had moved toICSI several years earlier. In conclusion, for many practices, oocyte aspira- tion can be a protable service to consider adding.Careful nancial evaluation is warranted to deter-mine the exact cost of the investment and surveyingclients to conrm that the caseload is present in thepractice's region to warrant offering this service.

Introduction Corticosteroids are the most effective drugs for equine asthma, but their systemic and inhalant useis associated with potential side effects, as theyinduce cortisol suppression. 1-3Ciclesonide has a low oral bioavailability, and a low afnity for glucocorti-coid receptors while in its inactive form, which in-creases 100 times after activation in the lungs. 4Due to this favorable prole, ciclesonide might be a valu-able drug for the treatment of horses with asthma. 2. Materials and Methods Using a crossover placebo controlled, blinded, random-ized design, 16 horses with severe equine asthma inexacerbation of the disease were enrolled in threedose-titration studies (8 horses/study). The effects ofdifferent doses of inhaled ciclesonide administered for a 2-week period on clinical scores, lung function, andserum cortisol were investigated. Systemic dexa-methasone served as a positive control and placebo asa negative control. 3. Results Both ciclesonide and dexamethasone signicantly im-proved clinical scores, pulmonary resistance, and pul-monary elastance after 7 days of treatment. Serumcortisol suppression occurred with dexamethasonefrom day 3 of treatment up to day 3 post-treatment,but not with ciclesonide at any tested doses. 4.

Introduction Dipyrone has been shown to effectively reduce fever 6 hours following intravenous (IV) administration inhorses. 1Rapid reduction in fever is clinically ben- ecial to minimize systemic effects. 2. Materials and Methods Two studies were conducted under similar condi-tions in adult horses with respiratory disease andfever (rectal temperature /H11350102.0\u00b0F). Dipyrone was dosed at 30 mg/kg IV. Signicance was deter-mined via Wilcoxon rank sum test. Study 1 was an unmasked single group study ( n/H11005 8). Rectal temperatures were measured pre-doseand 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-hours post-dose. Study 2 was a masked, randomized, placebo- controlled, cross-over study ( n/H1100531). In Phase 1 and 2, rectal temperatures were measured pre-doseand 4- and 6-hours post-dose. If fever was present24 hours following treatment, horses were crossedover to Phase 2. 3. Results In Study 1, dipyrone reduced fever ( /H113501\u00b0F) in seven horses (87.5%), with a return to normothermia(/H113502\u00b0F) in six horses (75%).

Introduction Equine influenza virus (EIV) is an infectious pathogen causing respiratory disease. Surveillance in theUnited States reported that EIV is commonly detectedin horses even with adequate vaccine protocols andbiosecurity programs. Molecular modication of thehemagglutinin (HA) gene by 1) antigenic drift, and/or2) introduction of foreign strains could influence theefcacy of vaccines. This study explored two scenar-ios of EIV vaccine failure by m odern epidemiological and evolutionary methods. 2. Materials and Methods This study included the sequence of the HA gene of58 EIV H3N8 strains collected from the UnitedStates from 2012 to 2017 and combined with 182 HAgene of global EIV. Phylodynamics were used toreconstruct the transmission patterns of EIV. An-tigenic drift and amino acid selection pressures in the HA gene of EIV in the United States were eval-uated to address how amino acid substitutions inthe HA gene is advantageous in the evolutionaryprocess. 3. Results and Discussion Phylodynamic analysis showed that foreign EIV strains have not been circulating in the United States.Only EIV Florida Clade 1 strains have been circulat-ing in the United States and have evolved separatelyfrom Clade 2 strains. EIV Florida Clade 1 xed 11amino acid substitutions in the HA gene compared tovaccine strains. The results support that antigenicdrift of EIV in the United States is the likelyreason for vaccine failure and vaccine strains shouldbe updated. 382 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE AIR IN HERE: MANAGEMENT OF RESPIRATORY DISEASE IN HORSES Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESAcknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of Vet- erinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Fungi contribute to pulmonary inflammation in horses with recurrent airway obstruction and in some formsof human asthma. The aim of this study was to eval-uate the prevalence of fungi in the respiratory samplesof horses, describe clinical signs associated with thepresence of fungi in respiratory samples, and assessthe risk factors associated with inflammatory airwaydisease (IAD) and with the presence of fungi in theairways. 2. Materials and Methods A prospective observational study was performedon 731 active horses referred for signs of respiratorydisease or poor performance.

Medical-grade honey has beenused topically to treat wound infections but there is nodata in human or veterinary medicine describing itsuse as an intra-incisional prophylactic agent. 2. Materials and Methods Horses that underwent colic surgery between May 2017 and December 2018 and survived for /H110222 weeks were included in the study. Horses were randomlyassigned to treatment and control. In the treat-ment group, following closure of the linea alba, medical- grade honey (L-mesitran soft ointment) was placed in the incision and closure continued routinely.Information regarding the incision and postoperativecomplications was obtained at 4 different time points(24 hours, 48 hours, 5 days, and 14 days). 3.

The intraclass correlation coefcient indicates that individuallaryngeal factors have a signicant effect on airway impedance beyond that of the surgical procedurealone. Authors' address: Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University Saskatoon, 1. Introduction Laryngoplasty is the procedure of choice for left re- current laryngeal neuropathy (RLN); however, par-tial arytenoidectomy (PA) has also been successful.Removal of the corniculate process of the arytenoidcartilage is simple and less invasive than a PA. The hypothesis of the study was that a corniculec-tomy and a laryngoplasty would be equally efca-cious in improving airway impedance aftersimulating left RLN. 2. Materials and Methods Using a previously published dynamic flow model,peak exercise conditions were replicated to evaluatesimulated RLN, a larynges. Tracheal flowand pressure, and chamber pressure, were recorded.Impedance, calculated from the flow and pressurechange, was compared between procedures for each larynx.

Introduction The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of arytenoid function grade prior to laryngo-plasty and ventriculocordectomy (LPVC) on postop-erative performance. 2. Materials and Methods Medical and race records of Thoroughbred race-horses diagnosed with Grade gradeon return to racing and average earnings/start wasdetermined by a multivariable Cox proportionalhazard model and multivariable linear regressionanalysis. 3. Results In a multivariable logistic regression, Grade III.2and III.3 horses had 1.83 times higher odds of returnto racing than Grade IV ( P/H110050.02). A multivari- able Cox's proportional hazard analysis controllingfor race prior to surgery ( P/H110210.01) showed that the likelihood of racing postoperatively was not differentbetween Grade III.1 and Grade IV ( P/H110050.61) and that horses with Grades III.2 and III.3 tended to bemore likely to race IV ( P/H110050.08). Kaplan-Meier survival anal- ysis showed that Grade IV horses took a longer timeto return to racing than Grade III.1 and Grade III.2and III.3.

Introduction Obesity has been shown to increase postoperative morbidity and mortality in humans due to its nu-merous effects on multiple body systems. Obesityin the equine population is a growing problem, yetthe impact of increased body condition on surgicalmorbidity has not been investigated. Body massindex (BMI) has been shown in horses to correlatewell with body condition scores and circulatinglevels of adipokines, and thus, can serve as an ob-jective estimation for obesity. The objective of thisstudy was to determine if horses with increasedbody fat, as estimated by BMI, are more incisional complications fol-lowing emergency ventral midline celiotomy. 2. Materials and Methods Medical records of horses /H110222 years old presenting with colic that underwent ventral midline celiotomybetween January 2010 and September 2018 withfollow up of a minimum of 30 postoperative days were reviewed. Extracted data included signalment, oper-ative details, and outcome. Body mass index (BMI)was calculated by dividing the patient's weight (kg) bythe withers height squared (m 2). 3. Results Two hundred eighty-seven horses met inclusion cri-teria. Incisional complication incidence was 23.7%.Horses with incisional complications had a higher BMI (median, 203.6 kg/m 2) compared to those with- out (median, 199.1 kg/m2)(P/H11005.03).

Introduction Previous literature has inconsistently identied age as a risk factor for development of postoperativereflux (POR), the authors hypothesized that this isdue to the predisposition for older horses to have astrangulating small intestinal (SI) lesion. 2. Materials and Methods A retrospective study of 44 geriatric (aged /H1135016 years) and 39 mature non-geriatric (aged 2-15 years) horsespresenting to the Royal Veterinary College, Universityof London between December 2009 and June 2015with a SI surgical lesion was conducted. Periopera-tive variables were evaluated for associations withoutcomes using multivariable logistic regression. 3. Results POR was associated with an increasing admissionpacked cell volume (PCV) (odds ratio [OR], 1.00-1.16; 4.61; 95% CI, 1.3-15.69; P/H11005.014). High-volume POR was associated with admissionblood glucose concentration (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.40; P/H11005.041), presence of nasogastric (OR, CI, POR P/H11005.001) were associated with non-sur- vival. Age, considered as both a continuous and cat-egorical variable, was not associated with thedevelopment of POR, high-volume POR, or withnon-survival. 4.

It is generally accepted that surgicalintervention should be combined with some type ofadjunctive treatment for the best results. 2. Materials and Methods Medical records of horses that underwent treatmentfor SCC of the limbus conrmed by histopathologyfrom April 2002 to January 2019 were reviewed ( n/H11005 49). Horses were included if follow-up of at least 6months was available. Data were analyzed using anon-parametric Spearman correlation analysis todetermine the association between tumor recur-rence and age, sex, eye affected, previous treatment,lesion size and location, treatment performed, sur-gical margins, and use of UV light protection. Mul-tivariable logistic regression was then used to determine the overall signicance despite confound-ing variables.3. Results None of the examined variables had a signicant as- sociation with recurrence. The most common limballocation affected was the lateral limbus. Sixteenhorses had rep orted recurrence at a median time of 7 months. Of those with recurrence, 10 resultedin enucleation. All horses remained systemicallyhealthy with no evidence of metastasis. 4. Discussion Prognosis for horses with limbal SCC that have beentreated with surgical keratectomy and adjunctivetreatment is good for globe retention. Long-termprognosis for the horse is excellent.

Introduction Bladder stones occur with some frequency in equine patients with urinary tract disease, accounting for69% of horses (47/68) with urolithiasis in one study. 1 Common presenting signs include hematuria, oftenpost-exercise, signs of colic, and altered urinationsuch as pollakiuria, dysuria, etc. 1-7Urolithiasis is a common indication for ultrasound of the urinarytract and is often performed after a bladder stone isidentied on rectal palpation. Bladder stones arereadily visible via transrectal ultrasound using ba-sic curvilinear how-ever, the urinary tract. Nephroliths mayproduce nonspecic or no clinical signs, includingunremarkable CBC or chemistry panel. Nephro-liths are sometimes found during renal or abdominalultrasound in horses with or without azotemia, pal-pable left renal enlargement, or signs consistentwith renal disease. 4,8 Because of the frequency of uroliths beyond the bladder, ultrasound of the entire urinary tractseems prudent in all horses with a suspect or con- rmed cystolith.1,7At the authors' hospital, it is not unusual for horses to be referred for removal ofa bladder stone, and ultrasound subsequently re-veals additional uroliths in the ureters or kidneysand/or concurrent renal disease that may affecttreatment, prognosis and life expectancy. While alone cystolith may be the only nding in somehorses, it is not uncommon for ultrasound to dis-cover multifocal uroliths, evidence ndings helpguide treatment. Ultrasound of the urinary tracthas been rewarding at the authors' hospital to man-age horses with bladder stones and has become rou-tine for all horses presenting for evaluation ofurolithiasis over the past 20 years. The purpose of this presentation is to describe transcutaneous and transrectal ultrasonographicevaluation of the urinary tract, including thekidneys, ureters, and and to highlightultrasonographic bladderstones. 402 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE SCIENCE OF SOFT TISSUE SURGERY NOTES2. Materials and Transcutaneous Renal Ultrasound A low-frequency (2-5 MHz) curvilinear transducer is necessary to evaluate adult equine kidneys. Ide-ally, the hair should be clipped with #40 blades, theskin washed, and ultrasound gel applied. Alcoholsaturation is acceptable in appropriate cases (thinhair coat, thin or lightweight horses), but it shouldbe recognized that subtle ndings may be missedwithout clipping in many horses. An abdominalprogram (aka preset, exam type) should be selectedand time-gain-compensation controls adjusted ap-propriately for deep cavity imaging. Frequencymay need to be reduced to improve penetration inharder to image horses. The left kidney is visible in the left paralumbar fossa and left 15th to 17th intercostal spaces deep tothe spleen at a scanning depth of 20-30 cm. Theright kidney is seen dorsally in the right 15th to17th intercostal spaces adjacent to the body wallat a scanning depth of 15-20 cm and cannot beimaged transrectally. Care should be taken notto misinterpret the hypoechoic area within thedeep medullary portion of the right kidney as amass or abscess. Ultrasonographic renal parameters include size, shape, should beevaluated for and (pyelecta-sia). Reported renal measurements are somewhatvariable. 9-10In the authors' experience, most kid - neys in adult horses measure between 6 and 8 cm inwidth and 15-20 cm in length, depending on horsesize, (i.e., a small Quarter Horse would be expectedto have a smaller kidney than a large Warmblood). Nephroliths appear as hyperechoic structures within the renal pelvis that cast hard shadows. 2,4,7,8 The normal hyperechoic appearance of the renal pelvis should not be confused with nephroliths.Nephroliths can be variable in size, unilateral orbilateral, singular or multiple (Fig. 1). Some canbecome large enough to distort the entire kidney andrender it nearly unrecognizable. Renal sludgewithin the renal pelvis can appear similar to neph-roliths, but often produces a less distinct shadowand does not distort the margins of the pelvis.Horses with an obstructive urolith within the corre-sponding ureter or even at the trigone region of thebladder may create proximal ureteral distentionthat may extend into the renal pelvis. Hydrone-phrosis may also be a nding in horses with long-standing obstructions (Fig. 2A). Fig. 1. Nephroliths (arrows) within the left kidney from 3 horses with concurrent bladder stones.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 403THE SCIENCE OF SOFT TISSUE SURGERYKidneys should also be evaluated for evidence of chronic renal failure.2,4,6-8Affected horses may show one or two end-stage kidney(s). End-stage kidneys are small and distorted with near completeloss of renal architecture, making them challengingto recognize by all but expert ultrasonographers(Fig. 2B). In h orses with one end-stage kidney, the contralateral kidney is often enlarged but re-tains recognizable renal parenchyma (Fig. 2C).Affected horses may present with obstructivenephrolith(s) in the remaining functioning kidneyor an obstructive urolith in the corresponding ure-ter. Evidence of pyelonephritis may also befound in horses with an obstructive ureterolith orcystolith due to ascending infection. Affectedkidneys appear enlarged with increased corticalthickening and echogenicity. Concurrent renalabscessation may be apparent due to ascendinginfection but is relatively unusual. Transrectal Ultrasound A rectal or small microconvex transducer is neces-sary for transrectal evaluation of the bladder andureters. The caudal portion of the left kidney isvisible at arms' length in many horses. If cystos-copy is desired, it should always be performed afterultrasound examination. Gas introduced duringendoscopy will obscure ultrasonographic visibilityand can mimic the appearance of uroliths in allportions of the urinary tract. Bladder The bladder is best evaluated via transrectal ultra- sound, although it may be visible transcutaneouslyfrom the inguinal region in some horses, dependingon the degree of distention. Transrectally, thebladder is seen ventral to the rectum and is oftenlled with varying degrees of echogenic urine due tomucus and crystals commonly found in equine urine(Fig. 3A). This appearance is often confused withpyuria by novice and even intermediate ultrasonog-raphers. Cystoliths can be found at the trigoneregion or in the dependent portion of the bladder(Fig. 3B). They may act as a ball valve by rollingback and forth to cause intermittent obstruction ofthe urethra and ureters when in the trigone region (Fig. 3C). In such cases, bilateral ureteral disten-tion and wall thickening may be evident on trans-rectal ultrasound that occasionally extends to therenal pelvis which may be visible on transcutaneousimaging. Thickening of the bladder wall may benoted but is not a reliable nding in the authors'experience. It should also be noted that a recentlyemptied bladder can appear falsely thickened. Ureters The right and left ureters are evaluated separately by beginning at the trigone region of the bladder andfollowing each as far proximally as possible. Thesmall size and maneuverability of a microconvextransducer makes it the probe of choice to obtaintransverse views of the ureters along their entirevisible lengths (Fig. 4). The use of a rectal trans-ducer to evaluate the caudal ureters has been de-scribed 11; however, this transducer is difcult and potentially risky to manipulate within the rectum for evaluation of the proximal and mid-ureteral re-gions. With a microconvex transducer, transverseviews of the left ureter can be obtained from thetrigone to the left kidney. Due to the right kidney'scranial location beyond arm's reach, the right ureteris slightly less visible, with visibility ending caudalto the ureteropelvic junction. The normal ureter is a small (approximately 1 cm) structure that is difcult to identify when collapsed.To begin the exam, ureters are often best identiedcaudally at the bladder trigone, usually at wrist'slength from the anus. Both ureters are often visi-ble at this location on transverse views. The col-lapsed ureter is often only subtly visible to the rightand left of dorsal midline of the bladder. Peristalticwaves will improve ureteral visibility and differen-tiate ureters from blood vessels and the male repro-ductive tract. Ureteral pulses ranged from 1 to 5pulsations every 2 minutes in one study of normalhorses. 11In the authors' experience, ureteral mo - theuse of N-butylscopolammonium bromide atypically reduces motility to such an extent that ureters be- come challenging to identify and is therefore avoided Fig. 3.

Once identi- ed, each ureter is followed cranially along its entirevisible length using transverse views. The mid-ureter region may be more challenging to visualizeas it often makes a small S turn before continuingonto the kidney. Ureteroliths can be found at anylocation along the ureter and may appear smooth orjagged. Ureteral distention and wall thickening iscommon proximal to the ureterolith but may be vis-ible along the length of one or both ureters, even inhorses with lone bladder stones. A single ureter-olith is most common; however, multiple stones inthe same ureter can be found. 3. Results Review of medical records from January 1, 2008through December 31, 2017 identied 32 horsesand one burro ultrasonographicexamination of the urinary tract for bladderstones. Equids ranged in age from 7 to 32 years (median, 17 years). There were 23 geldings and10 mares.

The most common presenting com-plaint was hematuria cases (45%) ofwhich 12 showed post-exercise. Cys-toliths had been diagnosed by the referring veter-inarian in 11 cases of which 6 were identied onultrasonographic examinations and 4 on rectalpalpation by the referring veterinarian (RDVM).Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine valueswere obtained in 27/33 horses and were within normal reference ranges (BUN, 12-27 mg/dL; cre-atinine, 0.9-2.0 mg/dL) in BUN and creatinine valuesranging from 30 to 80 mg/dL and 2.4-7.2 mg/dL, Fig. 4. Ultrasonographic technique and mid-ureter microconvex transducer is ideal to obtain transverse views along the ureteral length. Note the small size(/H110211 cm) and improved visibility when open during peristaltic waves (C, E, and H). When collapsed, the distal ureter will appear as a slight concavity of the dorsal bladder wall (B) and is even more challenging to visualize in the mid/proximal ureteral regions (F andI) where peristaltic waves identication.

Transcutaneous ultrasound alone wasused to visualize the bladder stone in the lone don-key in the study. Bladder stones measured 1-11cm (median, 6 cm) and all showed a rounded, smoothto slightly irregular, hyperechoic appearance andcast hard shadows. Twenty of 33 cases (61%) hadconcurrent uroliths identied in either the kidney(19) and/or ureters (3). Nephroliths were found in the left kidney in 7 cases, the right kidney in 5 and both kidneys in 7cases. Nephrolithiasis was graded as mild in 12kidneys, including 3 horses that were bilaterallyaffected and 3 horses that were unilaterally affectedas the primary renal nding. Two horses also showed mild pelvic distention, and one horse showedmoderate nephrolithiasis in the opposite kidney.Two additional horses showed moderate unilateralnephrolithiasis as the primary renal nding. Small,difcult-to-recognize, and distorted end-stage kidneyswere identied in 7 horses, including 4 horses wherethe opposite kidney was enlarged and had increasedcortical echogenicity and thickness, 2 horses whoseopposite kidney was normal or showed only mildchanges (increased cortical thickening and echogenic-ity) and another horse that appeared bilaterally endstage. Nearly all end-stage kidneys showed promi-nent mineralization and/or evidence of nephrolith for-mation. Two horses showed severe hydronephrosis,including one described below with an obstructive ure-terolith and an enlarged opposite kidney. Two horsesshowed evidence of moderate renal disease involvingone or both kidneys, including mild enlargement, in-creased renal cortical thickening, and echogenicity butwith easily recognizable renal parenchyma. Onehorse showed bilateral renal pelvic distention as a lonerenal nding. Kidneys appeared within normal lim-its bilaterally in 10 cases and unilaterally in an addi-tional 7 horses. Ureteroliths were identied in three patients, all within the proximal third of the right ureter. Sig-nicant obstruction of the ureter along with severethickening and distention cranial to the ureterolithwas seen in all three cases (Fig. 5). All demon-strated severe renal abnormalities, including severehydronephrosis (same horse as mentioned above),bilateral nephrolithiasis and an end-stage contralat-eral kidney in the second horse and an endstage ipsilateral kidney in the third horse. While two ofthese horses showed azotemia, BUN and creatininewere normal in the horse with hydronephrosis.This horse also had an enlarged contralateral kid-ney, severe bilateral ureteral thickening and thelargest cystolith in this study. Most horses showedmild-to-severe ureteral thickening that often ex-tended the length of the ureters.Treatment and Outcome Surgical procedures were performed in 29 patients. This included standing procedures in 19 cases,including transurethral removal in 8 mares andperineal urethrotomy in 11 geldings, of which 9also underwent lithotripsy to facilitate stone re-moval. Surgery was performed under general an-esthesia in the remaining 10 patients using aparainguinal 8or ventral midline2approach. One of these horses was euthanized on the table after discov- ering multiple tears of the bladder wall. Another 2horses were euthanized due to obstructive ureteroli-thiasis and evidence of severe urinary tract disease.Thirty horses were discharged from the hospital, in-cluding two horses that received no treatment due tothe small size of the cystolith. 4. Discussion Of the 33 equids with cystoliths over this 10-yearstudy period, ultrasonographic evaluation of the uri- nary tract identied additional ndings in nearly70% of cases (23/33). Ultrasound was able to iden-tify severe pathology in several study horses, includ-ing many with normal BUN and creatinine. Theseincluded horses with obstructive ureteroliths, end-stage kidneys and evidence of chronic renal failure,which would be expected to signicantly affectshort- and long-term prognosis. Whereas ndingswere considered mild in several horses, these in-cluded small to moderate size nephroliths in at leastone kidney. It would seem possible that the pres-ence of nephroliths would increase the risk for re-current bladder stones; however, this was notevaluated in this study due to the relatively lownumbers of horses that returned to the authors'hospital in subsequent years. For many owners,cystolith removal was performed to relieve thehorse's current clinical signs and they were willingto accept the risk of possible recurrence. The abil-ity for owners to make an informed decision wasespecially important in horses with obstructive ure-teroliths and/or extensive urinary tract disease fromwhich they were unlikely to recover, even with blad-der stone removal. Although ultrasonographic ndings did not often dissuade owners from pursuing surgical removal ofcystic calculi, this information was felt to be impor-tant in the decision-making process. Long-termfollow up to determine the rate of recurrence and/orrelationship between additional ultrasonographicndings and life expectancy would be benecial inthe future. Certainly, visualization of concurrentobstructive ureteroliths was felt to be a signicantnding, seen in 2 of the 3 horses with azotemia.One of these horses underwent lithotripsy fragmen-tation of the ureterolith in addition to standing blad-der stone removal. The other two horses withureteroliths were euthanized due to the extent ofrenal pathology which was conrmed on necropsyexamination. 406 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE SCIENCE OF SOFT TISSUE SURGERYTreatment recommendations for horses with a single cystolith as the primary nding were rela-tively straightforward. Bladder stones are typi-cally removed via perineal urethrostomy in males ormanually through the urethra in females. When-ever possible, stones are removed intact. Multipletechniques to break up stones have been used at theUniversity of California, Davis (UC Davis), includ-ing Knowle's forceps, radial shock wave lithotripsy,laser lithotripsy, and less often, hammer and chiselfragmentation. 12Most recently, the addition of a laparoscopic specimen retrieval pouch has been used to aid in the removal of cystoliths.13Nephrolith removal has been attempted in some horses but hasbeen met with limited success. Removal of ureter- oliths via a standing flank approach has also beendescribed but was not performed in any studycases. 14 It should also be mentioned that all cases were evaluated in a systematic manner by one of twohighly experienced ultrasonographers (MBW, BV)at an academic institution with a service dedicatedto large animal ultrasonography. Over the same10-year period, 172 scans were performed of theentire urinary tract by the UC Davis Large AnimalUltrasound Service, and this number excludes addi-tional horses presenting for complete abdominalultrasound examinations.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 407THE SCIENCE OF SOFT TISSUE SURGERYperience and expertise will affect image acquisition and interpretation. While ultrasound of the blad-der is straightforward, ultrasound of the ureters ismore challenging due to their small size and relativelack of visibility when collapsed. Ureteral peristal-tic waves are helpful to differentiate the ureter fromsurrounding structures with similar appearances,including blood vessels and portions of the malereproductive tract; however, one must exhibit pa-tience while scanning in many horses because pul-sations may be as infrequent as one every 2minutes. 11In horses with cystoliths, including many of those reported herein, the ureters were thickened and distended which signicantly facili-tated visualization. Transcutaneous evaluation ofthe kidneys also requires experience. Pitfalls in-clude overinterpretation of the normally hyper-echoic renal pelvis as nephroliths. Furthermore,the edges of the normal renal pelvis can create smallshadows due to edge artifact, creating even morecause for misinterpretation. In horses with end-stage kidneys, there is often so much renal distor-tion and mineral/nephrolith content that the kidneyis hard to recognize and may appear similar to largeintestine. In summary, ultrasonographic evaluation of the entire urinary tract, including transcutaneous andtransrectal approaches, is possible in many horsesand can reveal signicant additional ndings inhorses with cystoliths to enable owners to makebetter informed decisions. These ndings should be considered before surgical removal of cystic calculi inaffected horses. Lastly, it should be emphasized thatultrasound must be performed prior to cystoscopy.Gas introduced during bladder endoscopy can obscurelarge portions of the urinary tract, and its hyperechoicappearance can be misinterpreted as uroliths.

Introduction It is not uncommon for many in equine practice, both veterinarians and support staff, to feel resentment,discomfort, or guilt associated with unmet personalor employer expectations, unrealistic client de-mands, and the difculty of maintaining the elusive\"work-life balance.\" Equine practice is wroughtwith challenging scenarios that cause feelings ofbeing trapped without any positive options for afullling career, one where we can spend more timedoing the things we love and less time managing theaspects of practice that lead to burnout and discon-tent. Although many factors can contribute tothese issues, an inability to set clear boundaries isone of the most common causes of resentment andstress in the workplace. 1,2The purpose of this dis- cussion is to better understand what it means to set boundaries as well as identify skill sets thatwill allow veterinary professionals to more readilyset boundaries in order to have a more successfulcareer. Dening what it means to set personal and pro- fessional boundaries is often complicated and chal-lenging. However, Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. JohnTownsend, leading investigators of effective bound-ary setting, make understanding boundaries easy by explaining that they are simply a property linethat denes what we are responsible for and whatwe are not responsible for. They write, \"We areexpected to deal with our own feelings, attitudes,and behaviors ... even though it takes effort.\" 3 Dr. Brene Brown denes setting boundaries likethis: \"Setting boundaries is making clear what'sokay and what's not okay, and why.\" 2Doing the difcult personal work associated with what itlooks like in our lives to draw our property line,dene for ourselves and others what's okay andwhat's not okay, and then clearly communicatethat to those we are in a relationship with iscritical and involves a few foundational skill sets.These skills include the following: 1. Identify your 2-3 core values. 2. Operationalize your core values.3. Create property lines that protect you as you live into your values. 4. Guard your property lines.5. Respect the boundaries of others. It is impossible to live into your values and draw clear boundaries around them if you cannot clearly AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 411LIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS: EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUT NOTESarticulate what matters to you or succinctly name your values. And although many of us value manythings, it is important to identify which values youhold most important. A helpful question to con-sider in this process comes from Dr. Brown's book,Dare to Lead . \"What boundaries need to be in place for me to be in my integrity and generous with myassumptions about the intentions, words, and ac-tions of others?\" 2Dr. Brown's work in this area is very helpful and she has created a tool to help iden- tify core values at the following Web site: https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/w p-content/uploads/2019/ 02/Values.pdf. Once core values are identied, they must be op- erationalized and property lines drawn, one of thekey steps leading to clear boundaries. Operation-alizing values involves identifying specic behaviorsthat are tied to those values. For example, if one ofyour core values is family, operationalization of thatvalue might look like establishing a schedule thatensures you are home 3 of 5 nights/week in time tospend meaningful time with your spouse, signicantother or children. It is essentially determiningwhat it looks like to practice what we preach orwalk the talk. These questions, from Dr. Brown'sresearch, are helpful: \"Did I respect my ownboundaries in the situation? Was I clear with my-self and then others about what's okay and what'snot okay?\" 2 Drs Cloud, Townsend, and Brown all agree, based on their research, that one of the best ways to pro-tect our boundaries is to learn the importance of theword, no. Learning and becoming comfortable withthe idea that no is a complete sentence and learningto use it as such is an important skill to master. 2,3 Cloud and Townsend write, \"The most basic bound-ary-setting word is no. It lets others know that you exist apart from them and that you are in control ofyou.\" 3 Finally, just as important as setting our own boundaries is acknowledging and respecting theboundaries of others. This is sometimes a challeng-ing issue for many of us, as equine practice has atendency to default to \"paying your dues\" as the wayto success. We want new practitioners to followthe same path to success that we followed whichoften includes long hours, always being available forclients and a belief that only one way to practice isright. As equine practitioners begin to re-inventpractice around strategies that honor multiple corevalues, our ability to respect boundaries willincrease. 2 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Does the prioritization of personalwellness affect the overall practice in a positive ornegative way? Or both? What are the barriers toprioritizing personal wellness coming from withinand from beyond? Which are the bigger barriers? For each equine practitioner, overall personal wellness will look differently, although commonthemes will appear. The term \"wellness\" can beused to attempt to capture physical, mental, andemotional health and wellbeing. Making personalwellness a priority is benecial to the overall healthand robustness of the entire practice. Studies ofphysicians have demonstrated that physician stress,fatigue, burnout, depression, and general psycholog-ical distress negatively affect health-care systemsand patient care. For veterinarians who have tra-ditionally perceived personal wellness to be selsh,thinking of the benets to patient care and the over-all care system can help push for prioritization. Although personal wellness is a holistic approach that should encompass many aspects, this discus-sion will focus on the short-term and daily choicesthat support personal wellness. Taking survey and stock of what/where a practitioner would rate theirphysical, mental, and emotional wellbeing is therst step. If there is a component out of balancefrom what the practitioner desires those levels to be,the next step is to identify and name what the bar-riers are that currently exist to changing that bal-ance. The practitioner should be visualizing whatthe elimination of those barriers would look like,what the impact of introducing personal wellnesswill be for the practitioner and those who work withand rely on the practitioner, and then begin to putthem into practice. The intention is to nd per-sonal wellness as a way to complement veterinarypractice, rather than designed to ght that practice. Some questions for consideration are below: How often do I collaborate or discuss cases with colleagues during the average week? How often do I make decisions because of com- petition with colleagues or other practitionersduring the average week? What expectations do I have about what med- icine can do for my patients? AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 413LIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS: EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUT NOTESHow often do I do things I feel aren't best for the patient because of an owner/trainerrequest? Do I feel failure when I lose a patient? Do I feel personally responsible for the out- come of a case? Do I make and keep appointments with my personal physician, dentist, and/or mentalhealth professional at a level consistent withthe recommendations of those professionals? Do I know how to say no to a request I can't complete? Do I regularly negotiate a response to a re- quest that balances the needs of myself andthe requester?

Introduction There is an increasing trend of veterinarians with equine or large-animal interest and experience leav-ing large-animal practice to either change careersor, more commonly, to practice companion animal(dog/cat) medicine instead. 1This discussion will cover some of the most common reasons that veter-inarians are experiencing \"burnout\" and other rea-sons that are to leave large-animal practice orcausing them to feel dissatised with their careerchoice. The forum will then explore strategies forthe solo practitioner to try to mitigate these issues.The discussion will be focused on the solo ambula-tory veterinarian, but will also cover topics relevantto all large-animal and equine veterinarians. Thegoal of the discussion is to help veterinarians ndways to become more resilient and hopefully moresatised with their career choice, and in return,perhaps help retain more veterinarians in large-animal practice. 2. Discussion What is burnout? According the Merriam Websterdictionary, burnout is the exhaustion of physical oremotional strength as a result of prolonged stress orfrustration, especially from overwork or overuse. 1 The Mayo Clinic describes burnout as work relatedstress: a state of physical or emotional exhaustion that also involves a sense of reduced accomplish-ment or loss of personal identity. Reported causesof burnout are many, but include lack of social sup-port, work-life imbalance, dysfunctional work dy-namics, and a lack of control over workloads andschedules. As a direct result of the work requiredin the medical eld, all healthcare workers are re-ported to be at higher risk of burnout than otherprofessions. 2Veterinarians are not immune to these adverse conditions that can lead to burnout.Of concern relative to this particular discussion, arethe factors that contribute to burnout for the equineveterinarian. Over the last two decades, an increasing number of equine veterinarians have transitioned to work incompanion animal medicine (dog/cat) practice. 3 The most recent American Veterinary Medical As-sociation (AVMA) American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) Economic Report released in2018 suggests that an alarming number of newgraduates are leaving equine practice within therst 5 years after graduation compared to previ-ously. 3For example, in the graduating class of 2000, 20% of AAEP members dropped their AAEPmembership within 4 years of graduation. In con-trast, in the graduating class of 2008, this number AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 415LIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS: EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUT NOTESjumped to 50% within 4 years, and in the class of 2012, more than half (55%) had dropped their AAEPmembership within 4 years of graduation. Addi-tionally, when interviewed, 21% of graduates fromthe classes of 2012-2016 who are still in the equinesector reported that they would like to leave equinepractice. 3As large-animal, equine, and mixed- animal practice owners can attest, it is becoming extremely difcult to hire or retain associate veter-inarians willing to work in large-animal or mixed-animal practice in the current employment market,yet many veterinarians entered veterinary schoolexpressing a desire to become large-animal orequine veterinarians. 4 Why are veterinarians leaving large-animal prac- tice or unwilling to practice it at all? When thisquestion is asked, two key reasons are commonlygiven: nancial stress and the lifestyle associatedwith equine practice. 3New equine practitioners, on average, have a lower starting salary than all other new practitioners.3The average starting sal - ary for new equine associates in the 2016 survey wasroughly $45,000. In comparison, the average start-ing salary for similar graduates who were hired intocompanion animal exclusive positions was $76,000.Additionally, a large number of equine graduatesreported performing an internship compared to com-panion animal veterinarians. The average re-ported salary for equine internships was $26,000.Due to the economic crisis that started in 2006, thehorse population in the United States declined by33% between 2006 and 2012. 4Equine veterinari - ans saw their average income decrease by 6.7% dur-ing that time period. In contrast, companionanimal-exclusive practitioners saw average incomeincrease by 22.7% during the same period of time.When faced with the option to work less hours andmake more money in small-animal medicine, thechoice to leave equine practice is clear for manyequine veterinarians. To compound this nancial motivation, veterinary school tuitions in the United States have tripledbetween 1999 and 2016, 4and student loan interest rates are much higher than they were 15-20 years ago. Veterinary salaries, however, have not in-creased in correlation to this increased cost ofeducation. Large-animal veterinarians have thelowest reported mean incomes compared to othersectors of veterinary medicine. 4Veterinarians are now graduating with more debt than ever before and are often accumulating interest on their loans fasterthan they can repay it. 4The cost of 4 years of veterinary education and living expenses is esti- mated at $127,138 to $363,974 depending on schoolattended, with an average cost of $189,912. Theaverage reported debt incurred during vet schoolwas $141,000 in 2016, with around 5% of graduateshaving more than $300,000 in debt accrued duringveterinary school. Of great concern is that due toincreased costs and lack of increased salaries, thedebt to income ratio is greater than 2:1 for morethan half of all graduates of veterinary schools. 4 (The reported goal of the AVMA is to reduce this debt to income number to 1.4:1.) This nancial pres-sure makes it challenging for new graduates toaccept lower-paying positions in large-animal orequine practices, knowing that they will struggle topay their loans back, even if they truly have a pas-sion for large-animal or equine practice. In thepast, when loan debts and interest rates were lower,it was more feasible for veterinarians to take lower-paying positions in large animal to pursue their\"passion.\" In addition to the nancial aspects, another issue that is frequently cited as a reason for veterinariansfeeling burnt out and leaving large-animal medicineare the long hours and need to be on call for after-hours emergencies. Large-animal veterinarianstraditionally work more hours and more unpredict-able schedules compared to small-animal veterinar-ians. 4As a nature of the practice, large-animal veterinarians tend to see more emergencies and work more weekends, holidays, and after-hourscalls than most small-animal veterinarians. Beingavailable for emergencies is an unavoidable require-ment for most large-animal and equine veterinari-ans, but this requirement can cause signicanthardship for family life and any personal plans orhobbies outside of work. There is rarely an \"emer-gency clinic\" to refer patients to after-hours as thereis in small-animal medicine. Additionally, large-animal clients not only expect after-hours emer-gency services but often require the veterinarian toperform mobile eld calls to their home or farm.Some states even require veterinarians to provideemergency coverage for their clients or have asigned referral agreement with another clinic will-ing to take their emergencies, 5which is not always a convenient option for rural practitioners without a nearby referral hospital. For the solo practitioner,this sense of obligation to be on call all the time canbe stressful, exhausting, frustrating, and is a majorfactor when veterinarians choose to leave the pro-fession to work in a small-animal practice with noafter-hours requirements. Larger practices oftenshare on call among several veterinarians, andsometimes even interns. However, the solo practi-tioner and veterinarians in small practices can eas-ily become overwhelmed when they feel obligated tobe on call every day. When new graduates are look-ing for jobs, a common complaint to employers aboutwhy they don't want to work large animal is thatthey don't want to be on call for emergencies. Thisnegative perception of being on call is worsened ifthe veterinarian previously had to work in a practicewhere they were on call a large portion of the time,such as a small practice or internship. The nancial pressures associated with large- animal practice, as well as being on call seem to bethe biggest and most common reasons for veterinar-ians to leave large-animal practice; however, thereare several other factors that may also contribute to 416 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS: EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUTa sense of burnout or lack of job satisfaction. Solo veterinarians or veterinarians in small ambulatory-only practices may often feel \"alone.\" They oftenwork alone, without support staff and without inter-action with colleagues on a daily basis. Only onethird of equine practitioners reported utilizing vet-erinary technicians or assistants in their practices. 3 Lack of a social network is a known risk factor forburnout. 2The recent AAEP report also speculated that newer graduates may be more sensitive to this aspect as they are more inclined to be so-called \"Mil-lennials\" who prefer to work in larger work placeswith more coworkers, and prefer to work in collabo-ration in workplaces with a teamwork approach. 3 The vast majority of equine practices are solo orsmall practices with one or two veterinarians and donot offer much of a collaborative environment. 3 Even in larger practices, equine veterinarians maystill spend considerable time alone in their vehicleand on farm calls without the company of colleaguesor coworkers. This lack of a collaborative work en-vironment may be a factor why more recent gradu-ates are leaving equine practice for companionanimal practice, although a direct correlation couldnot be made from the data available. 3 Large-animal practitioners also have to deal with weather conditions and seasonal variations thatsmall-animal veterinarians do not. While weathermay be beautiful some of the time, large-animalveterinarians also have to work in extreme cold,snow, rain, mud, wind, scorching heat, and humidityamong many other factors. Seasonal fluctuationsin work can also contribute to stress for the practi-tioner. When certain times of the year are ex-tremely busy, it is exhausting and stressful for theveterinarian. However, when certain seasons are\"slow\" this can create nancial stress for the practiceowner. 3. Solutions How can we recognize burnout? What can the in-dividual practitioner do to reduce stress and burn-out? When considering the term burnout, it isimportant to recognize the signs of burnout. Manypractitioners may not necessarily identify as \"burntout\", but when questioned further may, in fact,be experiencing symptoms attributed to burnout.Commonly reported signs of burnout include beingcynical or pessimistic about work, not wanting to goto work; lack of energy or focus to be productive atwork; having a hard time concentrating; lacking sat-isfaction in accomplishments; feeling disillusionedabout your job; using food, drugs, or alcohol to\"numb\" feelings; abnormal sleep habits; or it caneven manifest as various and repeated physicalillnesses. 2 There are several well-documented general strat- egies that can help individuals improve mental re-siliency and reduce feelings of burnout. Theseinclude recommendations such as eating healthy,exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, yoga,meditation, and practicing mindfulness. 2Addi - tionally, utilizing strategies to set boundaries andpreventing compassion fatigue are also important,but will be addressed in other sessions. This dis-cussion will focus specically on ways for equinepractitioners to try to mitigate feelings of burnout ordissatisfaction with their career. One strategy to decrease burnout, decrease the feeling of \"being alone,\" improve time management,and improve nances is for the ambulatory veteri-narian to hire support staff. Many veterinariansclaim that they cannot afford staff. This author, asa practice owner, would make the argument thatveterinarians can't afford notto have support staff. Having a veterinary assistant who travels with anambulatory veterinarian can provide many benetsto the practitioner, both nancial and in terms ofmental health. An assistant, particularly one whowill drive for the veterinarian, frees up the veteri-narian to accomplish tasks such as invoicing,writing medical records, returning phone calls,scheduling appointments, and returning emailswhile driving between calls. When a veterinarianis driving themselves, the so called \"windshieldtime\" is often wasted time that is not accounted fornancially. Despite charging a \"farm call,\" thecharges rarely truly account for the lost time, fuel,and mileage placed on the vehicle. Many veteri-narians are overwhelmed and frustrated by havingsometimes hours of medical records, phone calls,and other administrative work to do at the end of along day of seeing appointments. By completingsome or all of these tasks on the road between calls,veterinarians can gain hours of time per day with awell-trained assistant. If the veterinarian prefersto they should train their assistant to accomplishsome of these same administrative tasks for them.Additionally, having an assistant should speed upa veterinarian in many appointment situations.Having someone trained to hold and restrain horses,to set up and put away equipment, and to cleaninstruments should signicantly increase the speedwith which a veterinarian can complete farm callsand appointments. If this increase in speed allowsa veterinarian to see even one more horse or onemore appointment per day, the increased incomefrom the extra work often more than offsets the costof the employee for the day. Additionally, an assis-tant can complete end-of-day tasks such as process-ing lab samples and bloodwork to either be run inhouse or sent out. The assistant can and shouldclean and restock the vehicle for the next day's ap-pointments. Assistants can also be trained to doother tasks such as invoicing, client callbacks, andappointment scheduling at the end of the day.Having paid staff to do these tasks should free upthe veterinarian to either leave work earlier or ac-complish other more meaningful medical-relatedtasks or practice management tasks. Time is valu-able both from a nancial standpoint and from amental health standpoint, so if paying an assistant, AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 417LIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS: EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUTeven if only a few days per week, can allow the veterinarian to leave work earlier and to spend morequality time with their family, pets, or hobbies, thiscan be invaluable for both mental health and overallsatisfaction. Having a paid assistant has additional advan- tages that can improve mental health and nancialstability. Working with horses can be very danger-ous. A 2014 British Equine Veterinary Association(BEVA) study found that equine veterinarians in theUnited Kingdom had the highest injury rate of anycivilian occupation. 6A trained handler should keep a veterinarian safer when working around horses, particularly badly behaved horses, ratherthan relying on untrained owners or stable help.Additionally, having an assistant can make certainprocedures much more time efcient such as equinedentistry, lameness and pre-purchase examinations,surgeries, laceration repairs, and taking radio-graphs. Having an owner hold horses for these pro-cedures or having them assist with takingradiographs is not only a liability, but the owner willnot be as skilled and efcient at the procedures.Setting up such equipment and cleaning it and put-ting it away after use does take a considerableamount of time. When an assistant is utilized, theycan do the set-up, clean-up and put away equipmentwhile the veterinarian writes the invoice, dischargesnotes, collects payment, and discusses aftercarewith the client\u2014saving valuable time. It could alsobe argued that most veterinarians are also morelikely to take more x-rays, float more teeth, performultrasounds and other procedures if they know thatthey have help to set up and put away equipment,and to help perform the procedures. This, in re-turn, will lead to better care for the patient, andmore nancial return for the veterinarian as result. Having support staff can improve the client's per- ception of the veterinarian, and may also improveclient satisfaction. The presence of an assistantmeans that the owner doesn't have to hold their ownhorse, and may not even need to be present for thevisit at all. This creates an increase in perceived\"value\" and allows veterinarians to charge more fortheir services. When clients perceive a highervalue to a service, they are less sensitive to priceshopping and are typically more willing to pay morefor services. 7 Lastly, the most overlooked benet of having an assistant as a solo ambulatory practitioner is thevalue of having \"company.\" When you have an as-sistant ride with you, you have someone to talk to, tolaugh with, to sing along to the radio with, to eatlunch with, to commiserate with about bad horses,annoying clients, or inclement weather. This senseof companionship can dramatically change and im-prove the enjoyment for many practitioners and re-duce the feelings of social isolation that contribute toburnout. The author would strongly recommendhiring someone that you like and can enjoy spendinghours in a vehicle together. Based on personal ex-perience, someone who is responsible, enjoyable to be around, and who can safely handle horses is theideal candidate to train to be a valuable veterinaryassistant. Many veterinarians will still say they can't afford help. The author would argue that this is false andsuggest that veterinarians try hiring someone for1-2 days per week as a trial. Plan to pay $15-20per hour. Book those days heavier and try toschedule appointments like dental work, lamenessexamination, radiographs, and ultrasound examina-tions on those days. Alternatively, or in addition,solo ambulatory practitioners can reach out to vet-erinary students across the country by offeringexternship opportunities. Having a veterinary stu-dent ride alone for several weeks can still be hugelybenecial in terms of having company and having anextra set of hands on appointments, but in no wayreplaces the value of a trained, paid assistant. In addition to hiring staff to help you, consider paying staff to do things that you don't like to do,which frees you up to do more of the things that youdo like to do. If a veterinarian feels that they don'thave enough personal time for friends, family, hob-bies, or exercise, the author strongly recommendsthat they pay someone to do more of their adminis-trative duties. Even if they pay someone to work2-3 hours, 1-3 days per week working on invoicing,billing, marketing, advertising, paying bills, inven-tory, scheduling and ordering, this can make lifemuch more enjoyable. Another key factor to reduce burnout and improve mental resiliency is to make a point to schedulepersonal time into your schedule. Set aside timeeach day or each week for things you want to do tomake yourself happy. The author nds that doingit in the morning is more effective than hoping to\"work it in\" during lunch or after work. You can setyour schedule to start later several days a week anduse those hours to ride your horse, ride your bike, goto the gym, get a haircut, meditate, go to a yogaclass, take a nap or whatever makes you feel goodoutside of work. Taking time for yourself to men-tally, and sometimes physically, \"recharge\" andmaking it a priority, even if it is a small thing eachweek can have a dramatic positive effect on yourmental status and attitude toward work. If you canstart your day doing something productive or thatyou particularly enjoy, you may nd yourself moreenergized, productive, and happy the rest of the day.Additionally, you may not be as resentful if emer-gencies make you work late at the end of the day.If you worry about lost income from starting late orblocking off time mid-day, consider staying open afew hours later several days per week. Many horseowners have jobs during regular work hours andwould love to have the option of a later eveningappointment after work if you are willing to offer it.However, I nd that if I don't block off my scheduleand treat this personal time with the same regard asa client appointment, it is easy to disregard it and 418 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS: EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUTsqueeze in extra work instead, which increases re- sentment towards work. Other strategies for reducing burnout include at- tending focused CE and continuing to learn newskills. Challenging yourself with new knowledgeand skills can help keep practice from gettingboring and stale. This can also allow you to addnew and specialty services to your practice, at-tracting new clientele and providing additionalstreams of revenue. The author recommendsthinking outside the \"big meeting\" box. Bigmeetings are great and have their place, but someof the smaller focused meetings and wetlabs canbe very valuable as far as obtaining hands-onskills and reviving passion for practice. In addition to staying current on learning, having a network of colleagues that you can talk to aboutcases and about practice management can be a valu-able resource. Whether you organize a monthlybreakfast meeting with other local veterinarians, oryou have several contacts that you can call, email, ortext about cases; having outside resources to discusscases and even just discuss practice in general cansignicantly improve overall attitude and happi-ness. Additionally, joining veterinary-specic so-cial networking groups can be another source forhelp with cases, emotional support, venting, andmuch more. Connecting with colleagues aroundthe world that are facing similar cases and chal-lenges can be very reassuring and supportive for theambulatory practitioner who feels like they don'thave a support network. Another strategy to help improve mental wellbe- ing and improve resiliency is the practice mindful-ness in the everyday approach to work. This maysound intimidating or too \"touchy feely\" for manytype-A veterinarians. However, being mindful sim-ply means to take the time to be aware of yoursurroundings and appreciate even the small thingsin daily life. Instead of rushing from appointmentto appointment in a hurry, take the time to lookaround and enjoy the beautiful scenery that we oftenget to drive through. Sometimes we need to simplyslow down and appreciate the beauty of the farms,ranches, and animals that we get to visit on a dailybasis. While it can be challenging to be outsideworking in adverse conditions such as cold, snow,rain, extreme heat or humidity, there are also timesof the year when it is absolutely gorgeous weather,grass is green, flowers are blooming, or leaves arechanging. Whatever small beauty that can be ap-preciated in these small moments, can truly makesmall differences in how we perceive our job, im-prove our mental wellness, and improve resilience. 2 If you have a short break between appointments,consider nding a park or trail nearby and going fora quick walk or hike. Also consider taking yourlunch to a shady scenic spot to sit outside the vehi-cle, eat, and have a few minutes of down-time. Rushing from call to call and trying to eatwhile driving may seem necessary but it reallydoesn't add much time to slow down and occasion- ally stop to take a few deep breaths and appreciateyour environment. How do we deal with the dreaded \"on call\"? Un- fortunately, large-animal veterinarians will mostlikely never be rid of on call completely. However,as a solo practitioner or small-practice veterinarian,you can work on ways to decrease the amount of oncall and ways to make it more fullling for you.We will discuss various options including a co-opwith other local practitioners to share and rotate oncall among several practices. There is a greatAAEP podcast 8specically about this growing trend. Universally the participants interviewed expressed a greater sense of collegiality, improvedquality of life, and greater nancial benet fromsharing on call. By being on call fewer days perweek, but covering several different practices onthose days, allows the veterinarian to be more ef-cient with their time. The veterinarian on call may see more emergencies when they are on call,but in a shorter time frame. Many practitionerswould agree that they would rather see a fewemergencies in one evening than to see one or twoemergencies every night. This increased casel-oad when they are on call seems to balance out thenancial impact of taking less days of on call.The key to this strategy being successful is amindful shift toward trying to cooperate with andbe collegial with your \"competition.\" Instead ofeach veterinarian trying to be the solo veterinar-ian who can \"do it all\" if we try to see colleagues asa resource, veterinarians can work together tocreatively reduce on call stress. Additionally, more practices are starting to use part-time employees to help reduce on call and givethe solo practitioner a break. Many group practicesare shifting to unconventional scheduling that mayinvolve a 4-day work week or non-traditional hours.In speaking with practice owners, there also seemsto be a growing number of veterinarians who arepracticing small-animal medicine but who still wantto do some large-animal or equine \"on the side.\"Small practices and solo practices are hiring theseveterinarians to either work 1-2 days per week ortake some on call evenings and weekends, or at thevery least to cover some vacation and CE leave forthe practice owners. There are also veterinarianswho do not want to work full time. There are manysolo practitioners who feel overwhelmed with theircaseload, but don't feel that they can afford to hire afull-time associate. These two parts of the employ-ment market can mutually benet each otherhugely. Traditionally, some equine veterinarianshave felt that they can't utilize part-time help ortake days off because of the nature of equine clientswanting a specic veterinarian and wanting them tobe available at all times. This is the same reasonwhy traditionally equine and large-animal veteri-narians often work 5-6 days per week. Veterinar-ians believe that if they are not personally available, AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 419LIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS: EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUTthat the client will be angry and stop using the practice. This sense of needing to be available to allclients all the time can contribute to burn-out. However, successfully \"branding\" the practiceand making clients more tolerant of using otherveterinarians for urgent or emergency situationscan be successfully done. 7 Another option to reduce on call duties is to try to grow your practice to the point where it can sustainan associate, partner, or intern. Veterinariansshould also not be afraid to consider if there is alarge referral hospital or university nearby, to workwith them and use them as a backup for emergen-cies when they are out of town or not available.When this relationship is established ahead of time,many large referral practices are happy to take ex-tra emergencies as they are better staffed with moreveterinarians and interns. Clients are also moretolerant of using a different clinic for emergencies ifthey are made aware ahead of time that it may beneeded. Reducing the amount of on call allows theveterinarians to have more personal time and sometime away from the stress of being available foremergencies. In addition to reducing the amount of on call one does, another way to reduce the negative mentalimpact of on call is to make sure that it is nanciallyrewarding. A major reason why many associatesand interns get burnt out with after-hours emergen-cies is that they perceive that they are not gettingany extra compensation for this \"extra work.\" As apractice owner, you do derive direct nancial benetfrom seeing emergency calls, or you should be.If you have associates, ensure that there is a signif-icant degree of extra compensation for the veterinar-ian treating the emergency to add incentive for themto do it and for them to feel appreciated for doing it.There needs to be an adequate emergency \"fee\" inaddition to whatever regular charges apply. Do notsell yourself short as far as what emergency servicesshould cost. Charge an amount that makes itworthwhile for you to do the work and allow clientsto choose if it is worth it to them. Additionally,changing your mindset about emergencies is part ofmindfulness and mental resiliency. If you focus onthe negative aspect of being forced to see an emer-gency after hours, you will be most likely be moreangry and resentful. If you consciously choose tofocus on how nancially benecial to your practicethat extra emergency income is, and how much youare helping an animal and client in need, emergencycalls can take on a more positive and benecial partof your practice. Part of making this mental shift ismaking sure that the emergencies are nanciallybenecial and that you are effectively collecting pay-ment for the work that you do. On the subject of nances, strategies to improve satisfaction and quality of life have been discussed,but if equine and large-animal veterinarians can'tmake a decent income, they will still continue toleave the profession for more monetarily rewardingpositions in small animal. How can this nancial gap be bridged? Practitioners cannot control thecost of veterinary education or the interest on loans.However, we can continue to pressure the AVMA,veterinary colleges, and state and federal agenciesto nd a more nancially responsible solutions forveterinary educations and loan repayment. Whatwe can also do as owners of practices is to be betterstewards of our own practice nances and incomes.In most cases, veterinarians need to raise prices, bebetter about collecting payment, and be better man-agers of their owner practice nances. Veterinari-ans need to be better about charging what they areworth for their time and less concerned about cut-ting prices to be lower than a competitor. By charg-ing low prices or playing a game of price competitionwith other veterinarians, all we are doing is hurtingall of our own nances. The author recommendscharging what you feel a service is worth, ratherthan worrying about what other local competitorsare charging. Figure out what it actually costs youin supplies, time, and resources to perform the ser-vice. Figure in some overhead expenses that alsoneed to be repaid. Do not underestimate the valueof your skills, experience, and any special training that you have. Raising prices will allow veteri-narians to do less work and make the same money,so even if some clients leave due to price increases,you will have more free time and the same income.If you are providing a high-quality service, effec-tively branding your business, and establishingthe value of your services, the \"good\" clients willnot be signicantly swayed by price increases. 7 Along this same line, practice owners should caterto the clients that they want, not necessarily theclients that they have. Taking excellent care ofyour best clients will attract more \"A\" clients.Raising prices may also chase away some of your\"C\" clients. Over time, your practice clientelewill slowly become a group of people that you enjoyworking for and that pay their bills and that ap-preciate the value that you offer. Not only doesthis increase the nancial success of the practice,but can also greatly increase your satisfactionwith the work that you do. As a solo practitioner, you are likely the business owner and struggle to nd time to get administra-tive tasks done because you are so busy doing vet-erinary tasks. The author strongly recommendsthat you block out time in your schedule to run yourbusiness. Whether this is a half day once a week ora full day once a week, set aside time to work on yourbusiness and nancials. You may have to squeezein emergencies, but try to keep this day sacred anddon't schedule regular non-emergency appoint-ments. Many veterinarians are great doctors, butpoor business managers. By spending some timeeach week working on nancials, paying bills, mar-keting, strategizing, reading business managementbooks or blogs, updating Web site content, planningfor upcoming events or special promotion, and just 420 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS: EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUTgenerally managing the business side of practice, you will nd much more nancial success. Takethe time to attend some of the practice managementCE whenever you go to a conference. If this soundsforeign to you, then ask for help. Go to practicemanagement talks, nd resources, and read booksabout how to better manage your nancials. Whenveterinarians spend 100% of their time on medicineand 0% on practice management, it easy to get lulledinto the trap of working harder and working longer,but not seeing any income benet to the hard work.This is a major factor in burnout. If you can setaside more personal time as well as make your prac- tice more protable, you will increase not only yournancial status and freedom, but also your jobsatisfaction. 4. Conclusion Being an equine veterinarian, particularly a solopractice owner, can be extremely challenging attimes. Equine practice can also be very rewardingas well. Although there is no way to completelyreduce or prevent all stressors, there are some sub-tle changes in how veterinarians practice and howthey mentally approach certain aspects of practicethat can dramatically improve their quality of lifeand career satisfaction.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Armentrout, DVM, MS, DACVS Measuring success in a work-life balance construct is difcult since it is personal and difcult to dene. Each practitioner will have to develop the individual skills necessary to balance work andlifestyle. Author's address: have your cake and eat it too\" is an expression that most people in the United States arefamiliar with. Parents everywhere remind chil-dren that they can't have everything they want at alltimes. There are many articles out there detailingwhy we can't have it all and why \"having it all\" is amyth. 1This is not strictly true. It is easier to \"have it all\" once each individual denes means. One person's denition of \"itall\" will be vastly different from the person next tothem, and it's important to make sure each individ-ual looks at their own life to determine where \"it all\"comes into play. You can't truly have \"it all\" youactually mean \"it all.\" Having the perfect job withdesirable hours, flawless family, impeccable health,an abundance of money, and plenty of free timewhile also volunteering on committees, publishingpapers, and never making mistakes are unattain-able myths that, if strived for, increase the likeli-hood of dissatisfaction with one's job and life ingeneral and can lead to increased stress and anxiety. 2. Work-Life Balance The concept and difculties of work-life balancearen't unique to equine practitioners or to any par-ticular generation, but professional responsibilitiesmake maintaining a work-life balance difcult. In the late 1800s, manufacturing laws limited thework hours of women and children. The Fair Labor Standards Act established a 44-hour work week in1938, but professionals such as doctors and veteri-narians were assumed to be perpetually on call.Many equine veterinarians have mentors that gaveup much of their life \"living\" the job, and that mind-set has been passed down. The three \"A's\" of aphysician excellence are able, affable, and available.Available is the easiest to achieve, especially earlyin one's career. Couple that with demanding cli-ents, and it is easy to become a \"workaholic.\" A large hurdle to perfecting work-life balance is that the understanding of what it actually is can beevasive. Wikipedia denes it as \"a andambition) and 'lifestyle' (health, pleasure, leisure,family, and spiritual development/meditation).\" 2 This can be challenging for an equine veterinarian,because work often encompasses many tasks/re-sponsibilities beyond treating patients. The age oftechnology also allows \"work time\" to spill over into\"lifestyle time.\" Additionally, lifestyle time has tomake room for the daily activities of living (shop-ping, laundry, paying bills, household chores, etc.\u2014what many working moms term the \"second shift\") 422 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUT NOTESand it becomes clear why work-life balance can be elusive for an equine veterinarian. The best way tostart balancing work and lifestyle is to create a timebudget. It is important to identify how time is cur-rently being spent, setting goals to identify long-term objectives, and tracking results. Identifyinghow time is spent, and where it is squandered, canbe eye-opening to many doctors and help identifymore time to add to the lifestyle budget. 3 3. Experience/Ability Many practitioners are concerned with stayingabreast with the latest topics, trends, and develop-ments in equine medicine, but this can beoverwhelming, especially to newer graduates andmixed-animal veterinarians. Due to limited timeavailable in the senior year of veterinary school,graduates who wish to undertake equine medicineare strongly encouraged to pursue an internship.These internships are often touted to be worth \"5years of practice experience\" due to the nature ofworking with several doctors across multiple disci-plines and being able to experience many emergencysituations. Internships are often grueling as far astime commitment and expectations, and while in-ternships are incredibly valuable and a veritablenecessity to practice equine-only medicine, theystart the cycle of creating workaholic veterinariansthat have little outside time. Conversely, they canburn veterinarians out in their rst year becausemany can't handle the idea that their work life willdictate all their waking hours. Doctors enteringinternships should prepare themselves for a chal-lenging year, but also recognize that it is only a year,and at the end, they will have developed skills andeducation that will serve them the rest of theircareer. 4. Family/Children \"The obligation for working mothers is a very precise one: the feeling that one ought to work as if one didnot have children, while raising one's children as ifone did not have a job. \"-Annabel Crabb. While this quote specically deals with mothers, it is trueof all parents. Additionally, many people care forelderly, ill, or disabled family members. Due to theunique nature of equine medicine, it is rare to ndemployment in the private sector where on-call isnot required. Many practitioners still work 6 daysa week with regular appointments and continue tobe on-call after hours a majority of the time. Thereare certainly jobs in academia with little to no on-call or after-hours responsibility, but most are lledby specialists. One of the reasons many choose toleave this profession is the extended periods of timeaway from family commitments. The sacrice offamily life takes the greatest toll for most veterinar-ians. There are several practices that have foundways to allow doctors to be present for family as wellas be efcient producers for the practice. Reducinghours in the work week is possible in many situa-tions, but practice owners need to start thinking outside the box and working with associates to de-velop schedules that benet the practice as well asthe practitioner. Veterinarians able to work ef-ciently and produce effectively for a practice canhave latitude when it comes to weekly workinghours. Part-time veterinarians can and do work inpractice, and veterinarians may choose to job-share,with two veterinarians covering a full-time scheduletogether. 5. Mental Health Resilience There is a consensus among professionals that 'men-tal health' is a positive state where an individual isflourishing, thriving, and meeting their full poten-tial in life. Another term used in relation to posi-tive mental health is \"resilience.\" This phrase isactually borrowed from engineering, where it refersto the ability of a physical material to withholdexternal stress. A resilient material is hardy, flex-ible, and strong. In psychiatry, it refers to the abil-ity of an individual to handle stress and adversityand can also be referred to as \"bouncing back.\"While resilience has yet to be well dened in veter-inary medicine, a recent study of veterinary stu-dents revealed 33% of veterinary students in thisstudy demonstrated low capacity for resilience andonly 6% had a tendency toward high capacity forresilience. 4This certainly warrants further investi - gation and highlights the importance of culturingmental health resilience, as it is can be a learned oracquired skill. The Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration cites four key areasto build resilience: adequate sleep, good nutrition,regular physical activity, and active relaxation(yoga, meditation, etc.). 6. Efciency Studies have demonstrated that human physicianswho work fewer hours have better efciency thanthose that work full time. 5With nancial woes loom - ing large in the mind of recent graduates, who av-eraged a debt-to-income ratio of 2.26:1 in 2018, 6 efciency is a key component in equine practice,where pay often depends directly on production.The importance of a quality internship can be seenin the rst year of practice after internship whennew practitioners are striving to distinguish them-selves from seasoned practitioners. Working ef-ciently is paramount to increase production/reducethe nancial burden of debt while also having timeleft at the end of the day for lifestyle. Solo practi-tioners can be more efcient with a technician\u2014thetime saved on each call can increase the number ofpatients seen in a day to offset the cost of an addi-tional employee. This is an area almost every vet-erinarian can improve upon in practice. Standarddischarge templates, technicians who drive/entercharges/answer phones, working on multiple pa-tients at a single barn rather than each one individ-ually, etc., can all improve efciency of the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 423LIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS: EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH/BURNOUTveterinarian, which can mean increased production and less wasted time. 7. Boundaries Boundaries are especially important as the face ofveterinary medicine as a whole is changing. A sur-vey in 2008 found that less than 10% of equineveterinarians had taken a leave of absence for per-sonal growth and development, such as education orchild rearing. Ethical boundaries are also impor-tant to practitioners, with many veterinarians expe-riencing ethical fatigue in practice. 7Learning to say no and setting priorities in practice is a key compo- nent to avoiding ethical fatigue and burnout.8 8. Conclusion The important thing to take away is the idea thatwork-life balance is important and is an ever-chang-ing target that takes continual adjustments to meet.There will be times in a career where the work-lifebalance will be work centered (internship, resi-dency, new job, etc.), but it is important to makesure these times are discrete with an end date insight. Conversely, there will be times when thebalance will shift toward life (the birth of a newbaby, caring for a loved one, recovering from aninjury, etc.), and these events will generally be briefor fleeting in the grand scheme of life. There arealways two ways of looking at every topic. You canbelieve that \"having it all\" is a myth we shoulddisregard, or you can believe that it is possible tohave it all, within your own denition of \"it all.\"There is no single standard for work-life balance, so success can only be measured personally. Develop-ing time management skills and mental resilienceare key concepts to work-life balance, as are improv-ing efciency and setting boundaries.

J. Pascoe, BVSc, DAVDC-EQ, MRCVS In recent years, the use of oral endoscopy in equine dentistry has become more commonplace. This equipment aids examination and also treatment of dental conditions. Author's address: EquineDentistry Referrals, Ltd, 24 Upper Hollis, Kingdom, HP16 9HP;e-mail: horse_dentistry@hotmail.com. \u00a9 2019 AAEP. 1. Introduction Oral endoscopy is the use of a camera or endoscope within the oral cavity to examine the teeth and softtissues in detail. The limited opening of the oralcavity in the horse restricts the viewing apertureand the angle presents challenges when examiningall aspects of teeth and soft tissues. The use ofdental mirrors have been widely advocated to ad-dress this; however, the limited magnication pos-sible with a mirror and difculty in documentingndings has resulted in oral endoscopy being sug-gested as an alternative. 1 While oral endoscopy does have clear advantages, it is worth highlighting some of the limitations fromthe start. First, oral endoscopy systems can be ex-pensive and there is a notable correlation betweenimage quality and their cost, with cheaper endo-scopes or cameras tending to produce lower-qualityimages compared to more expensive options. Sec-ond, the eld of view is comparatively small com-pared to most dental mirrors which can make itharder to visualize the overall picture within amouth. Finally, setup and handling time can slowdown some relatively quick procedures where a den-tal mirror may still be sufcient.2. Equipment There are many options available for oral endoscopy,from budget intra-oral cameras to high-spec autocla-vable Hopkins telescopes, which can be paired tofully featured medical endoscopy systems. In gen-eral, the more you are prepared to pay, the betterthe quality of the image. The two key features arethe length of the scope and the angle of the view.Most oral endoscopes will need to be in the 40-50-cm range in length, which will enable assessmentof the largest mouths without being unwieldy in theleast. The angle of view for most useable systemswill be between 45\u00b0 and 70\u00b0. Scopes with a moreshallow angle tend to be brighter, allow assessmentof overgrowths, and can be kept away from the op-erative eld in guided procedures, but are limitedwhen viewing deep alveoli, periodontal pockets, orinfundibular lesions. These can be sourced in the form of reconditioned bariatric laparoscopes.The steeper angles are superior for examination ofdeep structures but, unless purchasing the verybest scopes, tend to be darker and offer less depthperception. These are also specically madefor equine dentistry so carry a higher price tag.An option available that is the best of all AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 425BACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY bariatric laparoscope with a variable angle.a Medical endoscopes need to be coupled with a camera and light source. These can range fromdedicated endoscopy systems, as would be used forlaparoscopy or arthroscopy, to customized systemsusing compact cameras, smartphones and USB lap-top cameras, and light sources. The choice of sys-tem is largely personal, with the two main essentialsbeing a remote screen of sufcient size and lack oftime-lag in the viewed image, something that can bean issue on some wireless systems. 3. Oral Endoscopy for Examination The most obvious use for an oral endoscope is in oralexamination. The use of sedation for this proce-dure is mandatory and deeper levels tend to be re-quired as the combination of movement andmagnication will render the image and equipmentunusable. Use of an alpha2 agonist (romidine ordetomidine) with acepromazine, di-azepam and/or applications of topical lidocaine maybe necessary to reduce movement, particularly if thetongue is very active. A relaxed mouth and tongueis the aim to allow accurate placement of the endo-scope and a clear view in the absence of movement. Full-mouth speculae are always used to hold the mouth open to allow effective examination and pre-vent damage to the scope. Care should be taken toopen the speculum the smallest amount to enableeffective use of the endoscope, as stretching thecheeks taut can restrict examination of the buccalvestibule, risking damage to the endoscope and al-lowing signicant pathology to be missed. Thehead should preferably be supported using a standor sling at a comfortable height for the horse andendoscope operator, which usually means the headjust above the operator's waist height. Operatorsand handlers should be aware of the risks of a horsemoving backward on a stand and trapping theendoscope. Examination should follow a systematic ap- proach. 2Each quadrant of the mouth should be evaluated separately starting with a slow, steady examination of the occlusal surface of each tooth inturn. The scope should be positioned, if possible, sothe entire tooth can be seen, and this is something tobe considered when choosing which system to buy.A narrow eld of view or a cropped image on theviewer (to create an initially spectacular magniedview) can limit the operator's ability to assess thewhole tooth and it becomes easy to lose track of whathas been assessed and what hasn't. Examinationin this manner of the buccal and lingual/palatalaspects should be undertaken for each tooth. Close-up examination may require refocusing of the endoscope or camera, but this is necessary toevaluate lesions rst noted on the initial wider ex-amination. For this reason, xed-focus systems areless user friendly. The endoscopy can be combinedwith use of periodontal probes or explorers to fur- ther assess the signicance of the identied lesions,although coordinating this requires practice. The key features of using endoscopy for oral ex- amination are familiarity with normal anatomy andabnormal pathology, and the limitations of the two-dimensional view. For detailed assessments ofsubtle pathology of the endodontium and/or perio-dontium oral endoscopy can 3-5but overgrowths malocclusions, visual andmanual palpation is often superior. Recording ndings for clinical notes during an examination can be challenging, especially in caseswhere there are a large number of different pathol-ogies present. A technician familiar with oral ex-amination and terminology, who is able to writenotes, is benecial; or use of a phone or embeddedendoscopy system voice recorder can all be helpful inaddressing the issue. Recording video of the proce-dure as opposed to still images is also preferred. Once oral endoscopy is complete, detailed clinical notes or charts should be written to record the sig-nicant ndings as well as any treatment plans thatmay arise. 4. Endoscopic-Guided Procedures The use of endoscopes during dental procedures toaid better visualization has grown. 6While outside the specic title of this talk, the use of endoscopes during procedures will influence the choice of endo-scope systems, so it is an important consideration forthose seeking to purchase equipment and maximizeits use. Use in this manner tends to fall in to twocategories. The rst involves intermittent use of the endo- scope to assess placement of instruments, progressof a procedure, or as a postoperative documentationprocess. This certainly improves documentation ofcases; however, it doesn't allow visualization whilethe procedure is being undertaken. For quick in-traprocedural examination or checking, one can ar-gue that a dental mirror, with its ease of use andability to assess from different angles, is likely to bejust as good and, in some situations, may be supe-rior, although documentation of cases with a mirrorand camera can be very frustrating. True endoscopic-guided procedures, where the en- doscope remains inside the oral cavity during a sur-gery, is clearly the most useful approach. However,the operator learning curve when switching to thistechnique is steep, and where more than one personis involved, for example an assistant holding thescope and veterinary dental surgeon undertakingthe procedure, this can be very difcult. It is clearthat all parties need to be experienced, understandtheir roles and what is being undertaken, as well asbeing able to work in the conned area of the oralcavity together without putting the horse, person-nel, and equipment at risk. More recently thespeaker has used a scope-stabilizing system, which 426 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY FUNDAMENTALSreduces the need of a second person to maintain a stationary endoscope during a procedure. Thought should be given when undertaking endoscopic-guided procedures as to where the scopeshould be placed for the best view; this will varybetween procedures and also operators. Whileclose-up views may seem on initial consideration tobe the most appropriate, the lens can repeatedly getcovered with dental material or hemorrhage as wellas physically reducing the room to maneuver instru-ments and increasing the risk of damage to theendoscope. Shallow angles, such as 45\u00b0, allow thescope to be positioned more rostrally, avoiding thisproblem, although this may not afford the best anglefor visualization. Larger scope diameters can im-pede their use during dental surgeries. Protectivesheaths may be benecial as they afford some pro-tection to the endoscope from accidental damagefrom other instruments. 5. Case Follow Up As oral endoscopy generates video and still imagesthat can be kept as part of the clinical record, itallows far greater scope for following up cases in amore objective manner over time. Previously,where description of the lesion seen was made in thenotes, it was possible for subtle improvements ordeterioration to go unnoticed. By comparing im-ages and video obtained over time it is possible torecognize where treatments have worked, and also when there is no improvement. This can be partic-ularly benecial in treatment of periodontal diseasewhere it can be hard to assess changes over time,which may be gradual.6. Conclusions Oral endoscopy has greatly improved diagnostic and treatment abilities in equine dentistry. Its role indocumentation of cases can also allow better followup and has the potential to improve clinical out-comes in cases. For practices with a signicantdental caseload, oral endoscopy should be consid-ered a key purchase.

If bilateraldisease is present, then comparison to images of anormal horse of similar size and age can be helpful.Common abnormal radiographic ndings includeblunting/clubbing of thickness ofthe apical alveolar bone (sclerosis, condensingosteitis). 1 2. Materials and Methods After a general physical and extraoral exam, thehorse should be sedated for an oral examinationwith a full-mouth speculum. Sedation should beprofound enough that the patient maintains a low head position as the clinician and technician movethe x-ray generator and detector around its headand does not chew when the receptor plate is posi-tioned within the mouth for intraoral views. For anaverage temperament, 450-kg horse, the authorwould start 7 mg detomidine aand 3 mg butor- phanolbadministered intravenously concurrently. Additional incremental doses of detomidine aregiven if needed. A standard radiographic study in-cludes a minimum of 6 extraoral and 2 intraoralviews, as previously described. 1 The images should be quickly reviewed for cor- rect positioning and technique, and repeated if theimage is unsatisfactory. Supplementary views,such as the dorso-ventral (DV) with and or with rostro-caudal or caudo-rostral angulation, may also benecessary. Review of the radiographs should include side-by- side, 2-pane comparison of views of the left and rightincisors/cheek teeth. A systematic review of each radiograph should include evaluation of the following: 428 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY FUNDAMENTALS NOTESTooth numbers and anatomy (missing teeth, supernumerary teeth, malformation of teeth,malpositioned teeth, tooth resorption, hyperce-mentosis, blunting/clubbing of tooth roots).

Results The following cases demonstrate various radio-graphic signs of dental and paradental sinus dis-ease. In many cases, the physical examination and oral exam will identify the diseased tooth/teeth.The rst case is a horse without clinical signs inwhich defects over multiple pulp horns were identi-ed on examination of the oral cavity with a rigidendoscope (1 cm diameter rigid laparoscope with a45\u00b0 lens). The second case is illustrative of a situ-ation where there was facial swelling rostral to thefacial crest, but the oral exam was unremarkable.In this case, the radiographic signs were more sub-tle, and obtaining the normal side for comparisonwas important. The third case is a horse that alsohad no clinical signs and on routine oral exam afractured maxillary rst molar was discovered.Radiographs were important in ruling out sinus in-fection and guiding minimally invasive transbuccal Figure 1.

The fourth case is a horse that had bilateral sagittalfractures of the maxillary rst molars with signi-cant sinusitis that persisted after unremarkablehealing of the extraction sites. In the fth case, adental etiology of a unilateral nasal discharge couldnot be determined with oral examination, rhinos-copy, or standard radiographs, and was presumed aprimary sinusitis. Case 1 (Fig. 1) Radiographs obtained of a 6-year-old Warmbloodgelding, which on oral exam revealed defects overmultiple pulp horns of the left maxillary 2nd premo-lar (206). While the two DV views (Figs. 1A and B)do not demonstrate radiographic signs of dental pa-thology, they do illustrate how slight changes in therostro-caudal angulation of the central beam may beneeded to best visualize individual cheek teeth.Comparison of the right and left open-mouth DV andventrodorsal (VD) lateral oblique views readily dem-onstrates apical and dental pathology that might nothave been noted if the clinician had radiographedthe affected (left) side only. The open-mouth viewsare obtained using a full-mouth speculum, usuallyopened to oblique (RtD30LeVO),Fig. 1D, with arrows indicating the blunted apicesof 206. The right and left ventral 50\u00b0 dorsal obliqueviews are obtained with the 50\u00b0 right (RtV50LeDO) views are arrows indicate the apical blunting andalveolar bone lysis of 206 (Fig. 1F).

Changing the presets (programablealgorithms) in the system software ccan sometimes be useful; compare the images in Figs. 2A and B with the same images in Figs. 2C and D in whichthere is increased contrast and edge enhancement.As in Case 1, evaluation of the affected side onlycould have made diagnosis more difcult. Case 3 (Fig. 3) Extraoral radiographs of a 14-year-old Standard-bred gelding with a fractured right maxillary rstmolar (109). The patient had no history of nasaldischarge and there was no malodor to the breathfrom the right nostril. Oral exam revealed a largeportion of the supra gingival crown of 109 was miss-ing, with signicant decay of the visible crown-reserve LeD30RtVO,RtV50LeDO, lateral and DV views(Figs. 3A-F). There was no radiographic evidence Figure 2. Case 2. 430 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY FUNDAMENTALSof right rostral maxillary sinus involvement. There was alveolar bone sclerosis evident in theLeV50RtDO (D) and DV (F) views (arrows). Therewas no signicant widening of the periodontal liga-ment space. Narrowing of the coronal aspect of the109 alveolus was noted, which would impede oralextraction of this tooth. When the 109 crown frac-tured with forceps manipulation, a minimally inva-sive transbuccal extraction was performed with oralendoscopic and radiographic guidance. Case 4 (Fig. 4) Warmblood gelding, 15-year-old, with history of in-termittent left maxillary sagit-tal fractures of the maxillary rst molars (109, 209).Rhinoscopy of the left middle meatus revealed mu-copurulent drainage from a stula on the medialaspect of the left ventral conchal sinus (VCS), with exposed, necrotic bone. The left-to-right lateralview (A) reveals multiple fluid lines within paraden-tal sinus structures, but superimposition precludesidentication of which side and which sinuses areinvolved. The DV view (B) demonstrates the sagit-tal fractures but offers little other information.The RtD30LeVO (C) demonstrates some ill-denedsoft tissue and increased bony density in the leftrostral maxillary sinus (RMS, arrow) apical to 209.In the LeD30RtVO view (D), there is similar fluid/bone density apical to the 109 (arrow), and in addi-tion, there is fluid evident in the caudal maxillarysinus (CMS; arrow head). At the time these radio-graphs were obtained, 209 was extracted and theleft maxillary sinus was trephined with a Stein- Figure 3. 3.

One month later the LeD30RtVO view (E) was obtained prior to extrac-tion of 109. There was an increase in the apicalalveolar bone lysis and fluid within the right RMS(arrow), as well as fluid lines (small arrow) and apatchy fluid density within the CMS (arrow head).The 109 was orally extracted, and the right maxil-lary sinuses were lavaged via trephination of patient continuedpreviously prescribed systemic enrofloxacin treat-ment for 4 weeks, and the referring veterinarianfollowed this with ceftiofur for 1 month. The rightnasal discharge persisted and radiographs were ob-tained by the referring veterinarian that demon-strated a larger area of right paranasal sinusinvolvement. In the DV view (F), there is fluiddensity of both the right and left RMS, the rightCMS, as well as the right VCS. Oral examinationrevealed normal healing of the 109 and 209 extrac-tion sites. The horse was referred for a computedtomography (CT) study, which ruled out furtherdental pathology and identied bilateral rostralmaxillary sinusitis with sinusitis also theright CMS and right dorsal and VCSs.

A dental etiology forthe bilateral sinusitis in this case could not be iden-tied with CT. The sinusitis was treated surgicallywith large frontal sinus flaps and endoscopic laserfenestration of the VCS to establish adequate drain-age into the nasal passages. Case 5 (Fig. 5) An 8-year-old Thoroughbred mare presented with ahistory of a mucopurulent right nasal discharge with afetid odor of 1 week's duration. Oral examinationwas unremarkable. Rhinoscopy revealed only muco-purulent drainage from the right nasomaxillary ori-ce.

In the initialLeD30RtVO view (C) there was overlapping of theright maxillary fourth premolar (108) and the rstmolar (109), with an area of possible apical alve-olar sclerosis. However, in a second view witha slight caudo-rostral angulation of the centralX-ray beam (D), this overlap was eliminated and the apical anatomy of 108 and 109 appeared nor-mal. Fluid lines are present within the right dor-sal nasal conchal bulla (DNB, white arrows), rightCMS of thebulla of the maxillary septum (black arrowheads).Comparison with the RtD30LeVO view (E) in which the left DNB is free of fluid; thickened rotated to a more ventral position inthis projection. The diagnosis was primary rightmaxillary sinusitis with right nasal bulla empyema.Treatment was surgical debridement via a frontona-sal flap. Elevation of the flap revealed a small vol-ume of fluid in the CMS and marked enlargement ofthe bulla of the maxillary septum bulging into the frontomaxillary (F, white arrowheads); ethmoid turbinates(ETH). septum revealed inspissated puswithin the RMS and the VCS. 4. Discussion With the evolution of portable digital radiographysystems it is possible for general practitioners toobtain diagnostic quality dental radiographs in theeld. The indications for obtaining dental radio-graphs and positioning of the X-ray generator andsensor for standard radiographic views has beenpreviously described. 1,3While the signs of dental disease are generally not difcult to evaluate in incisors, canine teeth and mandibular cheek teeth,the maxillary cheek teeth have 3 roots which are notreadily isolated and the paradental sinus anatomy iscomplex, variable and often difcult to evaluate withstandard radiographic projections. The author rec-ommends doing a minimum of 6 standard views formaxillary cheek teeth, as this often provides a com-parison of right and left sides. A DV, lateral, andright and left D30V and V50D For the V50D lateral oblique views,a speculum or bite block is used to hold the mouthwide open. This permits imaging of the apices ofthe maxillary cheek teeth (as well as the apices ofthe mandibular cheek teeth on the ipsilateral side).Consistency in positioning for the radiographs im-proves the clinician's ability to recognize abnormalanatomy and identify radiographic signs of dentaland sinus disease.

Introduction Three thousand years of equine dental history brings this segment of veterinary medicine to theforefront of our profession. 1Today, because of signicant scientic advances we have a better un-derstanding of equine dental anatomy and patho-physiology of dental disease. 2-4Based on the current equine dental research literature, dentaldisease is more prevalent and wide-ranging thanonce thought. 5A century ago in 1919, Louis Meril- lat stated in his veterinary textbook on Animal Den-tistry, \"Human dentistry owes its existence to asingle disease process, caries , while animal den- tistry depends upon a single physical defect,enamel points \". 6Many of the same thought pro- cesses regarding the importance of dentistry in thehorse's ability to comfortably wear a bit and bridlefor control, guides many horsemen and veterinari-ans to believe that ling or \"floating\" cheek teethequals dental care. No longer can dentistry be ap-proached from the standpoint of addressing abnor-malities of occlusal wear and sharp enamel points.Modern veterinary dental practice has evolved toincorporate principles of medical care based on a complete signalment and medical history, physicaland oral examination, and advanced diagnostic tech-niques to arrive at a diagnosis on which to base atreatment plan. Failure to perform a complete sys-tematic examination of the patient is a major causeof medical errors and adverse events in human med-ical practice. 7The same holds true for any aspect of veterinary medicine. The equine hypsodont tooth is unique in that the occlusal surface and exposed crown is constantlychanging throughout the horse's life. The long re-serve crown and roots of the tooth are hidden fromobservation of the oral cavity. Imaging of the en-tire tooth including the crown and gingiva is impos-sible without the aid of a mirror or endoscope.Additionally, the use of radiography to evaluate thesubgingival portion of the tooth and surroundingstructures is often needed. Many forms of dentaldisease can only be diagnosed in the early stages byadvanced imaging techniques. 8-10 The common types of dental disease often diag- nosed in clinical practice can be grouped into severalcategories: 436 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY FUNDAMENTALS NOTES1. Abnormal crown occlusal wear secondary to some underlying malocclusion or diseaseprocess 2. Periodontal disease3. Endodontic disease4.

Developmental problems that can predispose to malocclusions of teeth or teeth and bone,unerupted or supernumerary dentition andabnormalities such as cysts, tumors, or dys-plasia of unknown etiology 7. Traumatic injuries to the teeth and support- ing structures with acute and/or long-term ad-verse effects on dental development anderuption Radiography is the most readily available medical imaging technique in equine veterinary practice.Utilizing standard radiographic equipment andtechniques, good dental images can be taken undereld conditions. 11Radiography is a 2-dimensional imaging of the complex 3-dimensional object (teeth and skull) and has its limitations\u2014some of whichhave been overcome by 3-dimensional imaging techniques. Imaging such as com-puted tomography (CT), magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) ultrasonography, and nuclear scin-tigraphy are also important at times to make adental diagnosis. These modalities are com-monly available in specialty practices and aca-demic centers. 2. Materials and Methods This paper and lecture will highlight some advan-tages of using modern dental examination tech-niques combined with quality radiographic imagingto diagnose dental disease and plan and carry outtreatment. Eight clinical cases from the author'sequine veterinary practice will be presented to stim-ulate practitioners' thinking about the importance ofa complete oral examination combined with radiog-raphy in the diagnosis and treatment of horses with dental disease. 3. Results Case 1 A 25-year-old Thoroughbred (TB) mare owned by a veterinarian. She was \"not acting normal\" whenaround other horses or when handled by the owner.Physical examination, complete blood count (CBC),serum chemistry, and endocrine testing were withinnormal limits. Dental examination was requested. On ap- proaching the mare, she was reluctant to have herlips parted or have her head or incisor teeth exam-ined. Sedation was administered and incisor ex-amination was consistent with an aged mare. Full-mouth speculum was placed and the oral cavityappeared normal except for some mild, sharpenamel points. No soft tissue abnormalities, ab-normal wear patterns, diastemata, or infundibularchanges detected (Fig. 1A). Dental radiographs were taken at the re- clinical ndings andradiographs, incisor extractions were performed. Within 3 weeks of extractions, the mare was back to acting like her \"old self.\" Six months post-extraction, the owner reported her appearing muchhappier, comfortable, and doing well. Case 2 A 6-year-old Andalusian gelding with a history ofchomping with its mouth when ridden in bit andbridle. The problem had become progressively worse over the previous 6 months. Examination by several veterinarians, dental care providers, and abiting consultant had failed to identify any medicalor dental abnormalities. Oral examination revealed the horse had been recently floated and had no other soft-tissue or wearabnormalities with the exception of an unerupted Fig. 1. Case 1. A, Normal appearing upper incisors.

Case 3 A 6-year-old American Saddlebred (ASB) show marepresented with 1-year history of intermittent verti-cal head tossing when ridden in bit and bridle andnot when being ridden in a Hackamore. The horsehad been worked up for trigeminal neuropathy and head shaking. Trials of several medications hadproduced no positive results. Oral examination revealed the teeth had recently been floated.

The root appeared bulbous and the crown wasslightly curved and wrapping around the buccaledge of 306 (Figs. 3A and B). Surgical removal ofthe 305 through a gingival flap was performed due tothe root conformation and placement of the im-pacted tooth. Clinical signs had completely re-solved 6 weeks post surgery when the mare was put back into work. Case 4 A 7-year-old TB gelding recently purchased froman equine retirement facility. Routine examina-tion by a lay dental care provider revealed an en-larged mandible and abnormalities in the lower leftquadrant of the horse's mouth. The owner was in-formed that this was a \"chronically infected tooththat would continue to decay and abscess until ex-tracted.\" The attending farm veterinarian sedatedthe horse for the extraction procedure (by lay per-son). Thirty minutes into the extraction, the horsebegan to bleed profusely, and the procedure wasaborted. The farm veterinarian recommendedreferral. The horse was presented with an enlarged lower jaw (rm, cool, and nonpainful; Fig. 4A). Oral ex-amination revealed a healing laceration in the upperright palatal area. The lower left arcade revealed306 tilting distal with an enlarged occlusal surface.A small fragment of dental material was attached tothe distal edge of this tooth. A narrow diastemawas present between 306 and 307. The gingivaaround the 307 had been elevated 5 mm and a largediastema was present between the 307 and 309.The 308 appeared to be missing and the socket spacewas covered with healthy gingiva. The 309, 310,and 311 appeared clinically normal. Radiographic examination of the left hemi- mandible revealed a diastema between the 306 and307 that contained a small dental fragment. Awide diastema was present between the 307 and309. There was excessive caudal angulation of the306 and 307. A su perimposed, unerupted dental structure was observed lying parallel to the longaxis of the mandible. This appeared to be a fullydeveloped, molarized tooth\u2014presumably the 308(Fig. 4B).

The right facial area wasslightly depressed just rostral to the orbit and thehorse exhibited epiphora in the right eye. Oral examination revealed normal dentition ex- cept for what appeared to be abnormal attrition ofthe 108 and 109 with a mild 408/409 occlusal wavepattern (Fig. 5A). Radiographs revealed an expired 608 deciduous tooth with no permanent tooth present and an ex-pired 109 with a blunted apex surrounded by con-densed bone (Figs. 5B and C). This diagnosis allowed the owner to plan and provide long-termdental care for the horse. Case 6 A 24-year-old Warmblood gelding with intermittentleft-sided malodorous nasal discharge present forover a year. The horse had been treated severaltimes with antibiotics with only short-term positiveresponse. Examination revealed a left side, fetid, purulent nasal discharge. Upper respiratory endoscopy re-vealed flakes of greenish mucus in the left nasalpassage and serous discharge from the sinus drain-age angle. Oral examination revealed senile dental changes with d iastemata between the upper 08s and 09s on both sides. The 211 had an expired crown withan area of forage packing in the center of the tooth(Fig. 6A). Radiographs revealed an expired 211crown with two root fragmentsand a bony defect in the alveolus. The left lled with dense material and fluid(Figs. 6D and E). The 211 crown defect was cleaned with right angle forceps and irrigated to remove forage (Fig. 6B).When the crown defect was lavaged, fluid flowedfreely from the left nostril. The dental defect wascleaned, air dried, and patched with polymethylmethacrylate a(Fig. 6C). The sinuses were tre - phined and lavaged over several days to removeforage contamination. Two years post-treatment,the horse continues to do well. The acrylic patch isin place and the sinuses have been clear. Case 7 An 8-year-old Dutch Warmblood mare seen for rou-tine dental work.

Open-mouth oblique radiographs revealed deep periodontal pockets with loss of alveolar bone up tothe apex mesial and distal to 109, 110, and 209 withover 50% attachment loss in these 3 teeth (Fig. 8C)This would be consistent with Stage 3 periodontaldisease. Multiple other diastemata involving up-per and lower teeth exhibited Stage 1 or Stage 2periodontal disease. The three Stage 3 teeth were orally extracted. The other periodontally diseased teeth were treatedmedically with periodontal cleaning, interdentalpacking, and odontoplasty. The gelding's mouthhealed well after treatment and 3-month and6-month follow-up examinations have not revealedany disease progression. 4. Discussion Recent veterinary dental research and case-basedliterature has changed how we approach equine den-tistry. Client information through social mediaand print publication has improved dramaticallyover the past 10 years. The veterinarian can nolonger evaluate the dental patient with only abucket and floats and expect horse owners to thinkthis passes for dental care. Taking a good medicalhistory and listening to the owner's and/or trainer'scomplaint or reason for the examination is the rststep. A detailed physical examination, proper se-dation and a complete dental and oral examinationwith the use of a full mouth speculum is expectedand required. Any abnormality detected on exam-ination should stimulate a more thorough evalua- tion using a dental mirror or oral endoscope, dentalirrigation, dental picks and probes, and if indi-cated, radiographs. Many dental disease condi-tions can only be detected with advanced imagingtechniques, and that begins with quality radio-graphs. Approaching dentistry in this fashion al-lows a more comprehensive approach to diagnosisand treatment and reduces the incidence of over-sights or errors.

Rice, DVM, DAVDC-EQ Proper evaluation of malocclusions present in the mouth will allow for appropriate treatment planning when performing odontoplasty. When crown reduction is necessary to address a maloc-clusion, knowledge of tooth anatomy can help determine how much crown can safely be removed inone odontoplasty procedure. Complete oral examination and routine odontoplasty are the corner-stone for good preventative dentistry programs. Author's address: Midwest adjustment, is the proce- dure by which the tooth is shaped and contouredduring a dental treatment. On a basic level, it in-volves removal of sharp enamel points that form onhypsodont teeth as they continue to erupt and un-dergo normal attrition. It can be analogous to\"mowing the grass\" to keep your lawn nice and tidy.However, just as some lawns get p atchy areas of grass or overgrowths of weeds, some mouths re-quire more than just \"routine\" maintenance.There is an art to approaching mouths with mal-occlusions, including how much tooth to remove,and what adjustments are required to achieve bal-ance in the mouth. 1This presentation will ad- dress some of these concerns. 2. Malocclusion Classication The classication of malocclusions, as dened bythe College (AVDC),comprises four main categories. Malocclusion 1(MAL1) represents neutroclusion, where there is normal positioning of the dental arches, with malposi-tion of one or more individual teeth. This can includerotation of the tooth along its axis, or bucco-, labio-, orpalatoversion of the tooth. These are considered den-tal malocclusions, as they are related generally to individual teeth. These are probably the most com-mon malocclusions encountered in day-to-day prac-tice. The underlying reason for the malocclusionmust rst be identied prior to formulating a treat-ment plan. The most common reasons for dentalmalocclusions are malpositioned teeth and missingteeth causing an overlong crown of the opposingtooth from lack of attrition. Less commonly, per-sistent deciduous or supernumerary teeth may alsoresult in focal malocclusions if not properly main-tained (Fig. 1). The three remaining classes of malocclusions are all skeletal malocclusions, resulting from develop-mental abnormalities that alter the normal relation-ship of the dental arches. Malocclusion class 2 and3 result from a discrepancy in the length of the upper and lower jaws. Malocclusion 2 2,3In these horses, the mandibular teeth are positionedcaudally to the maxillary teeth. An the the maxillary incisors are now ventrally displaced.This happens most often when there is no occlusalcontact of the incisors due to the severity of themalocclusion. All horses with overbite have somedegree of overjet, but or underbite (Fig. 3). This is a lesscommon malocclusion resulting from a longer man-dible compared to maxilla. Horses with MAL2 andMAL3 must have their entire bite evaluated as somewill have discrepancies in their entire length of jaw,affecting the balance of their incisors, canines andcheek teeth. Other horses may have the length discrepancy in the interdental space, allowing forneutroclusion of their cheek teeth, with malocclu-sion of their incisors. Malocclusion 4 (MAL4) represents maxilloman- dibular which in a rostro-caudal, side-to-side, or dorsoventral direction. Inthe most exaggerated form, cases of \"wry nose\" fallinto this category (Fig. 4). There are many moresubtle varieties of these that can be found whencareful examination of the mouth is made (Fig. 5).Many of these horses present with an incisor slant,which is perpetuated by their skeletal asymmetry.The difculty in performing odontoplasty on these Fig. 1.

A careful evaluationof how the mouth is functioning from a masticatorystandpoint is also indicated, as many of these horseshave adapted to their asymmetry and making majoradjustments in their mouth balance may make themunwilling or unable to eat comfortably. Crown re-ductions should be made slowly, and with frequentevaluation of the lateral excursion to ensure that theteeth are not being taken out of occlusion with ad-justments that are being made. 3. Odontoplasty One of the more common procedures performedduring routine odontoplasty is the reduction ofoverlong crowns. There is much debate over howmuch tooth can safely be removed at one time.The short answer is\u2014it depends on each individ-ual tooth! There have been multiple studies per- formed showing that there is a wide range of depth Fig. 4. Horse with wry nose and Malocclusion 4 (MAL4).

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 445BACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY FUNDAMENTALSof secondary dentin in the occlusal aspect of the pulp horns in teeth. There can be anywhere from 2 to 33mm of secondary dentin, 5,6and there is wide varia - tion even amongst the pulp horns in any individualtooth. There does not appear to be a recognizabletrend in depth of secondary dentin found in pulphorns in relation to age, or size of the overgrowth.Good rules to follow when performing crown reduc-tions are 1) Minimize time spent to 20 seconds orless of continuous grinding; 7-102) Rinse often, as this will cool the tooth and clean the surface for; 3) visualization of the tooth to evaluate pulp hornstaining. Secondary dentin has tubules that areperpendicular to the occlusal surface of the tooth. 11 This allows tannins from forage to leach into thetubules, causing the dark brown staining that istypical of secondary dentin (Fig. 6). As the second-ary dentin is removed through crown reduction, youwill start to lose the staining when you get close tonewly laid dentin, which is very near to the live pulp (Fig. 7). The dark brown color will give way to lightbrown, to tan, to cream, to pink once live pulp isencountered. As a general rule of thumb, crown re-duction should stop when a pulp horn becomes lightbrown to tan in color. It is also important to empha-size that when not using water-cooled instrumentationfor crown reduction, you must periodically rinse thetooth and limit continuous grinding to 20 seconds orless in order to prevent thermal damage to the livepulp. 4. Conclusion There are many approaches to odontoplasty, with awide variety of instrumentation available to com-plete the task. 12A comprehensive oral exam will help identify any areas of concerns that may be addressed through odontoplasty. It can take timeand patience to develop a consistent method of per-forming an occlusal adjustment, and it is wise tokeep an open mind and to learn to treat each mouthas an individual. There is not one \"correct\" way tobalance a mouth, just as there is not one way to \"correctly\" balance a foot. It is important to care-fully observe how the horse eats and the how the mouth functions as a complete entity before andafter occlusal adjustment. The goal with preventa-tive dentistry through odontoplasty is not only toremove sharp points, but to adjust focal malocclu-sions to prevent oral pathology from developing.

Introduction Providing adequate pain control for equine patients in the perioperative and postoperative period shouldbe part of any practitioner's surgical plan involvingdental extraction and/or sinus surgery. The vastmajority of extraction techniques in common usetoday can be performed standing with good periop-erative analgesia/anesthesia via intravenous seda-tion and regional nerve blocks. Performing dentalprocedures under standing sedation reduces the riskto the horse from general anesthesia, hemorrhageduring surgery, and recovery time. Many same daysurgeries can be performed stall side or with only a24-48-hour stay at an equine hospital. One facet of a good multimodal pain control plan is regional anesthesia. Nerve blocks are the keyto being able to perform dental extractions in thestanding horse under a constant-rate intravenousinfusion of an anesthetic agent. Prior to the com-mon use of regional nerve blocks for standing ex-tractions, the surgeon's success relied more on thenature of the horse, very high doses of intravenousanesthetics, and uncomplicated or nonsurgical ex-traction procedures. With the use of regional nerve blocks most horses can have productive non-invasive and invasive dental procedures understanding sedation. General anesthesia is stillnecessary for intractable patients, surgeries re-quiring tomography extrac-tions or maxillofacial surgeries requiring precise,delicate surgical technique. When placing a re-gional nerve block, achieving effectiveness whilereducing risk is paramount. The following de-scriptions give systematic directions to performthe major nerve blocks associated with extrac-tions. Three nerve blocks will be discussed:the maxillary nerve block, the mental nerve block,and the inferior alveolar nerve block. 2. Materials and Methods 60-120 minutes Give all regional anesthetics slowly (over 1 minute) and choose volume to match site (avoid placing toomuch in a restricted space). Equipment Needed Sharpie and straight-edge Clippers Betadine and saline needles lock\u20146-cc luer lock stimulator d \u2014Insulated peripheral nerve block needle 6\" length and 20 gaugee \u2014Conducting gel General Preparation Sedate the horse appropriately Locate injection site Surgically prepare the injection site Fill syringes with local anesthetic and flood extension lines if used Don sterile gloves and work in sterile manner for injection Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block Technique 11 The inferior alveolar nerve block anesthetizes theinferior alveolar nerve as it branches away from themandibular nerve and travels into the mandibularforamen and the mandibular canal. This block willprovide analgesia to the ipsilateral teeth in addition soft-tissue the mental nerve. 2The is located rostrally on the medialaspect of the coronoid process at the level of theipsilateral mandibular occlusal surface. 3 Locate the mandibular foramen at the inter- section of the following two lines:\u2014Lay a straight edge along the buccal surfaceof the mandibular cheek teeth. The mandib-ular third incisor-canine-second premolar in-terproximal space provides a visible markerfor the location of this line. Mark this linewith a Sharpie as it crosses over the masseter muscle.\u2014Lay the straight edge from the lateral aspectof the mandibular condyle to the vascularnotch of the mandible. Use the Sharpie tomark on the masseter the intersection point ofthe two lines. This intersection point pro-vides an estimate of the location of the man-dibular foramen on the medial aspect of thecoronoid process.\u2014Prior to injection, hold the 6-inch needle tobe used above the skin in a vertical plane tomeasure the distance on the needle from theventral aspect of the ramus to the mandibularforamen. This indicates the depth of needleinsertion on the medial aspect of the mandibleto reach the foramen.\u2014Perform block with or without the assistanceof a nerve stimulator. The use of a nervestimulator, in the horse, has not been pub-lished but is used in multiple academic insti-tutions. The use of the nerve stimulator givesthe clinician conrmation of appropriate depo-sition of anesthetic, reducing the volume ofanesthetic required, thus decreasing possibleimpacts to adjacent nerves like the lingualnerve. The masticatory reflex is believed tobe the result of stimulation of the inferior al-veolar nerve resulting in the jaw-opening re-flex and the reflex inhibition of jaw-closingmuscles similar to that described in detail inthe cat. If no nerve stimulation guidance is chosen, use the 6-inch, 20-gauge Tuohy needle to performthe block. Use of an extension set is recom-mended for ease. Positioning of the needleand delivery of anesthetic is the same forstimulation-guided and nonguided blocks.\u2014Connect a 6-inch, insulatednerve-block needle to unit and second con-tact to horse.\u2014Initially set the unit at 1 mA and 1 Hz. Thisis well tolerated by sedated horses.\u2014The needle is introduced /H110111-2-cm medial to the most ventromedial aspect of the mandible.\u2014The needle is directed dorsolateral toward themedial aspect of the mandible and coronoid pro-cess and toward the region marked by a Sharpie.Initially introduce the needle at a 30\u00b0 angle tothe coronoid process to avoid the pterygoid fossa.At this angle, the needle should rst contactbone on the dorsal aspect of the pterygoid fossa.\u2014When the needle contacts bone, redirect theneedle to a parallel plane with the coronoid pro-cess and try to keep the needle constantly incontact with the bone while sliding dorsally.\u2014As you get close to the mandibular foramen,twitching of the mylohyoid muscle and the digas-tricus muscle may be evident.\u2014Once you reach the premeasured length of theneedle, a 449BACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY FUNDAMENTALSin rhythm with the stimulation will indicate proximity of the inferior alveolar nerve. Turnthe unit to 0.5 mA to more precisely locate thenerve.\u2014The syringe is aspirated to ensure no directplacement in Inject 10-12 cc of localanesthetic slowly.\u2014If no masticatory reflex is elicited, carefullyredirect or advance the needle until the reflex isstimulated. Avoid making wide excursionswith the needle. If necessary, completely re-move the needle and attempt a slightly differentangle/placement. Technique 2 A second technique for anesthetizing the inferior alveolar nerve intraorally has been published in the literature. 4This technique requires fabrication of an intraoral device for anesthetic delivery. The study evaluated the efcacy of the intraoral block on clienthorses and reported the ndings. Determination ofefcacy was based on the ability to perform thenecessary dental procedure. If the reader is inter-ested in performing intraoral inferior alveolarblocks, it is strongly recommended that they refer tothe paper for anatomical guidance, needle position-ing, and encountered complications. Mental Foramen Nerve Block This block is NOT well tolerated by the horse due to the almost unavoidable direct needle contact withthe nerve; therefore, the slow approach describedusing the repeated lidocaine injections is paramountfor horse comfort and practitioner safety. The mental foramen nerve block anesthetizes the rostral portion of the inferior alveolar nerve as itbranches into the rostral inferior alveolar nerve thatinnervates the canine and incisor teeth and themental nerve at the level of the mental foramen.If the block is delivered to the rostral inferior alve-olar nerve, then the ipsilateral canine and incisorteeth will be anesthetized in addition to the skin andlip rostral to the mental foramen. Only the mentalnerve (skin and lip) will be anesthetized if the localanesthetic is not delivered through the mental fora-men into the mandibular canal. Mental foramenpositioning is 13of the horizontal distance of the incisor-premolar space from the second premolarand 13of the vertical distance in the mandible from the dorsal surface of interproximal space at the levelof the foramen. 5The mental foramen mean size is width, 6.4 mm (range, 2.3-17.1 mm) and height, 5.6 mm (range, 2.1-10.3 mm).5Angulation of the fora - men into the rostral mandibular canal was mean /H11006 SD, 68.3 plane, 22.2-58.6\u00b0); and dorsal plane.5Dorsal the tendon of the de - pressor labii inferioris, which lies over the foramen,will assist with palpation. 2-4,6Locate the position of the mental foramen. Clip, clean, and prep site. Use a 3.5\"-length; 22-gauge needle attached to an extension set for this block. Two anesthetics are used to perform this block so have 3 mL of lidocaine and 6 mL of bupiv-acaine available. The lidocaine is used toslowly approach the mental foramen, whichallows for the needle to be passed through theforamen and into the rostral mandibular canalwhere the bupivacaine can be deposited. Palpate the foramen. Introduce the needle roughly 1 cm rostral to the foramen and de-posit 0.5-1 mL of lidocaine. Wait 60 secondsto for the lidocaine to take effect. Advance the needle to the foramen in a medio- caudal direction /H110111 cm and deposit another 1 mL of lidocaine in the region of the mentalforamen. Wait 60 seconds. To advance the needle into the foramen, angle the needle roughly 40\u00b0 lateral to the lateralaspect of the mandible and 25\u00b0 dorsal in rela-tion to the dorsal surface of the incisor-canineinterproximal space. 5,7 Once through the foramen, the needle is ad- vanced in a dorsolateral to ventromedial direc-tion roughly 1 cm into the rostral mandibularcanal, and digital pressure is applied to themental foramen to stabilize the needle andprevent outflow of local anesthetic. The syringe is aspirated to ensure no direct placement in a vessel. Slowly deposit 5 mL of bupivacaine. Once complete, cease digital pressure over theforamen. Slowly remove the needle and reapply pres- sure to the site for roughly 1 minute. Maxillary Nerve Block (Extraperiorbital Fat Body Insertion Technique) 8 The maxillary nerve block anesthetizes the infraor-bital nerve as it branches from the maxillary nervein the region of the pterygopalatine fossa. Thisnerve block will provide analgesia to all ipsilateralmaxillary teeth and gingiva. The ExtraperiorbitalFat Body Insertion technique aims to infuse anes-thetic into the extraperiorbital fat body, which al-lows for diffusion of anesthetic into region of maxillary nerve. By using this technique, thepractitioner avoids close contact of the needle tipwith signicant regional vessels and nerves. Locate the entry point for a 3.5\", 22-gauge Tuohy needle.\u2014Follow facial crest to most caudal aspectwhere the crest starts to deviate dorsally tobecome part of the zygomatic arch. This point is usually located in the region of themiddle third to caudal third of the eyeball, 450 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY FUNDAMENTALSbut different facial conformation and various size horses make the use of eyeball position-ing less reliable.\u2014Roughly 10 mm caudal to the point of dor-sal deviation of the facial crest and parallelto the plane of the body of the facial crestmarks the point of entry for the needle. Clip, clean, and prep the site. This injection MUST be performed in a sterile manner. Holding the Tuohy needle perpendicular to the skin, the needle is advanced into the massetermuscle. As the needle passes through themultiple bodies of the masseter muscle, smallchanges in needle resistance will be felt. If at 10-20 mm of depth a bony structure is encountered, withdraw the needle and reposi-tion the needle another 5 mm caudal. Thebony structure is the dorsal potion of the max-illary tuber. At roughly 50-70 mm depth a denitive \"pop\" will be encountered with the needle and theresistance to advancement of the needle will bemuch less after the pop. The increased resis-tance accounting for the pop is the thick fascialplane dividing the masseter muscle from theextraperiorbital fat body. Once the needle has passed through this fas- cial plane, it is advanced an additional 5 mminto the extraperiorbital fat body. When the needle is appropriately positioned, 12 mL of anesthetic material (the type of an-esthetic material will vary depending on thelength of the procedure) can be slowly injectedinto the site. Remember to aspirate prior toinjection. Remove the needle and apply pressure to the entry point for 15-30 seconds. 3. Discussion Most of the published material regarding dental re-gional anesthesia in horses has been in the form ofreview article or textbook summary. A variety ofnerve block techniques have been described, butthere are only four current articles to the author'sknowledge that utilize a combination of computedtomography (CT) scanning, cadaveric experimenta-tion, and in vivo testing to analyze important re-gional anatomic landmarks, explore injectatedistribution, and to determine efcacy (level 2-3scientic evidence). 4,5,7,8The author opted to not explore the intraoral inferior alveolar nerve block as it was felt that this technique required a certainamount of dental expertise/experience to performsafely. Instead the author chose to describe themore traditional technique (supported by level 4scientic evidence) 1,9and enhanced by the use of a nerve stimulator if available. The choice of local anesthetic agent depends mostly on the duration of action the practitionerhopes to achieve. As the use of narcotics is lessdesirable in the horse due to decreased gastricmotility and the risk of colic, it is desirable to use a local anesthetic that will work for as long aspossible to help provide postoperative analgesia.Regional nerve blocks should be performed priorto performing surgery or extracting teeth, anddepending on the length of surgery, providing asecond block prior to recovery can be benecialpostoperatively. The author has found bupiva-caine to be an excellent local anesthetic for max-illofacial and dental procedures. It should benoted that bupivacaine's onset of action is longerthan other local anesthetics (10-20 minutes);therefore, lag time can be minimized by placingthe block prior to any surgical preparation, oralexam, and/or odontoplasty. The risk of complications that can arise during nerve blocks is signicant. Needle on nerve con-tact, as in the case of the mental nerve block, canresult in an explosive response from the horse nomatter how sedate. Practitioners should be pre-pared to deal with this type of response and keepthemselves, their staff, and laymen in safe posi-tions. Hemorrhage from vessel laceration is pos-sible if the horse moves suddenly when needlesare in place; this is a particular risk with maxil-lary nerve blocks. Ensuring animals are heavilysedated during nerve block placement is para-mount. Neurovascular damage is a major com-plication that can occur with the use of regionalnerve blocks. This is particularly importantwhen entering tight canals or regions packed withmajor vessels and nerves. Conventionally usedspinal or hypodermic needles cut through thesestructures. Using needles specically designedfor nerve blocks (Tuohy needles) and decreasingneedle size helps reduce this risk. The smallestpossible gauge needle should always be used tominimize nerve and vessel laceration. The tip ofTuohy needles have a rounded bevel with cuttingedges off to the side; therefore, these needles aremore likely to push the vasculature and nervesaway from the needle tip. The more blunt end ofthe Tuohy needle also provides increased tactilefeedback. This becomes a major advantage whenplacing the maxillary nerve block as it helps iden-tify the distinct \"pop\" associated with the medialfascial plane of the masseter muscle. If placingthe inferior alveolar nerve block, lingual macera-tion is a risk. The use of the nerve stimulator orthe intraoral technique may reduce this risk assmaller amounts of anesthetic can be placed at thesite of the inferior alveolar nerve. Overall, it isrecommended to not place left and right inferioralveolar nerve blocks at the same time as this runsthe risk of completely anesthetizing the tongue.Finally, all nerve blocks should be performed in asterile manner to prevent injection site infection. 4. Conclusion Regional nerve blocks make it possible to performmost extractions under standing sedation.

Many compli-cations of tooth extraction can be avoided with proper presurgical planning and appropriate diagnosis ofthe disease process affecting the tooth to be extracted. Author's address: Midwest Veterinary is a common procedure performed in equine dental practice. It is even more commonin the recent years due to a heightened level oftraining in the area of the oral examination and thediagnostic imaging process. Practitioners have abetter understanding of oral anatomy and are oftennding dental pathology before a large crisis in theoral cavity has occurred. Advances in digital imag-ing has increased the frequency that horses haveimages obtained of the oral cavity furthering theidentication of oral pathology. 1 Exodontia in our equine patients is best performed intraorally. Current equine literature has shownthat intraoral extractions carry the lowest complica-tion rates. These can often be performed in thestanding sedated patient with proper restraint. The reader is directed to other texts on sedationprotocols and regional anesthesia for equine ex-tractions. 2,3However, exodontia is an imperfect process. It often depends on chance as to whichteeth deliver easily and which cause great stressand anguish to the veterinarian and the horse.This paper will discuss how to plan for the bestextraction process with tips on avoiding obstaclesthat will increase the chance of failure of the tooth being delivered intraorally. 2. Anatomy Teeth are held in the oral cavity by the periodon-tium. The health and characteristics of the fourparts of the periodontium are one of the most impor-tant factors that affects the success of the extractionprocess. The gingiva, or oral portion of the perio-dontium, acts like a \"gasket\" keeping a barrier oforal contaminates from entering the periodontal lig-ament space. The next component of the periodon-tium is the periodontal ligament that suspends thetooth via an intricate network of bers that inter-digitate with the alveolar bone and cementum of thetooth. The last 2 components of the periodontiumare the cementum of the tooth and the alveolar bone.The cementum covering the tooth is a living tissuethat is constantly adapting to stress placed on itby the periodontal ligament. The size and shape ofthe tooth periphery can change based on the re-sponse of the cementum. The bony alveolustightly surrounds a tooth to m atch every contour of a tooth providing great stability in the bony jaw ofthe horse. Changes can also occur in the alveolarbone, causing an increased or decreased difculty in AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 453BACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY FUNDAMENTALS NOTESthe extraction process. Radiographic imaging will demonstrate many of the changes of these struc-tures such as an increased width of the periodontalligament space, alveolar periostitis, and increasedformation of the cementum. The oral examinationwill reveal changes to the gingiva such as recession,enlargement, draining tracts through the gingiva ormucosa and loss of the gingiva entirely. Mobility ofthe tooth should always be scored and determinedwhile performing the oral exam. The dental endodontic system is made up of the live pulp of the tooth (Fig. 1), which is contained inthe dentin of the pulp horns, common pulp chamber,and root canals. The live pulp of the tooth is con-tinuously producing dentin to compensate for attri-tion on the chewing surface of the tooth. While theinfundibula of maxillary cheek teeth are not techni-cally part of the vital structure of the tooth, theydeserve discussion when looking at the endodonticsystem since they are commonly affected by cariesthat can cause tooth decay and fracture. Infundib-ula are enamel lined structures that should be lledentirely with infundibular cementum. It is not un-common for there to be defects in this cementumthat can become caries when feed material becomesimpacted in the defect, initiating the decay process.If the carious process extends into the neighboringpulp canals, then an apical infection can result.Alternatively, infundibular caries can weaken thetooth, causing tooth fracture, which often results inan apical infection.When preparing for an oral extraction, the end- odontic system needs to be carefully examined(ideally oral endoscopy) and imaged (complete radio-graphic series of dental quadrants and paranasalsinuses) to determine the tooth's integrity and itsability to withstand the necessary forces requiredto deliver the tooth. Clinical exam ndings thatpertain to endodontic disease are tooth caries. Ra-diographic ndings that correlate with endodonticdisease include failure of pulp horns to narrow overtime, loss of crown integrity, tooth fractures of anykind including structure due tochronic reorganization of the apex of the tooth. Tooth resorption is discovered in many different types (Fig. 2), this can affect the ability to deliver atooth in its entirety. The two most common typesof tooth resorption seen in horses are external in-flammatory resorption and external replacementresorption. In external inflammatory resorption,there is progressive loss of the dental hard sub-stances beginning on the periphery of the tooth withprogression towards the pulp as the resorption be-comes more advanced. This type of resorption isseen radiographically by an irregular pitted appear-ance on the tooth and widening of the periodontalligament space. In these cases, hypercementosismay be noted as well if the process has been going onfor a considerable amount of time. 4 Fig. 1. Cartoon schematic of a maxillary cheek tooth, incisor tooth, and canine tooth. These images highlight the anatomy pertaining to each type of tooth in the equine. They are meant to review the periodontal and endodontic anatomy of these teeth. 454 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: DENTISTRY FUNDAMENTALSThe second most common form of tooth resorption seen in the horse is external replacement resorption, inwhich the external surface of the tooth is being convertedinto bony-like material. The radiographic appearanceof this type of resorption is either disappearance of theperiodontal ligament space or a void of the periodontalligament space entirely. This is often referred to asankylosis of the tooth, and is commonly seen in elderlypatients. In humans and dogs, this type of tooth resorp-tion is considered to be a normal aging change. It isimportant to recognize this in surgical planning, sinceloss of the periodontal ligament space may mean that thetooth must be chiseled from bone. Combining the information from the oral examina- tion and diagnostic imaging will allow you to predictpossible pitfalls that may be encountered during the ex-traction process, such as tooth disintegration or fracture.Choosing an appropriate extraction method that willlimit traumatic forces placed on the tooth during theloosening process will help set you up for success. Hav-ing training in multiple extraction methods, and a widevariety of instruments available will also increase the chances of a successful intraoral extraction. Periodontal disease causes an increased width of the periodontal ligament space due to the the in-flammatory process. The result is a loss of attach- ment of the tooth. Loss of attachment will increasethe tooth's mobility in the socket. The increasingmobility creates less periodontal attachment, whichusually correlates to an easier extraction process(Fig. 3). However, even a highly mobile tooth needsto be radiographed because sometimes the reasonfor the mobility is that the tooth has already frac-tured a root! Another common scenario seen in theolder horse is ankylosis of one root (external replace-ment resorption) with periodontal disease causing aloss of attachment to another root (or portion of tooth).The tooth will loosen quickly in the portion whereattachment is lost, but it remains rmly attached inthe area of ankylosis. Cases such as this are compli-cated, while it appears the extraction process is mov-ing forward quickly, in reality, separation of a root orportion of the tooth is likely. Removal of the portionof tooth with attachment loss is usually quite easy, butthe ankylosed portion can be quite difcult. In thesecases, it is important to carefully examine where theperiodontal ligament space should be in order to applyspecic luxation in these areas to successfully deliverthe remaining portion of tooth. 3. The Extraction Process The periodontium must be stressed and broken downto gain mobility of the tooth. The rst step of this is a Fig. 2. Radiographs of incisor tooth resorption.

B, Tooth 408 has evidenceof crown fracture and lytic areas (black stars) in the endodontic struc-tures of the tooth. The black arrowheads indicate an irregular borderof the periodontal ligament space and areas of narrowing. Togetherthese ndings increase the risk of crown failure during the extractionprocess. One must plan accordingly and be prepared to resort to an-other extraction technique if needed. Fig. 5.

This cuts the bers of the gingival tissue away from the tooth at the level of the crest ofthe alveolar bone. Sharp extraction luxators can alsobe placed in the periodontal ligament space to cut theperiodontal ligament and provide further rotationalstress on the periodontal ligament. Further reduc- tion in the periodontal attachment before the ex-traction forceps are utilized will increase thelikelihood of a successful extraction. 5 Endodontic disease affects the structural integrity of the tooth itself. Tooth fractures, pulp exposure,infundibular caries, or enlargement of the apex of thetooth may all complicate intraoral extraction efforts.It is important be fully aware of all of these potentialconditions of the tooth in order to properly plan theextraction. Examples would include, open pulp hornswith an enlargement of the apex, tooth root ankylosis(Fig. 4) and concurrently crown fracture with signi-cant crown missing, and enlargements of the apex dueto dysplastic dental material (Fig. 5). In these cases,the endodontic disease is chronic and will often lead toa frustrating extraction. In opposition of the afore-mentioned conditions, a large periapical lucency maypresent with apical blunting. In these cases the toothmay be quite easy to extract. These easier extrac-tions are often seen in the case of young horses withlarge periapical swellings. Even though the teeth ofyoung horses are quite large, they often have a wideperiodontal ligament space and an attachment that iseasy to break down and deliver the tooth (Fig. 6).It is important to be sure to remove all of the live pulpthat may remain in the alveolus otherwise pulp tissueleft in the alveolus that retains a blood supply cancontinue to produce dysplastic dental material and beproblematic in the future. Tooth resorption can be present in different types and depending on the form create different difcul-ties in the extraction process. We have discussedthat external replacement resorption or ankylosiscan be problematic as the tooth is difcult to freefrom the alveolus and can fracture easily. Differingfrom external replacement resorption, teeth withexternal inflammatory resorption generally have awidened periodontal ligament space and loss ofdental hard substances. These teeth may loosenquickly from the alveolar bone but can have a highincidence of root tip separation. External inflam-matory resorption is the type of resorption that is generally associated in elderly horses with equineodontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis(EOTRH). One must plan accordingly and obtainradiographs postoperatively. If a portion of a toothroot that has external inflammatory root resorptionis left, the alveolar socket will never heal properly. 4. Conclusion It is important to plan each extraction individuallybased on the clinical examination and the informationgleaned from diagnostic imaging. With careful atten-tion to detail, the difculty of the surgery will be illus-trated with the proper diagnostics. Teeth withnormal shapes, large periapical lucencies, increasedmobility, and widened periodontal ligaments are gen-erally extracted with less difculty. Teeth with anarrow to nonexistent periodontal ligament space, lossof crown integrity, exposed pulp horns, advanced in-fundibular caries, and abnormal shapes and positionscan be extracted, but only with an increased level ofdifculty. It is a better plan to refer or get help witha case than to give it a try and create a bigger problemthan what you were presented with.

Introduction The subject of retirement planning can seem com- plicated and daunting. Sometimes the furtheraway you are from \"retirement\" the more difcultthe process may appear. However, retirementplanning for the equine veterinarian is very impor-tant because sooner or later you will no longer beable to practice veterinary medicine. Retirementplanning and nancial planning is a process, not anevent. Life and circumstances change and so doesyour personal retirement plans. Personal nancial retirement planning starts with \"keeping score\" of where you are nancially today. Planning also requires a clearly desired out-come that aligns your accumulated wealth with yourpurpose. Keeping score requires regular \"check-ups\" to measure progress, celebrate victories, adjustfor the challenges that inevitably come to any retire-ment plan. These check ups can be measured inboth percentages and in time. Personal cash flow and personal net worth are major areas to consider when developing a personalnancial plan. Personal cash flow is the amount ofdisposable cash you have available. Once youknow your disposable cash flow you have to decidehow much of that disposable cash flow you want toallocate toward retirement planning. In essence,you are giving a portion of your disposable cash flowa job of funding your retirement. Generally, if youallocate 10% of your total cash inflows per year toward retirement you will be on track toward re-tirement. Personal net worth is calculated by add-ing up the value of all assets and subtracting fromthat total value of assets all debt obligations. Sim-ilarly, once you know your personal net worth youcan analyze how much of that net worth is allocatedtoward retirement. The closer you are to retiringthe more of your net worth should be allocated to-ward retirement. There are three things you can do with money: spend, save, or give it away. These areas can bemeasured as a percentage of personal cash inflow.Personal nancial planning allows you to develop amoney philosophy and an established money philos-ophy gives every dollar a job. An example of amoney philosophy would be determining that 10% ofpersonal cash inflow will be given away. Thiswould leave 90% of the remaining cash flow to beallocated between saving and spending. Spending happens! It happens with monthly ex- penses, unexpected purchases, and one-time ex-penses. It is important to remember that moneywithout a purpose will evaporate and be spent, notsaved. Lifestyle creep and debt load are examples of money evaporating. Lifestyle creep is responsi-ble for wrecking many retirement plans. Lifestylecreep occurs when your spending rises with yourincome without you being aware of the increase in AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 457THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF YOUR PRACTICE NOTESlifestyle. If you give every dollar a job through keeping score and reviewing your cash flow period-ically you can see lifestyle creep and make the nec-essary adjustments before your lifestyle hasincreased to a point where it is difcult to adjust. Savings can happen! Keeping score and estab- lishing a money philosophy will give every dollar apurpose and a job. Keep discipline around yournances, keep score and follow your money philoso-phy. The earlier a dened money philosophy is es-tablished, the better because if you have begunsaving for retirement early in your professional ca-reer the power of compounding interest will make agreat difference in the success of your retirementplan. The earlier you start saving, the less youneed to save as you approach your retirement years. As money is saved it is important to determine \"where to save it.\" There are three places you cansave money. These places can be dened by the taxnature of the distributions from these vehicles.Qualied plans are fully taxable when consumed in retirement. There are also tax-free or \"duty-free\"vehicles that allow for tax-free consumption in re-tirement. The remaining vehicle, known as Non-Qualied, has some sort of taxation at consumption,whether that taxation is ordinary income or capitalgains on the appreciation. Qualied assets are most commonly recognized as Traditional IRAs, 401(k), SEPs, and Simple IRAs.This form of savings offers a tax deduction as youcontribute into the account and it is fully taxable asit is withdrawn/consumed in retirement. Gener-ally speaking, these assets once saved are not avail-able until age 59 12years and are asset protected from creditors before withdrawn. Tax-free or \"duty-free\" assets are most commonly recognized as Roth IRAs, Roth 401(K), and cashvalue life insurance. These assets offer no tax de-duction as they are saved. These assets grow \"du-ty/tax free\" as they accumulate and are withdrawnfor consumption \"duty/tax free.\" Non-Qualied assets are most commonly recog- nized as closely held business assets, income produc-ing real estate, personal residence, brokerage and savings accounts. They are the assets that are notheld in the Qualied and Duty-Free vehicles. Typ-ically, as you approach retirement, this will be yourlargest group of assets of the three discussed herein. It is important to evenly allocate your net worth as much as possible throughout the three buckets.Keeping score and monitoring your allocation ateach review of your plan will help identify adjust-ments to the allocation to these vehicles that need tobe made. What can happen to derail your plan? Failing to start soon enough or save enough for retirement canhave a dramatic impact your retirement. Keepingscore and knowing where you are in your profes-sional journey will help prevent not saving enough,soon enough. Another potential risk to your retire-ment plan is personal disability. It is importantthat veterinarians protect from disability through aproperly structured personal disability policy. Alldisability policies are not created equal, so it isimportant to nd an industry professional who isknowledgeable in the area of disability forveterinarians. Retirement planning is a journey that you must consider throughout your professional career. It isnot too soon or too late to begin. It is importantthat you start, take the rst step toward keepingscore and then map out a process for moving to-wards your goals for retirement. Retirement plan-ning is more than just contributing to an IRA or401(k), it is a process that requires you to considerboth your net worth and your cash flow and howmuch of your net worth and cash flow you are allo-cating toward retirement.

Reese Hand, DVM, DACVS Pre-purchase exams are one of the most common, complicated, and stressful exams performed in an equine practice. The veterinarian is asked to do a thorough analysis of the horse to ensure it ishealthy enough for the intended career at that given moment in time. Veterinarians are alsofrequently asked to examine horses for dealers who are not just interested in the horse's serviceabilitybut their ability to resell the horse for a prot. This evaluation is composed of past history, currentexam, and speculative forecasting. The American Association of Equine Practitioners has approvedguidelines for reporting purchase exams. Author's Today's horse owner varies from the backyard owner to the professional owner, the business investor, thebreeder and so on. In all of these scenarios, the buyerwants more today than in the past. They want pre-dictions of future soundness, use, and longevity. It israre to nd a 100% sound horse. However, there areserviceable horses, including those that have obviousclinical lameness. Dening serviceability for eachhorse requires a great deal of judgment and interpre-tation. Experience in equine practice and knowledgeof the horse's discipline are both advantages in advis-ing clients about the potential of a horse's medicalcondition and its effect on the intended use. The goalof the examining veterinarian should not be to identifyimperfections that the horse might have but rather theveterinarian should thoroughly evaluate the horse andidentify abnormalities and discuss the potential forthose abnormalities to affect the intended use of thehorse. When combined with the increasing knowl-edge of equine owners and the value of the horse, thepre-purchase exam carries a lot of weight and poten-tial for liability. It is imperative that the equine prac-titioner go into the exam with a consistent and reliable exam so that all bases are covered and then a gooddocument can be submitted to the medical record. 1 2. Materials and Methods/Results The following are the basic components of a pre-purchase exam. There is not a standardized examfor pre-purchase. Each exam will, and should be,tailor-made for the individual. However, for liabil-ity issues, all components should be discussed with a buyer. 1. Pre-purchase exam form. 2. Signature of the seller and buyer on declarations. 3. Conversation with the prospective buyer and the seller or their agent. 4. Thorough physical exam of the patient. Conformation, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, teeth, age, joints, tendons, ligaments,feet, abdomen, back/sacroiliac (SI), genitalia,etc. Review of any past or current health issues.

Discussion With the many different disciplines in horses, there are high points and similarities that will be seen inthose disciplines and, therefore, should be consid-ered in each exam. The veterinarian's role whendoing a pre-purchase exam is to nd out everythingpossible about the horse's physical status and thendocument the ndings in writing. This will bebased on the individual clinician's personal opinionto try to spell out all the different possible scenariosfor management, treatment, and outcome of the var- ious problems that the horse has and try to givesome kind of odds, based on his or her's experienceas to what might be expected related to the prob-lems. Pre-purchase exam can be a stressful andoverwhelming event to practitioners. Liability, cli-ent satisfaction/approval, and image interpretationare just a few of the stresses. However, done prop-erly, it is a great prot center, which often results ina long-term veterinarian/patient relationship. Thetime involvement, liability, and knowledge are thekey factors to keep in mind. Having a pre-printedform to follow, doing a consistent exam the sameway every time and having good documentation willsignicantly decrease the stress and worries associ-ated with the pre-purchase exam.

Introduction Diagnostic imaging has become an integral part of most pre-purchase examinations and is used incases where the nancial investment of the horsenecessitates a greater degree of risk assessmentthan can be achieved solely by the clinical exam-ination. In the pre-purchase examination, radio- graphs are the most frequently used imagingmodality. However, as our understanding of boththe contribution of different imaging modalitiesand the limitations of radiographs increases, addi-tional imaging modalities are more frequently beingutilized as a part of pre-purchase examinations.This is especially true if abnormalities are identiedon radiographs, and the clinical relevance of these abnormalities can be better determined with addi-tional imaging. Understanding the contribution ofeach imaging modality in regard to different types ofpathologic change is necessary in the pre-purchaseexamination to allow the selection of additional im-aging that will provide the most accurate risk as-sessment. Once the imaging has been completed,and any abnormalities have been identied andcharacterized as well as is possible, the clinical rel-evance and associated risk must be determined.This comes from combining the imaging ndingswith the clinical examination and is typically a com-bination of experience and information provided in the literature. These different pieces of informa-tion are then presented to the client so that theymay make an informed decision. The specic needsof the client play a large role in the nal decision-making process, specically in regard to the in-tended use of the horse and its suitability for thatjob as well as the level of risk the client is willing to undertake. 2. Areas of Concern Based on Specic Western Performance Disciplines Knowing the predilection site of injury based on discipline is important when evaluating imagingas part of a pre-purchase examination. Foot painand distal tarsal osteoarthritis is a common themein western performance horses and affects all west-ern performance disciplines. However, in additionto foot pain and distal tarsal disease, each disciplinehas other regions that are more likely to be affectedor specic patterns of injury based on the type ofathletic activity performed by the horse. Suspen-sory ligament injury in the forelimbs and injury tothe stifle characterized by osteoarthritis and/or softtissue injury is a concern in reining and cuttinghorses. 1Barrel racing horses have a specic pat- tern of injury likely based on their AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 461HOW-TO SESSION: WESTERN HORSE NOTESwith forelimb lameness being more common than left forelimb lameness, and left hind lamenessbeing more common than right hindlimb lameness. 2 In addition, barrel racing horses have increasedcarpal disease and back pain as well as suspensoryligament injury and bruised feet. 2,3Similar to bar - rel horses, team roping horses have specic injurypatterns. 4In heading horses, the right forelimb is most frequently affected, and bilateral forelimb lameness is more prevalent than in heeling horses,which have a higher incidence of bilateral hindlimblameness. Associated with these specic injurypatterns, heading horses have increased soft tissueinjury in the pastern region, whereas heeling horsesare more likely to have metatarsophalangeal jointdisease. 4These discipline-specic patterns of in - jury should be considered when selecting and eval-uating imaging in a pre-purchase examination. 3. Radiographic Examination There are differing opinions on the standard radio-graphic views used in the pre-purchase examinationof the western performance horse. Traditionally,the most common views obtained were feet, hocks,and stifles. However, more commonly, a full seriesof radiographs is obtained, including the frontand hind fetlocks and the cervical spine, in addi-tion to the feet, hocks, and stifles. The back is alsobeing imaged with increasing frequency. The west-ern discipline being examined and its specicpredilection sites of injury will factor into the selec-tion of radiographic views. Furthermore, the iden-tication of radiographic abnormalities may thennecessitate additional radiographic views. The na-vicular bone is of particular interest in the westernperformance horse. Although radiographic evalua-tion of the navicular bone is by no means a newconcept, radiograph evaluation and interpretation ofthe navicular bone bear further discussion. The navicular bone is evaluated on the standard foot study. However, additional views may be help-ful in evaluating the flexor surface, an area of par-ticular interest due to the signicance of injury inthis region. The skyline view of the navicular bonein the foot study is typically obtained at 55 degrees.A detailed assessment of this view should be per-formed with evaluation of the flexor surface marginand density, the density of the trabecular bone (cor-ticomedullary junction), and the size of the synovialinvaginations, as well as other anatomic features ofthe navicular bone. However, a more shallow sky-line view may actually highlight the area of theflexor surface that is most often affected with boneloss. A 30-degree skyline view has been shown toincrease the visibility of density changes in theflexor surface at the mid to distal aspect of thenavicular bone. 5The two, differently angled, sky - line views allow a more thorough assessment ofthe navicular bone flexor surface. However, be-cause of the increased obliquity of the 30-degreeskyline view relative to the corticomedullary junc-tion, the 55-degree skyline view remains important for evaluating the density of the trabecular bone andidentifying sclerosis, which can be an indication ofpathologic change. In clinical practice, navicularbones are often reported to be sclerotic radiograph-ically. However, corresponding magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) examinations frequently donot demonstrate increased density in the navicularbone. This discrepancy seems to be the result ofradiographic obliquity and technique. The visibil-ity of the articulation between the middle phalanxand the dorsal margin of the navicular bone is onecriterion used to evaluate the quality of the skylineview positioning. With good visibility of the jointspace, the radiograph should accurately representthe anatomy. However, in many cases, the jointspace appears visible, indicating good positioning ofthe skyline view, but on closer examination it be-comes evident that the x-ray beam was only angledthrough the joint space at one level. This can bedetermined by identifying two dorsal navicular bonemargins, one proximal and one distal. In the caseswith less than ideal positioning, one dorsal navicu-lar bone margin will be superimposed over the pal-mar aspect of the middle phalanx, which can resultin the false appearance of increased trabecular bonedensity within the navicular bone (Fig. 1). Recogni-tion of this particular feature will aid in better po-sitioning of the skyline view and ideally lead to theproduction of a radiograph that will more accuratelyrepresent the trabecular bone density. When evaluating the navicular bone, an assess- ment of the trabecular bone density should be per-formed on all available views. An assessment of Fig. 1. Skyline navicular views (A-D) with increasing visibility of the distal interphalangeal joint space between the dorsal aspect ofthe navicular bone and the palmar aspect of the middle pha-lanx. The joint space is not visible on A. The joint space is partiallyvisible on B and C, indicating the x-ray beam was aligned with theproximal or distal aspect of the joint. This can be identied byseparation of the proximal and distal margins (arrows on B) of thenavicular bone flexor surface and superimposition of a single marginover the palmar margin of the middle phalanx. However, in D thejoint space is completely visible, which provides the most accuraterepresentation of the trabecular bone density. 462 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSEthe lateral view is an important part of a thorough radiograph evaluation of the navicular bone. How-ever, frequently prominent navicular bone abnor-malities are present that are not evident on thelateral view. Therefore, it can be difcult whenthere are discrepancies in the navicular bone ap-pearance on the lateral and skyline views. Imagequality, with assessment of technique and position,as well as the conspicuity of the potential abnormal-ity on each specic view, are considerations whendetermining which view is more accurate in caseswith a discrepancy. The same detailed assessment of all the views in all anatomic regions should be undertaken. Eachradiographic view should be fully evaluated forabnormalities but will highlight particular areasand types of pathologic change. Not every radio-graph can be perfect. However, ideally, the partic-ular area of interest for each radiograph should bewell visualized, despite imperfections in the image.The fact that certain abnormalities can only be iden-tied on a single, specic radiographic view becomesextremely important when evaluating pre-purchaseradiograph studies. Incomplete studies will pre-vent the identication of abnormalities that may berelevant in a pre-purchase examination. This is animportant discussion point when views are omittedat the client's request, to ensure they understandthe ramications of this decision. Abnormalities identied during acquisition of the standard views should be assessed to determine ifadditional radiographic views can be obtained thatwill provide more information about the identiedabnormality. The importance of slightly differentangles in the dorsopalmar view when evaluatingfetlocks has been shown. 6Slightly different angles can obscure or highlight injury to the sagittal groove of the proximal phalanx as well as to other regionsof the fetlock joint. This is also true in other joints.If there is concern due to an abnormality identiedon the clinical exanimation or a suspicious nd-ing on a standard view, then changing the angleslightly from the standard view can be helpful.Similar to the DP view of the fetlock, this applies tothe oblique views of the tarsi and the caudocranialviews of the stifles. An example of this on thecaudocranial view of the stifle occurs between themedial periarticular margin and the caudomedialmargin of in medial ofthe periarticular margin, obscuringperi-articular proliferation. can be alleviatedby recognizing the superimposition and retaking theview with a slight change in the medial to lateralangle of the beam. In addition to slight changes in the standard views, views that further highlight certain abnor-malities should also be utilized when those abnor-malities are identied the standard study. Theflexed cranio 10\u00b0 disto 10\u00b0 lateral-caudoproximome- dial oblique view of the stifle is considered quitebenecial when potential abnormalities are identi-ed on the distal aspect of the medial femoral con-dyle. 7This view provides an additional dimension to abnormalities on the cranial distal aspect of the medial femoral condyle that is not achieved with thestandard view of the stifle. The contribution ofoblique views of the cervical spine is becoming in-creasingly apparent and should be considered, espe-cially with any clinical signs related to this region. In certain cases, abnormalities are identied on radiographs that cannot be fully characterized fora number of different reasons. These reasons mostoften include soft tissue involvement, the limitationsof detecting subtle changes in bone density radio-graphically, and/or the presence of associated fluid.In this situation, additional imaging modalities area consideration. The decision to use additional im-aging modalities in the pre-purchase examination ismade based on details individual to each case, suchas the specic abnormality or area of concern, theimaging modalities available in the location of thehorse, the client's budget, and the possibility ofachieving useful information. 4. Additional Imaging Modalities Ultrasound, nuclear scintigraphy, computed tomog-raphy (CT), and MRI all have a place in the pre-purchase examination in certain cases. Each ofthese modalities can provide information that can-not be obtained with radiographs. Furthermore, incertain cases, these additional imaging modalitiesare invaluable for characterizing abnormalitiesidentied on radiographs. The nature of the radio-graphic abnormality or clinical nding dictates themodality selected for subsequent imaging. Ultrasound Ultrasound is frequently used in the pre-purchaseexamination for many different reasons. In certaincases, it is used to investigate abnormalitiesidentied during the clinical examination, such asenlargement or a pain associated with soft tissuestructures. In addition, ultrasound examinationsare performed following the identication of radio-graphic abnormalities that can have associated softtissue ndings or when evaluation with ultrasoundcan provide more information about a radiographi-cally visible osseous abnormality. With increasingfrequency, ultrasound is used even in the absence ofclinical or radiographic abnormalities to examinepredilection sites of soft tissue injury that may berelated to a particular discipline. Ultrasound is an obvious choice with palpable tendon or ligament enlargement as well as withbony remodeling at a soft tissue attachment that isidentied radiographically. However, it can also beincredibly helpful for certain radiographic abnor-malities that can be more difcult to identify orquantify, WESTERN HORSEaffecting the medial femorotibial joint (Fig. 2). Smaller, but still potentially relevant, osteophytosiscan be difcult to identify radiographically. How-ever, it is quite obvious with ultrasound, as will beany supercial osseous proliferation. Therefore,ultrasound is a quick and easy way to conrm areasof more subtle osseous proliferation that are difcultto identify The medial femorotib-ial joint can have additional radiographic ndingsthat can be better characterized with ultrasound,and one of which is subchondral bone abnormalitieson the distal aspect of the oblique view, pro-vide important information and an additional di-mension of the defects or depressions in this region. 7 However, ultrasound can provide additional infor-mation about the osseous abnormality and will al-low evaluation of the overlying articular cartilage(Fig. 2). The condition of the articular cartilage mayraise or lower concern in regard to the radiographicabnormality in the medial femoral condyle. In ad-dition, the remaining soft tissue structures and sy-novial recesses can be evaluated to have a betterunderstanding of the overall condition of the joint. The suspensory ligaments are considered a predi- lection site of injury in certain disciplines and areoften examined with ultrasound even in the absenceof clinical or palpable abnormalities. Ultrasoundexamination of the suspensory ligament is techni-cally challenging, with examination of the hind sus-pensory ligaments being more difcult than the forelimbs. The suspensory ligaments have a com-plicated anatomy with bers and a region of fat andmuscle dissecting through the ligament. A thor-ough knowledge of the anatomy and normal ana-tomic variation of these ligaments is necessary tocorrectly differentiate pathologic change from nor-mal anatomic variation. The interpretation of ul-trasound images should be based on the quality ofthe images and level of experience of the ultrasonog-rapher. In addition, it is important to rememberthat ultrasound has limitations in identifying cer-tain, more subtle or mild ber abnormalities, whichrequire MRI to identify. In cases with questionablendings or when more denitive answers are neces-sary, an imaging expert or an advanced imagingmodality should be considered. Nuclear Scintigraphy Nuclear scintigraphy is useful in the pre-purchaseexamination when abnormalities are identied onclinical examination that cannot be well imagedwith other modalities, such as back pain or stiff-ness. An additional use of nuclear scintigraphy ex-amination is to determine the activity of a boneabnormality identied on radiographs, as this infor-mation may factor into the interpretation of clinicalrelevance. It is important to note that a lack of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake on nuclear scintigra-phy examination does not rule out clinical relevance,as the relationship between pain or lameness and alack of radiopharmaceutical uptake in specic osse-ous abnormalities has not been clearly established. MRI The use of MRI in the pre-purchase examinationis considered controversial by some people whothink that the clinical relevance of ndings is not yetwell enough established. However, MRI will pro-vide more and different information than radio-graphs. The opportunity to make decisions with asmuch information as possible is a clear advantagefor the buyer. Several different types of MRI sys-tems are available for imaging of horses. In thepre-purchase examination, standing low-eld MRIis almost exclusively selected, as it is quite rare thata seller will allow a general anesthesia procedure aspart of a pre-purchase examination. Exceptions tothis most frequently occur when an abnormality isidentied on clinical examination and/or radio-graphically and the seller has an interest in furthercharacterizing that abnormality in the detail ob-tained with a high-eld MRI. However, that is theexception and, for that reason, understanding theimplications of obtaining a standing low-eld studyas part of a purchase examination should beunderstood. There are differences in the information obtained from high- and low-eld MRI studies, especially re-garding specic structures, tissue types, and lesion Fig. 2. Ultrasound of the stifle can be helpful to further charac- terize radiographic abnormalities. Mild periarticular osteo-phyte formation can be easily identied with ultrasound (A) andoften will not be visible radiographically. Evaluation of the ar-ticular cartilage and subchondral bone (B, C) of the distal aspectof the medial femoral condyle can be performed providing information once an abnormality has been identied in thisregion on radiographs. There is a difference in the appearanceof the articular cartilage when comparing (B and C). Image B hasechogenic material in the region of the articular cartilage indi-cating brosis and/or poorly dense mineral. In contrast, image Chas echogenicity consistent with articular cartilage overlying thesubchondral bone defect. Evaluation of this abnormality withultrasound can provide information that will allow a more accu-rate risk assessment in the case of the pre-purchase examination. 464 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSEsizes. The limitations of low-eld MRI should be well communicated to the buyer so there is no con-fusion as to what types of abnormalities may not bewell identied with this imaging modality. Low-eld standing MRI is a great advantage for imagingthe foot where palpation is not possible and ultra-sound is limited, especially given the frequency oflameness localized to this region in athletic perfor-mance horses. However, evaluation of articularcartilage is a signicant limitation when using low-eld standing MRI, and the distal interphalangealjoint is potentially more affected than other jointswith thinner articular cartilage. This is becausethe distal interphalangeal joint can have full thick-ness articular cartilage loss with no adjacent sub-chondral or trabecular bone abnormalities (Fig. 3).In other joints, articular cartilage loss frequentlycauses enough adjacent trabecular bone remodel-ing that it is possible to make reasonable inferencesabout the condition of the articular cartilage evenwhen it cannot be evaluated due to image resolution.However, this is not the case with the distal inter-phalangeal joint. The lack of trabecular bone re-modeling means there will be no increasedradiopharmaceutical uptake on nuclear scintigra-phy examination. The articular cartilage loss istypically centrally located on the weight bearingsurface, so the peripheral rim of the articular carti-lage maintains the normal joint space thicknessradiographically. One would think these horseswould be lame at the time of the pre-purchase ex-amination. However, this is not always the case forvarious reasons. Often these horses can maintainin their current environment; however, it seems as ifsome of them cannot overcome the changes thatoccur in a new environment and can subsequentlybecome clinical. A low-eld standing MRI cannotbe used to denitively identify articular cartilageabnormalities.MRI is valuable when there are limitations in determining the clinical relevance of certain ra-diographic abnormalities due to the impact ofassociated soft tissue injury and bone fluid. Animportant example of this is distal margin fragmen-tation of the navicular bone (Fig. 4). Horses withsimilar to identical radiographs can have vastly dif-ferent MRIs due to the amount of associated deepdigital flexor tendon injury and trabecular associatedwith navicular bone distal margin fragmentationcan consist of fluid and/or sclerosis. The sclerosiscan be difcult to identify radiographically, and thefluid can only be detected with MRI. Although de-fect and fragment size can, in many cases, be wellcharacterized radiographically, the remaining fac-tors that have the greatest influence of the clinicalrelevance can only be detected with MRI. It is im-portant to note in the pre-purchase examinationreport that the clinical relevance of this nding can-not be fully determined on radiographs and that anMRI was recommended but not pursued by theclient. Bone fluid is an important component in deciding the clinical relevance of many different abnormali-ties, not just navicular bone distal margin fragmen-tation. In addition, bone fluid can be identied onMRI images in the absence of pathologic change.Fluid that appears identical (same location and se-verity) when comparing MRI images from differenthorses can have vastly different causes and clinicalimplications. One specic example is fluid in thecompact bone of the distal phalanx at the deep dig-ital flexor tendon insertion. In certain horses, thisnding is a source of marked lameness. In otherhorses, this develops with changes in exercise, usu-ally a reduction, and then resolves with a return toexercise and is not associated with lameness. How-ever, side by side images from the sound horse andthe lame horse can appear similar to identical.This complicates the interpretation of fluid on MRIin the pre-purchase examination because often it isdifcult to fully understand the clinical relevance offluid on a single, initial study. In cases where MRIis performed because of lameness, clients are oftentold that the relevance of fluid is best determined bya recheck examination where it becomes clear iffluid can resolve with rest, indicating that thebone is capable of affecting a change in the fluid.Persistent fluid that does not resolve with rest andtreatment is considered of greater importance.This step is typically not possible in a pre-purchasesituation where a decision often must be made in ashort period of time. In certain cases, adjacentndings provide information that can be helpful indetermining the cause of the fluid. In cases wherefluid is detected adjacent to density changes in sub-chondral bone, this nding is considered of greatersignicance than fluid alone. However, if no otherindication is present, then determining the clinicalrelevance of fluid can be quite difcult. In this Fig. 3. High-eld MRI images of a horse with full thickness articular cartilage loss in the distal interphalangeal joint affect-ing the middle and distal phalanges. There is no adjacent tra-becular bone reaction, fluid, or sclerosis to indicate there is aproblem in the joint and only mild peri-articular osteophyte for-mation. These images demonstrate why detecting articular sur-face abnormalities in the distal interphalangeal joint will not bepossible in most cases using low-eld standing MRI. In addi-tion, this horse has an intact peripheral rim of articular cartilagethat will maintain the normal joint space PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 465HOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSEcase, the fluid should be interpreted in light of the clinical examination and current level of work of thehorse. The quality of standing MRI upper limb studies should be judged on an individual case basis. Inthe pre-purchase examination, upper limb studiescan provide additional information in horses witha temperament that allows the production of highenough quality images. In general, the osseousstructures are less susceptible to motion than thesoft tissue structures. Denitive identication orfurther characterization of an osseous abnormalitycan be extremely and is achievable withlow-eld standing MRI. Osseous cyst-like lesionsin the central or bones can difcultto denitively identify radiographically. However,these can be well identied on low-eld standingMRI studies (Fig. 5). Additionally, any potentialjoint involvement and associated trabecular boneremodeling, such as fluid, can be identied. Al-though the soft tissues are more susceptible to mo-tion, there are cases where standing low-eld MRIcan provide more or additional information relativeto ultrasound of the proximal suspensory ligaments,which would be important in a pre-purchase exam-ination. These cases should be assessed based onthe quality of the ultrasound and MRI studies aswell as any additional imaging and the clinical ex-amination of the horse. Computed Tomography In comparison to any of the currently available im-aging modalities, this advanced imaging modalityprovides superior bone detail in the absence of superimposition of surrounding bone. However, incomparison to MRI, it is limited in regard to softtissue detail. Similar to MRI, standing CT in thepre-purchase examination can provide informationthat is not available with a standard radiographicstudy and will have motion artifact in the standingstudies. Standing CT can be extremely valuablewhen questionable ndings arise on radiographs ofthe cervical spine (Fig. 6). 5. Imaging and Clinical Correlation and Client Communication The imaging performed as part of the pre-purchase examination has continued to increase, with moreviews now considered part of the standard radio-graphic study, and the increased use of multipleimaging modalities. This has increased the costof pre-purchase examinations. However, in manycases, the nancial investment of more imaging iswarranted based on the purchase price of the horse.The client must decide how much information theywould like to have before making a decision in re- gard to purchase, which is often dependent on howmuch risk the client is willing to take. In order tomake a decision about how much imaging will beperformed as part of a pre-purchase examination, itis important that the buyer understands, as much asis possible, what information is provided by thedifferent imaging modalities. In certain cases, theimaging that will be performed has been selectedprior to the start of the clinical examination. In Fig. 4. Horse 1 (A-C) and horse 2 (D, E) have navicular bone distal margin fragmentation with similar size defects (black arrows on A and D) bordered by focal sclerosis. Horse 1 has mild fluid and no associated deep digital flexor tendinopathy (B, C). Horse 2 hasdeep digital flexor tendon enlargement with focal tissue (white arrow on E) extending between the tendon, the impar ligament and thenavicular bone distal margin defect, which may indicate adhesion formation. This appearance can be compared to the unaffected sideof the navicular bone where the distal navicular bursa recess has fluid with separation of the deep digital flexor tendon from the imparligament (arrowhead on E). The radiographs of these horses would not have distinguishing characteristics, indicating horse 2 wasmore affected than horse 1. This is because other than defect size, the factors that affect the clinical relevance of the distal marginfragmentation cannot be SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSEother cases, the imaging is based on the clinical examination ndings. Less commonly, but with in-creasing frequency, imaging is performed prior toany clinical examination. This most frequently oc-curs when horses are being purchased for resale andthe buyers will not proceed if certain radiographic abnormalities are present. However, other buyershave had bad experiences with certain abnormali-ties and will not proceed with purchase if specicabnormalities are present. Once imaging has been performed as part of a pre-purchase examination and an abnormalityhas been identied, then how do we proceed fromhere? Several factors must be considered when as-sessing risk. What is the identied abnormality?What is the probability it will cause lameness giventhe horse's clinical examination, age, and intendeduse? How easy or difcult is it to treat and/or man-age this condition should lameness result from thisabnormality? Imaging abnormalities carry a certain amount of risk. How can this be accurately quantied? Whatwe know about a particular abnormality is then inter-preted in conjunction with the clinical examination.The clinical examination can result in an increasedrisk if additional abnormalities are found in the sameregion as the radiographic abnormality or a decreasedrisk in certain cases where no clinical abnormalitiesare present. However, with certain abnormalities,the risk is not decreased by a normal clinical exami-nation. Once all the information has been gathered,it is presented to the client and they must make the nal decision. In conclusion, imaging can provide valuable infor- mation in the pre-purchase examination that can Fig. 5. On pre-purchase examination radiographs, an oval lucency was identied in the central tarsal bone that was suspicious for an osseous cyst-like lesion. However, following multiple opinions on the radiographs there was not a consensus on the presence ofthis nding. In addition, if the nding was real, there was also not a consensus on its clinical relevance. Following a low-eldstanding MRI study, the osseous cyst-like lesion can be clearly identied, contains fluid, and is resulting in thinning of the distalsubchondral bone margin. This standing low-eld MRI clearly identied and characterized an abnormality of increased risk in amanner that was not possible radiographically. The osseous cyst-like lesion is bordered by normal subchondral bone, and thesuperimposition of this bone makes the subchondral thinning not possible to detect radiographically, which is one the characteristicsof this nding that results in increased risk. Fig. 6. On a pre-purchase examination radiograph study, thereare two oval lucencies in the C5-C6 articular process joints on thelateral radiograph of the cervical spine that are suspicious ofosseous cyst-like lesions. These osseous cyst-like lesions areclearly identied on standing CT images. Certain osseouslesions can be well identied on standing CT despite motionartifact, and the reformatted images then provide more informa-tion at the precise location of the osseous cyst-like lesions. TheCT images provide additional osseous details FOR THE WESTERN HORSEbe used as a part of the risk assessment. Client communication is imperative in this situation, andmany factors must be clearly explained and docu-mented for a successful outcome.

Introduction Western horses that perform speed (timed) events are in high demand. Prices for these athletes re-main high because of the prize money that can bewon at weekly events around the country. Severalof the high-end roping events and barrel raceshave payouts in excess of $100,000 to $200,000 towin the event. Many weekend events pay $500-$3,500 or more. Junior high, high school, and col-lege events allow contestants to win saddles andtrailers. Because of the potential for high earnings,pre-purchase examinations have become an impor-tant component of many horse ownership transfers.A wide spectrum of buyers exists from the NationalFinals Rodeo (NFR) caliber competitor to the week- end enthusiast, to the junior high, high school, andcollege contestant. Pre-purchase examinations of-ten have to be tailor-made based on the purchaseprice of the horse and the buyer's budget. An ex-tensive pre-purchase examination is not practical inmany situations because of the buyer's inability topay for services that veterinarians would like tohave available for decision-making. Some buyerscan only afford a physical exam/lameness exam plus/minus a few radiographs. Others request a fullcomplement of radiographs plus an endoscopic examand drug screen. The author's practice workswithin the buyer's means to stay within budget. If the buyer declines radiographs or requests limitedviews or declines a drug screen or endoscopic exam,it is documented in the medical record. Regardless of Western performance discipline, a thorough systematic examination of the horse beingconsidered for purchase is a prerequisite to develop-ing a snapshot that can aid in determining if an individual is suitable for purchase. Importantly, ahorse that is unsuitable for one buyer may be verysuitable for another buyer. Attempting to discernthe pros and cons of a particular horse in light ofwhat is discovered on the pre-purchase examinationcan be challenging. This presentation/paper is acompilation of the author's experience performingpre-purchase exams in Western speed event horses. 2. Medical History Prior to the exam, it is useful to request and obtainmedical history on the horse to be examined. Thisshould be requested at the time the appointment ismade. For barrel horses, it is important to know ifthe horse has ever experienced an episode of exer-cise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) and, ifso, is it an ongoing issue that requires medicationand is it controlled by medication. In addition, it iscrucial to know whether a horse requires periodic AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 469HOW-TO NOTESinjections (distal interphalangeal joint, tarsi, stifles, back, or other sites) to maintain soundness. Thisinformation, however, may not be available if theseller is not forthcoming. Particularly frustratingand an issue that puts the veterinarian at risk forpotential litigation is the horse that has been in-jected recently to achieve soundness and this fact isnot disclosed by the seller. This hides the currentstate of the horse being examined. Although thehorse may be sound on the day of examination andfor some time after, once the injections begin to wearoff, lameness will again become apparent. Thesetypes of situations present great risk to the veteri-narian for legal exposure. Many of the author'sclients use a multitude of veterinarians such that aseller may only provide the least alarming medicalrecords from the practitioner whose records have theleast incriminating evidence. The vast majority ofsellers, however, are typically forthcoming whenquestioned about the medical history. The pastmedical history is very important to consider as theveterinarian helps the buyer make judgments re-garding suitability. If the horse being considered for purchase has medical records at the examining veterinarian'spractice and the pre-purchase exam is being donein-house, the seller is advised to disclose those re-cords to the buyer. If the seller does not allowrelease of the medical records from the practice tothe buyer, a pre-purchase exam should be refused,and the seller referred elsewhere. Conflict of inter-est issues may develop when the veterinarian isasked to perform a pre-purchase exam on a horse forwhich they have been the attending veterinarian,the buyer also uses the same veterinarian, and theseller declines going elsewhere. If possible, theexam should be conducted by another practice.If not, the seller should be advised that the veteri-narian is working for the buyer. This situationputs the veterinarian in a potentially untenable sit-uation; however, both parties should be informedthat the veterinarian will present the ndings in anunbiased manner. These are awkward situationsthat both attorneys and practitioners recommendavoiding but sometimes are inevitable. 3. Lameness Examination A lameness exam that includes watching the horsetrot in hand (baseline exam) followed by flexion testsof the fore and hind limbs (dynamic exam) is thetypical starting point. Palpation of the legs includeevaluating joints for effusion and range of motion,tendons for pain and symmetry or tendon sheatheffusion, and suspensory ligaments and suspensorybranches for pain or enlargement are key to startingto develop a picture for an individual horse. Sus-pensory branch enlargement is not uncommon inrope horses and if non-painful may not be a reasonto not purchase the horse. Often, the seller is un-aware that there has ever been a problem and manyof these horses are \"rope horse sound.\" Rarely doesthe author lunge a Western speed horse as part of the pre-purchase exam. Many rope horses do notknow how to lunge and it is a fruitless endeavor.Watching the horse perform is impractical unless onvideo. Evaluation of the calf horse and heel horsestopping, the barrel horse turning, and the headhorse turning off and facing can be helpful, but allare rider dependent and may not transfer withchange of ownership. 4. Neurologic Examination A cursory neurologic exam includes assessment ofcranial nerve function, circling in tight circles toevaluate conscious proprioception, backing, observa-tion of the horse traveling up and down a hill, andsubjective assessment of strength via standing tailpull. The tail pull is performed with the horsestanding rather than in motion. A normal horsewill brace and pull the opposite way when the tailis pulled laterally. Each side is compared to theother. A weak response to one side may indicateparesis that can occur with diseases such as equineprotozoal myelitis (EPM) or wobbler syndrome.The tail pull is very subjective, and interpretation ofresponse will vary widely amongst veterinarians. 5. Radiographic Examination The decision of what to radiograph and how manyviews per anatomic site is often determined by thebuyer's budget. In the author's practice, radio-graphs are charged by the view; however, manyveterinarians charge a \"package price\" so more ofthe horse is evaluated at a reduced price. Thereare pros and cons with either approach. It is im-portant to document everything that is found on theexam and on the radiographs. Hard decisions mustoccasionally be made with the buyer's budget inmind and in doing so may expose veterinarians tothe hazards of litigation. In situations where the budget is tight but allows a few radiographs, a minimum series for either dis-cipline will include a skyline view of both front na-vicular bones, a lateral of each tarsus, a lateraloblique of each stifle, and 1-2 radiographs of thedorsal spinous processes in the mid-back region(barrel horses). 1-3Explain to the buyer that these are survey lms that will provide a glimpse of those areas but that because the series is limited, it ispossible some important issues could be missed.Not only is the veterinarian interested in ndingissues that would steer away from purchase but alsoto determine if there are issues that would compli-cate resale. If so, those issues are discussed atlength so the buyer can determine if they are willingto assume the risk. When radiographing prospects, young horses in early training, or horses early in their career,veterinarians may be more critical of radiographicabnormalities. For older horses that have beencampaigned and have proven to be able to do theirjob, some radiographic issues (e.g., mild navicular 470 2019 /H11408Vol. /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: THE WESTERN HORSEbone changes and distal tarsal joint osteoarthritis) may not be judged as harshly. Horses do not knowwhat their radiographs look like and their perfor-mance is often a matter of heart. There are lamehorses that have abnormal radiographs or othersubstantial ndings that remain top competitors.This aspect makes the veterinarian's job difcult. Barrel Horses The age of the horse should play into decision mak-ing with regard to what to radiograph. For barrelhorse prospects that are untrained or early in train-ing, a complete radiographic series of the front feet,tarsi, stifles, and back are typically recommended.If the budget allows, a lateral of all four fetlocks anda flexed lateral of the carpi should be considered asa survey for issues in these joints. For horses thathave been campaigned and are seasoned, it is rec-ommended to obtain all the views of the carpi, fet-locks, feet, tarsi, stifles, and back. Rarely is thecervical spine radiographed and typically only if anolder horse that is resistant to lateral excursion ofthe neck or if requested by the buyer. 3 When possible, always radiograph the back of bar- rel horses. The author believes impinging dorsalspinous processes is a real entity, but of all thehorses with radiographs that demonstrate kissingspine, clinical issues are relatively infrequent. Inhorses with radiographic evidence of kissing spine,the decision to buy needs to be based on performancehistory. If no issues are identied clinically or inthe performance history that would point to the backas being a problem (e.g., pain on palpation, bucking,swapping leads behind, kicking out, and refusing toturn), then radiographic evidence of kissing spinemay not be signicant. The problem is, however,that it can become an issue and the buyer needs tobe warned of that potential risk. In the author'spractice, buyers are informed that the developmentof symptoms from impinging dorsal spinous pro-cesses cannot be predicted. Rope Horses The primary radiographic areas of interest in ropehorses are the front feet and hocks. 2,4The carpi should also be evaluated if effusion is present or range of motion is decreased, particularly if flexionof the carpi induces lameness. Many middle-agedand older seasoned rope horses will have some mi-nor lameness issues when examined on asphalt onthe baseline exam and when flexed. It is fairlyfrequent that rope horses will have some navicularchanges (large synovial invaginations that are nu-merous in number) but still be a very useful athletein the roping pen. The same is true of arthriticchanges/spurs in the distal tarsal joints. Injectionhistory is important to determine if these issues areconcerning. Horses that have periodic injections(1-2 times per year) can likely be maintained andremain very useful. It is not uncommon that fusingor fused distal intertarsal joints are identied on thepre-purchase exam lms. This may not preclude purchase as many of these horses are either notlame or only minimally so when flexed. These nd-ings are presented to the buyer, the possible conse-quences explained, and the buyer left to decide onwhether to purchase or not. Rope horses (head andheel horses) seemingly can often perform well de-spite radiographic ndings that could be problem-atic in other disciplines. Calf horses seem less paintolerant, particularly with signicant distal tarsaljoint arthritis; however, this varies horse to horse. The minimum preferred radiographs for a rope horse are front feet and tarsi. As stated above,restrictions on the number of radiographs are oftendetermined by the buyer's budget. Not infre-quently, rope horses (particularly head horses) willhave carpal injuries that have resulted in chip frac-tures or arthritis. Reduced range of motion, effu-sion, or lameness of the carpi should be evaluatedradiographically. Very seldom is the back radio-graphed on rope horses; however, the author hasoperated several with kissing spines. aIf the history or clinical exam at pre-purchase suggests any pos- sible back pain, radiographs are warranted. Asdiscussed above for barrel horses, the bigger thebudget for radiographs, the more anatomic sitesshould be investigated. 6. Ultrasonographic Examination Ultrasound of the suspensory ligaments or suspen-sory ligament branches is generally only performedas part of the pre-purchase exam if an issue is iden-tied during the exam (enlarged branch), there is ahistorical suspensory injury that needs to be as-sessed, or if the buyer requests it. Many Westernspeed event horses that have been doing their job forseveral years will have changes consistent withchronic desmitis (increased thickness and cross sec-tional area, and changes in ber length and orien-tation). If lameness is absent (barrel horses) orminimal (rope horses), these changes may not pre-clude purchase with the proper communication ofthese facts to the buyer. For high-dollar purchaseson questionable rear limb proximal suspensory is-sues, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should beconsidered if ultrasound ndings are ambiguous.This can be problematic as well (general anesthesiafor high eld magnets) and infrequently endorsed byinsurance companies or allowed by sellers. 7. Endoscopic Examination Endoscopic examination of the upper respiratorytract is infrequently performed on barrel or ropehorse at pre-purchase, although it would be prudentto do so as often as possible. Endoscopic exam ofthe throat/larynx is most indicated in barrel horseprospects and untrained horses that have not beenpushed hard enough to see if they make any upperrespiratory noise. Speed event horses that aretrained and running hard without exhibiting respi-ratory noise are unlikely to have any endoscopic AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 471HOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSEissues; however, if the budget allows, an endoscopic exam should be performed. Left laryngeal paresisor hemiplegia, nasopharyngeal cicatrix, and may be identi-ed. 5,6If EIPH is a possible concern, seasoned barrel horses that have been run within 48 hours can have the trachea scoped to evaluate for residualblood. In situations where the buyer desires infor-mation as to whether a horse suffers from EIPH andthe horse has not been run recently, a bronchoalveo-lar lavage (BAL) can be considered. 8. Drug Screen A drug screen to evaluate for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tranquilizers, andpsychotropic drugs should be considered and recom-mended in every case unless the horse has been inthe possession of the buyer for a sufcient period oftime. The presence of any of these drugs couldmarkedly influence the pre-purchase exam andmake an otherwise unsound horse appear sound.This can be a precarious situation when the buyerrequests a drug screen and the seller is aware drugshave been administered. 9. Summary Western speed events are very popular, and manyhorses are bought and sold. Pre-purchase examsare an essential component that allow horse enthu-siasts and their veterinarian a mechanism to deter-mine if a horse is suitable to consider for purchase.Although a comprehensive exam is preferable fromthe perspective of protecting the veterinarian fromlitigation, adjustments in the scope of the exam aresometimes required to allow an exam to be withinthe buyer's budget. As long as the buyer under-stands that parts of the exam (particularly radio-graphs) have been adjusted because of budgetconstraints and it is documented in the veterinari-an's report, issues discovered later should not pro- ceed to litigation. When talking to buyers aboutthe exam, it is important to inform them of (1) theissues that have been identied that will likely be anissue, (2) the issues that have been identied thatcannot be predicted as to whether they will becomean issue (at risk), and (3) those that may or may notbe an issue but could affect resale. The veterinar-ian's role is to provide information that will help thebuyer make an informed decision as to whether topurchase the horse that has been examined.

Introduction In the author's opinion, the reining horse (reiner), the cutting horse (cutter), and the reined cow horseeach can present their own set of common injuriesdue to the nature of the events in which they com-pete. Understanding their events and the types ofinjuries they are predisposed to will help the veter-inarian weigh the signicance of the physical andradiographic ndings they encounter during a pre-purchase exam and offer a prognosis for perfor-mance and resale that has value to the client. 2. Materials and Methods Reiners, cutters, and cow horses each have theirown unique set of injuries predisposed by the eventsin which they compete. In the author's practice,pre-purchase examination included a general phys-ical exam, a musculoskeletal exam, as well as radio-graphic examination that is determined in concertwith the buyer. The author begins the pre-purchase examina- tion with a thorough physical examination of thehorse's general health status. Particular atten-tion should be paid to the eyes, the tongue, theventral abdomen for scars as a result of colic sur-gery, the palmar aspect of the front pastern for scars from a palmar digital neurectomy, along with scarsalong the proximal palmar/plantar metacarpus/meta-tarsus from neurectomy/fasciotomy/micropicking.Tail function should be evaluated as some associationshave rules regarding tail function. A musculoskeletal examination is then performed observing the horse in a straight line and circling ona hard surface and soft surface. Hoof testers areused to evaluate the feet with particular attentiongiven to the reaction over the middle third of thefrog. Flexion tests of all 4 legs is performed. It is the author's preference that a 28-view radio- graphic examination which has at least 4 views ofeach foot and each hock, 3 views of each stifle, andone view of each fetlock and each carpus would beperformed. Additional radiographs may be taken based on the ndings of the physical and lameness examination.Ultrasonography is sometimes used during the pre-purchase exam to evaluate the suspensory ligamentin all 4 legs and/or the stifle joint based on factorsdiscovered during the examination of the horse.Advanced imaging modalities can also be employed. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 473HOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSE NOTESMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most com- mon advanced imaging modality recommended bythe author to obtain adjunctive information. It isparticularly helpful in evaluating the high suspen-sory area along with the foot in the author's opinion. Blood collection for health analysis and drug screening are also frequently employed as part of apre-purchase exam. Reiners Reiners sprint at full speed during the run down totheir stops. In the author's opinion this predis-poses them to a higher incidence of carpal and fet-lock injuries when compared to cutters. Due to the highspeed turns during competition, reiners can be predisposed to traumatic concussiveinjuries of the carpus. Hematomas over the acces-sory carpal bone or contusions of the bone and softtissue on the face of the carpus are also common inreining horses. Lead changes are extremely important to the suc- cess of a reining horse. Horses that fall out of leadare frequently not lame. However, abnormalitiessuch as stifle inflammation can be a cause of fallingout of lead. For this reason the stifle should beexamined physically, radiographically, and ultra-sonographically during a pre-purchase exam forsubtle early signs of osteoarthritis (OA) and integ-rity of the soft tissue in cases where lead issues areobserved. Cutters Cutters compete in deep sand, which has beenassociated by some to causes soft-tissue injuries.The action described as a \"draw\" is thought to puta high degree of torque on the stifle joint. A drawis the preferred reaction to a cow when it is chang-ing direction. During a draw, the horse willkeep its hind feet planted while drawing or re-tracting its body backwards. This is followed bya rapid turn in the same direction as the cow.The torque created by this extension of the stiflefollowed by an explosive turn frequently is associ-ated by some to create stifle synovitis or injury tothe meniscus of the medial femorotibial joint.Ultrasonography can be used in a pre-purchaseexamination to evaluate any stifle with joint effu-sion if indicated. Reiners, cutters, and cow horses are frequently loped to bring their energy level down and increasetheir focus prior to competition. This can fatiguethe suspensory apparatus, causing injury. Again,ultrasonography can be employed to evaluate thesuspensory apparatus. Cow Horses Reined cow horses are considered to be the triath-letes of the western performance horse industry.They compete in 3 events: reining, cutting, andfence work. Fence work is when an individual cowis worked in the arena turning the cow sprinting ata full speed. This has the potential to exacerbate all the previously described injuries of the reinerand cutter. The author has observed reined cowhorses with injuries common to both reiners andcutters. 3. Discussion In a general sense, pre-purchase examination nd-ings should be evaluated from two different perspec-tives: the impact on the ongoing performance ofthe horse and the impact on resale of the horse.Most buyers of western performance horses have aclear exit strategy envisioned for the horse they arepurchasing. Some buyers plan to keep the horsefor bloodstock or for a lifetime of recreation as acompetition horse, trail horse, or pasture horse.Reiners, cutters, and cow horses do not typicallybegin competition until they are 3 years old. Thenormal course of business for horses being resold isfor yearlings to be purchased for resale as 2-year-olds. Two-year-olds are to be purchased to be re-sold as a three-year-old. It is very important forthe veterinarian to garner a clear understanding ofthe expectations of the buyer and the thought theyhave put into the exit strategy for the horse they arepotentially purchasing. Some Examples of Common Controversial Findings Physical Examination Signicant ndings on the physical examination are rather uncommon but there are few worthy of dis-cussion. It is the author's opinion, low-grade heartmurmurs have little effect on a horse's success in theshow pen, but there are many circumstances wherethe presence of a low-grade heart murmur has beenthe deciding factor in a potential buyer's aborting apurchase of a horse. Tongue injuries, ventral ab-dominal scars, neurectomy scars, tail function, fe-ver, and respiratory disease all create circumstancesdebatable regarding the long-term prognosis for per-formance or resale. Musculoskeletal Examination Low-grade lameness or low-grade positive response to hoof testers or flexion tests must be interpretedwith regard to the current athletic activity of thehorse. For example, a grade-1 lameness in a horseone hour after competition in the nals of a majorevent is interpreted by the author much differentthan in a h orse that has been turned out all winter and legged up 30 days. Conformation evaluationis very subjective as some of the worst conforma-tions for racehorses have not been associated withsuccess of a western performance horse in theauthor's opinion. Radiographic Examination Foot This discussion revolves predominantly around the interpretation of navicular bone. In regard to re- 474 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSEsale and to performance, it is important to begin a discussion about navicular bone radiology with ahorse buyer describing the range of normal ndings.The author prefers to see 4 or fewer centrally locatedvascular channels in the navicular bone. The au-thor tends to shy away from vascular channels onthe periphery of the bone and increased vascularitybeyond 4 vascular channels or horses having novascular channels in one foot and many in the othereven though they may be of the proper size andshape. The author has seen examples of horses with vas- cular channels that are atypical but has no history ofcofn joint injections, is bare foot, negative to hooftesters, negative to flexion tests, not lame on thehard ground in a circle, and negative to a drugscreen can still fail a pre-purchase exam when theradiographs are sent to a buyer's primary careveterinarian. Hocks The predominant discussion for the author regard- ing hock radiographs revolves around the absence orpresence or the degree of OA in the distal intertarsal(DIT) and tarsal metatarsal (TMT) joints. Manywestern performance horses have some degree of OAin the lower hock joints. Again, for the author per-formance vs resale is the dominant theme in regardto prognosing ndings. Age of the horse is impor-tant in this discussion as the appearance of OA signsin the younger horse affects its resale as an olderhorse in the author's opinion. The discussionaround a yearling with radiographic OA frequentlyrevolves around the degree and speed of advance-ment and how the radiographs might look as a2-year-old. The same can be true for the authorwhen evaluating a 2-year-old with radiographic OAand how it will affect its resale as a 3-year-old. The author believes most veterinarians feel com- fortable managing OA in the DIT and TMT. In theolder (3 years and up) show horse, discussion fre-quently moves into the realm of the buyer's veteri-narian's recommendations for management of theOA and the subsequent cost of this management onan annual basis. In the author's opinion, OA of the DIT and TMT joints has the greatest impact on the stop of a reiner,cutter, or cow horse. In terms of influencing thescoring it's the author's opinion the greatest impactis seen in the reiner or the cow horse reining pat-tern. Not holding the ground in a stop, picking ahind foot up in a stop, collapsing instead of easinginto a stop, and increased tail activity during a stop,all have been indicative of hock soreness in a reineror cow horse as is with not holding the inside pivotleg in the ground while spinning in a reining pat-tern, in the author's experience. Stifles Osteochondrosis or other radiographic ties of the medial femoral condyle cause concern onpre-purchase exams. In the author's experience, they have a dramatic impact on the resale of thehorse because when the letters \"OCD\" are men-tioned during a pre-purchase exam most buyers be-come skeptical. If this does not prevent the buyerfrom proceeding with their due diligence during asale, it frequently causes them to reevaluate thehorse's price, level of ability, and mentation beforemoving forward. Similar issues arise in the sale ofthe horse with navicular vascular channel irregular-ities, a horse with no stifle effusion, no lameness,and negative to flexion test can still have difcultybeing sold with osteochondrosis of the stifle, in theauthor's opinion. In the author's opinion, there are more soft-tissue problems not apparent on radiographs of the stiflethat have the potential to affect its long-term prog-nosis for performance than the osseous changes sofrequently debated. Again, the horse's history ofstifle intra-articular medication treatment and thelameness exam ndings along with ultrasonographycan frequently be more insightful than radiographsof the stifle alone. Stifle effusion indicative of sy-novitis, cartilage injuries, and meniscal injurieshave been noted by the author to result in a pro-found impact on the long-term prognosis for theathletic performance of the reiner, cutter, and cowhorse. The greatest impact being the cutter thanthe cow horse because of the draw they are expectedto perform while cutting. Ultrasonography of the Stifle In the author's opinion, ultrasonography of the stifle is very useful in a pre-purchase exam. In the au-thor's opinion, ultrasonic ndings such as thicken-ing of the synovial capsule and abnormalities of thecranial ligament of the medial meniscus can influ-ence prognosis for ability to perform. Free-floatingcartilage fragments in the joint fluid are also con-cerning. Meniscal injuries are recognized as chal-lenging to diagnosis in the author's opinion andfamiliarity with normal stifle ultrasound appear-ance is critical if this modality is used in prognosti-cating stifle health. Fetlocks and Carpus The author typically includes a flexed lateral of each front fetlock and carpus along with a standing lat-eral of the hind fetlocks in his pre-purchase exams. Again, in the author's experience, carpal injuries are very common in reining horses and cow horses.The fast rundowns along with concussions receivedfrom turning have the potential to produce lamenessand radiographic ndings of the carpus. The au-thor nds osteochondral fragments to be an infre-quent cause of lameness but feels they often causehorses to fall out of lead, which causes decreasedsuccess in the show pen. In the author's opinion, caudal eminence P1 osteo- chondral fragments, particularly of the hind fetlock,frequently cause reining and cow horses to fall out of AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 475HOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSElead in a reining pattern. It is more of a problem of performance for the high end reiner and cow horsethan a resale problem as many veterinarians seemto disregard their signicance, in the author'sopinion. Suspensory Ligaments The author nds one of the more common causes of lameness in the reiner, cutter, and cow horse isan enthesis injury to the origin of the suspensoryligament. This is of particular interest duringpre-purchase examination. At times suspensory- ligament abnormalities are accompanied by radio-graphic evidence of injury to the palmar/plantar aspectof MC/T 3 or ultrasonographic evidence of proximalsuspensory injury. Some enthesis injuries may onlyable to be diagnosed with MRI, in the author's experi-ence. Ultrasonography can show an irregular berpattern, disruption, or calcication of the suspensory ligament or its branches. Their presence offers apoorer prognosis based on the extent of the acute orchronic injury, in the author's hands. While radiographs of the proximal cannon region can show sclerosis, the author believes this is fre-quently overdiagnosed. Radiographs of this regioncan also reveal an avulsion fracture, which has apoor prognosis.

Introduction The pre-purchase exam is an opportunity to perform an important service to a new or existing client andcan mark the beginning of many years of workingwith that client and their potentially newly acquiredhorse. It should be approached systematically,with attorney-prepared documentation, and with anunderstanding of the legalities involved to preventany misunderstandings that could lead to problemsranging from a minor miscommunication to poten-tial litigation. A systematic approach to the pre-purchase exam can be broken down into three phases:The pre-assessment, the exam, and the delivery/documentation of the information gleaned fromboth the pre-assessment and the exam. Keepthese areas distinct in your mind and take respon-sibility for the successful completion of each asyou move through the exam with your client. With a better understanding of the legal aspects of a pre-purchase exam you can be condent in yourposition and intentional in your communication and documentation. Most notably, malpractice, agency,misrepresentation, negligence, and express warran-ties are key elements of the law that you will need tounderstand to keep yourself and your practice in goodstead when conducting and communicating the nd-ings of a pre-purchase exam.2. The Pre-Assessment The Client The pre-assessment is everything that can and should occur before you examine the horse. This isthe period when you organize all of the importantinformation that must be shared prior to the exam tobest position you and your practice to both performa thorough examination, and to provide your clientwith a transparent experience. The rst item ofbusiness is to accurately identify who your client is(the potential buyer of the horse) and make thatclear to both buyer and seller before the exam be-gins. Concurrently, you should understand if theseller or their agent will be involved in any way inthe pre-purchase exam. If buyer or seller are not going to be present and will have agents involved,make sure you have written authorization as toagent representation. Request the names of allinterested parties so that you can determine whether or not you have any personal history withany of them that may be misconstrued as a conflictand could be perceived as influential to the examshould an issue arise. If there is a trainer in-volved, maintain the distinction between thetrainer and the client so that there is no confusionas to who you represent in the exam. Make that AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 477HOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSE NOTESdistinction both written and verbal so that every- one understands your position. There is often more to consider than just current status of the horse standing in front of you. Do youhave history with the horse in any way that mayskew your assessment? Could that be interpretedas a conflict of interest in future litigation? Haveyou ever worked for the seller? Simply havingworked for the seller before or having any personalhistory with the seller may not be a conflict of inter-est provided that it is disclosed. Never agree toperform a pre-purchase exam for a buyer exclusivelyat the seller's recommendation unless the buyer isaware and approves of the recommendation. In ad-dition, if you or someone in your practice has seenthe horse as a patient previous to the exam, thisshould be disclosed. Fully documented disclosureis critical. Strive to create as transparent of anenvironment as possible. Complete transparencyonly has two potential outcomes: either everyone ison the same page and is in agreement to proceedwith the exam, or a conflict is identied and theexam is referred to a colleague. Either way, every-one wins in the long run. Second to identication of the client is educating the client as to your role in the exam. The purposeof the pre-purchase exam, is to examine a horse andevaluate its health and soundness. The client willthen utilize that information to determine whetheror not they will purchase the horse. However, cli-ents may press for assurances as to the likelihood fortheir successful future use of the horse. While anunderstanding of the horse's future athletic use isimportant, it is equally important to establish thatyour assessment is no guarantee of the horse's fu-ture abilities or future soundness. Make this pointabundantly clear early in your communication, sothat the client understands that you cannot makeany guarantees as part of the exam. You can onlyassess the condition of the horse as it is presented inthe moment that you conduct your examination.The future use of any horse is always unknown.Once the animal has been purchased the owner mayuse them for any need they determine. If you know the client well, you may have an under-standing of the horses they currently own, whichcan be supportive. Medical Record Ask the client to request all of the horse's priormedical records that are available from the sellerso that you can accurately assess the medicalhistory of the horse. If the seller refuses toshare medical record history, this should bedocumented. Authorization, Indemnication, and Liability Release Forms Documentation is critical in the pre-purchase exam.Because of the potential for gaps in communicationand potential reliance on things that may or may nothave been said, or may or may not have been under-stood, you should have a few forms on hand to best support everyone's understanding. These shouldinclude an authorization form to perform the exam,an indemnication agreement should any conflictsof interest (having done past work for the seller) beidentied and communicated to the buyer, a liabilityrelease agreement indicating that you are providingno warranty as to the horse's future condition orpotential, and a pre-purchase examination form de-tailing the scope of the exam that will also providedocumentation of your ndings as you proceedthrough the exam. An authorization form should be completed by both the client (the buyer) and the seller, authoriz-ing you to perform the exam on the buyers' behalf.Be sure you have the seller's contact information inthe event that they need to be reached should per-mission for more invasive procedures (like a nerveblock) be desired by the buyer. 1In addition, the seller needs to understand that because the buyer is the client in this situation, the ndings from theexam (the medical record for this examination) be-long to the buyer and not the seller, even though the seller currently owns the horse. The indemnication form can identify any conflict of interest that may have arisen, and p lainly states that all parties have been given full disclosure ofthe conflict, have elected to waive their rights toany future recourse as a result of said conflict,and have elected to proceed with the exam. Thebuyer will often be comfortable with their veterinariandespite the pre-existing relationship. There is a per-ceived advantage because the veterinarian knows thehorse to some degree by virtue of having been itscaretaker. 2 A release of liability for warranty may further shield you from potential litigation by outliningthe nature of the exam and your role as examiner.Within this document you should state your unbi-ased position and that you are providing no war-ranty, express or implied. Your role is to neitherpass nor fail the horse, but to provide a thoroughassessment of the health of the horse as deter-mined at that point in time and as it relates to thesuitability of the horse for the intended usedescribed. Lastly, the pre-purchase exam document should be shared, further outlining the scope of your workand the nature of your unbiased position. The formshould detail each phase of the exam as you intendto conduct it and leave space for your ndings to bedocumented in detail. Should any additional diag-nostics be suggested, document this on the form sothat there can be no question as to the diagnosticsactually performed and those that were offered anddeclined. These specic clauses can also be combined into fewer documents, provided all of the areas are cov-ered adequately. 478 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSE3. The Exam The Horse Be sure that the horse you are being asked to exam- ine is actually the horse that is presented. Checkpapers, markings, teeth, tattoos, freeze brands, andmicrochips if available to verify the identity of thepatient before ever proceeding with the exam. Format Remember, the documentation is the key to a fullunderstanding of the exam, the communication thatoccurred, and the ndings that were discovered.Days, weeks, and months after the exam has beenconcluded, the documentation is all anyone will haveto authenticate what occurred on the day of theexam. Documentation of each step is key to bothavoiding a legal issue in the rst place and defend-ing a legal claim should any miscommunication orunfavorable outcome result for your client in thefuture. Again, do not make any guarantees on thehorse's future potential. You are assessing an an-imal as it exists in the moment of the exam. Makethis distinction in your own mind as you proceedthrough the steps of your exam and make this dis-tinction abundantly clear in your documentationand in your communication to your client. Environment It is best if you examine the horse in an environmentthat you are familiar with where the horse can behandled by you and your staff. This will proveuseful when going through the paces of the actualphysical exam and will prevent any irregular cir-cumstances that otherwise might be out of your con-trol. Utilize your own staff when handling thehorse, for both safety and to maintain complete con-trol of each phase of the exam. Having your ownpersonnel handle the horse is critical to maintainingthe environment and the integrity of your familiarapproach to the examination. You are responsiblefor driving the exam, for identifying potential haz-ards that may lead to confusion, and creating atransparent experience for everyone so that therecan be no misunderstandings. Make sure you understand who will be present at the exam so that you can be prepared for that envi-ronment. It is best if only you and the client arepresent so that you can communicate your ndingsfreely. Although there can be advantages to havingthe seller present at the examination (e.g., the horseis demonstrably lame), the buyer is your client anddeserves private discussion about the examinationof the horse and the signicance of ndings duringthe examination without the seller being present. 1 As you move through the exam, you may nd the need for a ridden portion of the exam. If this isnecessary, be sure you have the seller's permissionfor the horse to be ridden by the specied rider.If you select the rider, always ensure that the rideryou have designated is qualied to ride the level ofhorse that you are evaluating. Should you prefer to ride the horse yourself, obtain the consent of theseller, and consider your own level of expertise as arider and whether it is suitable for the level of horseyou are examining. Alternatively, should you deemappropriate, you may ask the seller to either ride, orappoint someone to ride the horse. Ensure that thefooting, the tack and the exercise are appropriate forthe horse being examined. Video recording the exam can be an added layer of documentation. It can support your communica-tion of the exam and possibly defend your method-ology and ndings should a future issue arise. Bloodwork and Diagnostics Recommend drug testing for analgesics, anabolicsteroids, behavior-altering medications, breed-specic blood any treat-ments such as sedation for radiographs. 3When blood is drawn, immediately separate and submit for testing. Should you elect to store a blood sample,recognize that there could be questions regardingthe chain of custody of the stored sample. Understand the limitations of your examination procedures. Do not make assumptions. Offer alldiagnostic procedures that you feel are appropriate.If you do not have the necessary diagnostic equip-ment in your practice, make verbal and writtenrecommendation to have these diagnostic tests per-formed at a referral facility. Document in writingevery diagnostic service offered and ask the buyer toinitial next to that statement if they elected to de-cline them. Always exercise due diligence whengoing through each phase of your exam. If you areuncertain about the results of any diagnostics thatyou do perform, consult with specialists who mayprovide critical insight. 4. Legal Issues Your efforts in identifying the parties involved, pro-viding full disclosure, and documenting your com-munication and ndings are all steps taken to avoidrunning afoul of any legal issues. Potential legalissues in a pre-purchase exam scenario could arise from malpractice, agency, negligent or innocentmisrepresentation, and from a claim for expresswarranty. Malpractice Malpractice is among the key areas of concern andthis rests with your expertise and thoroughness as aveterinarian. Should an issue with the horse'shealth or soundness be discovered after a purchasethat a buyer feels should have been discovered dur-ing the exam, legal problems can result. In thiscase, the client will seek to prove that the horse hasan issue that should have been discovered during AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 479HOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE WESTERN HORSEyour exam and that they are entitled to damages as a result. Agency Agency, or acting as an agent for someone, is acommon term used in the equine industry. Legallydened, it is a relation, created either by express orimplied contract or by law, whereby one party(called the principal or constituent) delegates thetransaction of some lawful business or the authorityto do certain acts for him or in relation to his rightsor property, with more or less discretionary power,to another person (called the agent, attorney, proxy,or delegate) who undertakes to manage the affairand render him an account thereof. 4Documenta - tion and acknowledgment of agency power is recom-mended when dealing with anyone alleging torepresent another in any way in a pre-purchaseexam scenario. Misrepresentation A claim for misrepresentation arises where oneparty makes an untrue statement of fact that in-duces the other to enter into a contract. 5While you as the veterinarian are not party to the contract per se, your expertise may be viewed as proximal causeto the inducement to enter into the contract. Thiscan be made evident through a \"but for\" analysis ina court of law, where the complainant may allegethat \"but for\" your misrepresentation, they wouldhave not entered in to the contract to purchase thehorse. Negligent misrepresentation is dened as \"where the misrepresentation was made carelessly or with-out the representor having reasonable grounds forbelieving its truth.\" 5As an example, a case may be where a veterinarian represents the horse as being sound while overlooking a lesion in a radiographthat is later discovered to have been apparent at thetime of the exam. Innocent misrepresentation is one that has in- duced a party into a contract, but the person mak-ing the misrepresentation had reasonable groundsfor believing it was true at the time the represen-tation was made. A claimant who has been thevictim of innocent misrepresentation can stillpursue damages, but he or she cannot pursue re-scission. 4Misrepresentation, negligent, and in - nocent misrepresentation can all give rise to aclaim for malpractice. Puffery Puffery is a statement that is \"puffed up\" to makesomething sound better than it truly is. While notnecessarily a misrepresentation, it is a statementthat no reasonable person would actually interpretas a statement of fact. It can be interpreted differ-ently, however, depending on who is saying it.For example, if the seller of the horse makes thestatement, \"this horse can turn on a dime,\" this is aform of puffery. However, if you as a veterinarianperform a pre-purchase examination on a horse and make the statement that \"this horse ought to be ableto turn on a dime,\" this could rise to the level ofinnocent misrepresentation if it is later shown thatthe horse in fact cannot \"turn on a dime.\" This typeof statement is unnecessary from the veterinary per-spective. It can influence the buyer's decision andhas no specic scientic evidence to support it. Because of your role in the pre-purchase exam, as a veterinary professional with an unbiased positionyou are held to a high standard. Remember, yourjob is to conduct the exam and report your ndings.Do not get caught up in the enthusiasm of the trans-action. No statements of puffery should ever existin your communication. Refrain from making anyjudgments or statements that could be overly influ-ential to the buyer about the horse's ability. Again,this is not necessarily misrepresenting the truth,rather, it is making statements that could be misin-terpreted by the buyer that can influence their de-cision making and are not grounded in good science. Warranty Express Warranty is a promise about the characterof an item made by a seller used in negotiations.It is part of the contract of sale for acceptance pro-cess. A seller doesn't need to use the word war-ranty to make it one. 6While you are not the seller in the pre-purchase exam, your role in the potential purchase of the horse and the reliance on your ex-pertise can give rise to a claim for warranty withoutproper documentation and communication of dis-claimer of such. Warranty of Fitness is the specic type of war- ranty that may be interpreted by your client. Thistype of warranty is a form of express warranty thatthe item being sold is suitable for the purpose in-tended. From a client's perspective this can be thereason that your exam is being sought out in therst place. Buyers want assurances before spend-ing money. Your role is a step in gaining that as-surance. The assurance being sought is that thehorse will be healthy and sound and suitable for thepurpose intended by the buyer. This underscoresthe need to obtain written and signed documenta-tion that your exam is not to be interpreted as beinga warranty of any kind, tness or otherwise. 5. Conclusion Remember, the purpose of your exam, is to providean unbiased scientic opinion to a client as to thesuitability of the horse for the purpose that theclient intends from a health and wellness perspec-tive. 7In addition, you must be able to effectively communicate to the potential buyer the signicance of the ndings and provide an opinion as to thefunctional effect of these ndings in writingpromptly after the examination is completed. 7 By developing a systematic approach, providing complete disclosure, understanding the legal issuesinvolved, utilizing documents prepared by an attor- 480 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM FOR THE exercising due diligence, and properly docu- menting ndings throughout the exam you canbetter position yourself for a positive outcome.

Materials and Methods A randomized cross-over design was used with sixnormal horses using a sole-pressure lameness model.Objective lameness (vector sum [VS] score) was deter-mined with an inertial sensor system at 0, 1, 6, and 24hours after lameness induction. Physical examina-tions, mechanical nociceptive threshold and VS score were recorded prior toperineural anesthesia and at 1, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hourspost-injection. Each horse was administered LB andBHCl in random order with a 1-week washout periodbetween treatments. Data analysis was performedwith mixed with P/H11021.05.3. Results For LB, MNTs were signicantly different from baseline (19.5 kg/cm2) at 1, 6, and 24 hours (48.2, 44.2, 28.2 kg/cm2, respectively). VS scores were also signicantly different at 1 hr (13.6 mm), 6 hours(12.7 mm), and 24 hours (14 mm) compared to lame-ness controls at the same times (91 mm, 57.6 mm,58.4 mm, respectively).

Introduction There are many practical farriery options available to the clinician when an alternative to a horseshoemay be necessary or preferred. The wooden shoe isa simple, practical, and very effective farriery optionfor treating not only chronic laminitis but manyother foot problems (Fig. 1). 1-7Among those prob- lems that may benet from the wooden shoe areacute/chronic laminitis, extensive white line dis-ease, fractures of the distal phalanx/navicular bone,and horses that have feet with poor hoof wall growthcombined with thin deformable soles. The woodenshoe is used as a transitional device to stabilize thehoof capsule, promote hoof wall growth at the coro-net, and increase sole depth. Once the structures of the hoof capsule have improved with sufcientmass to achieve stability and realignment of thedistal phalanx within the hoof capsule in the case ofchronic laminitis, conventional farriery is used orthe horse can be left barefoot. The wooden shoe issimple to apply; however, there is a learning curvethat makes it is essential to follow a proceduralmodel. U nderstanding the principles of the wooden shoe, the appropriate foot trim, proper t and place-ment on the foot, and its application are essential.It must be stated from the onset that the applicationof the wooden shoe must be combined with the ap-propriate foot trim to achieve consistent effective results from this modality. The wooden shoe hasbeen popularized treating chronic laminitis, so itsuse here will be used as a model when describing theoverall procedure. Advantages The wooden shoe has all the mechanical componentsthat can be incorporated in other farrier methodologypreviously described yet it may possess some addi-tional advantages over previous methods. A majoradvantage of the wooden shoe is its ability to concen-trate the load (weight) evenly over a specied sectionof the foot due to its flat solid construction. 1-4,7Im- pression material added to the solar surface of the footincreases the surface area of the foot, further enhanc- ing the effects of placing one flat surface againstanother. Another advantage is its non-traumaticapplication that eliminates the necessity to use localanesthesia in the case of chronic laminitis or otherpainful foot conditions. The wooden shoe is con-structed from readily accessible materials (wood) or can be purchased commercially. aBreakover and heel elevation can be fabricated into the shoe andthe beveled perimeter of the shoe appears to de-crease torque on the lamellae by moving the NOT IN THE SHOULDER: FOOT ISSUES AND DEALING WITH THEM NOTESter of the shoe also concentrates the load (weight) under the distal phalanx due to the solid base of theshoe. Heel elevation, when necessary, can be ap-plied in a uniform manner by altering the shape ofthe wooden shoe or by attaching a degree pad to thefoot surface of the shoe. The shoe can be easilyaltered using radiographic guidance plus the biome-chanical or structural requirements of the individ-ual foot conformation. Mechanism There are three basic principles used in applyingtherapeutic farriery. The rst is to redistribute theload (weight of the horse) or decrease the forces on asection of the ground surface of the foot. Secondly,to reposition breakover and lastly, to provide heelelevation when necessary to decrease the tension inthe deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT). These threeprinciples are especially relevant when treatingchronic laminitis. To understand these principles,it is necessary to briefly consider foot biomechanicsand the moments about the distal interphalangealjoint (DIPJ). In a standing horse, the weight of thehorse borne by the limb (mass /H11003acceleration of gravity) exerts a force on the ground which is op-posed by an equal and opposite force, the GRF.The point at which the GRF acts on the foot istermed the center of pressure (CoP). The positionof the CoP varies dependent on foot conformationand trimming but will be located dorsal to the centerof rotation (COR) of the DIPJ. The GRF being dor- sal to the COR creates a moment about the DIPJtermed the extensor moment. The extensor mo-ment must be opposed by an equal and oppositemoment, which is termed the flexor moment. Amoment is the tendency to cause a body to rotateabout an axis which in this case, is the COR of theDIPJ. At rest, the extensor moment is the productof the weight borne by the limb (a force) and thehorizontal distance from the point at which the GRFacts on the foot (CoP) and the COR of the DIPJ.The flexor moment opposes the extensor momentand is the product of the force in the tendon of the distance of the DDFT from the COR and the force(tension) in the tendon and the shortest distance ofthe DDFT from the COR (Fig. 2A). The GRF deter-mines the load and subsequent compressive and ten-sile stresses that are placed on the dorsal section ofthe foot. The weight or GRF on the foot cannot bechanged, but the position of the GRF where it actson the ground surface of the foot can be shifted awayfrom the affected area or redistributed. At mid-stance and breakover, the flexor moment exceedsthe extensor moment and the GRF moves dorsallyin the toe placing pressure and a distractive force inthe dorsal section of the foot (Fig. 2B). The thick-ness of the wooden shoe allows breakover to beplaced in the shoe further palmarly than conven-tional shoes. This reduces the extensor moment, Fig. 1. A, Ground surface, B, Side view of the wooden shoe. Note the bevel around the perimeter of the shoe and the flat platform on the ground surface. Fig. 2. A, The biomechanical forces exerted on the foot and the moments about the DIPJ. B, Illustration of the GRF moving dorsallyin the toe during mid-stance and breakover (Courtesy of Andrew Parks). 484 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIT'S NOT IN THE SHOULDER: FOOT ISSUES AND DEALING WITH THEMbrings the GRF closer to the weight force, and re- duces tension in the DDFT (Fig. 3A). This conceptcan be clearly demonstrated by creating a bevel intwo pieces of wood that are of different thickness(Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the bevel around the pe-rimeter of the wooden shoe moves the GRF axiallywhich decreases the force required to breakover in amedial or lateral direction with less stress onthe tissues (Fig. 4). Finally, when the wooden shoewith its rm flat surface is applied to the foot, thedistribution of force becomes much larger because weight bearing is distributed over a larger area onthe solar surface of the foot. Therefore, combinedwith the appropriate trim and impression materialplaced in the frog sulci, one rm flat surface (thefoot) is being placed against the other (the shoe). Construction of the Shoe The author prefers wood due to its accessibility,light weight, the ease with which it can be construct-ed/shaped (both before and after application) and itsability to dissipate energy at impact while remain-ing rigid. 7There are shoes available commercially that have an ethyl vinyl acetate pad substituted for the thicker three-quarter-inch section of plywoodthat is beveled. Ethyl vinyl acetate is an extremelyelastic material that can be sintered to form a po-rous material similar to rubber, yet has resilience.The compressibility and wearability of this materialallows \"selective\" loading on the ground surface ofthe shoe relative to the load placed on the limb butthis loading is not always in alliance with the ap-propriate biomechanics to counteract the abnormalforces. The wooden shoe is constructed using analuminum shoe with a broad toe that is available insizes 00 to 5 as a template. bThe basic shoe is made from two pieces of plywood. One piece of plywood is 1/4 to 3/8-inch-thick and the second piece is 3/4 inchthick. Using the aluminum shoe as a template, thethinner piece of plywood is cut out with a verticalborder while the thicker piece is cut out with theborder straight or beveled at a 30-degree angleacross the palmar or heel section and a 45\u00b0 anglearound the perimeter of the block using anangle saw c(Fig. 5 A). The straight or decreased angle across the palmar section of the shoe preventsrocking backward during landing. The two piecesof plywood are glued together with the thinner por-tion proximal and then two 1-inch drywall screws orwood screws are inserted on the foot surface foradditional security. A wood rasp or belt sander isused to blend the cut angles into a uniform slope.Alternatively, the wooden shoe is available commer-cially and can be easily modied with a belt sanderor a hoof rasp to match the wooden shoe that wasdescribed above a(Fig. 5B). Shoe height is dictated by the conformation of the hoof and the amount of displacement (rotation) of the distal phalanxpresent\u2014i.e., the greater the rotation of the distalphalanx, the more shoe height is necessary in orderto achieve a more palmar placement of breakover.If the sole is prolapsed or the distal phalanx haspenetrated the sole, a recess can be created in thedorsal surface of the shoe by cutting a half-moonshape that mimics the prolapse using a router or ahand grinder to create a trough in the shoe below thearea of the sole or bone that has prolapsed. If it isdetermined that heel elevation is required, the heelscan be elevated accordingly by applying a wedge padto the hoof surface of the wooden shoe. The angle ofthe wedge is usually 2\u00b0-3\u00b0 degrees depending on the Fig. 3.

The wedge pad is attached to the shoe with 1-inchdrywall screws or wood screws. An alternativemethod to raise the heels is to create a wedge in theshoe by cutting the ground surface of the woodenshoe itself at an angle to the hoof surface. Radiographs Radiographs are essential when applying thewooden shoe. The lateral view evaluates the distalphalanx and related soft tissue structures of the footin a dorsal palmar plane while the dorsopalmar viewevaluates these structures in lateral medial plane.High-quality radiographs are required to visualizethe osseous structures, the hoof capsule and relatedsoft-tissue structures in order to evaluate any dis-ease process, hoof conformation, the position of thedistal phalanx within the hoof position ofthe DIPJ, and especially the soft-tissue structures.The radiographs are also used as a guideline fortrimming the foot as well as positioning and apply-ing the wooden shoe (Fig. 6). The lateral radiograph has always been consid- ered the \"gold\" standard for evaluating chronic lami-nitis but it does not allow identication ofasymmetrical medial should al-ways be included as part of the radiographic study for either acute or chronic laminitis. The radiographic features of chronic laminitis are well documented.8,9The lateral radiograph will al - low the clinician to assess the thickness of the dorsalhoof wall, the descent of the distal phalanx withinthe hoof capsule, the degree of dorsal rotation of thedistal phalanx, the angle of the solar border of thedistal phalanx relative to the ground, the distancebetween the dorsal limit of the solar margin ofthe distal phalanx and the ground, and the thick-ness of the sole. The dorsopalmar radiograph will reveal if asym- metrical distal displacement of the distal phalanx oneither the lateral or medial side is present andwhether the width of the hoof wall is thicker thannormal on the affected side. A useful template can be superimposed on the lateral radiograph and then transferred to the footfor use as a guideline to apply the appropriate trimand placement of the wooden shoe in cases of chroniclaminitis (Fig. 7). Application of the Shoe The Trim Prior to the trim, the horse should be observed in motion noting the degree of lameness, if present, in Fig. 5.

The landing pattern of the horse should be determined; whether the horselands flat, heel rst, toe rst, or lands asymmetri-cally on one side of the hoof capsule. The initialstep to trim the foot in all cases is to draw a lineacross the widest part of the foot. The widest partof the foot is located 5-10 mm dorsal to the COR,which makes it a good starting point for the trim.Loose exfoliating horn is removed from the frog andthe hoof wall is rasped from the middle of the footpalmarly to where the hoof wall and the frog are onthe same plane. The amount of heel trimmed willgenerally correlate with the lateral radiograph.This creates additional ground surface from the mid-dle of the foot to the heels which moves the load in apalmar direction. The toe length is reduced dorsalto the widest part of the foot to create approximateproportions on either side of the line. In most caseswhere the wooden shoe is used, the dorsal section ofthe foot will be compromised with limited sole thick-ness, so the toe length can be reduced using thenippers in a vertical direction according to the ra-diograph or by rasping the dorsal hoof wall. A template can also be used as a guide when trimming the case with laminitis. The quartersand heels of the hoof wall are trimmed from thewidest part of the foot palmarly to coincide with line 1 drawn distal to the solar margin of the distalphalanx on the radiograph. The solar surface ofthe foot dorsal to the widest part of the foot is nottrimmed. The toe length is reduced from the dorsalhoof wall according to line 2 drawn dorsal to theparietal surface of the distal phalanx. If possible,the ideal end product when trimmed according tothe template, will have two different planes on the ground surface of the foot with the heels of the hoofcapsule and the frog on the same plane (Fig. 8A).This method of trimming redistributes the load tothe palmar section of the foot and functionally un-loads the toe. Following the trim, the foot is placed on the ground and the horse is observed to see whether theheel of the foot is touching the ground at rest. Inmotion, the horse is observed for signs of lamenessor if lameness has increased following the trim andwhether it lands markedly toe rst in a straight line.If any of these signs are present, heel elevation willbe necessary to compensate for the increase in ten-sion in the DDFT caused by trimming the heels ofthe hoof capsule. Heel elevation is easily added tothe wooden shoe using a wedge pad (Fig. 8B). Fig. 7.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 487IT'S NOT IN THE SHOULDER: FOOT ISSUES AND DEALING WITH THEMFitting and Applying the Shoe The foot surface of a wooden shoe is measured from dorsal to palmar and then drawing a line throughthe middle of the shoe. The correct size of the shoeis determined by superimposing the line drawnacross the widest part of the foot and the line on theshoe over each other; allowing the wooden shoe toextend marginally beyond the perimeter of the hoofcapsule and 10-15 mm palmar to the trimmed heel.Using a 1.98-mm drill, multiple guide holes aredrilled through the lateral and medial side of thehoof wall beginning at the widest part of the foot andcontinuing toward the heel. These holes are pre-drilled from the solar surface of the foot to ensureaccurate screw placement in the wall, and 3.75 cmcourse thread drywall or wood screws are placed ineach hole on the outer hoof wall and screwed in untiljust visible on the ground surface of the foot. Torecruit the sole, bars, frog, and sulci for weight bear-ing and increase the surface area, deformable im-pression material 3is applied to the palmar section of the foot being careful that the impression material does not extend beyond the bearing border of the footsurface to create pressure. With the foot off theground, the shoe is now set in place, 2 or 3 of thepreplaced screws are drilled into the shoe andthe foot is immediately placed on the ground to bearweight. This allows the impression material toconform between the palmar section of the foot andthe shoe, thus creating two flat surfaces. After theremaining screws are inserted, additional screwscan be placed in the wooden shoe against the outersurface of the hoof wall at the heels to act as strutsto provide stability and act as an anchor for thecasting tape. With the foot on the ground and us-ing a rasp as a straight edge, a vertical line is drawnfrom the dorsal aspect of the coronary band to theground, the side of the wooden shoe is marked at theground surface and then a line is drawn acrossthe ground surface of the shoe (Fig. 9A). Settingthe breakover to this point in the shoe is easilyaccomplished by extending the bevel to this lineusing a hoof rasp with the foot being held in thefarrier position (Fig. 9B). The line across the shoe is where the breakover point of the shoe should bepositioned, which will consistently be located justdorsal to the solar margin of the distal phalanx (Fig.10). Orthopedic felt or impression material is placed across the bulbs of the heels and 2-inch casting tape e is applied around the perimeter of the foot formingan attachment between the hoof wall, screws, andwooden shoe. The casting tape provides circumfer-ential stability, which may prevent flaring of thehoof wall during weight bearing that ultimatelypulls the sole distally. 10Horses are radiographed at 4-5 weeks to assess improvement of the soft tissue structures and are either transferred to con-ventional shoes or left in the wooden shoes until thedesired results are achieved (Fig. 11). Unilateral Displacement of the Distal Phalanx Unilateral displacement of the distal phalanx in amediolateral direction commonly occurs as a conse-quence of overloading one side of the foot or fromlaminitis. 2,3,6Unilateral displacement can occur in two clinical scenarios. The rst context is less rec- ognized where one side of the foot is overloaded andthe distal phalanx descends. Here the limb confor-mation of the horse leads to an asymmetric landingpattern, which causes disproportionate loading onone side of the foot. Hoof characteristics would in- Fig. 9.

In the second scenario, the horsewill have clinical signs of laminitis, radiographicevidence of displacement, or rotation in the dorsalsection of the foot and the hoof wall on the displacedside will be thickened compared to the contralateralside due to the diseased lamellae (Fig. 12B). Basedon the apparent asymmetry of the distal phalanxwithin the hoof capsule visible on radiographs, aclinician's rst response might intuitively be to tryand correct the asymmetry of the DIPJ and theposition of the distal phalanx in relation to theground. This would most readily be accomplishedby trimming and or raising the side of the hoof onwhich the distal phalanx is displaced. However,bearing in mind the compromised lamellae on thedisplaced side, this practice will increase the weightbearing on the affected side and cause the distalphalanx to displace further in relation to the hoofcapsule, along with increased discomfort. Theoret-ically, the hoof capsule can be stabilized in relationto the distal phalanx by increasing weight bearingon the contralateral side and reducing weight bear-ing on the affected side. Biomechanically, theweight of the horse is opposed by the GRF which isexerted on the foot at every point of contact. TheGRF acts of the foot through the CoP which is typ-ically located in the middle of the healthy foot.The CoP is important because it determines thedistribution of stresses within the hoof; therefore,changing the position of the wooden shoe will causean asymmetrical redistribution of pressure on theground surface of the foot that will change the CoP(Fig. 13A). The author has been successful in con-trolling mediolateral displacement by setting thewooden shoe wide on the unaffected side. 2,3,6,11,12 The foot is trimmed as described above making sure the hoof wall and frog are on the same planeand that either the lateral or medial hoof wall is notlowered more than the other. Any signicant flareon the affected side of the foot is reduced with a raspfrom the outer hoof wall and impression material is placed in the palmar section of the foot to make itload sharing. The wooden shoe is tted to the footsuch that it is flush or tight on the affected side andthen forms a 14to38-inch extension beyond the perimeter of the wall on the unaffected side of thefoot (Fig. 13B). 2. Conclusions The wooden shoe provides another consistently ef-fective farriery option when treating a variety of footproblems, especially laminitis. The case selectionin this paper deliberately excludes laminitis pa-tients deemed to have a very poor prognosis. Theauthor, and many of his colleagues, contend that, forwelfare and ethical reasons, such horses are eutha-nasia candidates and should not be subjected toadditional pain and suffering with little to no chanceof success. Horses selected, although painful, werejudged to have sufcient integrity of the hoof struc-tures in which to apply the appropriate trim and usethe biomechanical aspects of the wooden shoe to getimprovement. 3. Results From the author's practice and consulting serviceduring the last 5 years treating acute and chroniclaminitis, white line disease, distal phalanx frac-tures and improving the structures, using thewooden shoe in a large number of cases showedconsistent improvement, which was considered asuccess (Table 1). Altering the biomechanical forces on the foot with the bevel of the wooden shoe decreases the stress onthe lamellae and soft tissues, an effect which is oftendifcult to produce with traditional shoes. Cuttingthe perimeter of the wooden shoe at a 45\u00b0 angle orbevel around the circumference of the shoe appearsto decrease the dorsal/lateral/medial torque on thelamellae, especially when the horse turns.

This concept of load sharing is veryhelpful in a horse with compromised foot conforma-tion that has limited viable hoof structures in agiven section of the foot. Furthermore, therapeuticshoes are often decient in providing sufcientbreakover and heel elevation due to the physicallimits of the particular shoe whereas increasing theheight of the wooden shoe allows the desired biome-chanics to be fabricated into the shoe. Finally, thewooden shoe provides a simplied method to applythe three principles of therapeutic farriery, whichare to redistribute the load or forces on the foot,reposition breakover, and provide heel elevationwhen necessary.

Introduction Cryotherapy is commonly used on horses in hospital and competition settings for anti-inflammatory prop-erties, but the analgesic effect is unexplored. Thisstudy assesses the analgesic effect of cryotherapy ap-plied in a framework applicable to sport horses incompetition. 2. Materials and Methods A cross-over study with 10 mature horses was con-ducted. Lameness was induced using solar pressurevia set screws and recorded via a commercial nonin-vasive inertial sensor. Horses were jogged in astraight line on the same grass surface to preventexcessive solar pressure from the screw. After induc-ing lameness, distal limbs were either maintained inan ice slurry (treatment) or at ambient temperature(control) for 60 minutes. Post-treatment lamenesswas recorded at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. The degree of lameness at each time point was compared with the initial induced lameness and be-tween treatment and control groups by using Wil- coxon sign test(s) for nonparametric data. 3. Results ( P/H113490.05) lameness reduction of 44% to 67% was observed at 5 minutes post-treat-ment in all horses and remained at 10 minutes post-treatment in the treatment group. Compared tocontrols, the median lameness reduction was greater for horses receiving ice treatment at all timepoints, with statistical signicance only at 15 min-utes post-treatment. 4. Discussion This study found evidence of moderate, transientanalgesia from cryotherapy. Additional research isrequired to determine if altering the method, dura-tion or temperature of cryotherapy, as well as thetargeted pathology and anatomy, alters the analge-sic effect.

Introduction Safety of veterinarians during painful or frightening procedures toward the horse is of paramount impor-tance. Minimizing the stress to the horse and re-ducing painful stimuli through various techniquesincrease the safety for all injection procedures.A recent study commissioned by the British EquineVeterinary Association and conducted by leadingmedical professionals at the Institute of Health and Wellbeing and the School of Veterinary Medicine atthe University of Glasgow revealed that being anequine veterinarian carried the highest risk of in-jury of any civilian occupation in the United King-dom. 1A study performed in the United States found that 65% of veterinarians had received seriouswork-related injuries and 17% had been injuredwithin the last year. 2A similar result was found in an Australian study with 54% suffering work-related injuries and 26% receiving injuries withinthe last year. 3Strategic horse handling during healthcare procedures is necessary for the safetyand well-being of all those involved (human andhorse). With growing interest in the eld of animalwelfare, equine handling methods that align withequine behavior and learning principles have beensuggested to result in fewer injuries and more posi- tive behavioral responses from the patients. 4,5 This retrospective study evaluated the ability to perform safe needle insertion and injection for diag-nostic analgesia in the limbs of horses and evaluatedthe effectiveness of using the presentation of foodcombined with or without sedation for restraininghorses during intrasynovial and perineural anesthe-sia. In all cases, the injection procedure on thelimb was achieved without having to resort to pain-ful aversion techniques, such as use of a twitch, andwithout injury to the veterinarian and attendingpersonnel. Modication of techniques and proce-dures to further decrease patient sensitivity andensure operator and horse safety included thefollowing: Using smaller needles, Skin bleb (subcutaneous 2-mL injection with local anesthetic) where it would not interferewith neural pathways, Injecting into a flexed limb if possible, Forewarning the horse through preinjection area pressure or tension directly or with theultrasound probe adjacent to the needle entrypoint. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 493IT'S NOT IN THE SHOULDER: FOOT ISSUES AND DEALING WITH THEM NOTES2. Materials and Methods Feeding Food, in the form of grain or horse treatsa, was provided to all horses undergoing diagnostic limb anesthesia in the authors' practice over a 6-yearperiod between 2012 and 2018. A bucket of horse crunch, palatable grain, or horse treats awas placed under the patient's nose by either a veterinary assistant, a staff member, or an ame- nable owner. The handler was instructed to startfeeding the horse 4 to 5 seconds before, during, andfor 4 to 5 seconds after the anesthetic procedure.The handler initially directed the attention of thehorse toward the side of the operator to ensure thatthe horse was aware of the veterinarian's presence.The use of a bucket instead of hand feeding has beenshown to decrease the likelihood of biting/nippingbehavior directed toward the handler. 4 Sedation Detomidine HClbwas the preferred sedative, as its duration of effect was long enough for diagnostic imaging to be completed and frequently allowedsome level of sedation to persist. The amount ofsedation varied from no sedation up to 5 mg detomi-dine HCl bas a total dosage. An initial small dose (1-1.5 mg intravenous) of detomidine HClbwas fre - quently administered to those horses that were un-able to jog quietly. This resulted in less headtossing and a more consistent observation of thelameness. There was also less variability in resultswhen sensor technology, Lameness Locator c, was utilized. Upon completion of the physical exam and motion analysis, a limb was chosen as having theprimary lameness. After conveying the results tothe owner and discussing the ndings, the horse waseither blocked or frequently sedated for ultrasonog-raphy and radiology of the limb or area(s) thought tobe affected. This sedation dose was dependent on temperament and expected duration of time requiredfor further diagnostics. When blocking forelimbs thatdid not require radiographic or sonographic guidance,sedation was rarely necessary. Most hind limb lame-nesses received low level sedation prior to blocking.Administering food during the blocking procedureavoided excessive sedation, which would postpone theexamination. Time from sedation to jogging was notrecorded but varied from 15 to 45 minutes. Limb Positioning The palmar digital and abaxial nerve blocks were alldone with the limb flexed and elevated, with thefetlock or metacarpus resting on the veterinarian'sknee while seated on a mechanic's roller stool.Digital sheath and fetlock joint blocks were done ina similar fashion, or alternatively, the metacarpuswas placed on a Flex Stand dwith an assistant main - taining the position during needle placement. Allpelvic limbs that underwent diagnostic limb anes-thesia were blocked with the limb flexed and ele-vated, resting on the operator or on an appropriate stand during needle insertion. Plantar digitalnerve anesthesia abaxial to the position by allowing the horse's toe to reston a small piece of 2 /H110034, as it naturally unloaded the limb, or placing it in the Flex Stand d.Proximal suspensory direct inltration was done with the limb held flexed between the operator's legs or usingthe Flex Stand d. Needle Size A 27-gauge needle was used for desensitization of allproper palmar/plantar digital nerves, all commondigital peroneal. All proxi-mal to the carpus or tarsus were done underultrasound guidance and included initial placementof a skin bleb using a 27-gauge needle before intro-duction of the larger needle. 6A 22-gauge needle was used for most proximal suspensory inltration blocks, ultrasound guided perineural, and intrasy-novial injections. Longer 20-gauge spinal needleswere used for the shoulder and coxofemoral joints. Forewarning/Desensitization Desensitizing the skin over the injection site wasdone prior to or at the time of needle insertion.The skin over supercial nerves, such as a palmarproper digital nerve, was slightly elevated at thetime of needle introduction in a pinching fashionand the needle placed subcutaneously. When in-jecting while using ultrasound, a momentary in-crease in pressure of the probe (light poke) was usedto assess the horse's response and to prepare thehorse for needle insertion. The needle was theninserted simultaneously with another momentaryincrease in pressure on the probe. 3. Results Four hundred twenty-two horses were included inthis study with 830 anesthetic injections adminis-tered. Cases from other veterinarians in the prac-tice were excluded because only the primary authorwas consistent in ensuring that food incentive wasused with all patients receiving diagnostic anesthe-sia. Therapeutic injections of the limbs were ex-cluded from this study because the sedation dosagewas appreciably higher and food was inconsistentlyused. The procedure was considered successful if the injection was accomplished safely (no injuries),without untoward movement from the horse, andother physical restraint techniques such as a twitchwere not used. Data collected included the success of the tech- nique, whether the Lameness Locator chad been used, the interval of time between the block and reassessment, the effectiveness of the desensitiza-tion, and the types of blocks performed. 494 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIT'S NOT IN THE SHOULDER: FOOT ISSUES AND DEALING WITH THEMThe location and type of limb anesthesia was cat- egorized into intrasynovial or perineural. One hundred eighty blocks were intrasynovial with anesthesia of the stifle joints being the mostcommon (43% of the cases). tarsometatarsal joint, tarsocruraljoint, scapulohumeral (shoulder) joint, and cubital(elbow) joint (Fig. 1). Six hundred and forty-onenerve blocks were done and these included themodied 4 and some proximal suspensory blocks weredone using ultrasound guidance. If no change wasnoted, then the horse was re-examined after moretime. This was more common with the large tibialand median nerves, which required more time toblock out. Horses were frequently sedated for initial radiol- ogy and ultrasonography. Diagnostic anaesthesiafrequently followed and was intended to conrm theclinical signicance of any imaging ndings. As aresult, the higher dosages of sedation initially usedwere frequently wearing off by the time limb desen-sitization was initiated and food distraction provedto be a very valuable form of restraint. Excessiveor oversedation was not usually a complication in this study because the operator was aware thathorses were required to jog 5 to 30 minutes (depend-ing on the location of the block) after the limb de-sensitization procedure. (Fig. 3 and 4). Therefore,there was a tendency to underdose rather than over-dose. Excessive sedation delayed the post-blockmotion analysis and also decreased the horse's in-terest in food. Results indicated that safety was achieved in all cases and at no time was a twitch used. Six caseswere unsuccessful at the rst attempt related to un-toward movement. Three of these were medial femo-rotibial injections done in the initial year of the study.Because the author did all upper limb injections underultrasound guidance, immobility of the limb was nec-essary to achieve success. The protocol was changedto include a skin bleb and a slightly higher level ofsedation. The skin bleb decreased pain on injection.Additional sedation was not a concern with intra-articular anesthesia of the stifle because diffusion ofthe block to other areas does not generally occur aswith perineural anesthesia, so immediate jogging isnot imperative. Two cases of hind limb proximal sus-pensory anesthesia were hypersensitive and re-sponded by kicking during needle insertion. Theaffected limbs had been flexed and held up against theoperator's lap resulting in the operator being pushedaway and not kicked. Both horses responded to in-creased sedation and a skin bleb on the second at-tempt. A violent response occurred with the sixthhorse while receiving a median nerve block under ul-trasound guidance. The horse had been sedated and Fig. 1. The type, number, and percentage of intrasynovial anesthetic injections.

The intern driving the needle touched the median nerve, resulting in the horse'slimb striking out at supersonic speed.

Discussion The diagnostic arena is an automatic stressor for most horses, and placing needles into horse's limbscan be painful. The simple act of a veterinarianproviding their patient with a treat upon initial in-troduction could shape positive and willing behaviorfrom the patient through the use of classical condi-tioning. 7The American Veterinary Society of Ani - mal Behavior (AVSAB) encourages the use of pre-medicating with chemical restraint along with theuse of a pleasant stimulus such as food during non-aversive procedures to eliminate forceful restraintand punishment that would, in turn, cause anxietyand decrease the welfare of the animal. 8,9The present study used a technique that provided food during a painful procedure (i.e., needle insertion)with the intent to prevent aversive behavior duringthe procedure. Much of the current literature continues to sug- gest the use of a twitch for restraint during intra-articular and perineural analgesia 10,11despite the recognition that the technique causes pain.12The use of a twitch contradicts the recommendations of the AVSAB and is an ineffective form of punishment(adding stimulus to prevent a behavior) as denedby McGreevy and Mclean. 13Assuming the twitch causes pain, handlers would be punishing the horse without an adverse behavior ever being exhibited.This frequently conditioned the horse to dislike vet-erinary visits, further via linking an unpleasantstimulus (i.e., nose or ear twitch) to an already un-pleasant situation/procedure (i.e., veterinary pres-ence and needle insertion). It has been suggestedthat the pain from the twitch would distract thepatient from the pain of the aversive stimulus. 12The ear twitch has been shown to have more adverse effects on equine behavior during and after commonhealthcare procedures, whereas the nose twitchseems to have a mild analgesic effect during the rst5 minutes of application, after which adverse effectson behavior and physiological stress responses wereobserved. 14A horse may remain immobilized for a short period of time through the use of a twitch and then explode, striking and rearing without warning.The horse's unpredictability makes the twitch adangerous tool to use. Painful forms of restraintprevent positive behavioral modication and mayreinforce the fear expressed by the horse. 5This results in a greater negative behavioral response during future veterinary visits.5In this study, the use of positive stimuli, such as food, coupled with minimal chemical restraint and other techniquesdiscussed were successful to safely restrain horseswithout resorting to the twitch. Multiple factors play a role in safe injection tech- nique. Further studies are needed to evaluate therelative importance of each. Decreasing any sur-prises for the horse by always ensuring the horse isaware of where the operator is located is a task notto be taken lightly by both the operator and thehandler. A well-trained vet assistant on the headneeds to be alert and aware of equine behavioralidiosyncrasies, warning signs of unpleasant behav-ior, and push pull techniques to remove the operatorout of harm's way. The present study did not record the variability in food motivation or needle hypersensitivity. On oc-casion where the horse appraised the food with dis-interest, other techniques to help distract the horseincluded scratching at the withers 4or rubbing the Fig. 4.

As suggested byAVSAB, 8the use of chemical restraint elicited in - creased well-being from the patient in comparison topatients that received a more forceful form ofrestraint. Previous texts have argued that sedation alters the gait of the horse, such that diagnoses of lame-ness may be rendered ineffective due to the analge-sia caused by sedation. 10Thus, twitch use is often encouraged as opposed to chemical restraint to avoid false positives.10However, recent research has shown that this is not the case.15,16A study ob - served the effects of intravenous administration of up to 10 mg of detomidine HClbon the gait of lame horses and showed that the sedation had no effect on the severity of the lameness.16Nevertheless, the author always suggests re-examining sedated horses that block out, ensuring that the level ofsedation has diminished sufciently to negate thepossibility of a false positive. Despite the simplicity of the present technique it may be difcult for many veterinarians to trade intheir twitch for a bucket of horse treats. The timecommitment to feed the horse is minimal, and ifdone consistently by the handler or your vet assis-tant, the veterinarian should nd an amazing de-crease in everyone's stress levels during blocking. In conclusion, the use of food to shape a horse's behavior was found to be an effective form of restraint.Food alone or food coupled with sedation was a simpleand almost obvious technique, which the authors suc-cessfully used to safely accomplish diagnostic limb an-esthesia in the horse in over 830 cases.

Authors' addresses: University of Kentucky Maxwell Gluck Equine Research Center,Lexington, KY 40546 (Page, Stewart, Horohov); Kentucky Horse Research in Thoroughbred racehorses has demon- strated that continual training leads to a decrease inpro-inflammatory gene expression as horses becomerace t. However, not all horses experience thispredicted decrease, which may be a function of theirtness level, performance ability, or recovery frompast work/races. The goal of this study was to de-termine whether pre-race inflammatory markermRNA expression correlates with race performance,race class, and other horse-specic parameters. 2. Materials and Methods Designed as a prospective study, single blood samples in Tempus RNA stabilization tubes werecollected during pre-race total CO 2testing at a Thoroughbred racetrack in Kentucky. mRNA wasisolated and quantitative PCR performed on data were ana- lyzed using one-way analysis of variance on ranksagainst a variety of horse and race parameters ob- tained from Equibase. 3. Results Pre-race inflammation was not signicantly differ-ent between winners and non-winners, other thanIL-6, which was decreased in post-time favoritesthat nished in the top three positions. Horses en-tered into graded stake races had IL-1 /H9252 and TNF- /H9251, as well as a lower average of all 5 inflammatory markers combined, when comparedto allowance and claiming horses. Additionally,some claiming horses had evidence of increasedpre-race inflammation. 4.

Introduction Equine strongyles are a common parasite of grazing equids, and the small strongyles are considered thefoundational parasite of adult horses. Parascaris spp. are the most signicant parasite pathogen offoals, creating a protocol divergence between man-aging parasites in horses /H110211 year of age and horses /H110221 year. The current study enrolled 410 horses on 27 farms (197 weanlings; 213 horses /H110221 year old) to determine the strongyle and ascarid burdens byfecal egg count (FEC), as well as the efcacy offenbendazole as judged by fecal egg count reductiontest (FECRT). All horses under 1 year old receivedone dose of fenbendazole (10 mg/kg) and the olderhorses received 5 consecutive days of treatment at 10 mg/kg. The average FEC for all animals withstrongyle-positive fecals was eggs per gram (EPG;range, 1-1286 EPG). reduced overallstrongyle the efcacy of fen- bendazole was highly variable between farms (range,41.6-100%). The average FEC for all ascarid- of fenbendazole was with an average of 98.3% reduction(range, 83.0%-100.0%). The data highlight the factthat most horses (398/410; 97%) fall into the lowor moderate egg-shedding category for strongyles.While fenbendazole treatment was /H1102290% effective in reducing strongyle egg counts at some farms, thevariability highlights the importance of FEC andFECRT in the routine care for horses to determinethe efcacy of the deworming program on each farm.

Introduction Colitis is a common cause of gastrointestinal disease in horses and can be associated with signicantmorbidity and mortality. The fecal microbiota ofhorses with antimicrobial administration (AAD) orSalmonella has not been thoroughly described. The purpose of this paper was to compare the fecalmicrobiome of horses with two common types ofdiarrhea, AAD and Salmonella , to a control popula- tion of healthy horses. 2. Materials and Methods Feces from three groups of horses (healthy, AAD,and Salmonella ) was collected, DNA was extracted, and Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes wasperformed. QIIME2.0 was used to generate se-quences and compute alpha and beta diversitymetrics. Alpha diversity was analyzed using aKruskal-Wallis test, whereas ANOSIM was used toestimate differences in beta diversity. Multivari-ate analysis and LEfSe were used to nd bacterial phyla associated with each group. 3. Results Compared to healthy horses ( n/H1100580), horses with colitis due to AAD ( n/H1100517) and Salmonella (n/H1100513) have decreased horses and those with AAD orSalmonella (ANOSIM, P/H110050.001) but not between AAD and Salmonella horses.

Introduction Practitioners depend upon peer-reviewed literature to develop their foundation of knowledge. Whenfaced with new advances in diagnostic tests, proce-dures, or therapies, the veterinarian must evaluatethe ndings and determine the value over their cur-rent standard of practice in order to provide the bestcare to their patients. In the midst of the information era, it is becoming exceedingly more difcult for the busy practitionerto keep abreast with current medical advances.Furthermore, with scientic literature widely avail-able to horse owners, practitioners are constantlyfaced with the need to interpret information thatclients may discover on the Internet. Accuratelyinterpreting, disseminating, and applying this infor-mation can be challenging but this critical appraisalof the veterinary literature is an important subset ofour daily work. Articles published in peer-reviewed journals and publications have undergone an extensive process ofcritical review. Unfortunately, this mechanism isnot perfect, allowing publication of flawed or biasedarticles. Deciencies in design, analysis, and re-porting are common, and the reader should ap- proach the conclusions of an article with appropriateskepticism. The eld of evidenced-based medicine has helped address the needs of busy clinicians by developing efcient guidelines for appraising and applying thescientic literature. 1-3The rst step in this process is to ask a few general questions about the paper todetermine if it is worth critically evaluating (Table 1). 4 Once the merit of the article is determined, the processof critical appraisal may commence in order to assessthe validity (dependability), reliability (repeatability),and relevance of the article. The objective of this\"how to\" is to discuss the process of critical appraisaland extraction of relevant scientic information to en-hance professional development. There are 3 ques-tions the reader should ask: 1) is the study valid?2) are the study ndings clinically valuable? and, 3)are the results relevant? 1 2. Materials and Methods Is the Study Valid? The Materials and Methods section of an article may be exhausting to read, but provides essential infor- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. TO ZEBRAS NOTESmation about the design of the study. In this sec- tion, the reader should answer the question, \"Is thestudy valid?\" The method of appraisal varies basedon the design and objectives of the study. Epidemiologic research involves the study of the relationship of one event or characteristic, termedan exposure, to a specic disease or disease state(outcome). There are two main types of study de-signs in veterinary literature: experimental stud-ies (randomized control trials) and observationalstudies (cross-sectional, case-control, cohort, andcase reports/case series). Not all studies are cre-ated equal. The evidenced-based medicine pyra-mid of evidence illustrates that the quality ofevidence improves as you work up the pyramid (Fig.1). 5Each design has potential limitations that can be minimized through careful planning by the investigator. In equine veterinary medicine, it is rare to en- counter meta-analysis or systematic reviews. Ex-perimental epidemiologic studies are also known asa randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a RCT anintervention is applied and variables are manipu-lated. Animals are randomly assigned into an ex-perimental group or a control group and are followedover time for the variable or outcome of interest. In an observational study, no intervention is made and no variables are manipulated; the animal isstudied in its natural environment and results are directly relevant to the natural disease process.The most common observational study designs inthe equine literature are cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies. Cross-sectional studiesprovide a \"snapshot\" of all parameters (exposuresand outcomes) which are assessed at the same time.In a cohort study, the patients are classied by ex-posure status at the onset of the study and arefollowed forward in time to compare the rate ofdisease occurrence in the exposed and unexposedgroups. These studies can be performed prospec-tively (followed forward in time) or retrospectively(information gathered from the past). In a case-control study, investigators rst identify animalsthat have the outcome of interest (cases) and pa-tients without the same outcome (controls), and thenthey collect historic exposure information. Finally,case reports and case-series provide a summary ofeither one or several patients with an outcome ofinterest, with no control group. In patient-basedresearch, the clinical question usually ts into one offour categories: 1) diagnosis and screening, 2) cau-sation, 3) therapy, and 4) prognosis. The type ofstudy employed depends on the clinical activity inquestion. 1,6 Diagnostic Tests Studies that evaluate a diagnostic test are usuallycross-sectional in design. The accuracy of a diag-nostic test is best determined by comparing it to the\"truth.\" Readers must assure that an appropriatereference or \"gold standard\" has been applied toevery patient, along with the test under investiga-tion. If the \"gold standard\" is acceptable, the nextquestion is whether the test results and the stan-dard were assessed independently of each other.Clinical experience demonstrates why this is impor-tant. For instance, once we have identied degen-erative joint disease on radiographs, a previouslyunidentied lameness may become more apparent.Finally, a common mistake is to apply the new di-agnostic to only patients with severe forms of dis-ease and patients without disease. Rather, the testshould be applied to a broad spectrum of diseaseseverity (mild to severe) to reflect a more practicalclinical application. 7 To interpret the results, a solid understanding of general epidemiologic principles, including sensitiv-ity, specicity, predictive values, and likelihood ra-tios, is essential. 8 Causation To determine risk factors for development of dis-ease, either cohort or case-control studies should beused to evaluate the strength of association betweenthe putative cause and the adverse outcome. It isessential in these studies to evaluate the outcomesand exposures in the same way in the groups beingcompared and the duration of follow up should besufciently long (for cohort studies).Table 1. Questions to Ask Before Beginning to Critically Appraise an Article 1. Is the article from a peer reviewed journal? 2. Are the study subjects similar to my patients?3. Is the study sponsored by an organization that might influence the study design or results? 4. If the results are true, will there be a direct impact on the health of my patients? 5. Is the problem addressed one that is common in my practice? 6. Is the test or intervention feasible? Is it available to me?7. If it is true, will the information require me to change my practice?

As with all study designs, these tooshould be interpreted with caution. Several ques-tions should be addressed when critically appraisingthe design of a RCT. These questions are listedin Table 2. The Consolidated Standards of Report-ing Trials (CONSORT) is an initiative that was de-signed to alleviate problems arising from clinicaltrials. The CONSORT statement checklist is avail-able online (www.consort-statement.org) to offer astandard for reporting of RCT. 9 Prognosis Cohort studies are considered the best design forstudying the prognosis of a disease. For a raredisease or if follow up is long, case-control studiesmay be used. Appropriate and precise case deni-tions are important to produce valid study results.While death may be a very objective outcome ofprognosis, more subjective outcomes such as devel-opment of disease may be more challenging to clas- sify and must be clearly dened. Animals shouldbe included early in the disease process so that se-verely affected animals are not missed due to death,follow up sh ould be an appropriate length and equal among study groups, the number of animalslost to follow up and missing information shouldbe minimized. If greater than 20% of a cohort islost to follow up, results should be interpretedwith caution. Bias When we think about the term bias, we often thinkabout a preconception on the part of the researcherthat may influence the study results. Rather, inpatient-based studies, the term bias is used in ref-erence to deviation from the truth. This may beattributed to either chance (or random error) or thestudy methods (systematic bias). Random errorcan occur in any direction affecting the precision ofthe study. Systematic biases arise from the way inTable 2.

Thistype of bias can overestimate or underestimate thetruth of the study. Different study designs areprone to different sources of systematic bias. 8,10 Statistical Analysis Statistics are mathematical techniques used togather, organize, describe, analyze, and interpretnumerical data. Unfortunately, as veterinarians,we are often leery of mathematical computationlending to a tendency to skim or even skip the sta-tistical analysis section. Understanding a few ba-sic principles will make this section seem lessdaunting. Types of Data The basis of statistics is the data. There are threebasic types of data: categorical, ordinal, and con-tinuous. Categorical data, or nominal data, arebased on categories without measurement. Com-mon categories in equine medicine may include sex(male, female), breed (Quarter Horse, Thorough-bred), or use (pleasure, race). Ordinal data areranked data in which a number is assigned, but thevalues are not continuous. Pain scores and bodycondition scores are examples of ordinal data. Fi-nally, continuous data are measurable on a contin-uous scale, such as heart rate, body temperature, orperitoneal lactate. Parametric Versus Nonparametric All statistical tests are either parametric or non-parametric. Parametric tests assume that the datawere sampled from a particular form of distribution,such as a normal distribution. Nonparametrictests make no such assumption. In general, para-metric tests are more powerful than nonparametrictests and should be used if possible. Appropriatedata for the test are essential to avoid spuriousresults. Tests of Normality There are many methods for assessing the shapeof the distribution of continuous data. Normaldata assume a symmetric, bell-shaped curve. Non-normal data are skewed. Non-normal data can betransformed to give the graph a normal shape usingmathematical transformation (logarithm, squareroot). Transforming data to achieve a normal dis-tribution is standard practice that ensures the datavalues are given appropriate emphasis in the overalleffect. It is not acceptable, however, to use tests based on normal distribution to analyze non-normally distributed data. Signicance A commonly used indicator of signicance in statis-tics is the Pvalue. This is a measurement of the likelihood that the data obtained arouse by chance.APvalue of /H11021.05 has been arbitrarily chosen as the standard of signicance, indicating that there is aless than 5% probability that the evidence gatheredoccurred by chance. It does not, however, meanthat there is a 95% chance that the results are valid.The Pvalue has signicant clinical limitations. It tells nothing about the size of the difference orassociations between groups, and an insignicant P value may actually have clinical signicance. For abetter assessment of the strength of evidence, con-dence intervals (CI) are used. CIs provide a measure of precision of study results for making inferences about the population of simi-lar individuals. A CI will provide a range that,with high probability, will contain the true value. 11 The larger the sample size, the narrower and moreprecise is the CI. Typically, a 95% CI is used,which provides boundaries in which we can be 95%certain that the true value falls within the range.For example, a clinical trial for a new drug demon-strated that 40% of the patients treated with drug Awere cured, compared with 35% of those treatedwith drug B. Statistical analysis of this 5% differ-ence revealed a Pvalue of .001 and a 95% CI of 0% to 10%. The investigators conclude that this is astatistically signicant improvement based on the P value, but a potential range of 0% to 10% is notclinically signicant based on the 95% CI. 3. Results Are the Study Findings Clinically Valuable? Once the study has determined to be valid based on assessment of the study design and the questionbeing addressed, the clinical importance of the studyshould be evaluated. This is usually measured bythe magnitude of the effect or association using mea-sures such as relative risk, odds ratios, relative riskreduction, risk differences, and number needed totreat. Complete explanation of these values is be-yond the scope of this discussion, but may be foundin several resources. 1,8,12,13 4. Discussion Are the Results Relevant? Once it has been determined that the results of the study are both valid and clinically important, theexternal validity of the paper should be evaluated.The tendency is to extrapolate information acquiredfrom the study to one's own patients; however, read-ers should ask themselves, \"To what extent may theresults be generalized and do the results of the studyapply to my patients?\" Unfortunately, many stud-ies in equine veterinary medicine lack heterogeneityof populations, making extrapolation of results chal-lenging. To what extent does this lack of similarityin the populations affect the applicability of the re-sults? There are no standard guidelines for assess-ing the relevance of a study to other populations andconsequently knowledge of the disease and familiar- 516 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUINE INTERNAL MEDICINE: FROM ASCARIDS TO ZEBRASity with the populations is vitally important for crit- ical assessment. 5. Conclusion Despite having signicant limitations, valuable in-formation can be gained through patient-based re-search. Critical appraisal of a clinical relevantpaper is a process through which both the strengthsand weaknesses of a study can be rapidly identied.Using the basic techniques and principles discussedin this \"how to,\" the reader should become morecondent in identifying potential limitations of clin-ically based research, interpreting the results, andapplying the scientic evidence.

Introduction Recent removal of feral donkeys from public land has increased concerns for disease transmission toother equids. The relocation process to new envi-ronments and introduction to other equids maycause outbreaks. The objective of this study was todetermine the frequency of respiratory pathogensand measure inflammatory blood biomarkers (se-rum amyloid A) in recently captured donkeys. 2. Materials and Methods Whole blood and nasal secretion samples were col-lected from 85 donkeys (Death Valley NationalPark); 24 were retested after 60 days in a long-termholding facility that were commingled with donkeysfrom multiple locations. Whole blood was tested forserum amyloid A (SAA) on site with a commerciallyavailable kit (StableLab, Sligo, Ireland). Quantita-tive Positive correlations were found for pathogen DNA and SAA, age, and body condition score. SAA levelwas correlated with age, with foals having a higherSAA, but not with body condition score, presence of nasal discharge, or behavior. Seventy donkeys were positive for asinine herpesviruses and Strepto- coccus zooepidemicus . 4. Discussion Additional research is needed to provide more infor- mation on domestic management systems and valueof SAA in gauging the health of donkeys.

Materials and Methods Fecal samples from 12 foals that received Re-HIP,and from 9 foals that did not, were collected beforeand on weeks 2, 3, 5, and 7 after infection withvirulent R. equi . Quantitative PCR (qPCR) for vapA , a gene present only in pathogenic strains of R. equi, was performed in all feces. 3. Results Eleven (10.8%) post-infection fecal samples were qPCR positive for vapA. There was an association between Re-HIP treatment and a decrease in fecalshedding of virulent R. equi (P/H11005.031). Foals in the control group shed signicantly more equi (cfu/mL) than foals that received Re-HIP ( P/H11005.008). All foals that developed pneumonia in the control group shed virulent R. equi in their feces while none of the foals that received HIP developedpneumonia. 4. Discussion A reduction was observed in fecal shedding of R. equi after Re-HIP administration. While this may be a potential benet, this study was not designed toevaluate the effects of the environmental virulent R. equi reduction on subsequent foal crops.

McCracken, DVM Thoracic ultrasound screening program incorporating white blood cell (WBC) and/or serum amyloid A (SAA) in conjunction with grade and use of grade size alone (initial and maximum) may reduceovertreatment of subclinical animals without signicantly increasing the risk of clinical R. equi pneumonia. Author's address: Hagyard Equine is an impor- tant disease in the equine industry. Clinical casesoften have devastating results, due to the severity ofdisease and corresponding economic impact of pro-longed treatment, management changes and possi-ble loss of life. Foals are infected within the rstfew days or weeks of life. 1,2The organism is fairly ubiquitous and disease progression is insidious,with clinical respiratory disease appearing typicallybetween 4 weeks and 3 months. 3R. equi pneumo- nia is hallmarked by pyogranulomatous lung lesions, and clinically manifests with marked eleva-tion of body temperature, coughing, and/or in-creased respiratory rate and effort. Signicantelevations in white blood cell (WBC) count and -brinogen level are typical laboratory ndings withclinical disease. Identifying a way to detect and address R. equi pneumonia prior to clinical disease has been thefocus of much research. Laboratory testing hasproven to be unrewarding when used alone as anearly detection method. It has been shown that use of agar of R. equi pneumonia. 4,5 PCR to identify the presence of virulent R. equi in feces is quite sensitive and specic in clinically illfoals, 6but its use in predicting subclinical or even- tual clinical animals has proved unrewarding.7 The use of WBC counts has been shown to be morebenecial than brinogen concentrations in earlydetection of clinical R. equi pneumonia, 5however, lacks specicity. An elevated WBC alone is usefulonly as an indicator for further investigation intothe source of inflammation. While WBCs seem tobe more helpful than brinogen, serial brinogenlevels may be more helpful than serum amyloid A(SAA) levels. 8A study showed serial brinogen rises in relation to foal age may predict subclinicalR. equi , but again lacks specicity and has not been applied to development of clinical disease. SAA hasbeen inadequate as a predictive tool, 8,9and in fact one study showed SAA was negative in 28% of clin-ical R. equi pneumonia cases. 9 522 2019 PROCEEDINGSEQUINE MEDICINE: FROM ASCARIDS ultrasound to identify subclin- ical R. equi pulmonary infection with subsequent various antibiotic therapies has been honed into avery successful screening method to prevent clinicalRhodococcus pneumonia. 3,10This program has greatly reduced incidence of clinical cases of R. equi pneumonia and has accordingly become widespreadpractice. However, endemic properties may have astaggering prevalence of subclinical infection (pres-ence of ultrasonographic lung lesions withoutclinical signs of illness) within their foal crop. 3,10 Although many juvenile animals develop subclinicaldisease, a much smaller percentage actually devel-ops clinical respiratory disease. Recent studieshave conrmed that the majority (79% 11and 88%12) of subclinical individuals resolve lesions without any signs of clinical disease. The reason that somefoals (Regressors) are able to resolve these lesionswithout ever becoming ill, while others (Progressors)eventually develop clinical disease eludes veterinar-ians at this time. Unfortunately, which category asubclinical foal will eventually fall into is also cur-rently unable to be predicted. The inability to foresee the outcome of a foal with subclinical thoracic lesions has commonly resultedin treatment of all or the majority of subclinicalanimals. This use of antimicrobials not only re-sults in a high percentage of foals receiving antibi-otics that have potential detrimental side effects,but may also be contributing to the development ofantibiotic resistant strains of R. equi . There has been one published report of a macrolide-resistantstrain documented on a farm that had been screen-ing and treating for 7 years. 13Laboratory data indicates that resistance to one macrolide infers re- sistance to all. With resistant strains clearly ap-pearing, it has become imperative to be able todetermine which foals are Regressors versus Pro-gressors. The questionable benet of treating sucha high percentage of foals is further compounded bya study which indicated that the length of time fromlesion discovery to resolution is not shortened byantimicrobial treatment. 14 Advancement of thoracic screening programs is needed, specically a way to predict the outcome ofsubclinical animals in a manner applicable for eldpractitioners. Establishing a system to more accu-rately identify animals at risk of clinical diseasewould greatly reduce overtreatment, allowing con-tinued disease prevention while curbing practicesleading to antimicrobial resistance. The incorpora-tion of laboratory testing into thoracic ultrasoundscreening may potentially rene the system. Theability of WBCs, SAA, and brinogen in conjunctionwith thoracic ultrasound to predict subclinical caseoutcome was investigated. 2. Materials and Methods Ninety-six Thoroughbred foals on an endemicR. equi farm in central Kentucky were enrolled in the study in spring 2016. The property had utilizedthoracic screening as a preventative practice since 2004. In 2004 and 2005, transtracheal aspirateswere performed on the rst ve individuals identi-ed with subclinical lesions. Cultures of the aspi-rates conrmed R. equi as the causative agent. From 2006 to date foals were considered to havesubclinical R. equi if lesions typical of R. equi were identied on thoracic scan at the appropriate age. Thoracic Ultrasounds Foals were scanned on a schedule of 4, 6, and 8weeks of age. Once thoracic ultrasound lesionswere identied, foals began weekly evaluations untillesion(s) resolution. Measurements (x- and y-axis)and location were recorded for every lesion visual-ized, and each lesion was assigned a grade followingthe Slovis grading system 10based on its largest di - ameter. Foals were then assigned a grade for thatpoint in time corresponding to the single largestgrade of lesion present. Foals were not treatedwith antibiotics unless clinical evidence of respira-tory disease was noted or exclusion criteria weremet. Each animal was categorized retrospectivelyas a Progressor, Regressor, or Excluded. For eachfoal, data was sorted by grade assigned at the initialpositive scan, maximum grade attained, and even-tual classication of the foal. Blood Sampling/Testing Blood was collected from the jugular vein of everyfoal immediately following every scan that visual-ized a lesion. Samples were run on the day of theexam for WBC count and brinogen levels. Serumfor SAA levels was frozen and banked until thecompletion of the study. Each blood sample wascategorized by the grade assigned to the foal at thetime of collection. Samples were also classied bythe category to which the foal was retrospectivelyassigned. No blood samples were included on anyfoals after removal from the study; accordingly, noresults reflect the influence of any antimicrobialtherapy. Rectal Temperature Once identied as subclinical, rectal temperatureswere recorded twice daily for each foal. Clinical Disease Criteria The presence of fever /H11022102.5\u00b0F, signicant cough- ing, and/or increased respiratory effort was consid-ered evidence of clinical R. equi pneumonia. For all foals thus classied, full physical examinations wereperformed to ensure that the symptoms were cor-rectly associated with R. equi pneumonia rather than other maladies of young foals. Once identiedas clinical, foals were removed from the study andstarted on medical therapy. Exclusion Criteria The exclusion criteria consisted of a lesion /H113505.0 cm diameter (grade mg/dL. If a foal met any one or more of these parameters, it was removed from thestudy and medical therapy initiated. Any foal thatwas found to have other sources of inflammation atthe time of blood sampling was also removed fromthe study. Inclusion Criteria The inclusion criteria consisted of a lack of clinicalevidence of respiratory disease, positive ultrasoundscans with a lesion(s) /H110215 cm diameter (grade /H9262L, and/or brinogen /H11021 800 mg/dL. Statistical Analysis Data were organized and analyzed in a manner thatwould be of practical use when implementing ascreening program in practice. In order to deter-mine the ability of WBCs, SAA and brinogen inconjunction with thoracic ultrasound to predict sub-clinical case outcome, correlations of lesion gradesizes and laboratory results (WBCs, SAA, and brin-ogen) and correlations of clinical outcome (Progres-sor versus Regressor) and laboratory results (WBCs,SAA and brinogen) were analyzed using single-factor ANOVAs. Fisher's Exact test was used tocompare likelihood of clinical disease developmentbetween groupings of ultrasound grades. Descrip-tive statistics were used to evaluate each laboratorytest at different grade cutoffs to establish a grade /H11001 lab result level (WBCs, SAA, and brinogen), whichwould allow practitioners to better differentiate be-tween Regressors and Progressors. 3. Results Of the 96 foals in the study, 54 foals were identiedas having subclinical lesions by thoracic ultrasoundexamination. Twelve individuals met exclusioncriteria and were not included in data analysis.The foals that were excluded from the study wereremoved for elevated WBCs (6 foals), lesion /H113505.0 cm diameter (3 foals), both elevated WBC and largelesions at the same exam (1 foal), and extenuatingcircumstances (2 foals). No foals were removed dueto elevated brinogen levels. The remaining 42foals were evaluated weekly until clinical disease developed (7 Progressors) or lesions resolved (35Regressors). The percentage of spontaneous reso-lution in this study was 83% (35/42). Clinical dis-ease was rst noted in the Progressors at grade 5 (4foals), grade 4 (1 foal), grade 3 (1 foal) and grade 2 (1foal). All Progressors developed clinical diseasewithin seven days of initial identication of subclin-ical disease. Data collected from excluded animalswas not analyzed, therefore it is important to notethat no information regarding grade 6 or higher iscontained in the following results. Correlation of WBC, Fibrinogen, and SAA to Ultrasound Grade and Foal Category Statistically signicant variation existed in WBC counts and SAA levels between Progressors and Re-gressors, but not brinogen levels. Statistical dif-ferences between Progressors and Regressors withineach grade were also looked at with single-factorANOVAs and did not prove signicant for any of thethree laboratory tests at any grades except SAA atgrade 5 and SAA at grade 2 (Table 1). There was acorrelation with grade for all three laboratory tests(WBC, SAA, and brinogen) (Table 2). Use of Ultrasound Alone to Predict Outcome of Subclinical Animals The initial grade assigned each foal was evaluated for likelihood of clinical disease development com-pared with smaller initial grades. In this study,foals with an initial grade 5 were more likely todevelop clinical disease than foals with initialgrades less than 5. There was no statistical differ-ence in likelihood of progression to clinical diseasebetween foals with initial grades 4 /H110015 compared with foals of lesser initial grades (Fig. 1). Similaranalysis was performed on the maximum grade at-tained for each foal. Individuals that reached agrade 5 were more likely to develop clinical diseasethan foals that did not develop lesions of that mag-nitude, while no statistical difference existed using asmaller grade cutoff (Fig. 2). In this study, early identication of clinical dis- ease by thoracic ultrasound alone had perfect sensi-Table 1.

Using the merepresence of a thoracic lesion (all grades other thangrade 0) to predict the outcome of subclinical ani-mals had the same perfect sensitivity and very poorPPV but totally lacked specicity (0%) (Table 3). A cutoff of grade 5 (both as initial grade and max- imum grade) yielded marked improvement over gen-eral ultrasound identication in specicity and PPV;however, there was a huge decrease in sensitivity forpredicting the development of clinical disease. Byusing a smaller grade as a cutoff (grades 4 /H110015) sen- sitivity was mildly improved to the detriment ofspecicity and PPV (Table 3). Use of Laboratory Results in Conjunction with Ultrasound Grade to Predict Outcome of Subclinical Animals When evaluated across all ultrasound grades, eleva- tion in WBC count was unable to provide perfectsensitivity but did improve PPV compared with ul-trasound alone. At a level of 13.5 K/ /H9262L or higher (normal, 5.0-12.0 K/ /H9262L), WBCs across all grades delivered a fair sensitivity and a mildly improvedPPV. Mild elevation in WBCs when a foal was a grade 3 or higher (grades 3 /H110014/H110015) at the time of sampling would have been a successful predictor ofclinical outcome in this study (Fig. 3). A WBC cut-off of 13.5 K/ /H9262L provided perfect sensitivity and an improved, but still fairly poor, PPV. Raising thecutoff value to 14.0 K/ /H9262L sacriced marginal improvement in PPV. Limiting WBCsampling to foals with grades 4 /H110015 had similar sen- sitivity at the same limits and signicant improve-ment of PPV (Table 3). Similar to the predictive capability of WBC counts in this study, mild elevation in SAA level ( /H1135075 /H9262g/ mL; normal, /H110213/H9262g/mL) across all ultrasound grades was also unable to provide perfect sensitivity but didyield a stronger PPV than with that of ultrasoundalone. In the study population, correct predictionof the clinical outcome of subclinical animals waspossible using the same SAA level when the ultra-sound grade wa sa4o r higher (grades 4 /H110015) (Fig. 4). A strong PPV was also evident with this combina-tion. Extending the range to include foals withTable 2.

ASCARIDS TO ZEBRASgrade 3 was unable to maintain perfect sensitivity but still had a solid PPV (Table 3). The combination of all ultrasound grades with elevated brinogen levels (normal, 200-500 mg/dL) was extremely poor at predicting the progres-sion to clinical disease (Fig. 5) with an extremelylow sensitivity and a low PPV. Even when lim-ited to just grade-5 animals, elevated brinogen(/H11350600 mg/dL) generated very poor sensitivity (Ta- ble 3). 4. Discussion Use of thoracic screening with treatment of all oralmost all lesions has greatly reduced clinicalR. equi pneumonia; however, has resulted in signif- icant overtreatment.

Clients and veterinarians most likely initiate R. equi prevention programs largely in response to signicant clinical disease experienced historically.This may have been due to high morbidity rates andassociated length of treatments, managementchanges, and intensity of labor involved with clinicalcases in a previous year or it may have involved oneor more signicant (economic and/or emotional)mortality.

Althoughclients may not be enamored with the expense of thescreening, costs and side-effects of antibiotic ther-apy, management changes due to treatment proto-cols and ethical repercussion of overtreating, manyare justiably reluctant to make program changesthat could increase the risk of clinical disease.After reaching a satisfactory level of clinical diseaseon an endemic property, it is also difcult for veter-inarians to recommend changes to an establishedscreening program that may increase the risk toindividuals. The goal of this study was to expand the approach of screening programs to improve veterinarians'ability to predict which individuals would developclinical R. equi pneumonia. The rate of spontane- ous resolution in this study and those previouslypublished are very similar. 11,12These values cor - relate with the PPV of ultrasound (all grades).Practical interpretation of the PPV is the percentageof those being identied that would have becomeclinically ill. The PPV of ultrasound (all grades) is17% in this study. A higher PPV would result intreatment of fewer Regressors. While an improvement in PPV is much desired for screening programs, it should not be accepted at asignicant loss of sensitivity. In the study popula-tion, thoracic ultrasound correctly identied allseven individuals that progressed to clinical disease.Sensitivity of thoracic ultrasound (all grades) is thepercentage of animals that were going to developclinical disease that were identied, 100% in thisstudy. In fact, thoracic ultrasound (all grades) hada perfect sensitivity for each of the previous 12 yearson the study property.In this study, the PPV generated by using blood- work (WBC, SAA, or brinogen) with all thoracicultrasound lesions (all grades) was an improvementover that of ultrasound alone (Table 3); however,sensitivities correlating to each lab test in conjunc-tion with all grades were less than perfect. Whilebrinogen did not prove to be helpful at all in theprediction of progression to clinical disease, WBCand SAA appear to be of substantial assistance es-pecially when applied to higher grade foals. Sensi-tivity of 100% was able to be achieved when WBCand SAA were evaluated at the point of larger tho-racic grades. The combination of WBC with grades3/H110014/H110015 and SAA with grades 4 /H110015 both were able to maintain 100% sensitivity while improving PPVover that of ultrasound (all grades). Although theimprovements in PPV compared to ultrasound alonewere not extreme, they are nonetheless signicant.Decreasing unnecessary treatment by even a fewanimals would be benecial. In this study, usinghigher cutoff values for the laboratory results didimprove the PPVs even more; however, doing sosacriced the perfect sensitivity (Table 3). Comparing the descriptive values of WBCs and SAA in this study, perfect sensitivity was able to beachieved for a larger population of foals (grades3/H110014/H110015) when using WBCs with ultrasound than with SAA and ultrasound (grades 4 /H110015). Although SAA had a stronger PPV at grades 4 /H110015 than that of WBC at the same grades, the ability to successfullyapply WBC cutoffs to more foals at an additionalgrade is signicant in practice. Ideally, a lab test would have been identied that could have been used reliably at all grade levels.In addition to evaluating the lab values of Progres-sors versus Regressors in light of a grade cutoff, all Fig. 5.

A loosevariance between WBCs of Progressors and Regres-sors was evident for all but grade 2. Only threesamples for Progressors were taken at grade 2.One result (WBC, 13.7 K/ /H9262L) was the initial sample from a foal whose lesion grew in size in a week.The foal became clinical after the second exam, atwhich point its WBC was 16.4 K/ /H9262L while a grade 3. Both blood results would be predictive using the13.5-K/ /H9262L cutoff. The other two grade-2 Progres- sor samples were from the single foal that becameclinical while only a grade 2. This foal had a WBCcount of 12.4 K/ /H9262L at the initial grade 2 and subse- quently 11.0 K/ /H9262L at the time of fever (103.4\u00b0F) 2 days later. All the other six Progressors had a risein WBC count at the point of fever, suggesting thatthis individual may have been an incorrect inclusionas clinical R. equi pneumonia. Removing this ani- mal from the study, the use of a WBC count cutoff of13.5 K/ /H9262L would have yielded a perfect sensitivity across all grades. Although initial and maximum grade had poor sensitivity for determining the likelihood for clinicaldisease, they had comparably powerful PPVs, espe-cially initial grade 5. In the study, the exclusioncriteria included presence of a grade 6 lesion orlarger. Accordingly, no inference can be madeabout the behavior of subclinical lesions of thismagnitude. However, some practitioners may beswayed by the likelihood of a grade 5 lesion becom-ing clinical being signicantly more than that oflesser grades. Perhaps renement of a screeningprogram could include grade 5 /H11001as a parameter for treatment, which would lower the PPV of the pro-gram but perhaps improve comfort level for clientsaccustomed to treating all lesions. Seven animals developed clinical disease during the course of this study. All seven cases respondedvery quickly to antimicrobial treatment such thatfevers were limited to three or fewer days for eachindividual. No foals required hospitalization, cli-mate control, or supportive oxygen therapy. Al-though all the clinical cases in this study would beconsidered mild examples of R. equi pneumonia, the small sample size begs caution in making a broadassumption minimizing the potential seriousness ofpostponing treatment of a subclinical animal. De-laying treatment onset could well result inextremely severe respiratory disease requiring in-tensive care and may result in patient death. If an established thoracic screening program were to incorporate WBCs and/or SAAs to decrease treat-ment of subclinical animals, it would be vital forveterinarians and clients to fully discuss and agreeon the potential trade of sensitivity strength forimproved PPV. It is up to the discretion of all thoseinvolved to decide what cutoff levels would provideenough condence in risk of disease developmentbalanced with the desire to treat more discrimi-nately. If circumstances dictate, comfort level maybe evaluated and limits set for each individual ani- mal rather than for the foal crop as a whole, basedon the economic and emotional value of particularanimals. Other properties may decide to take morerisk and raise treatment criteria levels or laboratorycutoff levels. It is also of vital importance that labvariation be taken into account when establishing acutoff level for a particular property. The valuesand statistical numbers produced by this study arethe result of one property, one season, and one lab-oratory. Results will vary across laboratories andcutoff levels for other labs cannot be accurately in-ferred or extrapolated from this study. Although the subclinical incidence and grade breakdown of the study population was similar tothat of the property over each of the past 12 years, 1year of data does not have extreme strength. It ishoped that cautious adoption of the union of WBCand SAA with ultrasound grade will be benecial tothoracic screening programs already established.It is also hoped that practitioners will continue toadvance this method of renement and share resultsfor further improvement of the prevention of clinicalR. equi pneumonia.

Introduction You have decided to grow your team (for the rst time or again) and the thought feels overwhelming.Where do you begin? The foundation is determin-ing the duties and skills you will hire for and deter-mining what to delegate to your team members andwhat to keep (as the owner or veterinarian of yourpractice). Letting go of tasks you will delegate ishalf the battle. 2. Learning Objectives Learn the benets of delegating for personal sanity, protability, and wellbeing. Outline duties to delegate and tasks to keep on your plate as the veterinarian or practiceowner. 3. Duties to Keep As a veterinarian, Think of what you are trained todo that no other team members are formally trainedto do? All other duties and tasks can be delegated to other team members. Empower them to take onevery task not related to diagnosing, prescribing,creating a treatment plan, and surgery.Review the duties and tasks of veterinary practice managers. As a practice owner, think of what duties and tasks are you wanting to hold on to? You may choose to have oversight in Checks-n- Balances of the Finances, which is highly encour-aged. Dening the Vision and Culture of yourpractice is on your shoulders. You may choose to be a part of the Controlled Substance tallying (it is yourDEA license on the line). All other duties and taskscan be delegated to a trusted, empowered, andtrained practice manager. 4. Team Tasks and Duties Formally trained team members may have gradu-ated from a university with a Doctorate in Veteri-nary Medicine (DVM), an Associates in AppliedScience (AAA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), or a cer-ticate as an Approved Veterinary Assistant (AVA).Team members may have a Masters in BusinessAdministration (MBA) or be a Certication in Vet-erinary Practice Manager (CVPM). The varying degrees of passion and focus within a veterinary hospital all bring valuable knowledgeand expertise to the veterinary team. Now is thetime to embrace and respect each individual in theveterinary practice and the unique knowledge and AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 531THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: HIRING PROFESSIONALS FOR YOUR PRACTICE NOTESexperience they bring. Properly leveraging all team members for their expertise and experience isimportant in achieving team satisfaction, patientcare, and protability. Team members who have graduated from an ac- credited veterinary technology program, passed theVeterinary Technician National Exam (VTNE),maintain their credentials in the state they practicein by fullling requirements, and pay their creden-tialing dues are considered Licensed, Registered, orCertied. These team members are eager to assisttheir veterinarians and to be leveraged to their high-est potential. By empowering the entire veterinary team to take an active role in completing tasks withintheir scope of practice, the efcacy of the entireveterinary healthcare team improves and goalsare broadened. The greatest asset veterinarians can control is how they use their time. In any given day, when aveterinarian can solely focus on patient care, clientservice, and the tasks he or she is trained to do,greater productivity and protability follow. There-fore, developing teams in veterinary medicinearound shared goals, shared knowledge, mutual re-spect, and effective communication is important tothe productivity and, in turn, the protability of aveterinary practice. The AVMA states, \"The veterinary profession is enhanced through efcient utilization of eachmember of the veterinary health care team byappropriate delegation of tasks and responsibili-ties to support staff\" (AVMA policy on veterinarytechnology). When veterinarians leverage their teams, they will see more patients and serve more clients, di-rectly impacting productivity and protability.In support of the protability that a veterinarypractice can achieve by leveraging members of aveterinary practice, a survey conducted in 2008found that for every credentialed veterinary tech-nician a practice employed, the practice generated$161,493 more in gross revenue. aThe study at - tributed the increase in revenue to the freeing upof the veterinarian's time by allowing qualiedtechnicians to complete tasks veterinarians tradi-tionally oversaw. 5. Benets of Delegating and Empowering There is more to delegating than meets the eye.There is a large amount of leadership, trust, train-ing, and empowering of team members involved.You may have worn so many hats for such a longtime that it may be challenging and feel as if you arelosing control when you begin divvying up responsi-bilities to your qualied team. The benets in delegating and empowering far outweigh the drawbacks. 1. Personal sanity is dened as the condition of being based on reason or good judgment orhaving a healthy mind. No longer juggling all the tasks of your business or wearing allthe hats, you are focusing on the tasks youare trained to do as a veterinarian. 2. Protability can be measured by your time spent doing \"Doctor Duties\" instead of man-ager duties. Economists use the term \"Op-portunity Costs\" when the veterinarian isnot generating revenue because he/she isspending the time managing the prac-tice. One study, performed by Dr. Neal Was-serman along with the NCVEI (2008-mostrecent data in my research), showed veteri-nary practice owners essentially lose $122 ofgross revenue for every managerial hourspent. Conversely, clinics see an additional$119 for every hour a practice manager works.Another survey completed by the Ontario Vet-erinary Medical Association reported smallanimal hospitals with a practice manager gen-erate 13% more than a hospital without apractice manager. 3. Wellbeing may be a goal of yours. It may be dened as going home with the ability to focuson yourself and your family. It may be denedas the ability to carve out time to exercise in amindful way, knowing your business is runningsmoothly. For many veterinary professionals,wellbeing is living with less stress. Throughappropriate delegation, these concepts in well-being may be achieved. What other benets can you identify supporting you in your career when choosing to delegate andempower your team? 6. Letting Go Beyond the aforementioned benets of letting go, itcan still be a challenge and even scary. You mayfeel anxiety and trepidation in letting go. You arethe veterinarian and it is your license on the line.However, there are valuable, highly skilled parapro-fessionals that are eager to support you in yoursuccess. \"I am a perfectionist. N obody will do it as good as I can\" are sentiments frequently heard andare hindering your chances to have a fullling,protable, and sustainable life (personally andprofessionally). In the article, Choose Progress over Perfection , you may nd a sentence or two that resonates with you.Instead of striving for perfection, aim to do your bestin each moment, for you and the expectation for yourteam. One veterinarian said he burned throughveterinary team members like they were going out ofstyle, mainly due to placing unhealthy attitudes ofperfectionism onto them. Once he experienced aparadigm shift in letting go of this unrealistic expec-tation, he began forming stronger, more satisfyingworking relationships with his team, resulting inbetter retention rates. 532 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: HIRING PROFESSIONALS FOR YOUR PRACTICEAcknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Vet- erinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction You have decided to take the leap and hire your rst (or more) paraprofessionals for your practice. Nowit is time to design the job descriptions, which arefoundational to team success, and outline the hiringprocess to include pre-employment backgroundchecks, series of interview questions, and an out-standing job announcement. Consider the Dos andDon'ts in hiring. 2. Job Description Veterinary team job descriptions are \"living docu-ments,\" growing and changing as employees developtheir careers. A one-size job description does not tall. A new veterinary technician's duties are differ-ent than that of a seasoned veterinary technician.The same goes for receptionists and veterinarians.Once employees have a couple of years under theirbelts, their passions and professional goals will bedened and reflected in their performance reviewsand upgraded job descriptions. This document isupdated to accurately reflect their passions, educa-tion, advanced skill sets, and dedication to clientservice. You may be asking, \"What about the new hire that is brought on as a general hire?\" If you truly arehiring someone for entry level skills, then yes, ageneric entry level job description will suf-ce. However, if you are looking to hire a creden- tialed veterinary technician with years of experienceand an interest in equine medicine, then the job description will reflect those skills, level of achieve-ment, and varied responsibilities. The compensa-tion would also reflect that experience and focus. Job descriptions are valuable tools for hiring, performance reviews, establishing expectations ofthe job, and documentation. If a job description isno longer relevant, reinvent it. Consider anotherconcept and have levels of competency. You may already have job descriptions for your employees. When were they last updated? Think about your team's job descriptions and ask each of them to recreate them, relevant to the du-ties they actually perform. Chances are you willnd gaps and overlap in tasks and duties. You maywant to add responsibilities to ll in the gaps anddistribute duties for less duplication. Download the following team exercise to help cre- ate job descriptions: A Day in the Life Exercise(https://catalystvetpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/A-day-in-the-life-exercise.pdf). Some practices may not have job descriptions, so links to a few resources that can help you in creatingjob descriptions are below. Again, team members(including veterinarians) should write out their jobduties and create job descriptions that are a true AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 65 /H114082019 535THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: HIRING PROFESSIONALS FOR YOUR PRACTICE NOTESreflection of where their time is spent, what they are passionate about, and the education they have(either formally, through CE, credentialing, orcertication-CVPM as an example). You will nd a complete list, by state, of veteri- nary technician duties and tasks on the AVMA'swebsite (https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/scope-vet- assistant-duties.aspx and https://www.avma.org/ Advocacy/StateAndLocal/ Documents/scope_vet_assistant_duties.pdf). Job descriptions for receptionist, inventory manager, and practice manager can be found onDVM360 (http://veterinaryteam.dvm360.com/sample-veterinary-team-job-descriptions). Job description for an equine veterinary techni- cian may be found on BalanceCareers (https://www.thebalancecareers.com/equine-veterinary-technician-125797). Academy of Equine Veterinary Nursing Techni- cians has 23 active members at time of print(http://www.aevnt.org/members). 3. Outline Hiring Process Before your job post goes live, completely outlineyour hiring process. This will help the person over-seeing the procedure stay on task and sets yourpractice up for success by being consistent amongcandidates and avoiding discrimination. The hiring process includes the following: Job description Salary or hourly wage/benets package/sign- ing bonus Job announcement to include background and drug screening Solid criteria in reviewing cover letter and re- sume for desired qualications Thanks and no thanks correspondence Email questions Telephone interview questions and request for a video/test In-person interview questions Letter of Employment 4. Pre-Employment Background Checks Consider that your client assumes you have vetted your team members for credentials (veterinarian,credentialed veterinary technician, driver's license,and insurance for courier service, etc.), but haveyou? Your clients are opening their barns or maybe their homes to a complete stranger\u2014your veterinaryteam member. They assume your team membersare free of felonies or other precarious traits. Here are some other questions to consider when hiring team members. Do they have embezzlementcharges in their past? Does it matter if they havegood credit or not? How is their driving record?Are they appropriately credentialed and current as aveterinarian, veterinary technician, or veterinaryassistant?The following are some benets for performing a pre-employment screening from the AVMA:Safety Bulletin: http://avmaplit.com/uploadedFiles/ AVMAPLIT/Publications/Safety_and_Loss_ Control/Safety%20Bulletin%20Spring%202011.pdf. 1. Discourage applicants with something to hide, e.g., felony arrests, DUIs, revokedlicenses. 2. Reduce liability by demonstrating due dili- gence via the consistency of performing back-ground checks on ALL applicants. 3. Avoid violence in the workplace\u2014keep in mind the statistics show drug users arrivefor work with their problems in tow. 4. Reduces costs associated with bad hiring be- cause you will be decreasing your chances ofhiring somebody with a drug problem or ad-diction or history of theft. 5. Get the right person for the job\u2014In fewer attempts! 5. Interview Questions Designing interview questions is another aspect of thehiring process in which wheels have already been cre-ated. Choose interview questions formulated speci-cally for veterinary team members. Then, design aseries of questions specic for the position you arehiring. Always introduce the same questions at thesame time during the interview process. The following are several resources and example questions to consider. 20 Interview questions for veterinary technologists and assistants: https://www.interviewstrategies.com/interview-questions-for-veterinary-technologists/. How do you relieve stress? What is the biggest mistake you have made? What did you learn from it? Tell me about your ability to work safely around horses. Interview questions for veterinary practice man- agers: https://interviewquestions247.com/2013/11/veterinary-practice-m anager-interview-questions- answers.html. How do you support your team members in personal and professional growth? What is your management style? How do you deal with clients with overdue payments? Interview questions for veterinarians: https://www. workitdaily.com/interview-questions-veterinarians/. What is the vision for your career in equine medicine? How do you leverage your paraprofessionals to reach your highest potential? 536 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: HIRING PROFESSIONALS FOR YOUR PRACTICEWhen delivering a poor diagnosis to a client, how do you do that? 30 Behavioral interview questions to identify high potential candidates: https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/cx/2017/PDFs/linkedininterviewebook10-11-17.pdf. Give an example of when you had to work with someone who was difcult to get alongwith. How did you handle interactions withthat person? What's the biggest career goal you've ever achieved? 6. Job Announcement Finally, you are ready to post your job announce-ment. Who knew so much preparation had to gointo the hiring of a veterinary team member? Keep in mind, we are currently in a job seeker's market. Remain open-minded to your options andpostings. Once your job description is completed,then you can create a job announcement focusing onthe duties specic to your practice's needs. With-out the job description, you are shooting in the dark! Consider creating an outstanding job announce- ment. Predictable and boring is out! Long gone are the simple four sentence advertise- ments in your local newspaper. Now there isLinkedIn, Indeed, and other recruitment platforms.You may consider cheerful videos of the services youprovide, which is another reason why you need apractice manager. Stafng falls on the manager'sshoulders. Your job posting is your practice's rst impression. It should engage and motivate the candidate toapply and continue along the hiring process. Bestraightforward with job title, company introduc-tion, job description, and qualications. Use bulletpoints to minimize text and be sure to identify whoto contact. List the benets package as this alonemay make or break a job seeker. This will help set the applicant up for success. 7. Letter of Intent You have identied the best-qualied candidate forthe position. Now, you'll need to generate a letterof intent for employment or a contract (possibly for aveterinarian or relief/locum position) which will in-clude the following: Welcome At-will (if an employee, in most states) Salary or hourly wage When to begin Contingent upon completing pre-employment screeningAcknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Studies show when veterinary team members are utilized to their fullest potential, there is higher jobsatisfaction. When team members are being dele-gated responsibilities within their scope of practice,they feel empowered as contributing members of theteam. 2. Dene Job Satisfaction Veterinary medicine has morphed through theyears. Today, veterinarians are better positionedto embrace a team-based approach to delivering vet-erinary care than ever before. As such, a leveraged team offers the opportunity within a veterinary practice for staff to pursue evenhigher potentials in career development, engage-ment, and job satisfaction than in the past. Many team members have spent years attending various programs to acquire appropriate skills andaptitudes to enhance their contribution to a veteri-nary team. Dedicated, committed, and knowledge-able individuals will experience greater reward intheir careers when all of their skills are utilized. A recent study of veterinary teams found a posi- tive association between individual engagement(i.e., feeling recognized, appreciated, capable of per-forming as an integral team member, and encour-aged to further develop skills and knowledge) andveterinary staff job satisfaction. 1Further, in a fo-cus group study involving credentialed veterinary technicians, participants expressed frustration attimes when their education, knowledge, and skillswere not utilized. Being delegated responsibilitieswithin their scope of practice left them feeling em-powered as contributing members of the team. 2 It seems reasonable, within a highly coordinated, highly functional veterinary team, that when veter-inarians focus on the duties they are trained toperform (diagnose, prescribe, treatment planning,and surgery), other tasks can be delegated to teammembers with the appropriate levels of educationand skill. This coordinated care within a veteri-nary team with shared goals, shared knowledge,mutual respect, and effective communication willallow the veterinary practice to flourish and thriveon team satisfaction, quality patient care, and over-all practice protability. Benets of a satised team are below: An enjoyable work environment (i.e., FUN!) A team that is mentally and physically healthy Reduced absenteeism High staff retention Positive outcomes for clients and patients 3. Scope of Practice\u2014Team-Delivered Veterinary Care What does it mean to offer team-delivered veteri- nary care? It means all team members seek to 540 2019 /H11408Vol. 65 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: HIRING PROFESSIONALS FOR YOUR PRACTICE NOTESunderstand the needs of the clients and their pet(s), then fulll that need, together. It means a teamthat is trained, trusted and empowered to work to-gether in a systematic manner, offering extraordi-nary client experience and the highest standard ofveterinary care. It means the client and patientare receiving the best possible care from an efcientteam. 4 The AVMA's Duties and Task List is a great re- source to have: AVMA's Duties and Task List: https://www. avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Documents/scope_vet_assistant_duties.pdf. Denitions of Direct and Indirect Supervision (may vary by state) further dene the delegation ofduties. The following denitions are from the AVMA Model Practice Act (MPA 2017: https://www. avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Model-Veterinary-Practice-Act.aspx#denitions). Direct Supervision A licensed veterinarian is readily available on thepremises where the patient is being treated and hasassumed responsibility for the veterinary care givento the patient by a person working under his or herdirection. Indirect Supervision A licensed veterinarian need not be on the premises;has given either written or oral instructions fortreatment of the patient; is readily available by tele-phone or other forms of immediate communication;and has assumed responsibility for the veterinarycare given to the patient by a person working underhis or her direction.At the Baneld Summit in P ortland in Septem- ber 2018, team utilization was a hot topic. Dan-iel Aja, DVM, senior vice president and chiefmedical ofcer for Baneld Pet Hospital, sug-gested veterinarians are getting in the way ofveterinary technicians not being utilized. Duringthe summit, Veterinary Nurse Initiative rolled outthe chart seen in Fig. 1. 4 Team utilization and leveraging is not a new con- cept, yet managers and veterinarians may not haveknowledge of the training veterinary techniciansand assistants received from colleges. Keeping thesimple formula outlined above, veterinarians diag-nose, prescribe, design treatment plans, and performsurgery. Credentialed veterinary technicians, assis-tants, receptionists, and managers perform all theother tasks in delivering team-centered veterinarycare.
