Her reading led her to the work researchers at Rush University in Chicago have been doing with elderly residents via the MIND diet, the first eating plan that focuses on foods that specifically support and improve cognitive health. Created to slow the loss of brain function that happens with age, the MIND diet combines two diets considered to be super-good for the heart: the mostly plant-based Mediterranean diet, and the low-sodiumDASH diet, developed in the 1990s by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to prevent and treat high blood pressure. Both build meals around fruits, vegetables and whole grains, with varying amounts of lean meats, fish, sweets and healthy fats allowed per day or week. The MIND diet takes it a step further by encouraging regular consumption of 10 types of \"brain healthy\" foods \u2014 berries, leafy greens, other vegetables, nuts, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and red wine \u2014 and limiting foods in five groups including red meats, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fried or fast food, because they are high in saturated fat and trans fat and known to increase cholesterol. When people age, Ali writes, plaque builds up on the brain, causing the communication system to short-circuit and interfere with the brain's messages to By Gretchen McKay Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Laura Ali has helped countless clients fine-tune their diets to promote healthy eating habits in her three decades as a registered dietitian and culinary nutritionist, 16 of them in a clinical setting at the Cancer Institute at UPMC, now Hillman Cancer Institute. Good nutrition is a cornerstone of good health, with study after study showing that adults who eat an adequate, well-balanced diet not only live longer, but also lower their risk of heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. Yet it was Ali's own genetics that got her thinking about the new eating plan known as the MIND diet, which is meant to support memory. She was so struck by its proposed benefits that during the pandemic, she wrote a cookbook with 65 simple recipes based on its recommendations. Published in March, it's called \"Mind Diet for Two\" (Rockridge Press, $14.99). Both Ali and her husband have a family history of Alzheimer's disease and have watched close relatives suffer from dementia. So as she inched toward middle age, the Pittsburgh native grew increasingly intrigued by the role food plays in long-term cognitive health. Hoping to avoid the same fate, \"I wanted to learn more to see if there were Continued on page 4 GETTY IMAGES Tilapia fish tacos is one of the recipes you will find in the \"Mind Diet for Two\" cookbook by Laura Ali. !\"#$%&#'()*+%,-.#'/%0+-'%-#&$ .1%211$.%23-#'%\",-+.\" AgingWell !\"#$%#%&! the body. Substances called flavonoids, found in foods like fruits, vegetables, cocoa and wine, contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which protect the body's cells from damage and reduce inflammation. That's important because Alzheimer's patients tend to have brains that are inflamed, while people with hypertension and diabetes are at a great risk for stroke, which is a major factor for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. \"It's just a healthy way of eating,\"Ali says. Research suggests that the MIND diet lowered the risk of Alzheimer's by as much as 53% in participants who rigorously followed to the diet to a T, and by about 35% in those who adhered to it moderately well. But improvements start to weaken at about year 7. Ali says she knew the cookbook would probably strike a chord with home cooks because people today are so much more aware of what they should be eating, and the role that good nutrition can have in maintaining and improving health.While we still want the convenience of drivethrough, or eating quickly on the run or at our desks, \"there's true desire to eat better,\" she says. In deciding which foods to include, Ali \u2014 a lifelong Sunday, October 23, 2022 | Special Advertising Section 1 R 4 cook who has done culinary consulting for Giant Eagle, StarKist and Del Monte Foods \u2014 chose 65 recipes that use ingredients readily available in any grocery store. She also steered clear of recipes that required special equipment like an air fryer or Instant Pot because not everyone has one. \"I approached it as what [the average person] typically eats,\" she says \u2014 quick breakfasts, simple lunches and mains that can be made in 30 minutes or less. Many are gluten- or dairy-free, and all come with nutritional information, along with prep and cook times. She also includes a servings chart, kitchen tips and a seven-day sample menu to get you started. The cookbook is unique in that all the recipes serve just two instead of the standard four to six for a family. That's because by the time most people are worried about dementia, they are often cooking for two most of the time as empty nesters. \"At this point in life, people are often caring for elderly relatives that may have dementia and are seeing the real effects it has. I think they become worried about their own health as they age.\" With food waste a growing problem, people also don't want to have to throw away leftovers. \"But most can easily be doubled for four or more,\" she says. If you're someone who doesn't already eat a lot of fruits, grains, fish or leafy vegetables, it can take some time to adjust to the MIND diet \u2014 for your body as well as your palate. (The increased fiber can cause bloating, gas or constipation.) She suggests starting easy by sneaking some of the ingredients into your dishes \u2014 say, add some spinach or salmon to your scrambled eggs, serve a leafy salad with dinner, or stir vegetable into your pasta. Tougher still may be learning to limit favorites like cheese, butter and steak. But the daily glass of red wine you're allowed, she says with a laugh, makes up for it. \"It's a relatively easy way of Butternut squash risotto is the perfect comfort page 3 1 R Special Advertising Section | Sunday, October 23, 2022 | Special Advertising Section 1 R 6 For years off and on I tried to sit on a cushion and meditate on my breath, bringing in light and exhaling darkness for 30 minutes as I'd been taught in a class. I kept trying and failing to keep focused for more than five or 10 minutes, giving up after a few days or weeks, and then eventually trying again. It wasn't until I was well over 50 years old that I realized there's no right or wrong way to meditate. \"There's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to reaping the benefits of meditation,\" says Nancy Isenberg, M.D., MPH, a neurologist at Swedish Center for Healthy Aging. \"Some people find sitting meditation and breath awareness practices helpful while others are more drawn to walking or sound meditation. Like exercise, which takes time to build stamina, meditation takes practice to cultivate focused attention.\" According to Isenberg, as we age it's more effort to pay attention and we can more easily become distracted by everything from our phones to being lost in thought. Meditation helps strengthen connections in brain networks important for concentration, flexibility and emotion regulation. \"Thanks to neuroplasticity,\" Isenberg says, \"the science demonstrates that over time these practices change activation and connectivity in key brain networks to improve attention and emotional balance to help keep older adults mentally alert and overall happier.\" The potential benefits of meditation \"You know you're doing the wrong practice if it's making you too tight and twisted,\" says Tuere Sala, a guide at Seattle Insight Meditation Society. \"The point of meditation is to relax the mind and allow for either simply letting go of stress and negative thoughts or investigating those thoughts instead of identifying with them.\" What kind of meditation is best for you? When choosing a mediation practice, the best place to start is asking yourself why you want to meditate. For me, it was about getting off the gerbil wheel of thoughts cconstantly spinning in my mind that made it hard to focus.

Mindful meditation aimed at learning to be less reactionary, less attached to thoughts so that they simply arise and dissipate, was helpful. There are dozens of apps available with guided mindful mediations that are typically five to 30 minutes long (see a few suggestions below). Sala differentiates between mindfulness, which she calls secular meditation, and dharma, which she teaches. \"Dharma is spiritual meditation,\" she says. \"It's about investigating habits of the mind learned over time that are causing sadness or pain.We use Buddhist teachings to learn not to tumble into the identification with thoughts. Instead, we can create new habits, new stories for ourselves that are based on cultivating compassion and happiness.\" Other types of meditation are based on quieting the mind with movement. These include tai chi, qigong and yoga. Getting started \u2014 and keeping it going Incorporating meditation into your daily lifestyle takes consistency and diligence, just like any other habit. \"Think about what's realistic for you, even if that means starting small with just five or 10 minutes daily,\" says Karen Tanzy, Ph.D., a psychologist, mindful meditation teacher and founder of AgingWith Creativity in Seattle. \"Setting a regular time each day can also be helpful. Think about how you can build the practice into your daily routine instead of trying to squeeze it in.\" Sala began her meditation practice by pairing the word \"meditation\"with everything from vacuuming to washing dishes, to remind herself to focus on whatever she was doing in that moment in time and let everything else go. \"There was a gradual allowing myself to come into what my mind was comfortable with,\" she says. \"And then I began to see that focusing on just one thing, sitting with my breath and coming back to that breath, was very soothing.\" \"We used to think you had to do 20 minutes twice a day to reap benefits,\" Isenberg says. \"But a recent study with a mean age of 79 showed 30 minutes of sitting meditation produced changes in functional connectivity in areas of the brain and improvements in cerebral blood flow.\" Tanzy also puts an emphasis on comfort. She points out that you don't need to sit cross-legged on a cushion. \"It's just as effective to meditate while sitting in a chair,\" she says. \"You can also lie in bed and meditate first thing in the morning.\" I like to sit in a leather chair in front of a window with a view of my backyard garden. The key is to be comfortable and safe, but not so cozy that you fall asleep. I also enjoy walking meditation in the woods across the street frommy house, focusing on breath and the sounds of nature around me. Meditating on a daily basis has helped me to improve my focus on living in the moment and letting go of negative thoughts. That said, this is just one lifestyle practice that works with diet and exercise to keep us mentally fit as we age. \"When we meet the challenges of growing older with compassion, we can also open to the gifts of aging,\" Tanzy says. \"Mindfulness does not negate pain but allows us to lean into it, offering ourselves the support we need. At the same time, we can remain open to living our lives with meaning Est. 1986 Estate Appraisals & Sales | Private Consignments Estate Management | Real Estate Brokerage Services Full-Service Family Estate Management WE ARE HERE WHEN YOU NEED US... Sunday, October 23, 2022 | Special Advertising Section 1 R 8 Almost no one wants to talk about death, whether their own or a loved one's passing. But Maureen Kures welcomes the discussion. Kures is the Seattle-based founder of Radiant Mourning, a service to help families discuss and plan for death. \"We don't want to talk about death in our culture because of that fear of the unknown, that someday we're going to be gone,\"Kures says. \"Many people don't even want to think about it.\" Years ago, when she started working at her first nursing job in an oncology unit, Kures felt scared. But over time, fears fell away. \"It's always sad when someone dies that we love.We miss them,\" she says. \"But death can be a beautiful journey.\" Only 40% of Americans have planned for their deaths in any way, Kures says, preferring to ignore or postpone the topic. But adult children between the ages of 45-65 tend to start getting anxious about juggling the needs of aging parents and growing teens or young adults. It's the perfect time to initially \u2014 and very gently \u2014 bring up conversations around end-of-life, funeral and burial, and after-death plans. In other cases, it's the parent's job to introduce the complex topic. !\"#$%&'(#)*+,$-\"(#.&/+$'-\"'$%&$#0& 1+(2(3#0&0\",'3,,\"(#,&$4(3-&0*$-5 PHOTOS VIA GETTY IMAGES Real TALK TALK TALK !\"#$ % &#$' !\"#$%&\"'()%)*+,%\")%-,(%.(\"-,%.(+/%\"0$%-,(%1(223% 4\"'(%+\"0%'\"/(%#(5(\"260&7%5*20(#\"82(%+305(#)\"-630) Aging Well !\"# !()* &)*+ 1 R Special Advertising Section | Sunday, October 23, 2022 9 There's an inherent tension as parents age, says Scott Schill, attorney and director of Longevity Law and Planning (which includes elder law and estate planning) at S. R. Schill & Associates. Adult children tend to be motivated by concern for safety, while older adults value autonomy. It's almost a reversal of the teen-parent relationship, although most adults can make better decisions about independence and risk tradeoffs than teenagers, he notes.With the right balance and open communication, everyone can be accommodated. Initiating final conversations Adult children might use a celebrity, friend or family member to initially broach the topic, Kures says. An example: \"Olivia Newton-John just died but was diagnosed with breast cancer 30 years ago.What would you want if put in that position? Aunt Mary's stroke paralyzed her on one side \u2014what would you want us to do for you in that situation?\" Don't be surprised if a parent doesn't want to discuss death. Step back and try again at another time \u2014 don't push. But frame it as a way to honor and respect a parent's wishes and reduce future familial conflict. As a nurse, Kures often saw families fracture over misunderstandings and disagreements when a dying parent's wishes weren't documented and discussed in advance. Perhaps one adult child was left in charge of health care decisions \u2014 but no one else knew\u2014or no one was left in charge, and kids bickered. Some parents call a family meeting after completing legal or other planning work with an attorney. This can start with simply saying, \"I want you to hear from me what I want if anything happens and I can't make my own decisions, and why.\"You can discuss whether you want a funeral, wake, or memorial and any estate planning documents. No matter who initiates, bring the entire family to the table to avoid gossip and rumors. Reactions may differ, and that's OK, Kures says. If the conversation gets heated, consider a talking stone or stick so that only one person speaks as others listen. If it's too emotional, it's fine to step back and try again later. Set the table, have a glass of wine, and with luck, at the end of the family meeting, everyone walks away feeling good. \"It's a chance for generations to exchange promises,\" Schill says. Children want to know that parents will understand the courage required when asking a parent to get help. Parents want to know that their children will advocate for their ability to return home if in the hospital. Practicalities An elder law attorney like Schill helps aging parents chart a path that avoids big fears, whether the nursing home, family conflict, outliving the nest egg or becoming a burden. The end goal? \"To simplify, dignify and unify,\" he says, by leaving a manual of instructions, so no one is left making regrettable or difficult-to-impossible decisions. Schill suggests a \"suite of documents,\" including the will, health care and financial power of attorney, living will, HIPPA authorization documents and a remainshandling directive, among others. Providing direction for remains gives the family \"a rite, something to do for closure,\" Schill says, and describes any prepaid funeral expenses. Prepaying offers many advantages, he says, including removing one more to-do and cost from the kids' list. Decisionmaking during grief is a vulnerability, he says, sometimes leading to susceptibility to pitches for extravagant funeral expenses. In addition, a \"What about me document\" outlines your tastes. \"If I'm in the hospital, what do I want on the TV? MSNBC versus Fox News?\" If you don't want the last thing you hear to be the voice of Sean Hannity or Rachel Maddow, you might consider letting others know. Review your health care and legacy once a year and discuss any changes with your family. Talk about hospice, too, Kures suggests.While most don't call hospice until the end, the resource can step in with a prognosis of 6-month life expectancy or less. \"You can have two people with the same diagnosis, but the person on hospice will live weeks to months longer, with a better quality of life,\"Kures says. Beyond practicalities Conduct a parent-child \"life review\" by peppering conversations with everyday questions, Kures suggests. \"What was your favorite ice cream? Who was your favorite teacher?\"And more revealing questions, too, such as \"What was the hardest challenge you've faced in life?\" Many parents want to feel they've made a difference and had a purpose in life. Final discussions also involve discussing regrets, asking for forgiveness and forgiving others. \"If you talk it out, you may not find it's not a regret at all, but simply require looking at a memory from a new perspective,\"Kures says. \"But talking is essential.\" Both the dying and family members often experience \"anticipatory grief,\" she says. Discussing memories, laughing and crying together and sharing special last moments can help with eventual acceptance and healing. \"If we don't have these conversations and lean into the grief, it's often harder to deal with after,\" she says. \"Conversations may be awkward at first, but the richness that comes from it is so important and profound and gives you a gift to help with your grief.\" Discussing a parent's \"bucket list\" can help provide advance closure. As physical mobility becomes increasingly limited, the list may change. Ask a parent, \"What brings you joy in your day? What's something you'd like to do again, someone you'd like to see, a place you'd like to return to?\" The responses could range from driving up the Oregon coast to see an old friend or visiting Edmonds to watch ferries set sail into the sunset. Kures's mother is turning 86 and said she hoped to revisit New England in the fall. Although she's in perfect health, Kures and her mother will be going in a few weeks.

The older we get, the increasingly crucial role balance plays in helping to prevent dangerous falls. According to King County Public Health, two-thirds of seniors who experience a fall will fall again within six months, and 60% of fatal falls occur in the home. For those 65 and older, one in three experience a fall at least once a year; furthermore, one in 40 of those folks will be hospitalized, and only half of those hospitalized will survive the year. Thankfully, several local programs raise visibility on the topic, and regional doctors and physical therapists offer practical assistance in this realm, too. There's even an annual national awareness campaign called Falls PreventionWeek. Year-round at Harborview's Fall Prevention Clinic, dedicated staff aim to deliver a research- and evidence-based approach. Though there's been much research on the subject over the years, this body of information still hasn't sufficiently reached the public, according to Elizabeth Phelan, M.D., professor of medicine, Division of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, at the UW School of Medicine. \"We're trying to translate this into real-world practice,\" she says. At the clinic, Kristina Moser Cosley, PT, DPT, is a physical therapist who specializes in the evaluation and treatment of patients with orthopedic injuries and geriatric patients with fall risk. The team first completes an evidence-based assessment of modifiable fall risk factors and conducts a falls-focused physical exam, examining a patient's strength, balance and gait. For example, they will see whether the patient can stand from a chair without using their arms. Through these evaluations, Phelan explains, they try to learn what's most important to patients and what activities they may have begun to restrict before delving into treatment planning. They develop an exercise routine customized to each individual that mixes static with dynamic balance exercises (during which one is shifting weight and moving). If a fall-prevention exercise program is recommended, patients initially are seen once a week, and frequently after that for as long as six months.

Afterward, the clinic places a strong emphasis on helping patients continue at home \u2014with a goal of having it evolve into a lifelong routine, whether through community classes or online streaming options. Phelan and Cosley agree that if folks can do one thing, they should engage in fall-prevention exercises over the long haul in order to maintain the protective effects of good balance. \"Fall prevention exercise puts a huge emphasis on balance and making sure people have optimal strength in their lower extremities and core, because strength is foundational to good balance,\" Phelan says. And both note that tai chi is one of the best options, because it has strong research behind it for preventing falls, fall-related injuries and reducing fear of falling. Yoga is another recommended form of movement, since it builds strength and stability and improves balance and coordination, too. Companies like Sugarcane Yoga \u2014 offering private sessions in the Greater Seattle area, and online content available from anywhere \u2014make classes accessible to clients of all ages. Sugarcane's founder-owner Meagan Lass believes that the benefits of a consistent yoga practice as we age are plentiful. In addition to all the physical payoffs, clients experience increased confidence, mindfulness and community building. The two initial concerns she hears from older clients are fears of falling due to lack of balance, or not being able to get down to the ground and back up. To address these worries, all postures can be done via seated variations with a chair. (Lass recommends attempting balancing shapes with a teacher first.) Lass tells older clients that the practice is truly about fall prevention versus staying in a yoga pose for extended periods of time. She gives the example of stepping off a curb and losing one's balance. \"You will be better equipped to find a way to prevent your fall with increased awareness of your body in space, how you move when your balance is compromised,\" she says. \"The fall prevention is the goal, not the balance itself.Working on balance, stability and confidence building translates to real-life activities where balance and dexterity are needed.\" Continued on page 12 Above: Ryan Lock and MaryBeth Sabine are health educators with the One Step Ahead Fall Prevention Program.

Lass has had the joy of witnessing many clients thrive after consistent attendance. \"I regularly have clients who come to class and tell me about experiences they have had where they used their improved balance to prevent a fall in their day-to-day lives,\" she says, \"like walking up stairs, across a street or out of a pool.\" For those starting yoga at an advanced age, Lass says, \"It's OK to start just as you are! Find a yoga teacher who has specialized experience in working with older populations and injuries and chronic conditions. An experienced teacher will ensure you are cleared by a medical professional to take yoga classes, ask if there are any limitations or suggestions from your doctor and work within their scope as a yoga teacher to support you.\" In their digital library, Sugarcane has several slower-paced classes, plus chair yoga classes, too. King County Emergency Medical Services/Medic One developed a free community resource for seniors called the One Step Ahead Fall Prevention Program. The program evolved out of a pilot program, as wraparound services following up on those who had called 911. \"We've stayed true to that since the beginning,\" says Erik Friedrichsen, Community Programs section supervisor for the EMS Division. This program aims to help people stay independent and safe at home thanks to a free in-home or virtual visit by a fall prevention health educator. The session involves a home safety walk-through to assess potential fall hazards and offers education, the installation of necessary fall safety devices and other resources. Those who enroll must be residents of King County (excluding Seattle), 50 or older, ambulatory and have called 911 after falling within the past 6 months. Currently, these services aren't available to residents of assisted living, nursing homes, adult family homes or on hospice services. Those interested in enrolling can call 206-263-8544 or email FallPrevention.EMS@ kingcounty.gov. As a complementary option, The Shape Up campaign has been designed to get seniors involved with physical activity programs at seven local community centers. Ultimately, these professionals share the goal of helping folks safely and confidently revisit pursuits they value most. Phelan and Cosley encourage patients to believe in the return to beloved activities \u2014perhaps dining out with family, walking their dog, even braving the steep cobbled streets of Pike Place Market to pick up fresh groceries.

That's partly because ceremonies observed since antiquity don't acknowledge the longevity of modern life, Jeanette Leardi, a social gerontologist and community educator in Portland, Oregon, said. Americans born in 1900 didn't expect to see age 50; why would they have planned rituals for later in life? But the lack of opportunities to celebrate, Leardi said, also reflects the ageist assumption that older adults have nothing much to look forward to, that they are incapable of change. Yet transitions lie at the heart of such rites of passage, she added: \"As a culture, we don't have an appreciation that this person has lived for decades and is ready to move into a new role, and that we should honor that.\" Oxman is now 86 and still a practicing lawyer. Raised by secular Jewish parents, he did not have a bar mitzvah as a teen. Decades later, \"it was important to me to have done it,\" he said. Although he had served as president of the congregation, he said, the ceremony and the weeks of preparation were \"extremely meaningful\" and marked \"the first time I felt like I really belonged.\" Here and there, older adults are inventing or reinventing other rites of passage at important junctures in their lives. Katherine Spinner, a child care provider, spent many weekends commuting from her home in Seattle to classes at Evergreen State College in Olympia. Decades earlier, bouts of depression had interrupted her education. But later in life, she said, \"I was not horribly depressed, and after a lot of work, I'd finished my degree.\" In 2018, at age 60, she marked her graduation at the University Friends Meeting in Seattle, where she had long been a member. She organized a special meeting for worship in the unprogrammed Quaker tradition, where some participants were moved to speak. The gathering included a potluck dinner, an exhibit of her ceramic sculptures and lots of singing. \"I felt I was offering something and also receiving appreciation frommy community,\" Spinner said. By Tatiana Boncompagni The New York Times Harry Oxman's bar mitzvah at the Society Hill Synagogue in Philadelphia looked much like the traditional Saturday morning event. He recited the customary prayers before and after the Torah reading. He discussed the meaning of the day's Torah portion. He carried the sacred scrolls in a procession around the sanctuary. The rabbi offered a blessing; the congregation yelled a congratulatory \"Mazel tov!\" and tossed pieces of candy to symbolize the sweetness of the days ahead. Lunch followed, with toasts from family members. The difference was that the celebration, a tradition that normally marks Jewish adulthood for 13-year-olds, occurred in 2019, when Oxman was 83. Because the 90th Psalm says that age 70 represents a full life span, some congregations offer this rite of passage \u2014often for the second time \u2014 to those turning 83. \"It comes at a different transitional moment in life,\" Rabbi Nathan Kamesar, who proposed the ritual to Oxman, said. \"It's the reflective moment, the opportunity to look back at the life you've led, and perhaps ahead to what the next chapter might be.\" Younger people have many rituals that mark important passages \u2014 graduations, weddings, ceremonies for newborns, even milestones like acquiring driver's licenses or casting first votes \u2014while older adults have few. Though birthday and anniversary parties may be great fun, they do not usually involve the same kind MICHELLE GUSTAFSON / THE NEW YORK TIMES Harry Oxman, 86, who celebrated his bar mitzvah in 2019, wears his tallit at his office in Philadelphia.

She also intends to offer a ritual developed in the 1980s for older women called simchat chochmah, a celebration of aging and wisdom. \"The second half of life includes so many moments that are worthy of attention and communal celebration,\" Timoner said. Other late-in-life rites take secular forms. Some proponents have devised rituals for common but fraught experiences such as handing over car keys and relinquishing driving, or leaving the family home for a senior living facility. Nancy Rhine, a gerontologist and marriage and family therapist in Mill Valley, California, has helped about 40 older adults prepare for and process late-life rituals involving hours of retrospection and introspection, art and music. \"They're looking at legacy, life review, taking stock,\" she said. \"It's that searching, a contemplative practice.\"Her oldest such client was 81. This spring, Kris Govaars was turning 70 and still mourning his wife, Vicki Govaars, who had died in 2019, just weeks after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. \"I was a boat without a tether,\" Govaars, a former architectural consultant in the Bay Area, said. \"I was struggling, trying to figure out my next steps.\" He came across the Center for Conscious Eldering, founded by Ron Pevny, author of \"Conscious Living, Conscious Aging,\" and AgingWell !\"#$%!%&'( 1 R Special Advertising Section | Sunday, October 23, 2022 15 decided to join its weeklong retreat at Ghost Ranch in Abiquiu, NewMexico. His group of 14, which included people in their 50s to their 80s, spent several days engaging in spiritual practices, exercises and discussions. For his culminating ritual, called a \"solo journey,\" Govaars selected a private spot on a riverbank. After passing through a portal formed by two trees (and having a close encounter with a bobcat), he fasted, maintained silence, read poetry, journaled and wrote \"legacy letters\" for his two children. \"I just spent a lot of time in thinking and meditation,\" he said, deeply moved by the experience. \"The outcome is hopefully a greater sense of happiness and purpose,\" he explained. \"I feel calmer. I feel much more introspective. I listen with an open heart and mind. I may look the same, but I am different.\" In addition to helping people see old age as a phase of life with purpose and rewards, along with the more commonly recognized challenges and deficits, rituals for older adults may affect others, Leardi pointed out. \"They benefit the community,\" she said. \"You might have little kids there \u2014 young people, other elders \u2014watching you go through this, hopefully aspiring to this. You cross the threshold and walk into your future.\" Most older adults, of course, will have the late-life ritual of a funeral or memorial, a remembrance some may plan themselves. That, too, involves contemplation of their lives, their contributions and accomplishments. But while some older adults plan their own memorials, they do not hear the hymns or poems, remembrances or eulogies. But Oxman did see his family and friends celebrate him and his role in his synagogue, his community and the world. He heard his rabbi bestow a blessing and tell the gathering that Oxman had spent his days wisely. \"Your presence is felt,\"Kamesar said. \"Your legacy is accounted for.

Each year, both Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D base their premiums on your reported modified adjusted gross income from two years prior. So if you filed individually making more than $91,000, or filed jointly making more than $182,000, you'll pay additional amounts each month. \"Because there's a lookback on earnings for Medicare expenditures, we'll adjust plans accordingly, because they might be paying considerably more the first couple of years in retirement than later in retirement,\" Lash says. It's also wise to consider guidance on Medicare choices in general, because you sometimes can't change coverage later if your health situation shifts \u2014 and Medicare is complicated. \"We do an annual meeting with somebody that specializes in Medicare,\" Lash says. \"All clients are invited to attend.\" 8\"#9&/#-#&::)6,#')#(3+:;4/(*63# :)6#+)/<;'36=#5&637# A person turning 65 now has about a 70% chance of needing some kind of long-term care, and costs are steep: It's $54,000 a year for an assisted living facility and nearly $95,000 for a shared room in a nursing home, according to insurance company Genworth's 2021 Cost of Care Survey. \"Some people are well enough off that they're comfortable self-insuring,\" says Kevin Brady , a CFP in NewYork City. \"Others have more limited assets.\" By Kate Ashford The Associated Press Using a financial adviser for your investment needs is 100% on brand, but what about the other parts of your retirement life?

Actual retirement spending looks more like a smile than a straight line, Lum says, with more spending at the beginning on things like travel and more spending at the end on long-term care needs. \"I'm not saying people should spend irrationally,\" Lum says. \"But thinking about retirement spending as a fixed calculation that doesn't change across the retirement life isn't a smart idea.\" AgingWell !\"#$#%&' 1 R Special Advertising Section | Sunday, October 23, 2022 17 pandemic. The results of the study were ultimately published by Health and Technology. \"Providing the population with the means to engage with VR activities to keep them occupied and physically fit could be a promising strategy to minimise the decline in mental and physical well-being that has been reported in many instances since the start of the pandemic,\" the study concluded. A systematic review published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health examined 15 peer-reviewed studies on the effects of virtual reality. \"Of the 12 articles examining physiological outcomes, eight showed a positive effect on physical fitness, muscle strength, balance, and extremity function,\" the review said. \"Only four articles examined the effects on psychological outcomes, three showed positive effects such that VR exercise could ease fatigue, tension, and depression and induce calmness and enhance quality of life.\" The review did however note that the 15 studies used \"far from ideal\" sample sizes and therefore suggested more rigorous studies be performed to confirm the findings. Dr. David A.

More rigorous tests still need to be taken. For now, however, the findings are pointing in a healthy direction. By Hunter Boyce The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (TNS) While virtual reality may once have seemed like something out of \"Back to the Future,\" the technology is now here to stay. A new report by CNET claims the gaming platform may even be older adults' next super weapon in the fight against dementia. From the Oculus Rift to PlayStation VR, virtual reality gaming is growing. Now studies are showing that playing some of the platform's biggest hits, like \"Beat Saber\" and \"Superhot,\"may slow the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.
