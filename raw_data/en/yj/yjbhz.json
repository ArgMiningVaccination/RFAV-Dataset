His friends call him Guidini, because a) it sounds cute and b) it distinguishes him from all the orange-skinned, steroid-and-silicone-filled meatballs who should be fixing our plumbing rather than roaming New Jersey beaches. Guido documents both music-related happenings and heavier, geopolitical stories. He trained under the preeminent Italian photojournalist Paolo Pellegrin, and his work has appeared in Italian Rolling Stone, Vice Italy, Nero, Foto8, PRIVATE, and other magazines. For this issue, Guido traveled to Lampedusa\u2014an island south of Sicily where tens of thousands of Tunisians fled following the revolution and ousting of former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\u2014to get the real scoop on the refugee crisis. See TOO MANY TUNISIANS, NOT ENOUGH TOILETS, page 74 HANNAH BROOKS This tall drink of water was born in Bowen, a small North Queensland town famous for its delicious mangoes. At one time, Hannah was the music editor of our Australian edition, which is why you may know her from VBS documentaries like Heavy Metal Gangs of Wadeye and Nimbin Mardi Grass. She is currently exiled in the paradise that is Byron Bay, where her days consist of loafing around the beach, walking the fine line be-tween burning and tanning, riding her bicycle, wearing black on principle (she says there's \"too much color in Byron\"), getting calluses on her fingertips from playing guitar, avoiding bongo players, learning to drive (public transport isn't an option up there), and conducting interviews with interesting people such as Rainbow Guy, the mastermind behind Byron's Rainbow Temple and a deep, dark tunnel without a destination. See PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, RAINBOW GUY, page 22 JAN VAN TIENEN The first time we met Jan, we were a little baffled. He looked more like a young dot-com entrepreneur than the editor of Vice's Dutch edition. With our help, he experienced his first-ever Halloween. He showed up to a Brooklyn bar in a black ski mask (tags still attached at the top), holding sparkly cheerleader pom-poms. We weren't exactly sure what he was supposed to be (we don't think he was, either), but we liked his gusto. In spite of being from the rural backwater of Zeeland, he has adapted nicely to Amsterdam's latte-stained yuppie district, where he enjoys tending to his bangs, collecting zombie books, Maoam candy, and \"the disco music.\" In this issue, you'll find Jan's account of tagging along with a bunch of young European Muslims on their way to protest France's burka ban. See ALLAHU AKBAR IN A PARKING LOT, page 34 PAUL MALISZEWSKI One of Paul's first short stories, written when he was a Tolkien-obsessed kid in Shreveport, Louisiana, involved a character walking into a pub, draining a pint of mead, and conversing with a face that appears at the bottom of the glass. He composes stories that alternate between painfully realistic examinations of the human condition and dreamlike narratives that reveal as much as they bewilder. Paul has received all sorts of well-deserved attention for his fiction and his essays, including two Pushcart Prizes and a book blurb from editor extraordinaire Gordon Lish that says, \"Paul Maliszewski takes no crap,\" which is like God saying someone is incapable of sin. Of course, we're thrilled to be publishing three excerpts from his brand-new fiction collection, Prayer and Parable, which will be released this month by Fence Books. See A PRAYER AND TWO PARABLES, page 80 ULTRAVIOLET BLACK-LIGHT CALENDAR This very special calendar came into our lives last Christmas during a Secret Santa gift-off. It features 13 classic images from Ultraviolet, a book celebrating the \"out-there-ness\" of black-light posters. Despite our shock that a publication dedicated to black-light posters actually exists, we've really been enjoying it here at the office; we count on its groovy date boxes to keep us on track for deadline and inform us of important psychedelic histori-cal dates like the FDA's approval of oral contraceptives (May 9) and the signing of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (May 26). There's also loads of cool imagery: pretty girls with flowing hair and boobs made of flowers, mustached neon bikers, a naked couple making out in front of an enormous peace sign, outer space, and, of course, an ode to Jimi Hendri x. Now all someone needs to do is send us a black light. See THE BRICK WALL ABOVE OUR ASSOCIATE EDITOR'S DESK 20 VICEWe approach the Cementerio General del Sur in Caracas in the back of a cab with darkly tinted windows. Fourteen thousand people were murdered in Venezuela in 2010, and Caracas is widely regarded as one of the most violent cities in the world. The cemetery, we've been warned, is in a particularly rough neighborhood, a difficult concept to wrap our heads around after seeing the rest of town. We enter the heavily guarded gates and pro- ceed slowly past a few funerals in progress. It's a Monday, which means the weekend's departed are being laid to rest. They are overwhelmingly young and male, and forlorn relatives are scattered across the graveyard. The Cementerio General del Sur initially looks like any Catholic cemetery: old graves interspersed BY RYAN DUFFY PHOTOS BY SANTIAGO STELLEYwith overgrown greenery, fresh flowers left by recent visitors dotting the landscape. But as you look closer at the gatherings of people, elements of Santeria pop out. Many visitors are dressed entirely in white. Small statuettes of saints sit on top of graves, and most people are carrying offerings. Venezuela is, to put it simply, a deeply divided society. The Chavez regime is a direct response to a distrust of authority born through centuries of violent dictatorships. This distrust is not limited to politics: Venezuelans living without running water have a wee bit of a difficult time connecting with the traditional saints of the Roman Catholic Church. They opt in-stead for more familiar, and flawed, figureheads. The cemetery is surrounded on all sides by cascad- ing hillside slums, like the upper decks of the world's worst football stadium. It's an imposing place to spend an afternoon, and the gravity is palpable. Until you see Ismael Sanchez. Standing at about three feet tall, with a sideways baseball hat and permanent cigarette dangling from his bottom lip, Ismael is the leader of the Santos Malandros (in English, the Holy Thugs)\u2014a col-lection of dead saints with a shared history of FOR MY DEAD HOMIES Los Santos Malandros Are the Hottest Saints in VenezuelaThree of the statues of Ismael Sanchez at his shrine in the Cementerio General del Sur in Caracas. That notch in his mouth is for cigarettes and joints. VICE 21criminal activity. Ismael is a dapper little fellow, sporting wraparound sunglasses, bright accents on his shirt to com-pliment his baggy pants, and shiny new Nike sneakers to match the swoosh on his cap. The idea of grown men worshipping at the feet of three- foot Homie dolls is a bit odd, but we assure you, the practice is even weirder. We find seven different Ismael statues on the plot when we arrive, along with numerous plaques, handwritten trib-utes, and other donations. Each of the Ismael statues has been built with a small nub between his lips, so followers can wedge cigarettes and weed in their mouths as offerings. Every day, hundreds of Venezuelans pour through the cemetery gates to visit Ismael and his esses to ask for a vari-ety of seemingly simple blessings: protection from theft, the health of a loved one, or just not getting shot on the way back from the market that evening. The irony is that in life Ismael Sanchez was, by all ac- counts, an unrepentant criminal. He made his living robbing people, but his devotees are quick to point out he favored a Robin Hood-style approach to holdups. \"If he ever stole anything, it was for the people, for his neighborhood, so everybody could eat,\" explains Ramon, the de facto caretaker of Ismael's plot. With a Tampa Bay Rays cap pulled tight over his eyes, he made sure we re-corded Ismael's virtues. \"Now, people come here to bring Ismael alcohol, cigarettes, fruits, and cake.\" Ismael is the boss of the court, but the rest of the Holy Thugs are held in similar reverence: Isabelita is helpful for exacting justice, Tomasito for loyalty-related issues, and so on down the line: Johnny, Elizabeth, Rat\u00f3n, and Petroleo Crudo (in English, Crude Oil. Yes, he's the black one). As we were speaking with a group of kids visiting the Malandros Court after getting off work for the day, a few rounds of automatic-weapon fire erupted in the hillside slums surrounding us. The kids promptly left, and we fol-lowed closely behind. Not far from the cemetery, we passed a storefront selling statues of the Holy Thugs in all shapes and sizes. Inside, we met a spiritualist named Clara who offered to channel Ismael for us. We asked her if it seemed a bit troubling that, in a country so violent, so many people were praying to a crew of armed criminals. She told us no, the thugs were just vessels for a larger good. Then she and Ismael told me that I had a nice light and should visit the Great Pyramid. Watch The Vice Guide to Travel this month on VBS.TV for the further adventures of Ismael Sanchez and his gang of saintly criminals/crimey saints. Another popular shrine, a couple of feet away from Ismael's, contains statues of other members of the Holy Thugs court like Freddy and Rat\u00f3n (\"The Mouse\").Right outside Ismael's shrine, a smaller plot features a large statue of Miguelito, known as El Pel\u00f3n (\"Baldy\"). One of Ismael's caretakers told us that he didn't know much about him, except that he used to rob people too. After a pause, he added, \"I don't think he did anything good for humanity.\"VICE 23Thirty years ago, Rainbow Guy (aka Guy Feldmann) was di- vinely inspired to change his gypsy ways, settle down, and complete two very important missions: build the Temple, a nondenominational gathering place devoted to the pursuit of truth, and burrow an underground tunnel without a destination. Not one to question the synchronistic flow of the universe, Guy soon secured a suitable patch of land in the hills behind Byron Bay, Australia, and in 1981\u2014on the doubly auspicious occasion of Easter Sunday and a full moon in Libra\u2014began to execute the consecrated tasks bestowed on him. Since its inception, the Temple has grown in size and repu- tation. By Guy's estimate, it currently attracts approximately 300 visitors a year, mainly international travelers and spiritual enthusiasts. It is a place of refuge where people can stay for as long as they want without hassle. Following the mantra \"As above, so below\" (we're still un- clear on what that means, but it sounds nice), Guy has no plans to stop digging anytime soon\u2014or ever, for that mat-ter. Guy told us that his tunnel, at 165 feet deep, is still in its infancy. His ultimate goal is to create an ever-expanding labyrinth that stretches for miles. Wishing to pay our respects to the Temple, and of course witness the intriguing tunnel for ourselves, I found Guy drink-ing coffee amid a group of Israeli backpackers. As expected, he was incredibly warm and welcoming but a little concerned that our interview would cause him to miss the beginning of a soccer match that was about to air on TV. Of course, I kept asking questions so I could talk to him for as long as possible. Wouldn't you? I mean, look at him. He's fuckin' Rainbow Guy! Vice: So you've been working on this tunnel for how long? Rainbow Guy: I had to finish the Temple first, so I didn't start on the tunnel until about 15 years ago. If you actually add up all of the work time\u2014as in eight hours a day, five days a week\u2014I've probably only put in about six months of real labor. Are you aiming for a certain length? There's no end to its journey. Miles, I'd like to think, but obviously this won't happen in my lifetime. Yet there should be no reason to consider my death to be the end of the tunnel\u2014it should go on. Does the tunnel represent a certain meaning or sentiment, or are you just really into drilling through rock? The tunnel complements the Temple. The idea is to build a labyrinth with lots of interior tunnels and egg-shaped rooms that we can use for singing, meditation, storage, retreats, wa-ter containment, and sound and light deprivation. But mainly it's fun, a great adventure, and part of a health campaign. I'm 65 years old, and you know the saying: If you don't use it, you will lose it. There's a lot of truth to that. Have you ever considered joining a gym instead? Yes, but then there's the joy of doing this. Every time I come out after a strong session underground, I feel like I could go in again; I've got more energy than when I went in. It's some-thing about being charged by the earth. Right. How does that tie into sensory deprivation? I've heard that if you spend a period of time in darkness, away from sound and light, that the brain goes through a change to adjust to those circumstances. The left and right brains will eventually meet because nothing separates them anymore\u2014there's no cause and no effect. Apparently, it's quite a valuable experience. You're not claustrophobic, are you? Yes I am. Does it impede your maximum tunnel-boring potential? I made sure that the tunnel was big and wide enough that it wouldn't be an issue, and I am not claustrophobic in that tun-nel. In other places, yes, but not in there. Have you experienced any problems with the local authorities? I imagine it'd be hard to get a permit for something like this. I probably would have trouble if they were aware of the tun-nel, but I don't because they're not. You'll have problems with the council if you pick your nose. You can't do anything. I met your son earlier, and he told me that he sees the Temple as the ultimate penis and the tunnel as its accommodating va-gina. Is that a sound theory? The Temple, being such a monolithic structure that reaches upward, is, in a sense, a vertical penis. It's surrounded by a stage, which is a big, beautiful receptive area, but yes, you could say it's phallic, tall, and proud. It hasn't been crowned yet, and I'm sure that it will bring about an orgasm of sorts when it's finally finished. Then there's the tunnel itself, which, when I'm in it, is like being inside the womb of the earth because all I feel there is love; I feel embraced by the earth when I'm in there digging. I get covered in clay and come out dripping sweat and feel like I've been through some sort of transformation or conscious metamorphosis. Any idea why you received this particular calling? Scientologists have a question: \"If you find yourself sur-rounded by chaos, how do you get out of chaos?\" I believe the answer is: Take any point and start from there. This is the point that I have started from, or that the universe has started from through me, to work its way out of chaos. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, RAINBOW GUY Now Tell Us About Your Underground Tunnel to Nowhere INTERVIEW BY HANNAH BROOKSPHOTO BY OLIVER PURSER 22 VICE 24 VICE BRAYDEN OLSON Brayden is a photographer with hair like Sideshow Bob's. He's also always up to no good (the day before we finished this ar-ticle, he was stabbed by a cab driver in the arm for arguing over a fare), so we thought he'd make a great candidate for this project. The lab report's confusing \"Nutritional Elements\" bar graph showed that he has lots of minerals like calcium, manganese, cobalt, and iron in his system. We thought that was good, but then the following page told us that the calcium \"is not being utilized properly,\" and this could lead to joint stiffness or low energy levels. Even more troubling was the presence of excess cobalt, which can be caused by exposure to paint or animal feed, and manganese, which is present in gasoline and fertilizer. The only explanation is that Brayden spends lots of time in a dung-filled flophouse, getting high on fumes from gasoline-coated rags. Clearly, this is not the ideal lifestyle in terms of balancing one's vitamin and mineral intake. According to the report, he should eat more oysters and pumpkin seeds but cut back on the pickled herring. If Brayden continues his bad habits, he's at risk for such ailments as fatigue, depression, and bradycardia, which apparently is a condition where your heart rate slows to under 50 beats a minute. Not good. They say eyes are the windows to the soul, in which case your hair is what? The roof? Like a roof, your hair is important but something that most of us hardly ever think about beyond its outward appear-ance. If you don't take care of it, it will rapidly be tangled with gunk and tennis balls and dead birds. Take Keith Morris, former Black Flag vocalist and frontman for the Circle Jerks and the recently formed OFF! He's been growing his dreadlocks in a variety of configurations for almost 23 years, and they now look like something that was snaked out of a gutter after a particularly bad rainstorm. This is why, after pondering the cornucopia of dis- gusting junk that might be found in Keith's keratin helmet, we asked him and his fellow OFF! bandmates (who would serve as a control group, of course) to send us at least three grams of their locks. The plan was to mail the samples to a lab in Texas that specializes in \"Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis.\" This not-exactly medically approved hair test determines which vita-mins and minerals an individual is lacking and how many hazardous metals are constantly being pushed through his or her scalp. We thought it'd be a good alternative to a normal music feature, because writing about bands is usually about as interesting as taking a shit in your shoe and walking around the block. The next time we heard from them, they told us that not everyone was into it. Initially, we figured it was Keith who was uncomfortable with the idea because he felt singled out due to the situation on his head. But for the record, we must state that Dimitri Coats, Steven Shane McDonald, and Mario Rubalcaba\u2014three supposed punks who between them were in Burning Brides, Redd Kross, and Rocket From the Crypt\u2014were, for whatever reason, scared of having their precious manes inspected by weirdo pseudoscientists in Texas. Keith, however, was totally game and immediately FedExed us a little furry cigar. For science's sake, and because the rest of the band declined to participate, we tested three other samples alongside Keith's: a black guy's dread, some ginger strands from one of our photographer buddies, and a bunch of clippings we stole off the floor of a barber-shop. After about a week, the lab sent us back pages of charts and graphs that we did our best to process and summarize into language that someone would actually want to read. BY VICE STAFF WE ANALYZED KEITH MORRIS'S DREADLOCK It Contained Uranium and Arsenic VICE 25 KEITH MORRIS The first thing we noticed about Keith's results was that there's a ton of uranium in his hair. The report said that this isn't the type of uranium that turns peo-ple into superheroes or kills them, but we're still a little worried for him because it's fucking uranium . He also had a bunch of arsenic in his mane, but curiously the report focused more on his apparent excess of cop-per, which can have an \"antagonistic effect on zinc.\" High concentrations of copper, the report warns, have also been associated with hair loss. Maybe Keith knows this, and that's why he's let his coiffure mat and clump for maximum coverage. The 25-page analysis also includes a chart marked \"Tendencies\" that lists ailments Keith should expect to experience unless he shifts his day-to-day habits toward metabolic optimi-zation. In Keith's case, he could suffer from depression and unnamed allergy symptoms, which doesn't sound that bad considering he's walking around with the Fukushima reactor on his head. In fact, Keith's hair was probably the healthiest overall. Catch OFF! live on our new music site Noisey.com.A BLACK DUDE'S DREAD Finally, someone who is actually in pretty good shape! This dreadlock came from a guy who told us that he gave up drugs and alcohol years ago, and his clean living is apparent in the test results. His hair contained more than the usual amount of alu-minum, but this isn't an issue because most food contains the substance. He also had an excess of vanadium, but that's not likely a cause for concern. The lab report said he was at risk for allergic reactions, itchy skin, and headaches\u2014but doesn't everyone who lives in a large city have those problems all the time anyway? Like everyone else we tested, the report also suggested that he buy a bunch of nutritional supplements. In our pro-fessional opinion, though, he's going to be fine. MYSTERY BARBERSHOP HAIR What can you tell about a complete stranger from analyzing his or her hair? Not a whole lot. This dude's hair\u2014we're assuming it's not a lady's because it looks like man-hair and we got it from a barbershop\u2014is remark-ably similar to Brayden's in terms of chemical composition. The big dif-ference is that it contains a bunch of cadmium, which is often caused by either tobacco smoke or zinc smelt-ers. He suffers from the same risks of fatigue, allergies, and bradycardia as Brayden (and, suspiciously, all of our other participants) and received the same sort of labyrinthine dietary advice: Eat less cabbage and kale but more rye bread, wheat germ, and blackberries, which contain high amounts of phytates (phytic acid in salt form). VICE 27 26 VICESatanism typically conjures thoughts of dark- cloaked figures in deeply wooded areas, where they sacrifice livestock over a makeshift altar and whisper mysterious incantations in hopes of appeasing their dark lord. Maybe every once in a while they get creative and throw a baby doll off an overpass or vandalize a Catholic church with swas-tika graffiti to garner a bit of attention. Chances are, however, that anyone who participates in these types of activities is also a regular at IHOP, works at a mall, and thinks Marilyn Manson is a real person. Truly terrifying entities don't advertise their presence, which is the main reason traditional sa-tanic cults have eluded the public and thrived in every sector of our society. For hundreds of years, these secret organizations have relied on the sim-plest method to recruit and convert: fear. In fact, the only reason we are certain satanism still poses a danger is because it continues to produce victims of severe ritualistic abuse. Claudia Fliss is a therapist and Germany's lead- ing expert on the aftereffects of ritualistic abuse. She has helped rehabilitate former members of sa-tanic cults for the past two decades. Claudia has examined hundreds of correlating accounts from cult members who strayed from the flock, and the examples she gave me made the usual yarns seem like bedtime stories. For starters, victims frequently recount instances of cannibalization and the mur-der and rape of children. Even more disturbing was the way Claudia spoke of these events with a serene familiarity\u2014she hears these kinds of accounts on a regular basis. Just when I thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, Claudia informed me that the majority of her patients were born into satanic orders and \"pro-grammed\" from an early age to obey their fiendish parents and elders. One of the initial stages of programming involves locking a child in a box and sounding a correspond-ing \"trigger,\" such as a mobile-phone ringtone or whistle. The goal is for the child to associate the noise with feelings of horror and dread, a method of control that proves to be very effective once the child is let out, which, by the way, doesn't happen until he or she is moments away from total asphyxiation. After the lid is opened, the child is immediately in-structed to do something awful like kill an animal. In most cases, the youngster refuses and is forced back inside, where he or she must wait for even longer before being hauled out again and given the same instructions. If he or she puts up a fight, it's back in the box until the kid's will is broken. This process is so traumatic that the vic- tim's mind creates completely new and different personae (often older children or even adults) that can better cope with the agony. When the ROSEMARY'S BABIES Satanic Cults and Their Hapless Victims BY TOM LITTLEWOOD PHOTOS BY ALEX BINDERindividual is finally released, he or she identifies the box opener as his or her savior and, by ex-tension, instantaneously becomes loyal to the cult. Then, whenever senior cult members need the victim to do their bidding, all they have to do is repeat the trigger sound; the target will relive the initial traumatic experience and revert to the state he or she was in immediately after being let out of the box. Victims of satanic ritual abuse are primarily women, and they often suffer from dissociative identity disorder as a result. It's hard to fathom, but the number of identities within a single indi-vidual can exceed 100, and victims usually refer to themselves in the first-person plural. After my initial interview with Claudia, she called to invite me to meet two victims and raise awareness of their conditions. Claudia also warned me that there was a large risk involved because the cult still had contact with the subjects. Three days later, we met in a Berlin flat. Claudia introduced me to two girls who were both less than 25 years old. They were reserved and apprehensive, and chain-smoked while drinking cup after cup of coffee. We sat in a small bedroom and spoke for an hour about their experiences with the cult. The conversation would stall when my questions about satanic cults, ritualistic abuse, and sound triggers became too specific. As they left the room, Claudia turned to me and asked whether I was aware of whom I had been speaking with. It was a weird question to be asked, so I paused for a second before she went on to ex-plain that between the girls she had recognized at least ten distinct identities that had emerged during our conversation. After months of treating the girls, Claudia can easily recognize the nuances of differ-ent personae: the 25-year-old hyperintelligent girl, the moody 18-year-old, the mistrustful 45-year-old conservative. The gravity of the situation was lost on me un- til I accompanied Claudia to the kitchen to speak in private. When I passed the girls, I noticed that they were slouched on the floor, literally saying, \"Goo-goo, ga-ga.\" The childlike personaes inside of them had grown tired of grown-up conversation and wanted to play with crayons. After this first encounter, I met up with the girls on seven further occasions. During one visit, they ar-ranged for me to meet more of the \"little ones\"\u2014the young children and toddlers within their systems. We visited a Berlin park just after dawn to avoid par-ents and their children. The mood was apprehensive, and when they were in eyeshot of the playground a remarkable transformation took place. Both girls began speaking in children's voices, sucking on their thumbs as they discussed which swings were still dry and safe to sit on. Over the next 45 minutes, I met approximately eight different \"children.\" They scaled walls, slid down slides, kicked a soccer ball, fell off a swing, and thumped around in the sand. As we were sitting in the sand, a whistle screeched. One of the girls hid her head in her hands and be-gan to cry. \"I have to see Mommy,\" she said. \"I 28 VICEmust see Mommy.\" That's when things became very dark. Calling for \"Mommy,\" of course, meant she was express-ing a desire to return to a member of the very cult she was now attempting to escape. Claudia later explained that the whistle had triggered a persona in one of the girls. \"We've always been several [personae],\" said one of the girls in a voice that apparently belonged to a different child than the one I was speaking with just moments before. Her friend sat there hugging herself and sobbing. The girl con-tinued: \"Even if we don't agree on everything, we're the only company we have.\" I asked Claudia what the girl meant. \"One goal of the therapy is to establish certain personae who act as spokes-people for others within the system,\" she explained. \"They build up a certain trust and deal with everyday encounters. When a new identity is thrown into everyday life, it is the role of these more stable personae to calm them and ex-plain what is going on.\" This process, called \"sorting\" by the girls, took a couple of minutes, and soon the small child had calmed down and was replaced by another identity. Had the girls not been capable of a staggering level of self-control, they would be back in the order now, suffering the consequences. The fact that they opened themselves up to me gave me hope that one day others might follow suit in numbers that will force the public to pay attention to their plight. \"We can't just live our lives complaining that there is nobody really there to help us without being willing to do something about this ourselves,\" one of the girls said. Even more than the torture, psychological program- ming, infiltration of governmental offices, and blackmail, the biggest factor contributing to the success of satanic cults is our reluctance to believe in them in a realistic way. The German police don't have a specific department that deals with crimes relating to satanism or ritualistic abuse, and the related crimes they do investigate are filed away in different categories and quickly disappear from the agenda. Many times, when victims make the incredible step of breaking away from cult life, the public can't help but question their legitimacy and look for a way to discredit their stories. As one of the girls said to me: \"People don't want to believe us because then they'd have to do something about it. I find that so cowardly.\" Then she started talking about the tattoo she was planning to get to cover the pentagram that was carved across her back. She said she was thinking of getting a dolphin. VICE 31AVERSION THERAPY Even though I am a total baby when it comes to getting electrocuted, my initial plan was to self-administer electroshock therapy. The thought of it scared the shit out of me, but using instructions I found (of course) on the internet, I fashioned a disposable camera into a Taser and shocked myself while looking at gay porn. Do not EVER fucking do this. It hurt incredibly badly\u2014like I was simultaneously being punched in the face, being hit by a car, and dry heaving while having cigarettes put out on my teeth. Aversion therapy is supposed to be painful, but I genuinely thought I was going to die. I made an executive decision and downgraded my punishment to self-flagellation. I read somewhere that this is how monks counter sexual urges. Belt at the ready, I prepared a slide show containing a mixture of straight and gay porn. For each gay image I looked at, I whipped myself with the belt. For each straight image, I ate a piece of candy. I did this for about 15 minutes each morning and night for the duration of the month. EFFECTIVENESS: 1 out of 10. Despite the fact that my left arm began to look like it was covered in rosacea, after a couple days, I got used to the pain of the whipping and started to really enjoy my nightly porn-and-candy sessions. Jamie looking at gay porn (left) and straight porn (right). 30 VICEWORDS AND PHOTOS BY JAMIE LEE CURTIS TAETEPLAYING IT STRAIGHT A Month of Giving Up Everything Gay Thanks to religion and the fact that certain people find butt sex \"totally gross,\" being gay can sometimes be a huge bummer. Due to this, there are some who would like to \"leave the lifestyle.\" But can this be done? Were we \"born this way,\" or do we have a choice? I wanted to find out. My original plan was to attend one of those Christian retreats where you stay in the woods for a week and learn how to appreciate vaginas, but they all require super-intense confidentiality agreements, so I wouldn't have been able to make fun of it in a magazine. After doing some internet research, I (a 5 on the Kinsey scale, slightly less gay than Elton John) decided to spend a month self-administering treatment instead. Here are some popular conversion methods that I tested. REGAINING MY MASCULINITY According to Leanne Payne's 1985 classic Crisis in Masculinity, the main reason men become gay is be- cause they've lost touch with their masculinity. This causes a void in their souls, which they then attempt to fill with other men's dicks. To rectify this situation, I gave my life a full heterosexual makeover: I started re-ferring to my bedroom as my \"man cave,\" stopped keeping my clothes in a wardrobe and started throwing them on my floor, replaced my Wii with an Xbox, tacked a poster of 50 Cent on my wall, abstained from using conditioner, and replaced my iPod's self-conscious mix of fragile indie songs and girly music with white-people rap and soft rock. I also stopped ironically watching Lindsay Lohan flicks and started seri-ously scrutinizing Matt Damon movies, refused to wash my towels or bedsheets, used my bookcase to store empty liquor bottles, read Tracy Morgan's autobiography, only ate meals that took less than 20 minutes to cook in the microwave, drank protein shakes and beers, and took part in a soccer game \"with the lads.\" EFFECTIVENESS: 4 out of 10. The depression that resulted from constantly fixating on every aspect of my behavior served as a welcome distraction from my persistent homosexual thoughts (more on those later). Jamie's gay iPod (top) and straight iPod (bottom). Gay-to-straight bedroom conversion. The 50 Cent poster helped familiarize Jamie with male nudity in a nonsexual context.32 VICEOVERALL EFFECTIVENESS Zip, obviously. I arranged a date with a young lady from the internet to test my heterosexuality, but I canceled at the last minute because leading the poor girl on made me feel like the worst person on earth. Also, I didn't need to test it. Pretending to not be gay doesn't make you any less attracted to men. It just makes you into a self-loathing homo. The only thing I gained from this experiment was a newfound sense of pity for people who stretch this process out over their entire lives. That's too awful to even think about. To summarize: Baby, I'm a fiiiiiiiiirework! REPARATIVE THERAPY Reparative therapy is based around the theory that gays are spawned from a specific parental combination: an overbearing mother and emotionally unavailable fa-ther. This doesn't really apply to me, but that's cool because there are a TON of other things that cause homosexuality: loneliness, sexual abuse, low self-esteem, \"artisticness,\" lack of confidence (anyone who has ever been to a gay-pride parade can confirm that queers lack confidence), repressed childhood trauma, and platonic female friendships. Much like a horo-scope, this applies to every single person on earth. All of the reparative therapy I performed on my- self was based on information given out by big ex-gay organizations like Exodus International and the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality. It was a little difficult for me to find specific instructions because almost every sentence on their sites ends with \"for more information, buy this $40 book.\" Still, I tried my best. The main areas I fo-cused on were \"bioenergetics therapy\" (hitting DAD?!?!\"), (no-homo spooning sessions with straight dudes), and obsessing over every homosexual urge to work out why I was having it (apparently it's because I'm trying to fill gaps in my own personality by having sex with people who possess the traits I want, like a charisma vampire). EFFECTIVENESS: 0 out of 10. It's easy to be cynical about the reparative-therapy movement and say that it's a giant scam that preys on the hopes of desperate people, which is good because I'm feeling lazy today. ABSTINENCE Due to pretty much every psychological group on earth claiming that gay conversion doesn't work, most ex-gay groups have started to focus on abstinence rather than \"curing\" gay people. I abstained from sex and masturbation for the duration of my experiment. Though I thought this would be totally ineffective, it actually had a fairly large impact on my sexuality by making me about 10,000 percent gayer. Now I know why closeted old gay guys cruise under-cover police officers in airport bathrooms and hire male prostitutes to \"carry their luggage.\" I turned into a hypersexual monster. I'm usually a picky person, but by the end of the month I found myself attracted to all adult males, which, when coupled with the fact that I was thinking about sex ALL THE TIME, caused me to develop a really intense and creepy staring problem. At one point I got turned on while watching an argument be- tween Meat Loaf and Gary Busey on Celebrity Apprentice. Ugh. EFFECTIVENESS: -1,000 out of 10. RELIGION Because I live in England and not some developing country like Nigeria, Iran, or the USA, I was unable to locate a church that would perform a gay exorcism on me (lame), or even find one with strong antihomosexual leanings. My best bet was an orga-nization called the Christian Revival Church that, according to their website, believes \"in heterosexual relationships between a natural man and a natural woman within the confines of lawful matrimony. Adherence to this stated principle of sexual behavior is an inherent requirement of membership.\" It's been a while since I've attended a church service, and they've really upped their game since my last visit. For starters, it was held inside a cinema with big La-Z-Boy seats and a Starbucks in the lobby.Instead of the congregation singing hymnals from a book, a guy with gelled hair and dog tags hanging around his neck led a band that played MGMT and Arcade Fire rip-offs with religious lyrics that scrolled across the movie screen like it was a karaoke party for Jesus. The talking part was as boring as ever, but weirdly, the topic of discussion in my final week was Sodom and Gomorrah. Was this a sign from God? I also started praying regularly, which I'd never done before. At first it was a total snoozefest, but eventually I got used to it and it was kind of nice to have ten minutes of quiet time each night. EFFECTIVENESS: 1 out of 10 again. I was going to burn in hell forever, I guess. Touch therapy worked about as well as treating alcoholism with beer bongs. Jamie discovered Christian indie rock was actually worse than the new music on his straight iPod.

Afterward they chanted \"Allahu Akbar!\" and in the process scared the piss out of bewildered holidaying families who had pulled off the highway to use the toilets. The scene was a result of a canceled protest of the French ban on wearing niqabs and burkas in public, which came into effect on April 11. I was BY JAN VAN TIENEN PHOTOS BY BOUDEWIJN BOLLMANNthere to interview Abu Imran, the spokesperson of Sharia4Belgium, one of a new wave of media-friendly Muslim fundamentalist groups who believe that Islamic law will ultimately rule over Europe. A few weeks prior, both Imran and Sharia4UK's Anjem Choudary (who was featured in VBS.TV's Jihad Milkshakes and Royal Wedding documenta-ries) announced the rally via YouTube and invited supporters to join them. The day before the rally, however, French authorities prohibited the demon-stration and arrested 61 would-be protesters. Earlier in the day I had called Imran to ask where in Paris we should meet, and he informed me that the police had detained him at the end of the toll road just north of the city. My traveling companions and I\u2014a photographer and camera-man\u2014immediately hopped in our car and sped toward Imran's location. A bit later, we pulled up to the road where Imran said he was being held and stopped at the tollbooth. ALLAHU AKBAR IN A PARKING LOT European Muslim Fundamentalists Hate Burka Bans but Love French Fries Members of Sharia4UK and Sharia4Belgium pray toward Mecca and, incidentally, in front of a huge Carrefour sign. 36 VICEWe watched as two vans containing Imran and other members of Sharia4Belgium sped away, surrounded by a police escort with sirens blaring. Excited, we told the toll attendant to keep the change and fol-lowed the vans to a police station in an industrial zone about 25 miles north of Paris. After everyone parked their vehicles, about 20 men with beards, djellabas, and head cloths stepped out of their vans and onto the pavement. Policemen stood around, MP5s hanging over their shoulders. When we walked up to the lot, Imran was just being led inside. \"Join the brothers outside,\" he said to me. \"We will talk later.\" A bald, goateed police officer wearing a pair of shades that belonged on a middle-aged bodybuilder told us to wait by our car instead. He assured us that, if we cooperated, we would be able to speak to Imran later. Fifteen minutes later, we asked the officer whether we could film some of the Muslims who were sitting in the grass. He banged his fist on his Kevlar-encased chest and told us that if he had to tell us to leave again there would be \"prob-lemes \u00e9norm\u00e9ment, colossal.\" We waited by the car again, and an hour and a half later the police released everyone except Imran. Three of the Muslims walked up to us, wondering what we were doing there. We explained to them that we were journalists. One of the men told us that Imran was still being detained. \"They gave us no reason why,\" he said. We asked them whether we could still cover the demonstration even though Imran would not be attending. They agreed, and soon we met Imran's replacement: a modest and soft-spoken Belgian-Moroccan man (he would not give us his name) dressed in a white djellaba. It was 1:45 PM. The demonstration had been scheduled to begin 15 min-utes earlier. In no time we were cruising down the highway, wondering what would happen if and when the dem-onstration took place. Fifteen minutes later, their vans pulled into the parking lot of a gas station adjacent to a Carrefour (the French equivalent of a Walmart Supercenter) and we followed them. We later learned that the police had canceled the demonstration, stat-ing that it was \"clearly an incitement to violence and racial hatred,\" and that Jewish groups and others were planning to confront the Muslim protesters, which could easily lead to public disorder. \"We understand that every Muslim or everybody with a beard is being arrested in Paris,\" Imran's re-placement said. \"We're going to wait here until our friends in the city call us to tell where we can meet without police interference.\" A 22-year-old Muslim from Antwerp added, \"Our mothers and sisters have been forced to un-dress themselves. Our basic rights of freedom of religion have been taken from us.\" Everyone turned to watch a bus with about 50 Muslims from the UK drive up to the parking lot. The Belgians warmly greeted their British counter-parts. With a couple of exceptions, all of them were in their late teens to mid-20s. A 30-something bald This is Abu Izzadeen, born Trevor Brooks. He told us Western society is corrupt beyond belief and that the flag of Islam will soon fly over all of Europe. He also told us sperm banks are one of the most depraved institutes imaginable.

This pose was supposed to have been struck in the heart of Paris, but alas, the protest was banned. WWW.ORIGINALPENGUIN.COM \u00a92011 H-D.

I asked him what his deal was and why he and his crew were only now arriving. \"We left at two in the morning from the UK to- day,\" Izzadeen said. \"In Calais, we were held, and our beloved sheikh Anjem Choudary was barred from entering the country. No reason was given. And that's the arbitrary nature of democracy. When laws are man-made instead of God-given, they can be used to deny Muslims their basic rights. You can change them as you see fit. It doesn't apply to Muslims. The demonstration was forbidden because the niqab is seen as a political symbol. Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world. There will come a day when the flag of Islam will be flown over all of Europe\u2014Rome, Paris, and 10 Downing Street. It is inevitable. Whatever Sarkozy and his ex-model wife do, Islam will conquer.\" Never before have I heard the words \"ex-model wife\" spoken with such disdain. Izzadeen also told me that he'd spent three and a half years in a British prison on terrorism charges. While we spoke, young Muslims gathered around us, holding up flags and mugging for the camera. A few of the guys bought french fries at the Carrefour that they insisted on sharing with the crew and me. As we munched on the grub, they tried to convince us of the blessings of Islam. It was funny to watch them go on about the pitfalls of Western society as they stuffed one of the West's most deli-cious culinary treats into their mouths. After some hours of happy bonhomie mixed with more renunciations of man-made democracy, we made preparations to follow the Muslim brothers to Paris. The caravan made a pit stop on the outskirts of the city, and our photographer tried to talk to some women wearing niqabs. Of course, the mood went sour. The Muslims dispersed and wandered off into the city, and we decided to go home to Amsterdam. The next day we learned that Imran was detained until 8 PM, when a couple of Belgian police offi-cers arrived to drive him back to Belgium, where they released him without incident. He told us that while he was in custody in France, Sarkozy's secre-tary allegedly called the station to inform the police that the leader of Sharia4Belgium was barred from entering France. We also realized that Izzadeen (aka Trevor Brooks, aka Sheikh Omar Brooks)\u2014the feisty older gentleman we met in the Carrefour parking lot who was not a fan of Mrs. Sarkozy's pert and mostly hairless body\u2014was a somewhat famous Muslim extremist. And he definitely wasn't lying when he claimed that he had served time in a British prison. In fact, Izzadeen was arrested on charges of terrorism and has been quoted by the Sunday Times as saying that he wants to die a suicide bomber. Oh yeah, he's also stated that the 7/7 bombings of London were \"completely praiseworthy,\" according to the Daily Mail. He's just the type of role model impressionable young Muslims need. This sweet British lad's soft blue eyes and velvety ginger beard made us want to cuddle him to within an inch of his life. We almost cried tears of joy when he said that one day we might \"be Muslim brothers, yeah, and meet in a mosque, yeah?\" The boys happily shared their fries with us. After we accepted, they told us all about the glory of Islam as they chowed down on the infidels' most irresistible delicacy. 40 VICEAs the fashion editor of this very magazine, I frequently have to schlep heavy garment bags around New York City and leaf through look- books of clothing Nathan Barley wouldn't use to hang himself from a closet rod. Consequently, when it's time to shop for myself it sometimes feels like I'm working. Shopping with friends is also difficult be-cause they don't understand that I've already pored over everything on the racks a dozen times over, so I'd rather not wander around SoHo for eight hours while tourists step on the shoes I just bought. About a month ago my situation got me to thinking: If I could shop with anyone in the world who would it be, and would I enjoy it for once? A BY ANNETTE LAMOTHE-RAMOS PHOTOS BY ALIYA NAUMOFFfew weeks later, a friend called to ask if I wanted to help her pick out a new dress and I confessed my dilemma. Somehow the conversation led to Genesis P-Orridge, specifically the time she told Ian Svenonius he could look just like her for $50. After we hung up, I opened my laptop, googled around until I found the contact info for Genesis's publicist, and wrote an email asking whether she would like to go on a shopping spree with me on Vice's dime. Later in the day I panicked. I had just asked the pandrogynous, gold-toothed founding member of Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV to be my gal pal while we spent a day buying crap we didn't need. Would she get pissed and cast a hex on me with a psychick cross? Thankfully, I wasn't left in suspense for long. I re- ceived an email from Genesis the next day: She was very much into the idea. We corresponded through-out the week, and she warned me that she had given up on trying to appear fashionable after being diag-nosed with diabetes (a side effect of contracting a parasite during a visit to her beloved Nepal). But she needed to get some biker patches made and could use a new pair of boots, so we set a date. A few days later, I was knocking on her door. It swung open, and there she stood with a bleached blond bob, denim vest, black t-shirt, raw washed jeans, and Supra high-tops. Things were a bit awk-ward at first (the photographer, two cameramen, and producer in the room probably had something to do with that), but we tried to make chitchat while Genesis showed us her prized biker vests. As we waited for the elevator, I could tell she was uncomfortable, but she was still being polite. The drive to a Brooklyn flea market would be the true test of her tolerance. I attempted some small talk as we walked to our rental van. I asked her about her building, which I had noticed was largely occupied by Hasidic Jews. She told me that all the children were afraid of her, and everyone had been nicer when she first moved in because they thought she was a \"real\" woman. I sensed a hint of sadness in her voice and couldn't help but glare at everyone who gawked at us as we exited the building and piled into the van. Making our way toward Brooklyn, I casually asked about one of her tattoos\u2014a leather glove with a nurse on top. She told me it was a tribute to her late wife, Lady Jaye, who worked as both a nurse and a dominatrix. The vibe in the van quickly snowballed into noticeable uneasiness as Genesis re-counted the story of Lady Jaye's funeral, specifically her body drifting down the Bagmati River engulfed in flames. I responded with, \"That's a beautiful send-off,\" which is easily the dumbest thing I've ever said. She ignored that remark and continued to rehash the painful memories that my innocent ques-tions brought flooding back. We were off to a really great start. As we parked outside the flea market in Fort Greene, I slowly began to feel like Genesis was one of my mother's best friends instead of someone no-torious for jacking off onstage. We walked around the market, digging through piles of 60s erotica nov-els and discarded grade-school prize ribbons that PSYCHICK CHIC A Lovely Day of Shopping With Genesis P-OrridgeWe bought Genesis this black shoulder cape at a flea market in Brooklyn.

CHAD MUSKAPHOTOS: ATIBA JEFFERSON 42 VICEseemed to interest Genesis for whatever reason. Then she saw the bear head. Gen (at this point I felt comfortable enough to abbreviate her name) wanted it for an upcoming museum exhibit. We tried haggling with the lumberjack-looking asshole selling it, but the guy wouldn't budge. Instead we settled for a Liberace-style velvet cape and some 70s Penthouse mags. Happy with our treasures, we decided to celebrate over some champagne. We got a table at a nearby Italian restaurant and promptly ordered two bottles of the bubbly. Finally, everyone seemed to loosen up. I listened as Gen recounted some of her past: There was her father, who rode motorcycles in the British Army\u2014a man who never approved of her lifestyle. His last words to Gen were, \"You disappoint me.\" Then there was her mother, who passed away just last year. Although she was more accepting, she wasn't exactly supportive, contact-ing Genesis only once in the last 30-odd years. Our conversation took a weird turn as she spoke about her devotion to Santeria\u2014Gen's an Olorisha, an official priestess of the religion. She expounded on various rituals and then explained to me the significance of the life-size doll that once sat in my grandmother's apartment. I always wondered about that thing because it scared the shit out of me. It was decked out in expensive jewelry, and later she mysteriously buried it fully clothed. Apparently, my sweet Gran practiced Santeria as well. The burial was an offering to a God named Oshun, affectionately known as \"the per-fumed whore\" and the deity worshipped by Gen and Jaye. Four hours had passed since we first set out, and there was little to show for it except a good buzz and a stack of nudie mags. We weren't going to hit all the shops we wanted to visit if we didn't leave soon, so we quickly paid our bill and set off for Greenpoint to order some biker patches from a weird sporting-goods store. A group of Puerto Rican guys stared us down as we walked into the shop. Gen ignored them, of course, and casually mentioned that they were known as the Lost Boys\u2014a gang she'd frequently seen in Ridgewood, Queens, where she lived with Lady Jaye before relocating to Manhattan after her death. As she browsed the store, Genesis with her favorite pillow. We tried to haggle with the owner of this bear head, but he wasn't having it. He wouldn't budge off his $350 price tag and kept saying, \"But he's such a handsome guy!\" What a dick. Genesis will always take first prize in our hearts.44 VICEshe told us that she once owned a 1979 BSA and used to hang out with the Hells Angels at their chapter in her hometown of Manchester. Their New York branch is off-limits to Gen because Jaye once dated an Angel, but at 61 years old she wants to ride again. I quickly glanced over at her order form: She wanted a gross quantity of rectan-gular patches in black and red that spelled FUCK 'EM ALL . It was getting dark as we headed to Trash and Vaudeville, our last stop whether we liked it or not since Gen needed to be home by nine. Jimmy Webb, the store mascot and Gen's old friend, greeted us amicably. He rummaged through the racks, and as he picked out clothes he looked over at Gen and said, \"Isn't that the most beautiful face you've ever seen?\" Later, when she told him that his ass was hanging out of his pants, he shrugged and yelled, \"If I would've known you were going to be here today I wouldn't have worn any underwear!\" I can only imagine what he was alluding to, but we were out of time so I bought Gen some boots and we drove her home. Before saying good-bye, I invited Gen to a movie the next night. I was speechless when she agreed. Without a video crew in tow, Sunday night's vibe was much more intimate and friendly. We started our evening at Employees Only, where Gen downed three fraise sau-vages as I stuffed my face with bread in an attempt to keep my rabid enthusiasm at bay. We talked about our dogs and the serial killer who's recently been terrorizing Long Island, and she told me my messy bun looked \"very chic.\" Then we finished up and headed to the movie. She fell asleep right after the opening credits and snored through the rest of the flick. It was kind of sweet. By the time the movie let out, it was pretty late, and she was obviously ready to go back to sleep. As we walked out, she claimed the film was just \"all right,\" but I knew better. In the last few minutes I spent with her, I saw that she'd finally let her guard down and was having a pretty good time. She thanked me for getting her out of the house and told me to give her a call again soon. On the way home, I thought, \"Am I now friends with Genesis P-Orridge?\" It felt pretty awesome.

It's so far south, in fact, that it is closer to Tunisia (70 miles) than Sicily (130 miles), and latitudinally it is actually lower than Tunis and Algiers. The island itself is tiny, with a population of 6,300 full-time inhabitants. In the rst weeks of February, following the oust- ing of Tunisian president Zine-El Abidine Ben Ali, more than 4,000 North African immigrants fl ed across the Mediterranean Sea and pulled ashore on the idyllic isle. That's when the Italian government and media started squawking about an \"immigrant emergency!\" and a \"Lampedusan crisis!\" Tunisians and other refugees con-tinued to pour in, Italy and the rest of Europe battled over where the refugees should be allowed to relocate, and the island was so overcapacity that the situation could have easily escalated into a full-fl edged riot. All told, at least 20,000 people landed on Lampedusa, which had nowhere near the appropriate amount of water, sewage systems, or medical facilities to support the sudden infl ux. The local Center for Identi cation and Expulsion (CIE)\u2014a cross between a shelter and a prison that houses fresh-off-the-boat immigrants\u2014has a maximum capacity of 800 people but was \"hosting\" as many as 2,500. The predicament reached a critical point on March 28, when 2,000 asylum seekers entered Lampedusa within a 24-hour period. It wasn't long before Italian interior minister Roberto Maroni announced that Italy would force many of the immigrants to return to Africa if Tunisia's government couldn't halt the perpetual stream of humanity. On March 30, Italian prime minister Silvio \"Sit on My Face\" Berlusconi visited the island and put on his usual show, announcing in a single press conference that he would: evacuate all the immigrants from the island with-in 60 hours, \"propose Lampedusa for the Nobel Peace Prize,\" give the islanders a bunch of tax breaks, look into building a new golf course and casino on the island, and buy a villa on Lampedusa. After Berlusconi's song-and-dance routine, around half the refugees were issued temporary visas and moved to other CIEs around Italy. (Many have since tried to en-ter France\u2014Tunisia's former occupier\u2014but the French border police have been making this very dif cult.) The other half have been repatriated to Tunisia. In short, thousands of Tunisians are bouncing around the EU and the Mediterranean, causing all sorts of problems for European governments. This is Ahmed in the Matinas' house, wearing hand-me-down clothes. The family would cook six and a half pounds of pasta at a time to feed dozens of immigrants, along with providing them jackets to wear. Obviously, the Lampedusans were angry that this type of story\u2014more common than one would think\u2014never made it in the papers. 74 VICE WORDS AND PHOTOS BY GUIDO GAZZILLI The Realities of Lampedusa's Refugee CrisisTOO MANY TUNISIANS, NOT ENOUGH TOILETSApproximately 60 immigrants wait to get on a bus that will take them to a boat destined for mainland Italy. 76 VICEOn April 11, a rebellion of the immigrants housed in the Lampedusan CIE led to a re and more deportations. As of press time, most of the immigrants have been ferried off the island, but the implications of this mass exodus are still unclear. European and Mediterranean nations will be dealing with the problem for some time to come as the new arrivals try to nd work and housing. One of Vice's most trusted Italian photographers, Guido Gazzilli, recently returned from a trip to the island. The rst thing he said to us was, \"The media are full of shit.\" Our interest piqued, we asked him to show us some pic-tures and tell us what he saw. I went to Lampedusa when the \"emergency\" was on ev-ery Italian's mind. It was the front page of every paper, the opener for every news cycle, and the topic of every talk show. I had seen many images and news stories that depicted Lampedusans as being furious at the devastation of the island by immigrants who were essentially squat-ting everywhere. The papers and TV broadcasts made it seem like the locals were wary of leaving their homes, their day-to-day lives destroyed. The moment I landed, however, I quickly realized that Lampedusa looked more like a North African shing island than an Italian one: Its colors, the wooden boats, the orange light, the sunburned grass, even the faces of the natives, looked North African. During my rst hours on the island, I had trouble telling the locals apart from the immigrants. I also rapidly became aware that all of Italy had been force-fed a giant plate of bullshit by the media. The situation was the opposite of what had been reported: I witnessed charity. I saw the locals taking in these immigrants, feeding and clothing them. Some families hosted three or four immigrants under their roofs, while others let them sleep in their boats or their garages. I saw the Red Cross give out free meals twice a day. I was shocked at the difference between what I witnessed with my own eyes and what I'd seen on the news. Reporters had sensationalized it all and, as usual, had tried to tell the scariest possible version of the story to instill fear and drive up circulation and ratings. I also realized that all the TV-news crews and big-shot journalists did little more than hang out at the docks, lm- ing the boats arriving and departing. I didn't see any of them mixing with the townspeople, visiting them in their homes, or telling their true stories. Of course, this led to the locals mistrusting reporters. They didn't like the tales that were being told about their island and instinctively didn't trust me. But I think they saw that I was there on The authorities selected who would leave and who wouldn't, seemingly at random. Obviously, the immigrants would say anything (\"I'm sick,\" \"My leg's broken\") just to get on the boat and leave the island. The officers would then choose 60 at a time and escort them to the loading docks. These are the makeshift tents on the \"Hill of Shame,\" where the majority of the island's immigrants set up camp. After Berlusconi swept them all off the island, Guido snuck into their \"homes\" to take these pictures. Some of them had been living in dwellings like these for almost a month. VICE 77my own, without assistants or big cameras or jackets with pockets, cables, and logos. They began to understand that I was asking to talk to them honestly and tell their stories, so eventually opened their doors to me. I immediately recognized the church as the center of activity. In terms of providing aid to the immigrants, the church was everywhere. The priests and the volunteers helped them economically, fed them, and organized a drive for secondhand clothes. I met two local volunteers\u2014Pippo and Maurizio\u2014who helped the immigrants nd showers and get cleaned up. The CIE has been packed to the brim for months and some people had been living in the streets without water, food, or electricity. The CIE's capacity is around 800, but when I arrived there were between 1,200 and 1,400 people staying there. There was also a center for women and chil-dren\u2014a converted American army base built during World War II that contained approximately 200 refugees\u2014and another center for older minors, which also housed around 200 or 300 souls. By my estimate, there were another 5,000 to 6,000 immigrants living outside the holding structures. Everything and anything the volunteers did helped the situ-ation, and most of the island's population had transformed into a huge volunteer force overnight. Most of the new arrivals were staying on what the Italian media dubbed, with their usual fl air for the dramatic, the \"Hill of Shame,\" which was located directly behind the docks. It looked like an improvised slum. Every morning, the Tunisians would move from the hill to the docks and wait there all day, hoping to get picked by the authori-ties\u2014who made their selections without any discernible method\u2014to get on one of the boats leading to CIEs in Civitavecchia, Crotone, or Campobasso. Shockingly, many of the stranded didn't realize that Lampedusa wasn't mainland Italy until they set foot on the island. Some of the most desperate tried escaping from the CIE, as if they would be able to walk across 500 miles of sea to the Italian mainland. The guards set out to look for them nonetheless. Pippo and Maurizio introduced me to a local Catholic family\u2014the Matinas\u2014who were hosting a lot of immi-grants. That's how I met Ahmed, a 23-year-old Tunisian.

He had been on the island nine days and was constantly on the move, trying to gure out whether he could get papers, attempting to reach an uncle who had emigrated to Italy years before, and happy to be on dry land even though he was nervous about possibly having to be sent back to Tunisia. Compared with those who didn't nd a hospitable family like the Matinas, Ahmed was lucky. The Matinas even wanted him to stay on the island permanently and were hoping to get him a job at a local bar, but Ahmed had to be moved to another CIE. Before leaving, he gave their daughter his Koran as a gift. She gave him her cruci x. Since then, I've kept in touch with Ahmed. I visited him in his current CIE in Civitavecchia, which holds 400 people. My wish is to continue to follow him around, help him, and, if I can, reach his uncle in Sicily. Ahmed told me he that he earned 60 euros a month as a waiter in Djerba (the largest island in North Africa, off the coast of Tunisia), where he lived before heading to Lampedusa. To get to Italy he had to pay border crossers 800 euros (approximately $1,150) for a 25-hour boat ride in a tiny shing vessel packed with another two dozen Tunisians. His mother had sold half her belongings in order to help him pay for the trip. \"I left for my future, for my family,\" he told me. \"For my mother. I can only thank God, who helped me cross over and made me meet this wonderful family, who took me in. The Lampedusans have good hearts. They are kind to Algerians, Tunisians, Moroccans, and Libyans. There is no racism, unlike the French. I only ask God that he grant me luck, and to be able to send my mother to Mecca and to buy her a nice house and a gold bracelet.\" This is an old storage area that immigrants found on a hill, close to the beach. Dozens slept here. It smelled very bad. \"The Lampedusans have good hearts, \" Ahmed told me. \"They are kind to Algerians, Tunisians, and Libyans. \"80 VICE VICE 81BY PAUL MALISZEWSKI PHOTOS BY JASON FULFORDA PRAYER AND TWO PARABLES FROM MY WINDOW, I CAN SEE THE BUS shelter. A woman is walking away from it, and there's a man underneath, standing. Both are dressed in the clothes of the season, and both are angry. The man I have seen before. I call him Screamer. I hear him before I see him. In this way he is not like a jet fighter. Today, Screamer has a splint on his nose, making it longer and more pointed. When he screams, his splint quivers. Much of what he screams is profane, curses and swears. He often screams, Asshole fall off the fucking earth. In the mornings, I hear him coming from the west, walking toward downtown. Later, in the evenings, he returns, walking toward the suburbs. He keeps a fairly tight schedule, Screamer does. In this way he is not un-like people who work at jobs downtown. Always he is angry. Always he is screaming. I have seen Screamer look over his shoulder, back at the suburbs in the morning or back downtown in the evening, and I wonder what to make of that looking back. My first thought was that he was being followed. Someone was after him. He had made someone angry. My second thought was that he just believes he's being followed. Whatever the case, Screamer is always yelling at the place he leaves, yelling at what he leaves behind. In this way he is not unlike you, or us, those, say, who have ever felt disappointed by the most recently passed experience, the last big letdown, that time we let our-selves think we were lucky, blessed, made from gold and promises. Precious stones never did rain on us. Which brings me again to what I see from my win- dow. The bus shelter. The woman walking away. Screamer standing underneath. The woman is angry. Screamer, she thinks, screams at her. And why shouldn't she take Screamer personally? Perhaps he told her, Asshole fall off the fucking earth. The woman bends down to pick something up, and I think she's going to throw something. I think, She's go-ing to hit Screamer. But it's just snow, and the snow is so powdery and dry, it scatters immediately after leaving her hand. She might as well have hurled a handful of dust. And Screamer still screams. The woman's hair has come undone under her scarf, and she pauses a second to fix it. Screamer curses her, more loudly this time. Asshole, he says. Fall off the fucking earth. The woman walks away, and then the woman comes back. She walks to the corner, and then she comes back. This time, the woman spits at Screamer. And still, Screamer screams. Once more the woman walks away and comes back. And once more she spits at Screamer. As she walks away, I hear her say, I could kill you.From my window, I see the woman crossing the street and walking along the hillside. Screamer is still at the bus shelter and still cursing. Maybe this will be the last time I see him. Maybe someone will kill him. Maybe some people will return for him and do what, I do not know. Fuck him up good. I wish I could intervene. I want to manifest myself on the ground, between Screamer and the woman. I want to move between them. I want to say, Wait, please, you don't understand. Hold back your blows, OK? Stay, for a second, the stones you've selected for this man's skull. And what if the woman then came upstairs to my apartment? What if she could see what I see? Look, from my window. I'm asking you. Perhaps something would come of it: me, on the ground, meeting Screamer, while she sits upstairs. With the woman may come the hundreds, maybe the thousands, of people who will ever meet Screamer outside, on the streets and on the side-walks. They all can crowd into my apartment, jostling for a view, a seat, a spot by the window. But can I say, really, that I wouldn't feel insulted?Asshole fall off the fucking earth.There is spit, and then there is the anger, like finger- tips gripping my scalp. The short stories of Paul Maliszewski are laser-focused and perfectly terse, but they are also enigmatic. Anyone who knows anything about the form will recognize these as ideal traits. Last December, Vice publi shed Paul's \"The Parable of Wood and Fire\" in our annual Fiction Issue. It was part of an ongoing series that began in 1995 and has now been collected in Prayer and Parable, which is out this month from Fence Books. The stories largely fall under two categories: humans hating and loving each other (the prayers) and more oblique narratives that go nowhere but say everything (the parables). It was only logical to excerpt a few of the stories and couple them with three new photos from Jason Fulford, who shot the cover of Prayer and Parable and whose work, like Paul's, is confounding in the best of ways. PRAYER FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC SCREAMER VICE 83MY OPPONENT ALWAYS ANNOUNCES himself the same way. He says, I have a bum. Warn-ing. I know he means bomb, but he pronounces it in the pinched way of the British. Bum. Warning. I have a bum. Yet he is not British. He has, in fact, never ventured outside the States. He does, however, have a bomb. That is why he's my opponent, my dear enemy. The city is our battlefield. Streets and avenues have, for me, pugilistic significance, a long history of beat-ings and many losses. You may walk past these sites without knowing it. I have met my opponent in fields, in parks, in city squares. He has met me on board buses, subways, and monorails. We have fought un-der overpasses and over rivers. I have struggled against him amidst the carnivals of summer. He has found me cowering in the beverage aisle of a grocery store, hiding in the shadow of a pyramid of Coca-Cola. In tropi-cal restaurants, cool rooms, windy vistas, on snowy heights, there is, we believe, no place we haven't al-ready fought. Were you unwittingly in attendance at some of our more celebrated bouts? We have wrestled atop buildings, decorating the skyline like two feisty hood ornaments. Always the game is simple, as my opponent takes pains to point out: one fall, mano a mano, me or the man with the bomb. When I fight, however, I am at an immediate dis- advantage. When I try to punch him, there's no force behind it. I draw back my arm, but that's it; that's all I have time for. When I try to run, I escape from nothing. I am always caught in midturn, pivoting and pushing off with my strong foot, but no more. Caught and then hit and then hit again, I fall. There is something in me that works against the punch, against my flight; it sub-verts each of my attempts. It is like misdirection. It is like the fact that water is at its thickest, its most dense, seconds before freezing. It, I say, because it hasn't any name. It is all effect and no identity. In my most produc-tive moments I come up with descriptions of it; I test them against my experience, comparing them against my bruises, measuring them alongside my memories of the man standing over me and laying into my body with whatever happened to be handy\u2014a socket wrench, a golf club, a tire iron, a stick. It is like second-guessing raised to the power of ten. It is like an interior mono-logue as loud as a rock concert. It is like the flashlights of a hundred righteous accusers. Everything I do, anything I try, whatever I can manage, it is in double slo-mo. This is the cruelty of fighting underwater.Do I even need to tell you that my opponent is not similarly afflicted? Other opponents trade in casual menace. They like to say, I've been watching you, or, I know where you live. My opponent says, I know what you feel. He de-scribes my small, daily failures to me. As if I didn't know. His assessments are pinches that leave marks on the inside of my skin. He tells me, You are the Neville Chamberlain of your extended family. Or he says, Your love is like the plastic cups left over from a party. My body serves up for him a set of ready meta-phors. Your stomach is a growing pit, he says, down which fall the snakes of your seven indiscretions. They are like arrows, their heads like arrowheads, and they move, constantly, one over another. Are you feeling that? he says. When I don't answer, he asks, Don't you understand? I'm not sure, I say. Then, after some thought, No, not really, I guess. I'm talking about your insignificance, he says, as if it could all be so plain. I get what you're saying, I tell him. In general, I mean, but you lose me on the specifics most of the time. My opponent actually looks sort of hurt. Should I be less gnomic or something? he says. I shrug. It would, I guess, be a start.Consider arrows, he says, speaking more slowly this time. Arrows in an empty stomach. Now do you see why I fight him? Even though my moves are slow? My efforts futile? I fight him because I must. I have no other choice, I think. When I'm not fighting my opponent, I see other people whom I imagine are fighting their opponents, on other nights, in distant parts of a darkened globe. Between dinner and dawn, the city is turned over to these fights. A long fight card every night. Many matches and many falls. Who are these people? How can you recognize them? They are those who misbut-ton an article of clothing. They are those who react last and late to a joke. We are the people whom you find always looking down and seemingly in. Eye con-tact is for the foolish when it is night and an opponent is about. We stumble frequently, unfazed. We step into traffic, neither surprised nor frightened when we real-ize our mistake. Not a day goes by that we do not find ourselves stopping people like you and asking for directions in the city of our birth.PARABLE OF A MERCIFUL END TO DREAMS OF FIGHTING UNDERWATER 82 VICE 84 VICE VICE 85THE NEW NIGHTCLUB OPENED LAST WEEK, and now everyone is trying to get inside. The new night-club is fabulous, according to every indication, offering entertainment beyond measure, joy and conviviality in un-paralleled quantities. Consider the new nightclub's stereo. Its sound system, speakers, mixing board, and turntables are together larger, more expensive, and more powerful than the stereos of the top five most popular nightclubs com-bined. The stereo's wiring would, if stretched end to end, run for seventy-seven miles, connecting cities to their sub-urbs. It loops underground, beneath the glass dance floor, and then circles overhead, in the rafters and around the ex-posed beams of the building, which, once upon a time, was a warehouse or a tannery, a potato-chip company or dress-shoe factory, something, in any case, that did something for someone, back when. Nobody can remember now. The new nightclub's wire is bound together in thick, menacing coils, blue wires and black wires all feeding into intricately webbed nodes and impressive muscular bunches. It is as if the club powered itself off the flayed body of a giant. The new nightclub's blue wire is the blue of 4 AM seen before sleep; its black wire is truly black indeed. I haven't yet been inside the new nightclub when it's turned on, when the lights are up and people pack the open spaces and drinks are being drunk. During the day, I worked on the second auxiliary electrical crew, brought on board by one of the subcontractors, this guy I know who used to date my sister. I wired up a set of lights mounted on these robotic arms, metal appendages, starved in appear-ance, that supported these other things that someone else, hired by another subcontractor, worked on. The DJ booth in the new nightclub can unleash various special effects, the sort that would not seem out of place in large-budget movies. I've heard talk of lasers and ho-lograms, even green screens. Supposedly parts of the club can be rear-projected into whole other areas, like scenery. Also, the bar is actually three bars, three bars each on three separate levels, each decorated according to a unique style or mood. The owner of the new nightclub is a stickler for details, so the moods of the bars are very much like the moods of people, very lifelike. The new nightclub is where the old nightclub used to be, before the old owner closed its doors, boarded the win-dows, and sold off all the furniture and stereo equipment in an auction sparsely attended by bargain hunters and just some curious lookers-on who felt they had some connec-tion to the place. Nothing from the old nightclub survives in the new one.People who have never even given a thought to going to a nightclub feel the inkling or perhaps pressure of having to go to this one, of needing to go, if only to see it, maybe just once. To see what it's like, they say. For something to do, they say. They all have their reasons, and their reasons are the same three or four. It's a childish wish, this desire to be inside the new night- club. Childish not in the sense of being simple, but rather because it reminds me of times I overheard my parents and their friends at parties. It was usually someone's birth-day or anniversary, the occasion was never all that clear or important. What mattered was that I could hear their voices, the sound of their voices, but I could not discern the words themselves. I would hear laughter and I would think, Someone just told a joke. Who told a joke? Who was it? What was the joke, exactly? How did it go? The laughter went on. Laughter carried, words did not. I could hear nothing except sounds of what I knew to be conversa-tion. It was incredibly frustrating, this feeling. Inside the new nightclub there is another, smaller, more exclusive nightclub, and inside that smaller, more exclusive nightclub, there is a smaller nightclub still. Five nightclubs at least are nested inside one another like so. After work one day, a few days before we finished and the foreman, as they say, let us go, I was talking to a guy who worked alongside me, this guy who put the things on the ends of the metal appendages I was working on. Anyway, this guy swore that there are at least nine nested nightclubs inside one another. He personally knew of at least nine, and he suspected there could be even more, each smaller, each more exclusive, each located inside the other. And at the center of it all, at the center of this series of clubs within clubs, there is a room, supposedly no bigger than a large box, like the sort of box a refrigerator comes packaged in. The owner of the new nightclub has had this room decorated sparsely, with a table and a chair and a candle on the table and a pillow on the chair. The table is not larger than a pad of paper. The candle is the size of a dime. The chair is plain. The pillow is more suggestion and gesture than pillow. What's more, the walls around the table are not in fact walls. On closer inspection, they reveal themselves to be speakers that look and feel like walls. Solid speakers. From the floor to the ceiling of the room, nothing but speakers. When the stereo is on, and the music is going, a person admitted to the room that lies at the center of the series of clubs within clubs can hear nothing else, nothing to indicate that there's anything else anywhere else outside or inside the room, nothing other than the room itself and the person inside it.

His photog- raphy has won him all sorts of fancy honors (for starters, a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Lange-Taylor documentar y prize), and it makes perfect sense that some of his best work has focused on Russia and Ukraine. The latter is where he completed his Interrogations series. Somehow Donald gained unprecedented access to a police station in Ukraine and sat in on interrogation sessions as the young, old, rich, and poor broke down and owned up to their dirty deeds, even if the charges against them were questionable. As Donald puts it: \"Without confessions and guilty pleas, courts everywhere would grind to a halt in an instant; more than 90 percent of all charges in the Russian and Ukrainian judicial systems end in guilty pleas, and only experienced criminals and highly educated defendants stand a chance. This is what the cops are doing behind their closed doors\u2014the feudal system's trial by ordeal is still much with us.\" The following pages feature selected photos from the Interrogations book, which will be released by Schilt Publishing this fall. The crimes of the accused are listed underneath their photos.

I got the feeling it was the kind of place where one must be careful not to wander too far toward the back room, lest one never come out. Even as the shopkeeper chatted with another customer, I could feel his eyes watching me. In front of one counter displaying Luftwaffe cufflinks and K-rations, I found myself staring at a publication ti-tled Horseshit. The cover featured a crisp illustration of a man with a face wrapped in barbed wire. It recalled Winston Smith's cover of the Dead Kennedys' Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death. Clearly, I thought, this was a punk zine I'd never heard of. What was it doing here? I opened it and immediately discerned three things: 1) The magazine predated punk by at least ten years. 2) It was full of extremely arousing draw- ings of nude women. 3) It was also full of disturbing antimili- tary propaganda (babies on bayonets, marines as drooling ghouls) that, if the guy behind the counter knew what I was looking at, would probably result in my ass getting kicked.BY SAM McPHEETERSILLUSTRATIONS BY ROBERT M.

So Why Has No One Heard of It? 94 VICE 96 VICE Horseshit was responsible (along with Zap, Snatch, and the SCUM Manifesto) for the arrest of Berkeley bookseller Moe Moskowitz on charges of selling pornography. A year later, Frank Zappa referenced the magazine in his track \"German Lunch.\" Beyond those two intriguing historical morsels, Horseshit occupies a void. A few online booksellers offered complete sets of the magazine\u2014all four issues for $150. By chance I found a website selling the set for consider- ably less, and I jumped at the opportunity. But as soon as I placed the order, I felt duped. Was it really possible that this magazine had slipped under the radar of everyone I knew? A dark paranoia festered: It all began to feel like an elaborate scam that would end with the eBay seller and the aggressive military-surplus-store guy splitting the cash down the middle. Two weeks later, the magazines arrived. The cover of issue 1 features line art of a US Army soldier of indeterminate rank cradling an automatic rifle. His other hand is holding aloft an apparently dead infant that he has just bagged, like a mallard. Below the magazine's title is the legend THE OFFENSIVE REVIEW and, under this, in the bottom corner, ATTACK! The fine print informed me that it was published by Gauntlet Press of Hermosa Beach, California. Incredibly, the magazine is dated 1965. The issue begins with a polite and brief intro: \"Some time ago, two young men, brothers named Bob and Tom Dunker, decided that there was a real need for a magazine that would combine strong, fearless, humorous drawings with witty, intelligent, outspoken writing... Remember that when you read an ordinary magazine, you are reading what some writer thinks you will want to read, not his own opinions... Horseshit doesn't have this problem. It is the work of men, not the product of a committee.\" The first article, \"On Naming the Magazine,\" depicts a dramatic dialogue in which three characters brainstorm magazine titles. The characters conceive and debate a long list: Asshole, The Clitoris, Contraceptive (\"It's no good, you can't send contraceptives through the mail\"), The Cow Flop, Cunts I Have Known, The Curse, The Diarrhea of Anne Frank, Dildo, Flatulence, The Hermosa Bitch, The Hermosa Rag (\"a John, The Masturbation Manual, The Nocturnal Emission, Nooky, Prick, Screw (three years before Al Goldstein's Screw), Self Abuse for the Obtuse, The Shaft, The Strumpet, Supposi-Stories, Ten Inches, The Toilet Paper, Twat, Urine, and Washington's Monument. Right out of the gate, Horseshit's publishers have some self-referential fun with the absurdity of their situation and eventual creation: Bob: The Whore's Home Companion? Gordon: Right, a magazine designed to be read in the par-lors of whorehouses while waiting your turn to go upstairs. [The character of Gordon, perhaps based on a real-life third partner, vanishes after this brief appearance.]I looked up. The owner was indeed staring straight at me, even while conversing with the other customer. \"Excuse me,\" I said as I lifted the magazine. \"How much for this?\" The two men stopped talking. The owner sized me up with undisguised disgust. \"That's NOT for sale,\" he finally replied. I nodded and backed out the front entrance, his hateful death-ray gaze following me onto the street. It was a confusing and mysterious introduction to a con- fusing and mysterious magazine. Later I scouted for clues about Horseshit online, but there weren't many. I learned from one website that the maga-zine was published by two brothers, Thomas and Robert Dunker (Thomas, a paraplegic, died in 2003). In 1968, VICE 97 Other articles include: An odd short story from the perspective of an East Indian villager Four pages of adult aphorisms (\"Life is a slut, full of hidden sores and secret smells\") and dirty poetry A personal reminiscence on sex education \"Ready, White, and Blue,\" a four-page antimilitary pictorial drawn in the blocky style of contemporary political cartoons A one-page short story \"The Plot to Kill the Queen,\" which ends with a finger-in-the-hole-of-a-dyke pun An eight-page sketchbook full of naked young women with gloriously furry crotches A ten-page teleplay about patients in a VA hospital An editorial about statutory rape (the Dunkers appar-ently disapproved of adults being imprisoned for having sex with consenting minors) The two-page \"Support Your Loco [sic] Police\" \"Boob Golf,\" a cartoon spread that clearly belonged in Playboy In Horseshit I saw the clear outlines of aesthetics later used by the Church of the SubGenius, Crass Records, Devo, the Feederz, and Raymond Pettibon. As a former voracious fanzine collector, I marveled that I'd never heard of it (incidentally, Thurston Moore, allegedly a ma-jor zine collector, turned down my interview request for this article). I kept returning to my weird doubt: Was the magazine an elaborate hoax produced in the 21st cen-tury? Wilder things have happened. It's useful to take stock of how weird and different 1965 was compared with modern times. It was much more Mad Men than Woodstock. Mad magazine had instigated American youth culture's shift toward the anarchic left, but it would be almost a decade before they published their infamous middle-finger cover. National Lampoon had yet to be conceived, and Monty Python's debut was four years away. The Dunkers' focused, antagonistic nonconformity was extremely jarring in a time when unabashed dissent was a nascent form of expression. Next to someone like Lenny Bruce\u2014whose solo stand against the agents of prud-ishness at least resulted in lasting notoriety\u2014the Dunkers barely garnered any cultural significance whatsoever. What's most amazing is that Horseshit offered something several shades beyond nonconformity without a support system of any kind\u2014no powerful rock-star friends, no charitable lefty lawyers to get them out of sticky jams, and no masses of youth willing to help their cause. The varied styles of art in Horseshit suggest several different artists. The illustrations are professional yet uncompromising, perfectly capturing the nonconformityof the Dunkers. There are studied line-art nudes (mostly, but not exclusively, women), sloppier crosshatched nudes, staid little spot illustrations, and frenzied doodles of military brutes and sexual perversions. The magazine's signature bullet\u2014a pictograph of a hand giv-ing the middle finger\u2014looks like the polished logo of a hip contemporary skateboarding company. Until I read the words \"all the drawings in this magazine are by Robert M. Dunker,\" I thought at the very least that the Dunkers had tapped into some sort of mid-60s adult clip-art treasure trove. Considering the intentionally marginal nature of the magazine juxtaposed with the professional artwork it con-tained, I wondered whether other periodicals had swiped Dunker's work over the years as if it were royalty-free clip art. I would discover later that many, including Playboy , allegedly did just that. Horseshit's obvious contemporary, Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts, had access to a high caliber of early-60s thinkers and artists: Burroughs, Ginsberg, Warhol, and others. Fuck You's presentation, however, was ama-teurish ephemera\u2014a junior high schooler's mimeographed poetry zine. If you can ignore its title, Horseshit is a slick, serious publication that would be just as at home in a doc-tor's office as in a brothel parlor. Issue 2 is dated 1967. The format remains the same, but by this time the Dunker brothers had changed the name of their pub-lishing company from Gauntlet (a preexisting \"homosexual pub-lication\") to Scum. It also seems like they were expressing even angrier sentiments than those in the first issue, opening with a story about a young man who refuses to be thrown into a volcano, and this statement: \"If you haven't caught on that our society uses human sacrifice, don't read this magazine. Horseshit is a mes-sage from the jungle. It is dangerous. If you read it, you In Horseshit I saw the clear outlines of aesthetics later used by the Church of the SubGenius, Crass Records, and Raymond Pettibon.VICE 99may find yourself agreeing with some of the things we say. Then people will think you are either crazy or a traitor. Go watch human sacrifices instead. Maybe you can be next.\" Contents include: \"Canonize JFK Now\": a piece mocking the martyrdom of Kennedy with deep, acidic sarcasm \"Cunt Is a Christian Word\": A dreadful two-page poem (\"There is no cock as big and rough as the one your church has thrust in you\") with an exquisite layout. Curiously, one illustration of a spread-eagled naked woman omits her genitalia. Possible self-censorship? An article on providing sexual education to federal judges \"The Fetishist,\" a comic featuring a deviant anthro-pomorphized shoe in which the shoe man locks the bedroom door, goes to the closet, finds a rack of small human beings, and ecstatically rubs one out all over its shoe body before a bunch of police shoes kick in the door \"The Last Words of Jefferson Monroe Just Before He Was Torn to Pieces on the Floor of Congress,\" written in the style of a contemporary teleplay, but with lots of non-contemporary language (Sample dialogue: \"All you do is suck on the assholes of your rich masters!\") Ten pages of whimsical \"Patriotic Drawings\" that look like they belong in a dirty-minded kid's coloring book A six-page spread on the Kama Sutra, written like an explicit Mad gag A two-page spread of jokes about women A page of \"Quickies,\" including a chastisement of black Muslims: \"The Muslims have been spending their time talking about the white man as though he were a devil and implying that he ought to be wiped off the face of the Earth. And yet, have they ever killed anyone? There is no evidence that they ever have. How can they hope to compete with the Christian churches who have killed millions?\" A seven-page short story about an army private who goes insane and stalks officers on his own base like a serial killer A back-page discussion of Horseshit's steep $2 price (ap-proximately $13 today): can't get most printers to print it, or typesetters to set our type, or distributors to handle it, or booksellers to sell it. Doing battle with all these idiots naturally runs up our expenses.\" Later, the editors offer subscriptions for readers' enemies The entire magazine feels oddly isolated. Except for brief nods to the Realist and Eros, there are no references to any sort of American counterculture. (There is, however, one pointed notice that Horseshit is NOT a member of the Underground Press Syndicate.) At this time the Dunker brothers were in their mid-30s, radicalized but disconnected from the organized left. In the truest sense of the words, they were outraged citizens moved to action.Issue 3, published in 1968, maintains the Dunkers' rather off-putting honesty: \"We put out this magazine for the same rea-son that little boys run around and shout and make noise. Because we're alive. That's all. Because we're alive.\" It also fea-tures a marked ratcheting up of the antimilitary sentiment; the writing and graphics are far bit- terer. On boot camp, Thomas Dunker proclaims, \"The whole training mess is bullshit. An excuse to give the sa-dists who run the Regular Services a chance to work out their perversions at public expense.\" Additionally, the issue offers a selection of the Dunkers' antimilitary post-ers (ten for $1), the year of the My Lai Massacre and two years before Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland's \"F--- the Army\" traveling stage show. There's also an article titled \"Committee of the Gods and the Female Tits and Ass,\" which ends with, \"A man can no more ignore a woman's ass than a dog can ignore a rabbit\u2014so let's force them to shape up.\" Through the magazine's run, there is an ample supply of that squishy misogyny of the pre-70s left. In \"A Year's Supply of Excuses for Girls,\" the Dunkers offer just that: \"He forced me,\" \"I was too drunk to know what I was doing,\" \"He said I'd lose my job if I didn't.\" Women are often punch lines, with one article fea-turing a discussion of females' \"faint\" brain waves. Issue 4 is the big one, which may have something to do with the fact that it was released in 1969. At 56 pages, it's the longest issue of the bunch, and the first to in-clude an order form inside and a warning on the cover ( NOT TO BE SOLD TO MINORS ). The very non- inflammatory cover art features a painting of a dragon holding the Earth and spitting fire into the ether. But inside is some of the most ferocious content to ever grace the pages of a magazine. Were the brothers Dunker the dragon taking the world back, or inhabitants of the world, held hostage by the dragon? Contents include: \"The Nut Growers Foundation,\" a seven-page satiric conspiracy piece A rather pedestrian\u2014considering the times\u2014piece titled \"Old Believe... Young Think\" (\"Old people think that it is shameful to go to prison. Young people are faintly ashamed that they haven't had the guts to go to prison\") Six pages of \"The Circulation of the Blood During the Sex Act,\" which features illustrations of fully splayed genita-lia that are far more explicit than what's found in issue 2 \"We put out this magazine for the same reason that little boys run around and make noise,\" the Dunkers claimed. \"Because we're alive.\" 98 VICE 100 VICE The two-page \"How Flowers Mate... and Eliminate\" with an unexpected jab of (ironic?) racism when, among the naughty flowers with fully engorged phalli and boobs, one particularly large, droopy schlong is labeled NIGGER FLOWER A 16-page short story, \"The Lesson They've Been Trying to Teach Us,\" which begins as kid-on-kid (as in minors fornicating with other minors) porn and devolves into an incest tale. The story is written in an off-putting, genuine manner that seems to have an ambiguous political point (Americans are too sexually uptight? It's OK for juveniles to have sex with one another?). Jarring and deeply creepy, the piece is a fitting grand finale to the magazineWhen I finally reached the elusive Robert Dunker, I learned that he lives only 45 minutes from the store where I first discovered his magazine. Now an octogenarian, he was po-lite and gracious enough that I resisted saying \" Horseshit,\" lest I offend him (I referred to it as \"your old magazine\"). Robert filled in the gaps of a surprisingly prosaic up- bringing. The brothers grew up on a farm west of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, suffering a childhood out of a Norman Rockwell painting (\"...a mile through the snow to the school bus. Then, after school, we'd get home and work until dark\"). He also told me that he served in the marines, and that Tom was drafted into the army (years before his paralyzing accident) after leaving the seminary on the grounds that it was \"nonsense.\" I asked whether their military service had served as an agent of radicalization. Had there been a particularly scar-ring incident? How does one's rage meter go from 0 to 100 so quickly and forcefully? \"I don't think that there was such an incident that caused anything like that,\" Robert told me. \"What happened was, our parents were exceedingly devout. They got down on their knees and prayed for peace every night with their ro-saries. And to me, in my mind, I never accepted any of that. We went to a parochial Catholic school, and I always was just looking around, wondering, 'Am I different or crazy? I don't believe any of this...' I think there are people in the world who are believers. They'll believe any damn thing, whether it's Bigfoot, flying saucers, or whatever. Then there are people who won't believe anything, unbelievers. And I think my brother and I are just unbelievers.\" Did the brothers, I asked, have any connection to the beat culture when they started their magazine in Hermosa Beach? \"No,\" Robert said. \"Most of the activity for the hippies was in San Francisco and downtown LA. And we didn't know anybody like that. Once our magazine got to be well known, we got invitations to all the rock shows or what-ever they were at that time. I never went to any of them. I'm antisocial. And because Tom was in a wheelchair, he couldn't go to them. So we never really met people like that. There were certain ones who came and visited Tom, and he would tell me about it afterward. I can't even re-member their names.\" By this time, the conversation had taken on a strange tone. It felt like we were discussing a journal of macram\u00e9. I marveled at the professionalism of the magazine (in all four issues, I found only one typo and one shadow line). Robert told me he had worked for the electronics divisions of several aircraft companies, designing and illustrating brochures. Somehow this wasn't the exciting explanation I had hoped for. I also inquired if it was true that Horseshit had been originally distributed inside a brown paper wrapper. It was. \"We wanted people to read it, but we realized that if we put a big stamp that said Horseshit... the post office at that time considered itself censors of everything that went through the mail, and consequently if they opened it up, they would just return it or destroy it.\"\"There are people who won't believe anything, unbelievers,\" Robert said. \"And I think my brother and I are just unbelievers.\" VICE 101 What about legal troubles? There were none to speak of. How about their family? Were relatives aware of their little deviant pet project? Had their parents disowned them? \"We never sent it to them,\" Robert said. \"We never mentioned it to them, there was never any back and forth. Our relatives were all wonderful people, but they weren't in favor of anything we ever did, so we considered our-selves black sheep. But we kept on good terms with them.\" The story was almost unbelievable. How could the Dunkers have produced such a scathing attack on ev-erything\u2014in the 60s, no less\u2014without immediate and dramatic negative results? I suddenly felt like a caricature of a bad reporter, barely able to contain his annoyance at not receiving the story he wanted to hear. The magazine ended, Dunker told me, because the conclusion of the Vietnam War made Horseshit irrel- evant (odd chronology, considering that Vietnam raged for another half decade). Additionally, Robert said, their struggles with typesetters, printers, and distributors had become unmanageable. It was an entirely reasonable and logical conclusion. And what of the years since? You could fit an entire life- time (mine, for example), in the gap between issue 4 (a planned fifth issue never materialized) and our phone call. Here too, Robert's tale was surprisingly upbeat:\"My brother was a paraplegic, and he spent a lot of time in the hospital. He hated hospitals and never wanted to go back to a VA. So we decided to make some money so that he could live on his own. We invested well. We bought houses for nothing down and remodeled them. My brother made the calls and handled the contracts, and I did the labor. Eventually we had two crews of people working for us. We made a good deal of money. I still have houses that provide me with rental income. And Tom had exactly what he wanted, a nice house on the beach. We had five people on call all the time, so there was somebody either with him or close by 24 hours a day. During his last ten years he needed somebody to help him up and out of bed and do things for him, and so it worked out fine for us.\" After our chat, I mulled over his answers. Everything checked out, until I looked at the magazines again. I thought of my initial reaction, that I was the victim of an elaborate prank. Then something else struck me: Did Robert Dunker sound suspiciously like the owner of the military-surplus store? 104 VICEIn October 2000, Todd formally contacted the DEA and declared, \"I have what I believe is the world's largest LSD conspiracy... and I would like to try to work something out.\" Todd received total immunity for his involvement with the laboratory and walked away a free man, while Leonard was given two concurrent life sentences without parole. In the wake of the trial, Todd and Krystle trav-eled across America, dealing kilos of crystalline MDMA to survive. As time passed, Todd became increasing violent and paranoid, and in September 2003 he was arrested and began a protracted legal battle that culminated with a sen-tence of life in prison for assault with a dangerous weapon (a hypodermic needle) and kidnapping. In the years since the arrests, Krystle has parlayed her experience into a series of books and YouTube videos, the most popular of which involves an in-depth discussion of an intrarectal DMT-administration technique termed \"the sha-manic colonic.\" Apparently, it burns. Krystle is one of very few people who participated in the LSD operation who is not currently incarcerated, and so I flew to Kansas to meet her, ask some questions, and pay a visit to the legendary missile silo. Despite all she has gone through, Krystle is an ebullient bundle of entheogenic energy. When I picked her up to drive to Wamego she was wearing a tie-dyed shirt that read \" \" At one time, the silo was a testament to Todd's unre- strained profligacy. The main missile bay was filled with fine Persian carpets and luxurious leather couches. He owned a $120,000 stereo system, which he used to listen to Deep Forest and Sarah McLachlan at high volumes. The bathroom alone contained a shower with three heads and a bathtub that could easily accommodate half a dozen people. Krystle said it was fun. After the bust, the silo was gutted, and everything of value was sold. The space was vandalized and abandoned, it flooded with water, and eventually Todd's henchmen broke inside to steal a cache of MDMA, LSD, and DMT hidden within the varicose pink marble walls. Today, very little of the original silo is intact, and the property is owned by a military-vehicle fanatic, who uses the missile bay to store a collection of WWII-era Soviet T-34 tanks. After leaving the silo, I sat down with Krystle for a chat. Vice: How did you and Gordon Todd Skinner meet and sub-sequently fall in love?Krystle Cole: I was stripping at a place called Club Orleans. Todd didn't frequent strip clubs, but his employees did, and one of them saw my act and told Todd, \"There's this girl down there you should really see.\" I did an interesting act\u2014a bond-age act. I certainly stood out for the Kansas crowd that was in there. I was really goth because I hated Kansas. I would play death-metal music and have this chain that I would wrap around the pole, and then I would whip myself with the chain. I wanted to rebel against everything Kansas was about. When Todd came in, he wasn't like the other customers, he didn't want lap dances or anything like that. He would just sit in the VIP room and hand me lots and lots of money. Eventually, he asked if I wanted to see where he lived. At strip clubs they al-ways preach a rule: \"Never go home with a customer; you'll be chopped into pieces and raped.\" So I was nervous, but I said, \"OK, I'll go.\" After driving for hours we arrived at these huge metal gates with barbed wire along the top. He had at least ten security cameras outside, as well as these motion-sensing floodlights. There were no other buildings in sight, and the door to the missile silo was large enough to accommodate a semitruck. As he led me inside, I was freaking out. Why did Todd choose to live in a decommissioned nuclear-missile silo as opposed to, say, a house?When I first met Leonard and Todd, their story was that they were eccentric investment bankers, and Todd said he had been stockpiling food and machine guns to prepare for Y2K\u2014we met right after the millennium. Todd had every-thing you would need to survive the apocalypse in the silo. They explained that they carried briefcases stacked with for-eign currency and $1,000 bills because they thought the US financial system was on the verge of collapse. They threw around money, drove Porsches, bought me Armani clothes, and I didn't have to work at the strip club anymore. Here in Kansas you aren't raised to scrutinize people about whether they are lying to you or not, you know? So Todd said he was an investment banker- cum-survivalist preparing for post-Y2K financial collapse, but how did he explain the kilos of MDMA?Todd very much hid it. When I first met him, I never got to see anything like that. I had virtually no experience with drugs. I did the basic drinking alcohol and smoking pot, but I had never even heard of MDMA. He said, \"Try it just once, you'll like it.\" And boy did I... but I only got to see this small amount. Eventually, I began to suspect something was going on, but I didn't know exactly what. Everyone was so nervous. If you talked about drugs on the phone, or visited drug-related web-sites, there would be a major chew-out session. It was only later that I was shown the stockpiles of drugs and I found out they had an LSD lab in addition to the MDMA lab, but it never got busted. I've read that he told people he was using the missile silo to manufacture high-performance springs for NASA. Technically, at one time, they had springs being made out at the missile silo. Some of his employees said they had tried to make a few springs, but it was mainly just a cover. Did you see any springs at all?No, I never saw a single spring at the silo, but Todd's mother actually does own a spring factory in Tulsa, and they do make springs for NASA. Krystle and Hamilton cut loose with a steamed-vegetable platter at Houlihan's. VICE 105 An apparatus consisting of 182 batteries Todd claimed to have designed for experimental electrochemical MDMA synthesis. Holes drilled by Todd's henchmen in order to check out the \"books\" in his \"library\" that contained popular Dutch guilder. Todd pensively stares off into space while massaging a sore shoulder.VICE 107So once you figured out that Todd and Leonard were in- volved in an LSD-manufacturing ring, did you want to end your involvement with them?As I started to figure it out, I didn't, I wanted to get more in-volved! I didn't find out exactly what was going on until after Leonard had been busted. I was on a lot of drugs, and I was only 18. I didn't have enough foresight or world experience to be able to discern the things that were happening around me. Before I was just like, \"Hey, let's party.\" I didn't think about the consequences or the future or anything, really. What were some of the substances that the group synthesized and experimented with?Todd's specialty was tryptamines. He would perform Mimosa hostilis extractions but could also produce synthetic DMT. He was very proud of all the different chemicals he had. If you got close enough to him, you would get to see this huge \"library\" of different substances\u2014hundreds of different drugs. This was back in 2000 before most of these substances could be purchased online as research chemicals. Todd would go around giving everybody stuff, and we were like, \"Give me!\" I don't know what most of the things were. Back then I was on so many different substances, it was like living in an entheogenic monastery. I didn't have to work. I didn't have to worry about paying bills. I didn't have to do anything other than take psychedelics. I had the opportunity to use all kinds of unusual things like ALD-52 and ergot wine, as well as some totally novel things that I have not heard of before or since. What were some of the novel substances? Well, I couldn't talk about a lot of this stuff before, but I can now because the statute of limitations has expired. Specifically, there was one substance that nobody had ever tried before. It was something completely new, and what I experienced on it was above and beyond anything I can describe. Because it was like looking... It was like it turned reality into this whole... I mean, it was reality, but like a layer over reality. It's hard to explain, but afterward I felt like it taught my brain that there was a neurological switch I could just flip and enter an altered state at will. What was the name of this substance? Todd didn't name most of the chemicals he created, but this was a novel analog of 5-Me O-MT. He sent me a number of letters from prison describing the synthesis in coded lan-guage; apparently it could be made with electrified rhodium foil in a 20-gallon fish tank. 1 There were lots of new things, but that one was particularly crazy. He also said it was an especially sensitive molecule that was prone to degradation, and so when storing that particular \"book\" in one of his \"li-braries\" it had to be \"bound\" with a \"light-blocked book cover.\" There were other novel substances as well. Leonard made a new LSD analog called \"diazedine,\" though I don't know exactly what that was either.Are you familiar with lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide? 2 No, but they were calling this diazedine. It was also crazy, but nothing earth-shattering. Leonard gave it to Todd in a bottle of Everclear for testing, and we would dose a capful at a time. Apparently, diazedine failed to be doable on a large scale because the production costs were too high and the yields too low. Diazedine caused a lot of stress between Todd and Leonard, because they had high expectations for it as an LSD alternative. So at what point in all of this did Todd become an informant for the DEA and turn Leonard in?As the time of the bust approached, Todd began to tell me various things about Leonard: that he was involved in the heroin trade and the trade of Stinger missiles in Afghanistan, and that he had contracted the murder of a man who was supplying them with an LSD precursor. I don't know if I believe Todd now, but I certainly did at the time. I was com-pletely in love with him, and anything that he said I took as the truth. Now I can look back and see that he was such a liar a lot of the time. I've exchanged letters with Leonard, and he seems like a gen- tlemanly and kind man.You have to realize that he's not that innocent in all of this. I mean, it's horrible that he is serving a life sentence for com-mitting a nonviolent crime, which is not even a crime but a service that has had a profoundly positive effect on humanity, but Leonard was not an angel either. A lot of people try to paint him as this Buddhist-monk-like guy who would never do anything bad. Both Todd and Leonard were drug dealers at the top level; neither of them was good. On the flip side, I don't think Leonard was a murderer. Did Leonard seem like someone who would be involved with the heroin trade?Probably not, but he didn't seem like someone who would be involved with the LSD trade either! Leonard was so good at acting the part. I never once saw him use a drug or even speak of a drug. The only thing he ever said to me was, \"You should go to raves. You will like them.\" That's the only remotely drug-related thing he ever said before the bust. Did Todd ever allow you to observe the synthesis of any drugs?Well, I saw kilo upon kilo of indole. I saw glassware and lab equipment and things that were in the last stages of synthesis or purification. I saw glass jugs filled with wine made from ergot cultures, but I never once entered one of \"I don't know what most of the things were. Back then I was on so many different substances, it was like living in an entheogenic monastery.\" 2 Lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide (aka LSZ) belongs to a very small group of serotonergic psychedelics that surpass LSD in potency. Aside from the \"diazedine\" is a lexical clipping of dimethylazetidine ( diazedine<dimethylazetidine), the first paper describing the chemistry and pharmacology of LSZ came out of a laboratory at Purdue University, where Leonard had previously studied under the renowned chemist David Nichols. Though the paper was published after Leonard's arrest, it is still quite likely he was aware of the preliminary research. When I asked Dr. Nichols whether he thought Pickard may have produced LSZ, he replied, \"Leonard knew of our work, of that I am certain.\" Rumors of LSZ distributed on blotter paper (purportedly under the name ) have circulated for years, though there are few confirmed reports of its existence. Of course, the name diazedine is ambiguous and could be referring to just about anything, but I would bet a kilo of benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate that LSZ and diazedine are one and the same. 1 In Todd's letters from prison, he describes using both 5-Fluoro-MT and 6-Fluoro- MT. The former is commercially available in small quantities, and the latter was distributed by Leonard's group and is said to be a \"beast.\" Both are active psychedelics, but neither could be produced with the precursors and electrified rhodium-foil fish-tank apparatus Todd described. 106 VICE Krystle dons a gas mask and G-string, nay LSD-string.108 VICEthe labs or observed any syntheses. I think I knew Todd better than anybody, but he still didn't trust me enough to take me into his lab. I was always confused about Todd's role. Clearly Leonard had a specific purpose\u2014he is a highly educated organic chem-ist, a student of Alexander Shulgin\u2014but why was Gordon Todd Skinner involved?Well, Todd told me many different versions over the years. According to official reports, he was there to launder money and take care of other cash-flow-related things. Initially, he told me he was the head of security for the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, but then later, when he began to trust me more, Todd explained that he was an LSD chemist as well. He said that he was responsible for making \"white fluff\" LSD, while Leonard would make large amounts of \"lavender\" LSD for sale. 3 From what I can deduce, I think that Leonard was mak- ing the bulk majority of the LSD. Todd was just making these small batches, and also Todd would make the DMT. You once wrote that Todd synthesized something called \"Black Tar Acid,\" which gave people seizures. Why was he giving this to people?Yeah, I don't know what it was. It looked really bad. Instead of being crystalline, it was this black, inky tar. When you would try to dissolve it in solution, it would turn this really dark col-or. This was toward the end, when he began to unravel. He was making a lot of really poisonous tryptamines that gave people seizures. All the stress of the court cases, years of run-ning, and years of shady dealings with the government began to take their toll. As for why he gave it to people, why did Todd do anything he did? He was mentally ill. I really think he is a sociopath. I mean, at the time I didn't know what a sociopath was. Now having gone to school for psychology and understanding the definition of what that is, I realize there is a very small percentage of the population who are sociopaths. At one point, Todd claimed to invent an HIV vaccine and was offering free injections to all of your neighbors, correct?Yes, the bigger his lies, the more likely he was to get away with them. I had been doing so much MDMA that I was afraid I had brain damage, so I went to a naturopathic doctor for treatment. The doctor prescribed a number of different IV vitamin infusions. When Todd saw me with the IV, he wanted to experiment with his own vitamin infusions by adding psychedelics to the mixture. He would go to this na-turopathic doctor's office\u2014if you can imagine, there are all these old people in there undergoing chelation therapy in the same room\u2014and he would put a DMT solution in the IV bottle. He would adjust the flow so he would start tripping more and then restrict the flow to cool down. He was surfing the DMT high. He would just sit like that with the old people, tripping his ass off for hours while everyone thought he was undergoing chelation. But he could totally keep it together. I wouldn't do that. Nor would I... It's one thing to smoke DMT and then be done with it, but having a multihour DMT trip with a needle in your vein does not sound appealing to me. Although once you do it enough, you can make almost any trip a pleasant experience regardless of the environment. For example, when Todd be-came violent he knew I would try to escape, and so he began booby-trapping my house with various psychedelics. He wanted other people to think I was going insane, or maybe he wanted me to doubt my own sanity. Leonard told me that Todd must have coated my doorknobs with psychedelics. As a result of these booby traps, I tripped for three days in a row, each day stronger than the day preceding it. Whatever this substance was, it was the strongest thing I have ever taken. It's very off-putting to be going about your daily business and then find yourself inexplicably plunged into a +++ trip. 4 Totally slammed beyond belief. Yet, it was also a really good experience in some ways. I just remembered that life is a cosmic giggle on the breath of the universe. So like I said, any psychedelic experience has the potential to be good unless there is a person literally standing above you and stabbing you with needles, strangling you, and scream-ing, which is what Todd did the second time around. So that was hard to get through, you know? There's no way to make that good. I've read that Leonard was also working as a DEA infor- mant. I find it amazing that two of the world's most powerful drug dealers were both working for the DEA independently, unbeknownst to each other. Did Todd give you the impres-sion that the DEA is closely involved with the distribution of Schedule I drugs?Yes, absolutely. He would say those exact words. At the top of the pyramid there is no division between drug distribution and drug enforcement. Fifty-four percent of the prison popu-lation are sentenced for drug-related offenses. The assets of those prisoners, and the money they draw through the court system, is absolutely enormous. Without chemists to produce drugs, the DEA cannot profit off busts. If they bust people at the lower echelons while retaining the production at the top, they can sustain the agency. Without these chemists, the entire organization would disintegrate. So if they were working with Todd and Leonard while profit- ing off lower-level busts, why would they arrest Leonard?I have no evidence that they were working with Leonard dur-ing the silo bust, but I know they had worked with him in the past from time to time. I think the reason they busted 4 Alexander Shulgin developed a five-point rating scale, ranging from +/- to ++++, with +++ indicating, \"Not only are the chronology and the nature of a drug's action quite clear, but ignoring its action is no longer an option. The subject is totally engaged in the experience, for better or worse.\"3 \"White fluff\" and \"lavender\" are terms used to denote different grades of LSD, with the former being of high purity and the latter being of medium to low purity. These names are derived from the appearance of the crystalline LSD, but it should be noted that this is acidhead nomenclature and is not rooted in any kind of formal chemical analysis. Whether Todd was actually capable of producing white fluff is unclear. In his court testimony, he said he could not synthesize LSD despite the fact that he had total immunity. Accordingly, I have always wondered whether Todd simply liked the image of being a patriarchal Alexander Shulgin figure and his entire chemist persona was an elaborate hoax. Todd considered Dennis McKenna a personal friend, and so I asked McKenna for his thoughts on the matter. He replied, \"Skinner claimed to be many things that he was not. As far as I'm aware, a chemist was one of them!\"\"Todd must have coated my doorknobs with psychedelics. As a result of these booby traps, I tripped for three days in a row.\" VICE 109Leonard and didn't give him a chance was because Todd went directly to the head of the DEA in Washington, DC, and got these immunity agreements. So at that point it had all become too big. Leonard had no way to get out of it. Todd received immunity for absolutely everything related to the silo bust. It seems as if his government connections were so strong that he was almost invincible. What he got caught for in the end was unrelated to LSD distribution, but rather for torturing your ex-boyfriend, correct?Yes, that's true. I think his legal immunity started to drive him insane; he thought he could get away with murder. He's now serving life for what he did to my ex-boyfriend Brad. After the trial, I was trying to get away from Todd because he was falling apart psychologically. He wanted me back and wasn't going to take no for an answer. Todd dragged me into his car and strangled me while threatening to drive us both off a bridge. I knew that if I didn't get help I was going to die. First I went to the local police and got a tempo-rary restraining order, but that only made Todd angrier, so I had no choice but to go to the DEA. The DEA knew that I had dated Todd, and so they were willing to meet with me. I walked into the office with Brad, and we confessed everything. I told them I was an MDMA dealer, the loca-tion of one of Todd's MDMA labs, and about his abuse and the forced druggings. It turned out there were other people Todd had drugged who had gone to the DEA as well, so they had more than enough evidence for a case. I told the agents, \"I don't care if I go to prison for a few years for incriminating myself; at least nothing else will happen to me or anyone else.\" It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but I had no other options, Todd was either going to kill me or someone else. But the agents didn't do anything. Conveniently, two days later, Todd called me up and told me that he knew we had met with the DEA. He was en-raged, and that is why he kidnapped me and Brad. What happened during the kidnapping? It started with Todd offering Brad communion wafers laced with a psilocin analog. I have no idea why Brad agreed to eat the wafers. Then Todd offered Brad a drug that he claimed would amplify the effects of the psychedelic wa-fers. It was a really big white pill, and after Brad took it he fell unconscious for 12 hours. Todd would do that to peo-ple sometimes if he didn't want them at a party; he would trick them into taking a pill that would knock them uncon-scious. He was like a pharmacological puppeteer, pulling everybody's strings with these different chemicals. Then he repeatedly injected Brad with psychedelics, kicked him in the penis, and interrogated him about what, exactly, we had told the DEA. Was he using the psychedelics as a truth serum?Yes, that was his plan, at least. He was giving Brad IV DMT injections and interrogating him and psychologically tor-menting him. Todd would say, \"We can keep him, we can make him trust us again.\" And I said, \"No, we can't. He has to go to the hospital!\" He was injecting me as well with what he said was sodium pentothal. I was so afraid. To think that someone would use psychedelics for the types of things he used them for. It was really horrible. After it was over, Brad had to go to hospital to recuperate from the damage done to his penis, but I had to stay with Todd for a whole month. He drugged me, he raped me, he sodomized me. He did horrible things to me.Where is Brad now?I don't know. I haven't had contact with him since then. He slowly became convinced I was a Satanist, and after a few weeks in the hospital he was making statements like, \"Krystle was performing satanic s\u00e9ances over my dying body.\" I assume that he hates me and if he ever got a chance to voice his side of the story he would probably say I was this Satan-worshipping devil woman who was in cahoots with Todd to do horrible things to him from day 1. Were you performing satanic s\u00e9ances over his dying body? No, I was giving him CPR! He was on enormous doses of psychedelics and barbiturates so his memory of the ordeal is seriously distorted. He was on the verge of death. I would have called the cops, but Todd had needles filled with some drug and said, \"If you call the cops, I'm injecting him with this, and he'll be dead long before anyone gets here.\" I did everything I could in order to get him out of that situation, and Brad is still alive now as a result. After listening to all of these stories about Todd as a socio- pathic, controlling megalomaniac\u2014I wonder, how did you fall so deeply in love with him?Well, at first he was so nice. He seemed like the most spiritual person you would ever meet. Tripping with him was different than anyone I have ever tripped with. We experienced telepa-thy together. We experienced God together. I wholeheartedly believed that he was the most spiritual and the most perfect person out there, and I fell in love with him completely. After that, I was willing to overlook some of the bad stuff that I started to see in the first couple of years. I would tell my-self that underneath all of the insanity he was a good person. Looking back on it, he was just manipulating me. I was a stupid girl. I have some major psychological scars from what happened. That's why Todd's serving life--what he did was not a good thing. That's not what psychedelics should be for. So I wrote Lysergic to teach people to be careful about who they decide to trip with, so hopefully people don't make the same mistakes I did. Because I really chose the wrong tripping partner when it came to Todd.

The sun slaps me in the eyes with its burning solar cock. Can't see shit. Next thing I'm expecting is a bullet in my head or a knife to my chest, followed by Hippo Mary's deep, shitty laugh. That's not what I hear, though. Instead, a little, paper- thin, annoying-as-fuck voice pierces my eardrums. It's Shit Bird. He looks like an emu and is a total and complete piece of shit. Hence the name. I hate Shit Bird. He's the kind of creep who makes you want to kill yourself because it's impossible to bear the notion that the world would al-low someone like him to exist\u2014the type of guy who makes you ask yourself: \"Why should I be a part of such a dumb fucking world?\" I shield myself from the UV, just as the little bastard starts flapping his beak lips: \"Hey, Toupee. What are you doing right now?\" \"Beating off to a murder fantasy, starring you. What do you want, Shit Bird?\" He steps aside and reveals an old beater\u2014the kind of car you're scared to stand near for fear it'll explode in your fucking face. \"You giving me a car, Shit Bird?\"\"No, asshole. I'm giving you a job. That car's got something inside, and it needs to be driven off a fucking cliff. Pronto.\" \"What's in it that's so goddamned get-riddable?\"I watch a tear fall down Shit Bird's cheek before he meekly says, \"Dead Dick. Dead Dick's in there, and he's dead. Dead Dick's dead.\" Holy shit. Dead Dick's dead, and so is his dick. Must be a bad day for Shit Bird. You see, Dead Dick and Shit Bird, they were fuck buddies, lovers, boyfriends, what-ever you want to call it. Dead Dick was pretty much the worst smack junkie in the desert. Always nodding off, puking everywhere. Bald as fuck too. Puking bald fucks are the worst. Their heads get bright red when they spew. It's like watching a baby being strangled to death. Still, Dick wasn't so bad when he was alive. He was a better boyfriend to Shit Bird than that asshole deserved. Must be hard to drive around with your boyfriend's corpse in the trunk. He's probably supposed to get rid of it but can't handle the job. That's why these assholes come to me. I can deal. It's not that I take death lightly. It's not that I hate people. It's just that I hate most people. \"Sure, Shit Bird. I'll do the job. By the way, my condolences.\"\"Fuck you, Toupee. You can fuck my asshole with your tongue.\" Next thing I know I'm driving. Should've taken the edge off with something. I hate driving sober. Nothing more boring than sitting in a fucking metal box, looking at miles of desert. If that bullshit wasn't bad enough, I got to listen to my own stupid thoughts like, \"What the fuck am I do-ing with this dead asshole in the trunk? Jesus Christ, are human beings really this expendable? Poor Dead Dick. He just was doing the best he fucking could, and now he's gone. Probably over some stupid pointless shit. And here I am, going to dump his body like it's a bag of bat shit. What is my life?\" If I were high I'd only have two thoughts: 1) \"I love drugs\" and 2) \"I love money.\" I see the cliff ahead. They call it The Dump. I'm sure you can guess why. It really is the best spot to dispose of your baggage. Either that or The Dump Jr., which is like The Dump but smaller. I'm sure you guessed that too, smart-ass. I reach The Dump. I don't even stop. I'm used to this part. I just slow the beater down a bit, jump out, and let 'er roll. I scrape my fucking elbow this time, though. I hate that. Scrapes are half-assed cuts. I prefer gashes. I rise to my feet. Then I feel a kick to my back, and I'm down again, dry-humping the dirt. It's the pigs. I know it's them because of the smell. It's a clean scent. Don't know which feeling I hate more: the boot stomping the back of my neck or the cold metal around my wrists. Looks like it's ba ck to the fucking zoo. Rape City. Hope they at least let me wear my toupee. This is the second installment of Toupee, a previously unpublished novel by Brett Gelman that Vice unearthed a while back. We will be serializing it throughout 2011. No one has heard from Brett since last October, when he sent us a bag of cat shit in a Ziploc bag along with a note that read, \"Keep this safe.\" Please get in touch if you've seen him.

This is peculiar be-cause if you put a gyroscope near the axis of a spinning body, it'll tend to be pulled around in the direction of the spin. But if you place it outside the equator of the same body, then the moving mass drags the gyroscope around the other way. Let's use our spinning Earth as an example. The effect of its spinning on its neighborhood is very tiny because it's not going very fast and it's not a huge astronomical body. Nevertheless, if a satellite is orbiting Earth, then it will become a gyroscope. The axis of the gyroscope is per-pendicular to the orbital plane of the object that's being dragged around by Earth. If you look at the orientation of the two objects by using an astronomical reference point\u2014distant stars that are very nearly xed, for example\u2014you can look at the orbit in relation to those distant stars to see that the orientation is turning. The equatorial plane of Earth extends out into space, and at a certain point the orbit of the satellite will go from south to north, through this plane. This is called the nodal point. As the orbit turns, that point will move. Imagine this equatorial plane and the orbital plane of the satellite turning, and as they do, the point of intersection turns. The line intersecting those two planes, which turns a tiny bit, is called the line of nodes. This concept can also be applied to a binary neutron star system: two very dense, rapidly rotating objects in close proximity. The gravitational eld of one spinning object will cause the axis of the other object to turn. Whenever you have a massive spinning object\u2014and the more massive Dr. Neil Ashby is a professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder. His research emphasizes the practical applications of theoretical general relativity.it is and the more spinning, the bigger the effect\u2014the orbits of satellites around it will reverse. Because of the frame-dragging effect, someone watch- ing a binary neutron star system from afar would observe that the satellites around that system progress in a differ-ent timeline. That is, for things lower in the gravitational eld, the clock tends to run slower. These kinds of effects are commonplace on Earth when dealing with the Global Positioning System. Because that system is so precise, one must worry about the clocks in the satellites running faster than those on Earth. They have to be compensated for. Now imagine that massive binary system again. The sheer massiveness of the two neutron stars will affect time much more drastically. For anyone used to the comparatively mild Earth time shift, it will be a mess. All measurements of time will depend on how close the clock is to one of the other stars, and so on. Another way we can observe this effect on Earth is by watching the orbit of satellites. Picture two satellites in line with Earth, with one object behind the other. In this scenario, light from the object behind is going to pass near the surface of the other and slow down. That is, the actual speed of the light will decrease. The experiments executed to measure the frame-dragging effect are involved, to say the least. The LAGEOS satellites, for instance, are a series of spacecraft full of lead and cov-ered with refl ectors that laser beams are bounced off of. By measuring the time it takes for the beam to bounce back, it's possible to derive the satellite's orbit using millions of such measurements. Of course, there are other effects that cause the line of nodes to turn, and that's been a major stumbling block in the attempt to detect frame dragging. Earth's fl attening (at the poles), or axial tilt, for instance, causes the line of nodes to turn. We must wait for better models of Earth's gravitational eld\u2014models that account for these stumbling blocks\u2014before we can really 114 VICE THE CUTE SHOW PAGE! BY ELLIS JONES, PHOTOS BY JUSTIN KIERSKY Red Pandas Red pandas have the right idea. Their lives are a permanent vacation, way up in the trees of the Himalayas, where they get to eat, sleep, and make adorable little faces all day long. Whenever they're feeling depressed, they just have to look down to remind themselves how great and smart and lucky they are up above all the idiot bottom-feeders below. Their hobbies are finding shade, na pping, and wandering around searching for crisp bamboo shoots and delicious berries to softly nibble on before scrambling right back up the tallest tree to lounge some more. Although they are smaller than giant pan-das (duh), they make up for it with striped, bushy tails that are as long as their bodies and feel all soft and cuddly.

Strange that the Bible would put such importance on location and proximity. All my neighbors are in their 80s so there's no real covet-ing going on around my block. Maybe with one of them. She barely looks 70. The pretend love affair I've had with Matt's wife (above) has been going on for years. Matt shoots nudie photos of random girls as well as his wife and is kind enough to send them to me on a semi-regular basis with offers to wife-swap or test-drive his woman. A few years back they even grabbed another girl and wrote \"Happy Birthday, Christopher\" across their tits in chocolate icing for my birthday-card photo. It's all perfectly normal and my wife gets a real kick out of it. I'm sure you and your friends do the exact same thing. Sadly, I am all bark and no bite. I know I'll never get to bed down with Matt's wife. But I don't mind barking till I lose my voice. In recent months my at-tention has shifted to a new porn star, Angel Vain, whom I might actually have a chance of having sex with (still highly doubtful). I have decided she is an exact duplicate of Matt's wife: big tits, tattoos, ass, and all. When I came across her site (livinginvain.com) I immediately told Matt his wife was doing porn. When Angel put this video up for sale, I wrote Matt, \"Hey, now your wife takes it up the ass on film!\" His response was both stoked and saddened: \"That's amazing! If only that were true in real life...\" In a strange turn of events my friend Todd Bratrud, artist and owner of High Five Skateboards, befriended Angel. \"She looks just like Matt's wife, huh?\" I said. It freaked Todd out. He knew there was something he liked about Angel but couldn't put his finger on it. \"Don't tell Matt,\" he said, \"I don't want him to think I want to fuck his wife.\" \"It's OK,\" I said, \"I'm pretty sure he knows everyone wants to fuck her. That's why he doesn't ever let her out of the house.\" So I bought his wife's anal porn. $35. I have never bought a porno in my life. Every DVD I've ever re-viewed has been promo'd. I felt a little dirty. My justification was that it's the girl's first anal scene; perhaps it will go up in value like X-Men #1 or Rickey Henderson's rookie card. I sent Angel a note with my PayPal payment: \"Maybe Todd told you that I think you look like our mutual friend's wife. And I'm curious how she takes it in the ass...\" Like Matt's wife, she didn't respond or humor me. She did include a signed, naked 8x10 inscribed with the lie \"When I think of you, I touch myself,\" which I plan to frame and hang over my bed.

Duodecim is more of the same, and it's great. Nine new characters have been added to the Dissidia roster, bringing the total up to 31 (15 of whom you have to unlock)\u2014most notably Lightning, the protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII, and Tifa, the busty supporting female character from the most famous and popular game in the franchise, Final Fantasy VII. This somewhat rectifies the gender im-balance of Dissidia (which featured only three female characters, one of whom was a genderless god of de-struction who merely took female human form), but it's still a giant sausagefest. Dissidia's story was ludicrous and asinine; Duodecim's story is ludicrous but well presented. The goddess of harmony and the god of discord are in the midst of war, and they've called up champions from a bunch of different worlds to join their ranks. The champions are trapped in an endless cycle of pointless violence and getting angry because of it; they begin to realize that it does them no good and they want it to end. The premise has little relevance to the lives of real humans, but at least the dialogue is good this time around. Dissidia's story line unlocks as a play-able extra on completion of Duodecim, which would be neat if the old material were anywhere near as strong as the new. What I really want to talk about, though, are the game mechanics. Duodecim is a one- or two-player fighting game that's unlike anything in the genre. Characters are customizable\u2014each has a unique set of combat moves, about half of which can be equipped at any given time. It makes for a lot of variety when ap-plied across 31 characters. Combat relies on managing \"Bravery\" and \"Health\" stats that initiate two different sets of attacks. Bravery attacks are easy to land and drain your opponents' Bravery while increasing your own. Health attacks are hard to land but damage your opponents' Health equal to your current level of Bravery while reducing your Bravery to zero. The game is a stat-based tug-of-war between two combatants until one's Bravery score is high enough for a Health attack to significantly damage his or her opponent. It sounds simple, but the game includes swordsmen, mages, gunners, and one character who fights with tentacles and laser beams. All of them are completely unique in terms of gameplay. Unlike con-ventional side-scrolling fighting games, the camera is set up like a third-person action game. Combat arenas are huge, asymmetrical, and destruc- tible, which allows characters to be thrown through walls. The game's two-button controls and the way Bravery paces matches makes for viscerally satisfying, button-mashing fun. Aside from the fighting, there's a whole bevy of an- cillary systems to explore. Characters gain experience by leveling up and learning new abilities, and you can buy them new equipment and costumes. The story mode is stretched over several distinct episodes, each spotlighting a different character. Dangerous areas are navigated through a sort of chessboard interface in which you position your character to enter chains of multiple fights to earn the most currency for purchas-ing weapons and equipment. New to Duodecim (aside from the nine new char- acters) are the world map, which is barely worth mentioning, and the assist feature, which allows you to call in backup to help during fights by expending \"Assist Bar\" points. The ability to select any character as a part-ner significantly increases customization, although, to be honest, most assisting characters play about the same. Besides a few shortcomings, it's the best game I've played for the PSP and the only one I currently play on the console. If you're interested in an action game that looks, sounds, and plays terrifically, it's perfect, even if you don't care about Final Fantasy.

LIL' B Underrated Self-released It's been great watching the Based God go totally legit. That said, it's frustrat-ing to hear him outpaced by Snoop Dogg's former sarcophagus moistener. Come on, B! MCs with \"Sending Shots\"- or \"Motivation\"-type dirt on these high-profile collabs? It sounds like you're sleepwalking, brah. I hate to say it, but I'm not even sure this verse is positive!ACKMANG MEXICANS WITH GUNS Ceremony Innovative Leisure What's this genre called now that Intelligent Dance Music's not a thing? It's rap-inflected techno that keeps the baseheads dancing and never falls into that dreaded IDM stasis zone that prevents all but the most serious and/or high-on-2C-B listeners from making it through the album. Can we call it Glorch?THANKS IN ADVANCE JUNIOR BOYS It's All True Domino When I was growing up, I used to spend a lot of time listening to Wham! on my Walkman while lying on BEST ALBUM OF THE MONTH: ICEAGE ENJOY LONDON'S FINEST RESPONSIBLY. BULLDOG LONDON DRY GIN 40% ABV. DISTILLED FROM GRAIN. IMPORTED FROM ENGLAND BY BULLDOG IMPORTS, MANHASSET, NY. 122 VICEREVIEWS WORST ALBUM OF THE MONTH: MIA DOI TODD: the hood of my parents' car in the drive- way and trying to hump my own thigh by twisting my legs around and gyrating my pelvis. This album reminds me of those simpler times. KELLY MCCLURE DAILY LIFE My Time/Daily Life Glass Coffin I have a big old record player with that drop-down spindle so all the unpleasantness associated with playing a flexi disc is in full effect on my system. In order to keep this thin plastic sheet of a record rotating at a steady pace, I had to tape it to the turntable. There was a lot of hiss, and the needle could pick up all the textures on the rubber mat under the re-cord, which gives everything an ugly thudding quality. It took me a few listens before I could hear it well enough to try an objective review. Both tracks have poppy drumbeats that make them easy to like. The first incorporates some organs and a symphony of synths, like a lamenta-tion of beautiful swans. There's lots of echo, because you've got to give the peo-ple what they want. Later some guitars come in. NICK GAZIN TEARIST Living: 2009-Present Thin Wrist Recordings Tearist remind me of that scene in Mad Men where the pretty girl gives Don Draper an old-timey BJ in the car, and he thinks to himself, \"She wants me to know her. The problem is that I al-ready do.\" I want to like you, Tearist, and I basically do. It's just that you are not sig-nificantly different from the other analog-synth goth bands who are using the same keyboards as you and have the same pretty-young-woman-who-probably-likes-choke-sex as their singer. If you come to town, I will come out and I will be into it, but I will not make eye contact when I pass your merch shrine.SPRAYPAINT ON A TIT M A N I K Armies of the Night: I Declare War Ovum About a minute into this record there's an acid lick and a tech pulse over huge dirty drums, and I'm like, \"Tell me more!\" But then we settle into a plodding 70 minutes of nothing-much New York City slow-house that I can't be-lieve is getting hype as \"the next wave in American dance music.\" You people really like super-boring drum programming mixed way out front don't you? I mean, do you really want yet another record that \"takes its inspiration from the cult 1979 film The Warriors\"? And DUDE! You probably grew up on the internet too; you're seriously putting those spaces be-tween the letters of your band name? C o m e o n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n!ARGON PEACOCK THURSTON MOORE Demolished Thoughts Matador Did you ever see that video where Nardwuar's trying to interview Sonic Youth back when they were open-ing for Neil Young in the early 90s, and Thurston and Lee are full-on bullying him, then Neil passes by and Thurston shouts, \"Hey, Neil!\" and makes the smoking-weed gesture? Classic stuff. This acoustic solo dealy sounds a little more like Nick Drake than Neil, but it is nevertheless fine Sunday-afternoon joint-rolling muzak. TERRY HAND THE FELICE BROTHERS Celebration, Florida Fat Possum The Felice Brothers got their start playing in New York City subway stations, which is where they should have stayed. This album is so evocative of being wasted at the Montrose stop at 2 AM while some bearded goon noodles out the theme from The Godfather on a banjo it's making me want to barf Chex Mix and Wild Turkey 101 into the Felices' guitar case like nobody's business. ALABAMA WORLEY JUSTICE OF THE UNICORNS Animals Will Be Stoned Little Lamb Recordings The woolly-faced singer of this band works for the New York State Parks Department and frequently finds six-foot-tall pot plants throughout Manhattan, which he is loath to yank out. One of the guitarists is an Asian food blogger (mightysweet.com/mesohungry) with immaculately styled hair who hosts cookie jamborees and chili-offs and once spent over than $1,000 on a rubber-mold-ed costume of a made-up superhero. I know these aren't reasons to listen to a music album, but they are charming sto-ries, and if you make the effort you may find their catchy Tom-Petty-on-mescaline ditties and genial southern charm to be the perfect soundtrack for forthcoming barbecues and summer shenanigans. OBAMA BEAN HEAD AND THE HEART S/T Sub Pop Here are some sad/triumphant \"straight-talking\" songs in the late-generation \"American roots\" pocket. I guess we can thank Wilco or, like, Saddle Creek for this. I'm sure I'll walk into a cof-fee shop this year and catch a guy who's trying to bang his semi-alternative/boring/sweet 22-year-old coworker by putting this record on. Fucking take my life, ugh.CLOM GLOM METAL MOTHER Bonfire Diaries Post Primal Absolutely intolerable misty/breathy/moody faerie child-girl vocals sus-pended in a gray flan of overproduced nonideas, all recycled from some \"Top 99 Moments in Trip-Hop\" list that I'm sure must exist on some VH1 property's \"web-only-content area\" if you look hard enough. The sleeve design looks like a shitty Genghis Tron t-shirt.RR GONE MIA DOI TODD Cosmic Ocean Ship City Zen I can't begin to imagine how hellish your middle school years have got to be if your middle name is \"DOY.\" My wife's a single syllable away from \"Sarah Queef,\" and it gave her such a complex that to this day I can't make fart sounds without watching her involuntarily tense up like a deer in the headlights. Anyway, every one of these songs sounds like \"Midnight at the Oasis.\" I know. TEDDY LINKIN CHAD VANGAALEN Diaper Island Sub Pop Chad's got an American Robyn Hitchcock vibe, which is a bit of a double-edged sword because the Soft Boys were great and Robyn's spent 30 years making acid-charged weirdo pop without ever treading into goofy They Might Be Giants territory (Moxy Fr\u00fcvous territory if you're Canadian) But at the same time, have you seen the crowd at one of that gee-zer's shows lately? Total sausage party. Good luck with that, Chad. MILTON CRAMER VIRGIN ISLANDS Ernie Chambers v. God The Control Group I grew up in the Virgin Islands, a fact I take great pride in. On the VI we call these kinds of dicknuggets \"mudascunts.\" It's a portmanteau of mother's and cunt and means that the person is so dumb that they must've just been born. In mainlander parlance, you might say \"baby dicks.\"ALABAMA WORLEY LITURGY Aesthethica Thrill Jockey I remember seeing the drummer for this group in an Emperor shirt and thinking, \"That guy doesn't know shit about Emperor.\" I was so wrong. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so wrong. He is actually the King of Emperor, and he can blast a beat so fast you'll wonder if time is slowing down or your heart's just stopping. This record will blow minds, make you want to kill people, and it's also not boring. My only wish is that they were ugly, hate-filled weirdos with bad skin who wore black long-sleeved t-shirts and corpse paint that got all over their shirts when they sweated. Fuckin' pretty boys. MARMADUK ICEAGE New Brigade Dais These are some angry, brooding Danish 17-year-olds, and they made an album that I predict will be on a lot of bloggers' top-ten lists. Is there anything gayer than top-ten lists? Only my homoso-cial longing for the angry cuties of Iceage. Fucking Scandinavians have been doing punk better than anyone since the 60s. Side A is good, but it's the B-side of this record that delivers the mind-melters. Angry, in-tense, urgent: These are words I am listing that describe the record because I am a lazy writer. It makes me feel a little like I want to run around in a tiny circle pit, in my kitchen, by myself.PRINCESS PISS COULTER Grip Fast Coulter Club What good has ever come out of pretending you're British? I guess Green Day got an opera and the Brian Jonestown Massacre kept the LA heroin trade afloat for the back half of the 90s, but is that really worth having every guy in the room mentally picturing their fist crumpling your windpipe while their girlfriend does that shitty girl-at-a-show BEST COVER OF THE MONTH: GANG GANG DANCE REVIEWS126 VICEWORST COVER OF THE MONTH: COULTER: dance? Is it really worth not being able to watch Party Down because every scene dealing with Kyle's band is way too close to the bone? No it is not. ARMAND HAMMER WOMEN IN PRISON Strange Waves 7-inch HoZac There's a scene in an issue of Hate where Stinky has Buddy listen to a band and Buddy says, \"They just sound like another bunch of Iggy and the Stooges imitators to me...\" and Oh, Stinky! guys are just another nostalgia act. Save your dough.SCREAMING FOR HEROIN NATURAL CHILD 1971 Infinity Cat They've got a song on here about how life's no fun when you turn 21, but I'm way past 21, and you know what? 'Tain't bad. I mean the living, not the music here. Maybe there's some power-pop Polar Express thing here where I'm physically too old to enjoy nondescript chord bashing. Or maybe I've just forgot-ten how to love. SNATCHERAL CHILD THE CLUTTERS Breaking Bones Chicken Ranch It seems like the point of this CD is to sell it for $10 on the merch table at a hometown show to people who have seen the band play 15 trillion times. Seriously: We all have this band in our city. Who cares? As totally straight-ahead bar rock goes, you can do way worse, but I can't imagine listening to this if you don't either already know all of the words or need a reminiscing session.CX ZOLA GANG GANG DANCE Eye Contact 4AD In spite of the fact that a member of GGD used to live above me and was a total dick (audible sighs if it took too long for me to unlock the front door; ugly looks when I flashed a friendly smile), this album is one of my favorites of the year. It's even more sampley than their previous releases and is one of those records you can listen to on repeat six or seven times without realizing that you've slowly be-come increasingly furious over the space of three hours. DARK KARL THIS WILL DESTROY YOU Tunnel Blanket Suicide Squeeze Hey, it's another one of those plod-along-athon records. There's that one guitar in the background with some infinite sustain on, the other guitar run through too many ZOOM pedals, and the super-polished woosh-shcheeew feed-back howl. Oh, and a bunch of super-fancy computer stuff. Jeez, and a piano? For a band that sounds so much like Godspeed You! Black Emperor, you sure got some nougats following their lead on the two-words-too-long naming formula. Honestly, though, I like Godspeed You! Black Emperor\u2014it's great \"writing music re-views\" music.ALEX DUNBAR SCREENS Dead House What Delicate Recordings STOP SHOUTING AT ME THROUGH SO MUCH REVERB! God! Am I supposed to think you're in a cave? Sing into the microphone! And tell your friend to stop howling: Howling is unpleasant. Hence banshees. Also, get your drummer some Strattera; he's making a big, beaty mess. And while you're out, please pick up a thing of milk. You and your sister wolf through these cartons like you're in Alien Nation or something. What? You don't know AN? Well, I guess I'm old. SOME KID'S MOM DRE W SWINBURNE THE CUTE ALBUM Wham City Drew writes all the music for VBS's The Cute Show, and this is an entire album of just that! Fifteen tiddly little key-board ditties and synthesized-dog-bark doodahs that will wheedle their way up your heartstrings and worm their widdle way into whatever part of the brain is gen-erally accepted as the most adorable. Seriously, this shit is a 50mg cap of sonic Prozac. As an added bonus, in the same way that putting on \"Yakety Sax\" can turn the unfunniest footage of 9/11 into a guar-anteed laugh riot, using these puppies as the soundtrack to anything will automati-cally up its awww quotient by an order of ten. Give it a shot! I just turned a bumfight outside the office into a Bosco cartoon!SMELMER GREEBLES REVIEWS Cults at The Independent San Francisco, CA watch this and more at noisey.comfb.com/noisey @noisey_us A VICE MUSIC EXPERIENCE IN CONCERT WITHa new online channel showcasing emerging music from around the worldVICE 129 ONE-DAY \"SUCCESS MY WAY\" SEMINAR!
