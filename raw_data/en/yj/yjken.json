Stone healing, also known as crystal healing, involves the use of crystals and gemstones to promote physical, emotional, and spiritual healing. The stones are believed to have different properties and energies that can help to balance and restore the body's natural energy flow. In the context of Reiki, stones may be placed on or near the body during a Reiki session to enhance the healing process. The stones are chosen based on their specific properties and how they may complement the individual's needs. For example, amethyst is often used for promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety, while rose quartz is believed to help promote self-love and emotional healing. While there is limited scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of stone healing, many people who have tried it report feeling more relaxed and balanced after a session. The use of stones in combination with Reiki can create a powerful and personalized healing experience that addresses both the physical and energetic aspects of the body. "}
