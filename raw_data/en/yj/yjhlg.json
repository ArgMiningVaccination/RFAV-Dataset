You can combine manipulators, translators,microscopes ( MOM or SOM ) and stages to give you complete control over your complex experiments. Bring all devices to memorized positions or bring pipettes to a working location in seconds. Available as a free download on our web site. OPTICAL PRODUCTSOur latest products include the Lambda HPX-L5 , a new high-powered white light LED and the versatile SOM simple moving microscope optimized to allow in vivo and in vitro experimentation in one set-up. As with our two-photon MOM microscope, the SOM can robotically position the objective over the sample and focus, opening up experimental possibilities.MICROPIPETTE FABRICATIONSutter Instrument, the recognized leader in micropipette fabrication technology, offers leading edge technology in the P-1000 micropipette puller with an intuitive, full-featured interface. An extensive library of built-in programs is available through the color touch-screen display, taking the guesswork out of pipette pulling. MICROINJECTIONThe XenoWorks \u00ae microinjection system has been designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of applications that require the manipulation of cells and embryonic tissues including ICSI, ES Cell Microinjection, and Adherent Cell Microinjection. Highly-responsive movement and excellent ergonomics intuitively link the user with the micropipette, improving yield - saving time and resources.Visit us at Booth #834 ONE DIGITAL DRIVE, HOURS * TELEPHONE NUMBERS AAA ..................................................................... 617-954-3968 Boston Convention & Exhibition Center, Room 103 Saturday - Tuesday, 7:30 am - 6:30 pm APS ...................................................................... 617-502-2246 Westin Boston Waterfront, Hancock Saturday - Tuesday: 7:00 am - 5:00 pm Wednesday: 7:00 am - 3:00 pm ASBMB ................................................................617-954-3485Boston Convention & Exhibition Center, Room 252 OutsideSunday - Tuesday, 8:30 am - 5:00 pm Wednesday, 8:30 am - 3:00 pm ASIP ..................................................................... 617-954-3482 Boston Convention & Exhibition Center, Room 159Saturday - Tuesday, 8:00 am - 5:00 pm Wednesday, 8:00 am - 12:00 pm ASN....................................................................... 617-342-5437 Renaissance Boston Waterfront, GeorgesSaturday - Tuesday, 9:30 am - 1:00 pm;

CME Accreditation Statement: This activity (\"American Society for Investigative Pathology [ASIP] 2015 Annual Meeting\") has been planned and implemented in accordance with the Essential Areas and policies of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) through the joint sponsorship of the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) and the American Society for Investigative Pathology (ASIP). ASCP is accredited by the ACCME to provide continuing medical education for physicians. The ASCP designates this \"live\" educational activity (ASIP 2015 Annual Meeting) for a maximum of 30.5 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s). Physicians should only claim credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity. Educational Objective/Target Audience The objective of the ASIP 2015 Annual Meeting is to increase basic and applied pathology knowledge, and to provide a forum for the exchange of new research by scientists and investigators. The ASIP 2015 Annual Meeting is designed to meet the participants' education needs in the physician competency area of Medical Knowledge, as defined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), and to support participants' lifelong learning towards a goal of promoting patient safety and improving patient care and is specifically targeted to graduate and medical students, postdoctoral fellows, research scientists, clinical practitioners, and medical education professionals. At the completion of the ASIP 2015 Annual Meeting, participants should be able to: 1. discuss the research underway and/or the current topics relevant to their areas of interest in pathology; 2. demonstrate a gained level of knowledge of the methods and techniques being used by researchers and practitioners in the field; 3. utilize information and data that lead to improvements in human health. Disclosure of Financial Relationships and Resolution of Conflicts of Interest:In order to ensure balance, independence, objectivity and scientific rigor in all its educational activities, and in accordance with ACCME Standards, the ASCP requires that all individuals in a position to influence and/or control the content of ASCP CME activities disclose to the ASCP and subsequently to learners whether they do or do not have any relevant financial relationships with proprietary entities producing health care goods or services that are discussed in CME activities. Faculty are asked to use generic names in any discussion of therapeutic options, to base patient care recommendations on scientific evidence and to base information regarding commercial products/services on scientific methods generally accepted by the medical community. All ASCP CME activities are evaluated by participants for the presence of any commercial bias and thus input is used to subsequent CME planning decisions. The primary purpose of this \"live\" CME activity is educational and the comments, opinions, and/or recommendations expressed by the faculty or authors are their own and not those of ASCP or ASIP. The staff of this CME activity have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interest to disclose. The planning committee members have been asked to disclose any relationships that could be perceived by some as a real or apparent conflict of interest. The following members of the planning committee have disclosed relationships that they do not consider have influenced their participation; the disclosures have been reviewed and conflicts of interest have been resolved or managed:liiName Commercial Interest Role Compensation Satdarshan Paul S. Monga Abbvie Advisory Board Honorarium John Tomaszewski Ibris Scientific Advisory Board Nothing Precision Diagnostics Scientific Advisory Board Travel support Warren Tourtellotte Roche MCOE Advisory Board Honorarium The following members of the planning committee and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose: Wen-Xing Ding Martha Furie Thomas Giordano Jonathan Themis Kyriakides Asma Nusrat William Puszyk Mark E. Sobel James Stone Elizabeth Whitley Monte Willis All invited faculty of CME-designated sessions have been asked to disclose any relationships that, in the context of their presentation, could be perceived by some as a real or apparent conflict of interest. All faculty with disclosed relationships have affirmed that they do not consider these relationships will influence their presentation. The disclosures have been reviewed and conflicts of interest resolved or managed. All disclosures are included in the ASIP 2015 Annual Meeting CME Workbook and will be revealed at the beginning of each scientific presentation. Sessions Eligible for CMEPlease refer to the ASIP 2015 Annual Meeting CME Workbook for a consolidated list of sessions that are eligible for AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s). The ASIP 2015 Annual Meeting CME Workbook will be available online on the ASIP website (http://www.asip.org/meetings/2015/cme.cfm) beginning March 13, 2015 and onsite in the ASIP Office and the Experimental Biology Meeting Management Office located in the Boston Convention Center, Boston, MA. In addition, signs outside ASIP meeting rooms will designate those educational sessions that are eligible for AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s) as \"CME.\" Please note that some ASIP scientific sessions are not eligible for AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s) because faculty disclosures of financial relationships with commercial interests could not be resolved or managed. Please also be aware that visiting exhibits and posters in the exhibit hall is not an approved continuing medical education activity because of ACCME standards that are designed to prevent commercial bias. Should you have any questions about CME eligibility of a session, please ask at the ASIP Meeting Office or contact the ASIP Education Office (cme@asip.org, 301-634-7130), located at 9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20814-3998. How to Apply for CME Credit: CME Application Forms will be available online at http://www.asip.org/meetings/2015/cme.cfm by March 28, 2015. Applications for CME credit must be submitted online no later than June 30, 2015. You will receive your CME certificate within two weeks of successful submission of your online application. Should you have questions about your CME application (or do not receive your certificate within the timeframe explained above), contact the ASIP Education Office (phone 301-634-7440; fax 301-634-7990; email cme@asip.org or write to ASIP Education Office, 9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20814). CME Application Fees: ASIP members in good standing: there is no fee to apply for CME for the ASIP 2015 Annual Meeting Non-ASIP members: there is a $100 application fee, payable upon submission of the online CME application. liiiCAREER DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS (OVERVIEW) Please refer to the session numbers below (preceding each title) in the Oral Program pages 1-170 for further information regarding these sessions.

Core to science communication is the ability to be attentive to an audience, to let the audience's physical and audible responses inform how the talk is given. Yet the skills that make this possible (deep listening, flexibility, and spontaneous responses) are learned through practice that is rarely part of our scientific training. More than knowing what to do, scientists need opportunities to experience and practice what to do. Light refreshments provided.78 BIOCHEMISTRY MONDAY229.

But, now that you have started looking, how do you land the position in the department that is \"perfect\" for your career goals and research interests? The secret to getting your foot in the door involves the assembly of a strong, effective, professional academic job search portfolio. What is an academic job search portfolio? It is a concise but comprehensive summary of your professional growth that highlights your professional training, goals, and work philosophy. It contains a collection of documents intended to showcase your potential to garner extramural grant support, lead a comprehensive and innovative research program, and demonstrate your commitment to excellence in teaching. Your academic job search portfolio should tell prospective employers that you meet all expected requirements for the advertised position, and, in general, it will fulfill the requested documents needed for the initial application. There are several components to an academic job search portfolio. Each has its own unique role, and each provides information that is critical to getting the position that you desire. The five major components of an academic job search portfolio are as follows: 1) Cover letter 2) Curriculum vitae (CV) 3) Research statement 4) Teaching philosophy statement 5) References The cover letter is probably the most important part of your academic job search portfolio. It is the component that can literally \"get your foot in the door.\" How? Think about how you shop for a book while waiting to catch a flight. Think about what persuades you to buy a particular book. You probably initiate your search for a novel by looking for books by authors whose work you have previously read and enjoyed (name recognition). Then the next step in the decision-making process involves reading the blurb on the back cover of the book that highlights the contents or storyline.

Members have been recognized worldwide for leading edge scientific accomplishments in science and medicine, and the generation of documents that have literally changed the approach, direction and emphasis of anatomical science education around the world. Our Mission Advancing anatomical science through research, education, and professional development. Our Vision Serve as the gateway for conveying the relevance of biological structure as it relates to function from molecules to organisms, and the role of anatomy in team-based, interdisciplinary science, healthcare, and education. Our Difference AAA is dedicated to supporting and providing our members with opportunities to enhance their careers, expand their scientific knowledge, and grow their professional network. 9650 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD 20814-3998 301.634.7910 To join today, go to www.anatomy.org.\"AAA is a great organization and provides many ways to become inv olved and build careers. As an example, AAA gave me the opportunity to give my first presentation as a graduate student, chair my first platform session as a postdoctoral fellow, organize my first symposium as an assistant professor, and as a professor, to take my first trip to China to participate in a meeting of the Chinese Anatomical Society. So, AAA has continued to give me opportunities to learn and network from early career up to being a senior faculty member. AAA can do the same for you. \" Lydia DonCarlos, Ph.D., Professor Loyola University Chicago Member Since 1988Membership Bene Include: Reduced page charges to publish in ASPET journalsFree access to all ASPET journalsFree networking & social events Award opportunitiesCareer center benefits And much more!

The normal physiological condition of rodents under surgery is altered by the introduction of the anesthetic. Subsequent surgical procedures and other activities performed while the animal is under anesthesia can further change the physiological state of the rodent. Any change in temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate or blood pressure introduces a variable into your study that can be controlled.

Even though it introduces the greatest variability into cell culture, surprisingly FBS is not intensely scrutinized as a reagent. The use of FBS in cell culture applications will be examined, as its use may go against the basic principles of scientific experimentation in that the variables are not controlled for, it contains unknowns, and results from experiments using FBS in cell culture potentially cannot be replicated.Tips and Tricks for Improved Immunostaining Abcam1 www.abcam.com 2:00 pm-3:00 pm (Hall A) - Show Floor Presenter: Brendan CollinsImmunohistochemistry can be a very frustrating and time consuming technique to get right. Over the years, Abcam's Scientific Support team have successfully helped many scientists with their immunostaining experiments. Our expert from the Scientific Support team will share some of the most common problems and mistakes made in the lab when performing immunostaining on tissue or cell culture samples, and reveal their top tips for troubleshooting your experiment. The topics covered in this talk will address the entire experimental procedure: treatment of cells or tissue to modulate protein expression, preparation of samples for immunochemical analysis, and protein visualization. If you have any specific questions, our team would be happy to answer them after the presentation.535 *By invitation only.
