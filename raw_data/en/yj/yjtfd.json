Roth, MD, MS froM the c ha Ncell or for h ealth Scie Nce S The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center is our state's only aca- demic health center - one of fewer than 100 in the nation. We train much of New Mexico's health provider workforce while offering the highest-quality clinical care to our residents. But we are also charged with planning for the state's health needs. This takes many forms. For example, we conduct an annual workforce analysis that tells policymakers how many health providers we require, and where. We also are engaged in discovering new methods of health care delivery that will benefit future generations while building our capacity for population health research. This is where our vibrant and growing research enterprise plays such an important role. I'm pleased to report that our research funding continued to grow last year, even as this arena has grown progressively more competitive nationally. In fact, while other academic health centers are struggling, we're thriving. This speaks to the incredible dedication of our faculty, staff and students. I'm very proud of their accomplishments. Grant funding is just one way to measure a research program's success, how - ever. Our scientific inquiry ultimately must improve the lives of the people we serve. One sign that we're succeeding in this effort is the 37 new private companies created since 2004 from research that was done here. New business development contributes to New Mexico's economic vitality and holds the potential to transform the treatment of many serious diseases and chronic conditions. This represents our highest and most enduring values. I want to congratulate our researchers for their contributions, and I am confident that we can look forward to their continued success in coming years.RESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 3 Richard S. Larson, MD, PhD froM the executive v ice c ha Ncell or a N d v ice c ha Ncell or for r e S earch Some things just improve with time. I'm pleased to report that our research enterprise at the UNM Health Sciences Center has once again seen year-over-year growth, achieving a record $156 million in grant funding for FY 2014 - a 5 percent increase. We have maintained this upward trajectory amid a broad decline in the overall level of funding for academic research. With federal dollars declining, we have strengthened our internal capacities while forging strategic partnerships with other entities, such as Sandia National Laboratories. Affordable Care Act-related grants and contracts have been central to our success. The Office of Research and the Clinical & Translational Science Center provide a suite of training and support services for investigators seeking awards. Over the past three years, we have submitted 144 applications for ACA-related funding and seen an amazing 49 percent success rate, for a total of $46 million. We can look forward to continued growth with the successful renewals of our Clinical and Translational Science Award and the UNM Cancer Center's NIH Center Core Grant. Meanwhile, we garnered national recognition by hosting this year's Land of Achievement: Extending the Reach of Science with SBIR/STTR Programs, the 16th annual Small Business Innovation Research-Small Business Technology Transfer conference. This National Institutes of Health event brought together hundreds of researchers, NIH program officers, small business entrepreneurs and company representatives. UNM HSC also provided vital leadership by serving as the hub of a regional consortium that brings together researchers from throughout the Western states. New Mexicans can justly take pride in the scope of our groundbreaking biomedical research. 4 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Nancy Ridenour, PhD, RN, APRN, BC, FAAN froM the dea N of the c ollege of Nur S i Ng The College of Nursing continued to provide leadership both locally and nationally over the past year, with innovative research and service, and a growing array of grants and contracts. The College has historically focused on promoting and enhancing health and well- ness, along with creative approaches to helping patients, families and communities manage health challenges. Our research addresses cancer prevention and screening, sleep apnea, pain, respiratory conditions, childhood asthma and rural health, along with problems affecting particular populations, such as Native Americans and veterans. College of Nursing faculty lead important projects and participate as members of in- terdisciplinary teams. They also contribute to local and national initiatives dedicated to advancing the science of health, including UNM's Clinical & Translational Science Center and the federally funded Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. We also engage in translational science by collaborating with others to help implement evidence-based solutions while growing our partnerships with other organizations, government and industry. The Nurse-Family Partnership Program is one example where nursing faculty, students, alumni and other practitioners make a difference within the community. This model, in which nurses work closely with new parents, already has shown promising outcomes and has the potential to improve children's health throughout their development. The College's longstanding model of collaborative research and service contin- ues to bear fruit as we work with colleagues and partners to address New Mexico health priorities. RESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 5 Lynda S. Welage, PharmD, FCCPfroM the dea N of the c ollege of Phar Mac y College of Pharmacy researchers are dedicated to finding cures, novel treatments and non-invasive diagnostics for some of the nation's deadliest diseases and public health threats. Research at the College focuses on improving outcomes for stroke victims, growth and neurocognitive deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, novel therapeutics and interventions for infectious diseases, the prevention of coronary artery disease and the treatment of congestive heart failure. College researchers are also examining and finding treatments for diseases associ- ated with exposure to air and traffic pollutants, pesticides, tobacco and UV exposure, as well as arsenic, uranium and other heavy metals, and environmental toxins. Can-cer research focuses on diagnosing and treating leukemia, breast, ovarian, prostate and other cancers. Other investigations involve novel drug and vaccine delivery, medication therapy management and serious adverse drug reactions. The College received more than $7.8 million in extramural research support this fiscal year - a remarkable 40 percent increase compared to total research awards in FY 2014. Most impressively, total National Institutes of Health funding increased 121 percent over the same period. This growth has translated into a significant improvement in the College's national research performance rankings: the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy ranked the College 27th in total funding and 29th in NIH funding for federal FY 2013 among 130 U.S. colleges of pharmacy. The College promotes interdisciplinary scientific collaborations via its Request- for-Proposals Intramural Pilot Funding Initiative. It is fostering team science collaborations and building on its areas of excellence to increase extramural funding, including large-scale programmatic grants and other high-impact outcomes. 6 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Thomas M. Williams, MD froM the executive v ice dea N of the School of Medici N e The UNM School of Medicine had another record-setting year in overall research funding success. In a challenging environment for academic health centers, we continued to grow our research enterprise in an approach that is highly integrated with our clinical and educational missions. The School's total research funding increased to more than $133 million in FY 2014, including significant increases in cancer and pediatric clinical trials, awards associated with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and continued success in basic research and programmatic grants from the Nat-ional Institutes of Health. Several new programs will help train medical and graduate students in the art of discovery and translation of new knowledge to better care for those affected by illness. Under the umbrella of our Clinical & Translational Science Center, we continued to develop our Signature Research Programs in cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disease, child health, infectious diseases and immunity, and environmental health, with a special emphasis on brain and behavioral health. The Brain and Behavioral Health Institute is developing our extensive clinical and research expertise to facilitate interdisciplinary solutions to the myriad diseases of brain and behavior facing New Mexicans. The institute has reached out across the state to talk to patients, families and support groups to better understand those needs that we can best address through collaboration. In line with our core values, we are supporting and training the next gener - ation of investigators and caregivers to achieve our Vision 2020 initiative to improve the health and access to care for all New Mexicans. RESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 7 Principal Investigator Christopher Abbott, MDAssistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry; Medical Director, Seniors Clinic and Electroconvulsive Therapy Service Grant Name Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Mechanisms and Biomarkers (COBRE II) Grantor National Institute of General Medical Sciences Collaborators/Mentors Juan Bustillo, MD, Andy Mayer, PhD, and Vince Calhoun, PhD Electroconvulsive therapy sounds scarier than it looks. An electrode placed on a sedated patient's right temple sends 25-millisecond bursts of electricity surging through the brain for seven seconds, inducing a 40-second seizure. Drugs briefly paralyze the patient's muscles; only faint twitching in one foot betrays what is happening. \"It's really anticlimactic, \" says Christopher Abbott, MD, medical director of UNM's Electro - convulsive Therapy Service. But ECT, as it is known, can yield dramatic results for patients with severe, treatment-resistant depression. A month-long course of ECT treatments often relieves depression symptoms while spurring the growth of new neurons in the hippocampus, a brain structure that plays a central role in forming long-term memories, Abbott says. He is part of a $12 million multi-modal neuroimaging investigation to explore the neural basis of psychiatric disorders. Abbott conducts MRI scans of patients' brains before, during and after ECT to better understand how the treatment works and which patients are most likely to benefit. Abbott, who completed his residency in psychiatry and earned a master's degree in clin- ical and translational research at UNM, credits Juan Bustillo, MD, a professor of psychiatry and neurosciences, for his mentorship in neuroimaging. \"He's been really instrumental in helping me develop my research career, \" Abbott says. Abbott, who also was a Mentored Clinical Research Scholar, credits the UNM Clinical & Translational Science Center for providing multiple resources to support his research. \"It's unusual to have a high-tech scanner this close to patients, \" Abbott says. \"We are in a really unique position to be able to capitalize on our inpatient psychiatric facility and get people into the scanner. \" KeePiNg c urre N t: Tracking T he n eural e ffec Ts of e lec T roconvulsive Therapy Featured on http://vimeo.com/hsctv/abbott8 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Nature is unkind to decomposing bodies. Muscle, skin and internal organs slacken and lose their form as time, temperature and other factors drive the inexorable process of decay. Tissue breakdown brings with it substantial changes in chemical composition and physical properties, explains Natalie Adolphi, PhD, who is exploring ways to enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of human corpses. The same MRI methods that allow doctors to get detailed images of soft tissue in living patients don't work as well once tissue cools and decomposition sets in, explains Adolphi, a research associate profes-sor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. \"My goal is to understand the effect of post-mortem changes in both temperature and time since death, \" Adolphi says, \"and then be able to account for those by adjusting imaging protocols to give high-quality images that could then be used diagnostically to aid in determining things like the cause and manner of death. \" Adolphi has teamed up with pathologist Kurt Nolte, MD, director of UNM's Center for Forensic Imaging in the Office of the Medical Investiga-tor (OMI), and radiologist Gary Hatch, MD, the center's assistant director, to conduct tissue experiments using OMI's 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner.

Adolphi experimentally adjusts the scanner's sampling rate to compensate for temperature and time post-mortem to obtain the highest quality image, creating a reference standard for patholo-gists to use. New Mexico's OMI, which handles all autopsies in the state, is unique in the U.S. for having both a clinical MR scanner and clinical CT scanner in the autopsy suite, Adolphi says. \"It really makes possible a level of access for forensic investigation that just normally wouldn't be available at other medical examiner's offices. \" The forensic imaging center is a partnership between the departments of Radiology and Pathology, the School of Medicine and OMI, says Nolte, who has performed or supervised more than 4,000 conventional autopsies. \"The purpose of the center is to really foster interdisciplinary and multispecialty research, as well as provide support for clinical imaging, \" he says. Pathologists performing autopsies sometimes encounter serious obstacles due to severely decomposed tissue, Nolte says. \"To be able to adjust MR scanners so that they can image tissues that are decomposed, too hot, too cold - all of the different variables - so that forensic patholo-gists can then get a window into anatomy that may be difficult to dissect, is very important. \"Hatch, who studied \"virtual autopsy\" techniques in Switzerland before coming to UNM three years ago, helps Adolphi identify changes in anatomical structures in her research. The Swiss, he says, are studying how much of the traditional autopsy method could be replaced by digital tools that include medical imaging, laser scansand high-resolution color photos. Adolphi believes the research holds tremendous poten- tial. \"The next level would be a new grant further down the road that takes the methods we have developed in this basic study and applies them in a rigorous and sys-tematic way to human subjects, \" she says.

UNM's Center for Development and Disability (CDD) focuses on the social determinants of health - with strategies like support - ing prenatal care and strengthening parent-child relationships for low-income, first-time mothers - through an evidence-based model called the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP). With key support from the College of Nursing and the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department, CDD is participating in this home-visiting health program, which enables licensed nurses to share knowledge and support with at-risk young families. NFP nurses are deployed inAlbuquerque's South Valley (the highest at-risk area in the state) to work with teen and single mothers who lack a regular primary care provider, as well as those involved in substance abuse, smoking or other risk factors that hinder good prenatal care and parenting. Expectant mothers who are less than 28 weeks pregnant and voluntarily enroll in the program receive home visits from a specially trained nurse throughout their pregnancy and until their baby turns two years old. \"Initially, weekly nurse visits involve pending moms and dads, and oftentimes grandparents who might be heavily involved in child care, \" says CDD director Marcia Moriarta, PsyD, the partnership's principal investigator. \"Topics for discussion are based on the families' desires - anything from maximizing baby safety to what to expect from a 1-year-old, \" Moriarta adds. \"The critical component here is our nurses. They're highly qualified, incredibly empathetic, enormously patient and truly caring. Our nursing profession-als make great home visitors and have been strong partners in this study. \" By helping these vulnerable young mothers achieve healthier pregnancies and births, stronger child development and a path toward economic self-sufficiency, both mother and child benefit - as do communities.RESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 11 In a decades-long research career devoted to unlocking the secrets of multiple scle - rosis, Oscar Bizzozero, PhD, credits patient interactions as the key to his lab's success. \"MS is the most common neurological disorder of young adults, \" says Bizzozero, professor and chair of the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology. \"It is a devas-tating diagnosis and it hits them in their prime. \" The disease's daily impact first hit home several years ago when Bizzozero gained a research lab assistant with MS. Now, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society helps support his investigations into how the disease progresses at a cellular level and provides feedback on issues that patients believe are important. \"Working with the MS Society is gratifying, \" he says. \"Their members are well- informed and highly curious about the state of research. \" In previous studies, Bizzozero discovered a protein unique to MS. He has also found that the disease's progression involves the immune system attacking brain and spinal cord cell proteins. In normal circumstances, an enzyme complex called the proteasome would activate to remove the damaged cells, but MS patients seem to have little or no supply of the complex and it never switches \"on. \" Bizzozero's team is investigating whether this failure is unique to MS or present in other disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, he says. Bizzozero and his team also hypothesize that oxidized cells contribute to cell death. If true, then preventing that oxidation may be key to preventing disability in patients with progressive MS. Long-term, they hope their research will suggest new treatments to halt the progression of the disease.Searchi Ng fo r t he Key: unlocking The s ecre Ts of m ulT iple s clerosis Principal Investigator Oscar Bizzozero, PhD Professor and Chair, Department of Cell Biology and Physiology Grant Name Impaired Activity of the Proteasome Activator PA28 in MS Grantor National Multiple Sclerosis Society 12 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) renders about three in 1,000 U.S. newborns developmentally disabled, causing severe cognitive impairment, distinctive facial features, organ de - fects and vision and hearing problems. The more a pregnant mother drinks, the greater the risk. But FAS is just the tip of the iceberg, says Daniel Savage, PhD, a UNM Regents professor and chair of the Depart - ment of Neurosciences. \"Lurking beneath FAS are more than 10,000 newborns each year affected by Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, \" he says. \"That's a higher prevalence than autism. \" Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a less-severe neurodevelopmental condition caused by a combination of prenatal alcohol consumption and other risk factors, like smoking, inadequate prenatal care and poor overall maternal health. FASD causes functional brain damage in newborns, affecting intellectual ability, memory, attention, language expression, social perception and abstract thinking. These lifelong cognitive deficits can lead to failure in school, de - pendent living and trouble with the law, as well as increased risk for medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, hyperten-sion and certain cancers. Savage was recently awarded an $8.1 million National In- stitutes of Health grant to support the New Mexico Alcohol Research Center, one of just 18 NIH-designated alcohol re - search centers, and the only one targeting mechanisms and diagnosis of FASD, as well as effective interventions. The center comprises 15 faculty investigators from the departments of Neurosciences, Psychology, Pediatrics and OB/GYN, as well as the College of Pharmacy and the Mind Research Network. Their projects range from preclinical re - search on how prenatal alcohol exposure causes functional brain damage to clinical studies targeting earlier detection and improved interventions for adverse neurobehavioral consequences associated with FASD. Researchers at the Center are also investigating how drink - ing during pregnancy alters neurotransmitters in the brains of alcohol-exposed offspring, and whether existing drugs might help reverse some of the behavioral problems associ-ated with FASD-stricken children. The work focuses on a neurotransmitter called histamine, Savage explains. The activation of histamine type 3 recep - tors inhibits glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, potentially suppressing learning and memory. \"FASD kids' histamine seem to be in overdrive, inhib - iting glutamate and thereby suppressing neurotransmission, \" Savage says. He hopes to identify existing compounds that block histamine's ability to activate those type 3 receptors, thereby boosting glutamate-powered neurotransmission by \"inhibiting inhibition. \"diag No S i S a N d t reat M e N t: Tackling T he s courge of f eTal a lcohol s pec T rum Disor D er Principal Investigator Daniel Savage, PhD Regents Professor and Chair, Department of Neurosciences Grant Names New Mexico AlcoholResearch Center;Fetal Ethanol Effects on Histaminergic Regulation of Neurotransmission Grantor National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and AlcoholismRESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 13 UNM researcher Ludmila Bakhireva, MD, PhD, explores the neural correlates of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, employing state-of-the-art imaging technology and behavioral measures to identify early signs of functional brain damage in infants prenatally exposed to alcohol. Bakhireva, an associate professor in the College of Pharmacy, and Julia M. Stephen, PhD, of the Mind Research Network, are using magneto- and electro-encephalog-raphy to scan 120 mother-baby pairs at six and 20 months of age for early signs of atypical brain development. It's UNM's first NIH-funded prospective cohort study of pregnant women and their children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. \"FASD is often not diagnosed until behavioral deficits become apparent in school- aged children, \" Bakhireva says. \"We would like to develop tools for diagnosis in the first two years of life. \" With Johnnye Lewis, PhD, of the College of Pharmacy, Bakhireva also measures multiple biomarkers to gauge the combined effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and environmental toxicants on children in the Navajo Birth Cohort. They hope this research will reduce health disparities in the Navajo Nation and improve reproduc - tive health outcomes. Approximately 15 percent of pregnant women use alcohol, with rates as high as 20 percent reported in recent decades. Bakhireva believes her research could help more fetal alcohol-affected children receive effective early intervention, sparing them devastating disabilities later in life.Principal Investigator Ludmila Bakhireva, MD, PhD Associate Professor, Division of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy Grant Name Early Indices of Atypical Neuro-development with Fetal Alcohol Exposure Grantor National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Collaborators/Mentors Johnnye Lewis, PhD, andJulia M.

But Francisella tularensis, the bacterium that causes the disease, can also be harnessed in a bomb. \"In an act of war or terrorism, that bomb is going to be releasing an aerosol, \" says Terry Wu, PhD, a research assistant professor in theDepartment of Internal Medicine. \"The most dangerous form of tularemia is caused by inhalation. \" With support from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Wu and UNM colleagues are collaborating with Sandia National Laboratories on bio - technology that could help protect soldiers exposed to such a weapon. The Sandia researchers leading the project, Jeffrey Brinker, PhD, and Carlee Ashley, PhD, have engineered \"protocells\" - nanoparticles that can be filled with antibiotics and modified to release them in selected tissues at highly controlled rates. A soldier heading into battle could take a single capsule filled with nanoparticles designed to release an antibiotic after exposure to the infectious agent. The antibiotic would continue to be released over the period of time required to completely eliminate infection. The drug-delivery system shows promise far beyond the battlefield. Protocells could be modified to target a tumor without damaging sur - rounding tissue. Or they could be used to reduce public health threats from infectious diseases like tuberculosis, delivering a full course of antibiotic in a single capsule. The technology works well from an engineering perspective, says Wu. He's conducting animal studies to determine the safety and drug-releasing properties of protocells. \"Ultimately, \" he says, \"we want to know whether the protocell is safe, and if so, what's the best way to apply it. \"Courtesy: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesCourtesy: Army ROTCRESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 15 Principal Investigator Yubin Miao, PhD Associate Professor, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy Grant Name Novel Receptor-Targeting Theranostic Peptides for Prostate Cancer Grantor National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Prostate cancer is, by far, the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American men. Ridding the body of it would be so much easier if medical oncologists could see the cancerous cells and kill them where they hide. Yubin Miao, PhD, has devel-oped a tool to do just that. The new peptide he and his team in the College of Pharmacy have developed strongly binds to a specific receptor that prostate cancer cells display in abun-dance. Normal cells display few or none of these receptors. \"This receptor is over - expressed on prostate cancer cells, \" Miao says. \"By targeting the receptors, you can differentiate cancer cells from normal cells. \" Miao's team derived its molecule from a naturally occurring peptide, engineering it to have a far stronger binding affinity and include a radioactive atom called a radionuclide. They used several intricate chemical reactions to create these cus-tom-designed peptides, then thoroughly tested their binding affinity. Radionuclides can be used for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Attach- ing a radionuclide that emits gamma rays makes the peptide visible in a SPECT or PET scan, allowing doctors to locate the cancer cell to which the peptide has bound. A radionuclide that emits beta rays will also kill the tumor cell once the peptide has latched on. Miao and his team coined the term \"theranostic\" to describe their peptide's dual therapeutic and diagnostic ability. The team is testing the peptide in animal models to pave the way for human stud- ies. They hope their man-made molecule will be used in a clinical setting to help medical oncologists find and kill cancer cells wherever they may be.doiNg d ou Ble d uty: craf Ting p ep T i D es To Dia gnose an D Trea T p ros TaT e cancer16 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER The eyes, it is said, are the windows to the soul, but for Arup Das, MD, PhD, they also hold clues to a cure for a devastating disease called diabetic retinopathy. Twenty-nine million diabetic Americans - including an esti- mated eight million undiagnosed patients - face the threat of gradual vision loss as blood vessels leak into the light-sen-sitive rear portion of the retina. \"Diabetes is a big problem, \" says Das, chief of the Division of Ophthalmology in theDepartment of Surgery. \"The question is, are we ready?\" Some 150,000 New Mexicans live with diabetes and 50,000 may develop the eye disease. \"There are many underserved people with diabetes and advanced eye diseases, \" Das says. \"If I can help them in any way, I'll fulfill my dream. \" About 15 years ago, the quest for a cure brought together Das and cell biologist Paul McGuire, PhD. \"It was a fortuitous part-nership and an opportunity to apply what I had been doing to a more clinically relevant problem, \" McGuire says.Das injects medication into the eyes of retinopathy patients to help them regain some of their lost vision, but the treat - ment falls short of sustainable relief. \"I see all the limitations of our current treatment because half of the patients don't respond to it, \" he explains. Even patients who regain some of their lost vision must return for numerous injections, he adds. Now, the duo is testing a new treatment targeting a molecule called angiopoietin-2 that spurs the growth of new blood vessels in the retina but also causes them to leak. Taking their promising research from mice to people, the team is acquir - ing post-mortem human eye tissue in a new collaboration with Madras Diabetes Research Foundation in Chennai, India. Das and McGuire are also investigating methods for spotting diabetic retinopathy earlier. \"There is a period of 10 to 15 years where there are no signs, \" Das explains. \"You don't see any bleeding in the retina, but silently there is some damage going on. \" The late onset of the disease makes it particularly challenging to treat. The pair's research has been conducted in the Cell Biology and Physiology Department's laboratory for nearly 17 years. Consistent funding pays for supplies, student researchers, ad-ministrative support and grant tracking, enabling the search for a cure to go forward, McGuire says. While Das and McGuire seek new treatments, Das offers some wise advice: \"The most important way to prevent blindness is through diet and controlling blood sugar, blood pressure and blood cholesterol. If a patient doesn't control their diabetes, treatments will be ineffective. \" with a N eye tow ard a c ure: unm r esearchers sT u Dy r eT inal Diseases Principal Investigators Arup Das, MD, PhD (left) Professor of Ophthalmology and Cell Biology and Physiology; Chief, Division of Ophthalmology; Vice Chair (Research) Department of Surgery Paul McGuire, PhD (right) Chair, Department of Cell Biology and Physiology Grant Name Inflammatory Chemokines: A Novel Target in Early Diabetic Retinopathy Grantor National Institutes of Health/National Eye Institute RESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 17 Principal Investigator Dusanka Deretic, PhD Research Professor,Department of Surgery Grant Name Rhodopsin Trafficking and Photoreceptor Membrane Grantor National Institutes of Health/National Eye Institute ...asks Dusanka Deretic, PhD. She's talking about the eye's photoreceptor cell, which she has studied for more than 10 years to understand another leading cause of blindness - retinitis pigmentosa. The disease, inherited and incurable, causes patients to progressively lose these retinal cells. Deretic explores mutations in a molecule called rhodopsin in the photoreceptor cells of frogs in her lab at the Fluorescence Microscopy Center. The frogs' large photoreceptor cells are ideal to study the eye disease. \"It's the most complicated cell, \" says Deretic, a research professor in the Depart - ment of Surgery. \"It's not only very sensitive but it also has to be maintained throughout your life. \" Deretic compares a photoreceptor cell to a multi-story building in which rhodop - sin resides. To maintain healthy eyesight, the molecule must restrict its movement to certain parts of the building. \"If it goes everywhere, it causes everything to collapse and die, \" she says, \"and that is how you lose vision. \" Deretic is also collaborating with University of Edinburgh researchers to study two forms of retinitis pigmentosa in hopes of finding a common cure. \"how D o you keep T his beau T iful cell heal T hy?\" 18 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER fkill =2 BVF L BVF K (r /L) - K (r /(L BVF)) BVF r K (r / L) (1 - BVF)1 01 b bbb ,Raj Shah with members of the Zuni Health Initiative Principal Investigator Vittorio Cristini, PhDProfessor and Director of Computational Biology; Victor and Ruby Hansen Surface Professor in Molecular Modeling of Cancer, UNM Cancer Center Grant Name Collaborative Research: Multistage Modeling of Mammary Gland Development Grantor National Science Foundation doiNg the M ath: how \" mas T er eQ uaT ions of cancer \" can Transform Trea Tmen T If nature obeys the laws of physics, shouldn't cancer tumors obey them, too?

Cristini, the Victor and Ruby Hansen Surface Professor in Molecular Modeling of Cancer at the UNM Cancer Center, explains that biology is still very important in understanding cancer. \"Cancer is a complex, multi-scale, micro-structured material in space and in time, \" he says. Genes, he says, change the cellular environment and those changes al- ter the physical transport properties within a tumor. Cristini's equations describe those physical processes and aim to provide the missing link between the genes and the tumor's behavior. Cristini's current project will apply these master equations to normal breast development. He hopes to learn why cancer develops as a per - turbation - a disturbance to normal development. \"Ultimately, \" he says, \"we would like to develop a multi-scale simulator that can show the entire progression from normal duct all the way to breast cancer. \" The project includes a concurrent clinical trial being conducted at the UNM Cancer Center to use the equations to guide breast cancer treatment for patients. The clinical trial might find new biomarkers for breast cancer while shedding light on how chemotherapy drugs reach the tumor in breast tissue. \"We need to assess how the predictive value of chemotherapeutic efficacy correlates to clinically relevant outcomes, \" Cristini says. \"Then we can use [the equations] as a tool in the clinic. \" Featured on http://vimeo.com/hsctv/cristiniRESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 19 fkill =2 BVF L (r /L) - K (r /(L BVF)) BVF r K (r / L) (1 - BVF)1 01 b bbb , Natural Networ KiNg: using viv o To p romo T e Team- base D r esearch Principal Investigator Richard S.

In more formal terms, VIVO is a highly searchable online net - working system that enables scientists to identify colleagues who share their research interests. Its use has grown through-out the UNM Health Sciences Center since UNM received its Clinical and Translational Science Award. \"Right now, it's being used by more and more departments as a faculty web page, \" Weagel says. \"The department will have a list of faculty names and those will be linked to VIVO profiles. \" More than 800 faculty members have created profiles with varying degrees of detail, he adds. UNM took a big step toward embracing VIVO on an institution- wide basis in 2012, when Pope L. Moseley, MD, chair of the Department of Internal Medicine, required all 250 faculty mem-bers in his department to adopt it. \"You do that, and suddenly you've got some weight, \" Moseley says. VIVO has been of particular benefit within the Mountain West Research Consortium, an 11-institution partnership formed to spur inter-university collaboration, Moseley says. When awarding pilot grants within the consortium, \"We insist that people use VIVO as the first cut in looking for a mentor, \" Moseley says. \"You're training people in research, but you're also teaching people a networking tool - you're training people in team science. \" Edward Weagel, PhDPope Moseley's research on VIVO \u00a9 Strategies Pope L . Moseley, MD20 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Scientific resources are hard to come by in the wide-open, empty spaces of the West. Low population density and a shared medical frontier pose unique challenges for clinical care and biomedical research. To meet those challenges, biomedical research must em - brace a team approach, says Richard S. Larson, MD, PhD, e xecutive vice chancellor and vice chancellor for research at the UNM Health Sciences Center. That's why UNM led the formation of the Mountain West Research Consortium, with the goal of building research capacity throughout the western United States. \"A single investigator can't do everything that is needed on many research projects, \" Larson says. \"It's important to be able to leverage our capacity and build resources. Being part of a large network of universities enables us to do that. \" The idea of banding together as a consortium grew from a meeting in Albuquerque in 2009. By the end of the gather - ing, attendees from universities in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Nev ada and Wyoming had agreed to form a research net - work. Hawaii later joined the 11-member consortium. T he consortium benefited from the Institutional Devel - opment Award (IDeA) program, launched by the National I nstitutes of Health (NIH) in 1999 in recognition that federal research funding has historically lagged in many Western states. Today more than 20 research projects have benefited from the program and more are in the pipeline. The consortium provides opportunities for collaboration and research train - ing, as well as access to shared resources and services. Syn- ergy has been achieved through joint pilot funding, VIVO net working, mini-sabbaticals, junior faculty mentoring and an undergraduate biomedical research pipeline program. Principal Investigators Bill Shuttleworth, PhD Professor, Department of Neurosciences; Associate Director, Clinical & Translational Science Center Richard S.

Montana, for instance, has a public health program with a national reputation for its work in Native American health concerns. Wyoming had developed a distance education model worthy of study, says Bill Shuttleworth, PhD, co-director of UNM's Clinical & Translational Science Center (CTSC). Researchers from across the region are now coming to Al - buquerque, he says. \"Just opening the door is often all that is needed t o see real changes, \" Shuttleworth says. \"Many times what they need is funding for teaching release time. \" Visiting researchers give a grand rounds lecture, which yields insight into their areas of study. \"At the same time, \" he adds, \"they're meeting with successful researchers here who have been through the grant process and know what types of review their efforts will be up against. \" Pope L. Moseley, MD, chair of Department of Internal Medicine and associate director of the CTSC, has partnered with the CTSC bioinfomatics group to expand the use of VIVO - the shared professional database that allows investi - gators to search for current member research interests. T he consortium was recently awarded a $20.4 million NIH grant to further develop research ties. UNM's $5.3 million share of the grant will enable the Health Sciences Center to serve as the regional biostatistics core and for additional visiting professors, new training programs and mini- sabbaticals by researchers. \" There is a lot of benefit for UNM in these collaborations, \" Shuttleworth says. \"We have been able to expand faculty research into other states and other patient populations. \" \"This is a tremendous achievement, \" Larson adds. \"I antic - ipate this will be a platform for further strengthening our r elationships with other institutions in the region. \" 22 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER It's going to take a village to defeat the epidemic of diabetes in the United States, says longtime researcher David Schade, MD, who has recruited for his studies hundreds of patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. \"We are going to win this race, \" says Schade, chief of the Division of Endocrinology in the Department of Internal Medicine. \"A lot of people are working on different aspects of this very complicated disease. \" Schade conducts his studies at the Diabetes Research and Treatment Center, launched decades ago by the late Leonard Napolitano, for - mer dean of the School of Medicine, at Schade's behest. The research center is hosting new research to find the best treatment for Type 2 diabetics. The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes Effectiveness study will compare the effectiveness of four drugs in 5,000 diabetics who have developed high blood sugar because they cannot make or use insulin properly. Schade is partnering with physicians from across the UNM Health Sciences Center to manage the care of some 200 New Mexicans par - ticipating in his latest study. \"Collaboration is the name of the game, \" he says. \"There is lots of help at our university, lots of expertise and people always say yes. \" Schade also is seeking therapies to help Type 1 diabetics, who can- not produce insulin. \"We don't have a magic bullet yet, \" he says. His studies have helped predict the occurrence of the disease five years before a diagnosis, but the search for a drug to prevent it is frus-trating. \"We are not smart enough right now, \" he says. \"There is too much we don't know. \"Principal Investigator David Schade, MDProfessor and Chief, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine Grant Name GRADE/Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study Grantor National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Collaborators/Mentors Allen Adolphe, MD, PhD, andMark R.

Nancy Kanagy, PhD, a professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, is seeking to understand why that happens. Just how sleep apnea worsens blood pressure is not well understood, but up to one in five people may suffer from it. When the National Institutes of Health put out a call for proposals on sleep apnea research several years ago, Kanagy realized UNM's experience in conducting vascular studies could provide a novel approach. \"Most researchers were looking at the sympathetic ner - vous system, \" Kanagy says. \"We thought, 'Why not develop a model to investigate vascular changes and contributions to the elevated blood pressure?'\" Kanagy's team first developed a rat model of sleep apnea and found that it only takes about 14 days for repeated exposure to hypoxia (low oxygen) during sleep to increase blood pressure, even during waking hours. They found that hypoxia increases production of an artery-constricting peptide called endothelin, which ele - vates blood pressure. Ongoing studies are investigating exactly how that happens. The team is also investigating the role of hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) in controlling blood pressure. Sleep apnea patients show significantly lower H 2S levels compared with normal sleepers. The molecule seems to limit inflammation and open arteries, leading to many positive effects in the cardiac and vascular systems. \"Long-term, we are hoping that a better understanding of these mechanisms will lead to new and more effective therapies to treat cardiovascular disease in sleep apnea patients, \" Kanagy says.Principal Investigator Nancy L.

Internationally recog-nized for her scientific contributions, she collaborates regularly with colleagues in Neurosciences and Psychiatry.laurie h udson, p hD Basic Science Research, 2014 In her 17 years at UNM, Laurie Hudson's scientific curiosity has led her to pursue research interests ranging from therapies for ovarian cancer to sub - jects like wound healing, skin cancer and metal toxicity. T here's a thread tying together these diverse topics, says Hudson, a Regents professor in the College of Pharmacy: epidermal growth factor (EGF), which stimulates cell division and differentiation. When the EGF system is disrupted, trouble ensues. \"The EGF receptor is frequently overexpressed in epithelial tumors, \" Hud- son says. Ovarian cancers share many characteristics with these tumors, she adds. With her UNM colleagues, she is studying a painkiller called ketorolac for its surprising tumor-fighting properties. \"We're in the final stages of our initial clinical trial, \" she reports. ellen beswick , p hD Junior Faculty Research, 2014 Nationally known researcher Ellen Beswick is working to understand how chronic inflammation in the gut promotes the growth of tumors as she searches for new cancer-fighting therapies. \"I discovered three pathways that may be prog- nostic and therapeutic targets for gastrointestinal cancers, \" says Beswick, an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology. \"Two involve inflammatory cytokines that are early events during Helicobacter pylori infection and in inflammatory bowel diseases that may drive chronic inflammation and tumor development. \" The third avenue is a signaling pathway, she says. \"The overall goal of my research program is developing novel animal models and utilizing hu-man tissues to pinpoint the precise mechanism in chronic inflammation to target for new therapeutic approaches. \"robin ohls , m D Clinical Science Research, 2014 When Robin Ohls, a professor in the Department of Pediatrics, started in neonatal hematology in the late 1980s she was interested in substances that could boost red blood cells in preterm babies and reduce the need for transfusions. Ohls found that two hormones - erythropoietin and darbepoetin - were effective and carried an unexpected side benefit: they actually protected the brains of children who received them. \"We looked at their cognitive scores at 2 years of age and again at 4 and 6, \" Ohls says. \"We show significant effects with both of the medications we've studied. \" \"It looks like it's coming along and eventually it will become the stan- dard of care for preterm babies, \" Ohls says of her research. \"We certainly have laid the foundation. \" vallabh o. \" raj \" shah, p hD Population Science Research, 2014 Vallabh O. \"Raj\" Shah says he was \"a lab rat\" when he joined UNM in 1990.

An associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Mo - lecular Biology, Shah has worked to help the Zuni people combat an epidemic of diabetes using education and behavioral interventions. He recently spearheaded the creation of an exercise facility - but he gives most of the credit to the Zunis themselves. \"I didn't do anything, \" he says modestly. \"I just had the right staff to help me. \" 26 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER A rowing hobby taught Doug Vincent that it's not only important to have a powerful stroke, but also a long and smooth recovery\u2014which, he says, also happens to be true for mimicking blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Vincent is the CEO of Design Mentor, Inc., a New Hamp - shire medical device company that is developing a pulsatile pressure cardiac pump that mimics the human heart to maintain optimal blood flow during bypass surgery. He won the Pitch Fiesta at October's National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research and Technolo - gy Transfer Conference in Albuquerque. Hosted by the UNM Health Sciences Center, the three-day conference focused on NIH Small Business Innovation Research and Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) programs, which in 2014 provided more than $758 million to support small businesses developing new therapies and medical devices. The conference brought together scientists, en-gineers, computer programmers, doctors, nurses, entre - preneurs and investors interested in learning about this funding source and in strategies for developing innovative health care solutions. \"NIH SBIR/STTR is crucial for transforming basic discoveries into practical improvements in health care, \" says Richard S. Larson, MD, PhD, UNM HSC's executive vice chancellor and vice chancellor for research. New Mexico inventors and small businesses have obtained almost $15 million in SBIR/STTR support since 2010. That funding has supported portable imaging systems to diagnose diabetic retinopa-thy, 3-D ultrasound technology to detect congenital heart defects in infants, magnetic nanoparticle biopsy tech-niques and improved feeding devices for use in neonatal intensive care units, among others.Albuquerque Mayor Richard J. Berry spoke about the city's support for biomedical entrepreneurship. \"I have a deep and profound respect for anybody here today who is taking the great work that happens with the help of NIH and bringing it to the market to help people be well and survive and spend many fulfilling years with their loved ones, \" Berry said. taK i Ng care o f Bu S i N e SS : pa ving T he wa y for p ublic- p riva T e par T nerships RESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 27 By the N uMBerS 1,346 Proposals submitted821 Proposals awarded1,002 Total full-time faculty$156,103,365 in FY 2014 $28.5 million increase since 2005287 Principal investigators extramurally funded 83 Community research sites in New Mexico 37 Business start-ups over 10 years 1 of 42 National institutions with both an NIH-designated Cancer Center and a Clinical and Translational Science Award hsc research 2014 28 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER SUPPORT KNOWLEDGE INVESTIGATORS Prioritizing Research Strategic Planning Tracking and Continuous Quality Improvement Education Food and Drug Administration Commercialization Seminars Online or Face-to-Face Good Clinical Practice Training KL2 (Mentored Clinical Research Scholar Awards) Junior Faculty Mentoring Undergraduate Pipeline Network Masters in Clinical Research Clinical and Translational Investigators Program Mentor Training Program Cores Biomedical Informatics Biostatistics Community Engaged Research Core Drug Discovery Clinical Research Unit Human Imaging Core Translational Lab Flow Cytometry Microscopy Genomics Pilot Programs Clinical and Translational Pilots New Technology and Commercialization Linking Clinical Trials to Drug Discovery and Re-purposing Linking Technology to Clinical and Translational Investigation Community Interventions Leading to Better Health Outcomes Research Allocation Committees Cancer Center PilotssupporT for science Growing our OwnRESEARCH ANNUAL REpORT 2014 29 Partners Regional Consortiums National Labs (Los Alamos, Sandia) State/Community Partners New Mexico Angels Facilitation Biodesign Program Synergy Meetings VIVO (IT Tool That Enables Collaboration) Weekly Announcements of Funding Sources National Institutes of Health Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Health Resources and Services Administration Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Training Grantsmanship Team ScienceEXTRAMURAL FUNDING PARTNERSHIPS 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 $156 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014millionMillions $ SUPPORT Cores Biomedical Informatics Biostatistics Community Engaged Research Core Drug Discovery Clinical Research Unit Human Imaging Core Translational Lab Flow Cytometry Microscopy Genomics Pilot Programs Clinical and Translational Pilots New Technology and Commercialization Linking Clinical Trials to Drug Discovery and Re-purposing Linking Technology to Clinical and Translational Investigation Community Interventions Leading to Better Health Outcomes Research Allocation Committees Cancer Center PilotssupporT for science Growing our Own30 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER uNM heal th Sciences t raining grants 2014 Mario Aragon, PhD Candidate T32 Scholar, NIH/NHLBI Research Interest: Humoral mediators of endothelial cell activation following exposure to air pollutants and inhaled nanoparticles Mentor: Matthew Campen, PhD Jonathan L.
