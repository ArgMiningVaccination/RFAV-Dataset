It originates from the first Named Entity set defined by MUC (Grishman et al., 1996), the Named Entity set developed by IREX (Sekine et al., 2000), and the Extended Named Entity hierarchy which contains approximately 150 NE types (Sekine et al., 2002). The applications include Questions and Answering (Q&A) system that analyzes general texts such as newspaper articles, as well as Information Extraction (IE), Machine Translation (MT), Summarization and Information Retrieval (IR) systems that meet variety of NLP applications. For example, Q&A system provides information that one wants to know or extract from articles. Those information can be categorized into fixed number of classes with hierarchies; we designed it in the Extended Named Entity Hierarchy, Q&A system or IE system assuming that information one wants know is basically in a form of noun phrase with specific names and numerical values. In other words, it is not a word that expresses general concept or class, but rather a name of concept or thing that can be pointed out physically. The Extended Named Entity Hierarchy is divided into three major classes; name, time, and numerical expressions (these three classes are the same as NE hierarchy defined in the MUC, IREX project). Based on our observation, we know that one's question on a specific matter often fits in one of these categories. Having these three classes at the top of the Extended Named Entity Hierarchy, Q&A system and IE system are created taking into account the concepts and words that are generally considered as common knowledge in usual newspaper articles and encyclopedias. Designing the Extended Named Entity Hierarchy We defined the classes based on a criterion that frequently occurring words and noun phrases should be categorized into a class according to its meaning and usage. In practice, the following methods are used to develop the hierarchy. Types of words to be included in the class (test questions) In order to define the Extended NE Hierarchy, it is convenient for us to refer to an example from the Q&A system. Following explanation refers to such applications. Also, since the manual is created for tagging purpose, expressions such as \"Tag x\" rather than \"x is Y class of word\" is used. This section explains judging criterion; what type of word is included in which class. The test questions described here is the basic criteria, however, in reality, it may be ambiguous and some arbitrary decision may be necessary. In order to solve the problem, the Definitions include many specific examples. Names Basically, when we create a test question like \"Tell me the name of x\"\" where \"x\" being the class name of NE hierarchy, a word of a satisfactory answer to the question can be thought as an example of its NE class. If a test question, \"Tell me the type/class of x\" is more suitable than \"Tell me the name of x\" for a word \"x\", then the word should not be included in the class. There are two advantages for this method. First, it is a good method to design our targeting Q&A system and IE system. Secondly, the method allows us to tag Data more objectively and provides unity to the criterion. Specifically, following test questions are created to accommodate each class. In this way, criterion for tagging becomes clear that \"beetle\", for instance, can be tagged as a name of an INSECT, but \"parasite\" cannot. In case of \"beetle\", it is more suitable to ask for its name. However, in case of \"parasite\" it is more suitable to ask for its type rather than name. It is quite reliable to tag on proper nouns when words are name of a person, organization, or location, However, name of a product is not necessary the NE. For example, test questions for food names can be tagged for common nouns such as \"spinach\" or \"pizza\". Of course, there are foods that belong to both categories. For example, depending on its context, \"nihon shu\" (Japanese sake) is more suitable to tag for its name than for its type. In such case, refer to examples listed under the Definitions to decide its class. Moreover, there is only one class name for FOOD. However, as indicated in the Definition, FOOD also includes beverages. Therefore, it is possible to ask, \"Tell me the name of the beverage\" for this class. The words that can be put in place of \"x\" in test questions are called \"focus words\", and these words are listed for every class. Time Expressions For time expressions, whether an expression can be tagged as a class of the Extended Named Entity hierarchy or not depends on providing satisfactory response to the following test questions. By this Definition, the majority of corresponding expressions are eliminated. In other words, expressions such as \"today\", \"two days same day\" cannot determine the exact time of event. However, when the rule is strictly applied, \"May 22nd \" cannot determine what year of \"May 22nd\" it is. Likewise, \"22nd \" alone cannot determine what month of \"22nd\" it is. But unlike the expression \"today\", the \"May 22nd \" is limited to a specific date of a month, and therefore it should be tagged. Numerical Expressions Similarly for numerical expressions, create a test question like \"Tell me its x\" with \"x\" being the name of the NE hierarchy class. If a satisfactory answer is given, then the word is an example of the NE class. This class is defined as numerical expressions, however, if answers to the above questions are satisfying, then numerical values may not necessarily be included in the expressions. In other words, \"top\" or \"champion\" is also included in the rank expressions. Like name expressions, words that can be put in place of \"x\" in test questions are listed as \"focus words\" for every class. Designing Attributes ENE categories have specific attributes and these are very important. In theory, most ENE category names are just labels and the meaning of an entity can only be discerned from its attributes. For example, \"river\" has attributes such as \"Place of Origin,\" \"Confluence,\" and \"Length.\" With the knowledge, a system can answer questions such as \"From where to where does the Amazon run?\" or \"What is the second longest river in the world?\" The author tried to design a set of attributes for ENE's Name categories using a Japanese encyclopedia, and listed a set of attributes which appears in more than 10% of sample entries. There are 107 Name categories with a set of attributes in 154 Name categories. Attributes which appear in 50 % or over of 20 or over samples, or 75 % or over in less than 20 samples are named \"Major Attributes\" in this document. Background colors in a set of attributes are different depending of frequency. | | 20 or over samples | | less than 20 samples | | 50%~ (Major Attributes) | | 75%~ (Major Attributes) | | 25%~50% | | 50%~75% | | ~25% | | ~50% | | Judge | | Examples | | YES | | Barbaro, Bubbles, Max, Maggie, Nessie | | NO | | | | Attributes (20) | | Examples of Attribute Values | | Freq. | | % | | Typical ENEs of AV | | Occupation | | professional baseball player, economist, poet | | 46 | | 100.0 | | Nationality | | American, English, Swiss | | 29 | | 63.0 | | Career | | professor of experimental physics at Johns Hopkins University, Prime Minister of Canada | | 26 | | 56.5 | | Work | | Mona Lisa, Physical Optics, the United Nations Headquarters | | 25 | | 54.3 | | Alma Mater | | Trinity College, Cambridge, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Kyoto Imperial University | | 20 | | 43.5 | | Place of Birth (City) | | Paris, Manchester, Shanghai | | 19 | | 41.3 | | Place of Birth (Province) | | Massachusetts, Quebec, Sichuan | | 18 | | 39.1 | | Previous Stay | | Singapore, New York, Tehran | | 12 | | 26.1 | | Teacher | | Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, Gaston Paris, Bernardo Pasquini | | 10 | | 21.7 | | Person | | Date of Death | | August 11, 1955, 1778, unknown | | 10 | | 21.7 | | Era | | the Edo period, the latter Kamakura period , the 11th century | | 8 | | 17.4 | | Award | | the Nobel Prize the Golden Ball, Gold Gloves | | 8 | | 17.4 | | Real Name | | Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet, Cecil Louis Troughton Smith, Liu Che | | 8 | | 17.4 | | Person | | Another Name | | The Great Bambino , Shizong, Francisco | | 8 | | 17.4 | | Person | | Title | | honorary doctorate by the University of Hamburg, knighted, elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame | | 6 | | 13.0 | | Competition | | 1998 FIFA World Cup, 1927 World Series, the Cardiff Singer of the World competition | | 6 | | 13.0 | | Father | | George Herman Ruth, Sr., Thomas, Masukichi Kato | | 5 | | 10.9 | | Person | | Place of Death | | New York, Birmingham, Passau | | 5 | | 10.9 | | Cause of Death | | cancer, killed in a car crash, executed by decapitation | | 5 | | 10.9 | | Number of Analyzed Data: 46 Major Attributes: \"Occupation\" \"Nationality\" \"Career\" \"Work\" | | Judge | | Examples | | YES | | John Fitzgerald Kennedy, George W.
