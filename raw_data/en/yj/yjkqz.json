Read on to learn more about the health benefits of some of the most commonly used Ayurvedic herbs and spices. But First, What Is Ayurveda? Last week, we told you all about Ayurveda, an ancient Indian holistic healing system that dates back over 5,000 years. As a refresher: Ayurveda comes from two Sanskrit words, \"Ayur,\" which means life, and \"Veda,\" which translates to knowledge or science. So it pretty literally translates to \"knowledge of life\" or \"the science of life.\" The 5,000-year-old [system](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/aa116840spec) of holistic medicine originated in India and is based on the idea that your physical state of health (constitution or Prakriti\u2014prime material energy) determines health. Prakriti is governed by the balance of three principles, or doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. According to [Ayurveda](https://www.nutrisense.io/blog/a-guide-to-ayurveda), health is a state of balance within the individual, and illness results from imbalance. Practitioners design Ayurveda therapies to restore balance and improve overall health. Although Ayurveda has been around for centuries, it's becoming increasingly popular worldwide off late as more people seek alternatives to conventional medicine. Ayurvedic Herbs and Spices Since Ayurveda is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a balance of the three doshas mentioned above\u2014Vata, Pitta, and Kapha\u2014Ayurvedic treatments focus on restoring balance within the body and mind to promote optimal health and overall wellbeing. And one of the key aspects of Ayurveda is using herbs and spices to maintain balance in the body. Ayurvedic practitioners usually advise Ayurvedic products and treatments depending on your doshas. A note of caution here: before trying any herbal medicine, or substituting traditional medicine with herbal remedies, speak with a healthcare professional to find out what works best for your body. Also, consult your doctor before making any changes to your diet or lifestyle.
