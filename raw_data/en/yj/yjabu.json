Different types of proxy access are available depending on the patient's age and circumstances. Children aged 0-12 Parents and legal guardians with proxy access to children ages 0 through 12 will have full access to their child's record. This will automatically transition to limited proxy access when the child turns 13 years old. Teens aged 13-17 Due to laws for patient privacy, parents and legal guardians with proxy access to teen patients aged 13-17 will have limited access to their teen's record. Proxy access will be automatically terminated when the teen turns 18 years old. For teen patients with severe cognitive impairment, please discuss the possibility of full proxy access with your primary care provider at a clinic visit. Adults Adult patients may invite another adult, such as a spouse, to have full proxy access. For adults with limited capacity to manage their own healthcare, proxy access may be granted to another adult who has medical power of attorney for them. This may be done at a clinic visit by the patient's clinician with valid legal documents.

Billing features Where can I access my billing information? You can see and pay all of your UW Medicine bills on MyChart, including balances from before MyChart went live. You access your bills the same way you do your medical information \u2014 using your MyChart login. Simply log in using your username and password or sign up for a new account. You will have access to the billing information for which you are financially responsible without any additional set-up required. You will be able to see all historical information for any of your outstanding accounts, regardless of where you were seen. Please note that certain services (such as laboratory services, Airlift Northwest and Valley Medical Center) will still be accessed through separate portals. Where can I access my old statements and bills? For most UW Medicine statement data, including historical charge details are accessible through your MyChart account. To access your physician billing, Harborview statements for dates of service prior to March 27, 2021, you will need to access the existing Harborview physician portal. Online payment for these balances will be through your MyChart account, or through MyChart's \"pay as guest\" feature. Services at Harborview after March 27, 2021 will be accessible through your MyChart account. Questions about where to find your bill, or need help paying? Contact us at [206.520.0400](tel:2065200400) or toll free at [855.520.0400](tel:8555200400). Who can see UW Medicine billing information? Billing access is controlled separately from clinical details. Access to billing-related details, including statements, ability to pay, and billing letter communications is available only to the person who is financially responsible (known as the guarantor). Proxies will not have access to billing information. If you are responsible for more than just your own bill, you will see all of your accounts as separate tiles on the billing home page within MyChart. For example, if you are a patient, but also have two children at UW Medicine that you are financially responsible for (the guarantor), you will see an entry for your own bill, and two separate entries for each child. MyChart medical advice messages What are medical advice messages in MyChart? Medical advice messages in MyChart are a convenient way to communicate with your care team about non-urgent medical issues, allowing you to stay connected between in-person visits. If your situation requires immediate attention, please contact your medical center or dial 911 if it is an emergency. NEW - What is changing with MyChart medical advice messages? [MyChart Patient Portal](/mychart) is an easy and convenient way to stay in touch with your care team. Over the past few years, MyChart has also become another way to seek medical advice, rather than coming in for an appointment. This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of messages our providers receive. As of June 27, 2023, you will see a notification that you may be billed for medical advice messages. To account for the medical advice and expertise provided through MyChart, UW Medicine will bill for some of these medical advice responses that provide care or consultation that otherwise would have been done through a clinic or telemedicine appointment. These medical advice messages enable you to receive care via MyChart without making an appointment for every care need. This change applies to patients at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center as well. To learn more about medical advice messages in MyChart, including when they are free and when they may result in a charge, please visit our [MyChart Medical Advice Messages FAQ](https://www.uwmedicine.org/patient-resources/billing-and-insurance/mychart-messaging) page.
