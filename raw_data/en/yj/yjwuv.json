Science is about understanding the world, but it's a process rather than a body of knowledge. Scientific knowledge is what we learn from the scientific process, which involves experimenting and collecting data. Scientific research is the collecting of data to investigate and explain a phenomenon. The idea of science is that you can only learn about a phenomenon in a reliable and accurate way through collecting empirical data. The scientific process is designed to reduce human bias as much as possible and make our conclusions as accurate as they can be. Part of the scientific process concerns what you do after data has been collected. Once you've collected the data, it is analyzed, often using statistics and calculations, and then conclusions are made from those results. But, how do we know that those conclusions are accurate? One way is through a process called peer review, which is where research is scrutinized and critiqued by fellow scientists. This process has to be completed before any scientific paper is published, and it weeds out a lot of flawed research. It's a big part of why science has been so successful in explaining the world. Let's take a look at some of the key elements and themes in scientific knowledge. Elements of Scientific Knowledge Systems are sets of interconnected parts forming a complex whole. In science, systems are a way of separating the world into sets of parts to be studied. For example, you may study the oil inside an engine and how it is affected by heat. If your system is the oil itself, you might not concern yourself with any effects on the engine. On the other hand, you may study the variation in temperature across the entire engine, including the oil, meaning that the whole engine and its contents is your system. The way you define your system has an impact on how you conduct your research. Models involve representing a real life phenomena in a way that makes it easier to understand or study. For example, you might create a physical clay model of a landscape, or you might create a 3-D computer model of a skyscraper, or you may come up with a set of equations that describe the motion of clouds in the sky (which is a mathematical model). Constancy and change is the idea that things in nature can change or stay the same. The Earth continues to orbit the sun in a particular pattern, but we humans move across the Earth and our brain patterns change constantly. Aspects of the same thing can change and stay the same, or things can seem constant on one timescale, but be changing on another. For example, it might not seem like the ground itself is changing, but we now know, because of plate tectonics, the ground does move over time - just very slowly. In the context of a day, the ground is a constant, but in the context of 10,000 years, there is significant change. Equilibrium is where a system reaches a final, balanced state. For example, if you put some ice cubes into a cup of hot tea, that system is no longer in equilibrium. Heat is being transferred from the tea into the ice. When the temperatures balance out and the ice has melted, it could be said that the contents of the cup have reached thermal equilibrium: a final, balanced state. Form and function are important concepts in science, but especially in biology. Nature has many forms: our bodies are structured in a certain way, trees are structured in a different way, as are insects like ants. The idea of form and function is that the form of an organism fits the function that it fulfills. Humans have to eat, sleep, breathe, excrete, and reproduce. Our bodies have a form that is designed to achieve this function. This happens through the processes of evolution. Lesson Summary Science is a process for learning about the world, which involves collecting data through scientific research, the collecting of data to investigate and explain a phenomenon, and following processes to reduce bias. The result of the scientific research is scientific knowledge - the things we learned from the scientific process. To confirm that our scientific knowledge is accurate, we have many techniques, including peer review, which is where research is critiqued by fellow scientists before it can be published. Key elements and themes in science include systems, models, constancy and change, equilibrium, and form and function. - Systems are a way of defining the particular thing your research is focused upon and how the parts that make it up are interconnected and affect each other. - Models are ways of representing things in the natural world in a way that makes them more understandable and easy to analyze; it can include physical models, computer models, and mathematical models. - Constancy and change is the idea that things in nature can stay the same or change, and both can be true on different time periods and in different ways. - Equilibrium is when a system reaches a final, balanced state. For example, thermal equilibrium is when a system is all the same temperature. - And, form and function is an important idea in biology that explains how organisms have a particular form, and that form is designed to fulfill the organism's functions.
