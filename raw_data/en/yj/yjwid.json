Like traditional acupuncture, it helps activate muscles, improves blood circulation, and relieves tension. Electroacupuncture delivers therapeutic low-level electric currents to problem area(s), and is especially useful in treating chronic pain. Electroacupuncture, an Viable Treatment for Chronic Pain: When performed correctly, electroacupuncture is a safe, highly-effective practice that should not cause pain. During treatments, patients may notice slight vibrations or a soft, gentle humming emitting from the electroacupuncture machine. Electroacupuncture needles are designed to stimulate the strength and effectiveness of a human acupuncturist's touch while being able to target problem areas with more precision. Though they can achieve similar desired results, most electroacupuncture treatments typically require a shorter session than traditional acupuncture.
