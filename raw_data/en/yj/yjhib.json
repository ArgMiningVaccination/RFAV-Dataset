Thank You! [NadjaLind.com](https://NadjaLind.com) Every single 'Turning In' Ambient Drone wave is designed to gently guide you into states of deep relaxation, emotional release, freedom, focus and inner peace, achieved through underlying binaural entrainment frequencies - frequencies designed to physically stimulate and soothe the human brain. This only works on headphones. Some tracks are combined with an EMDR-like aural impulse to actively stimulate both hemispheres which is being used to help with the symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This helps your body to naturally release its own destressing hormones, allowing you to breathe deeper, help your physical and spiritual body to rebalance and to recover quickly from the rigours of everyday life. How to use the binaural tracks most effectively: 1. use (noise-cancelling) headphones to get the entrainment effect. The binaural frequencies are produced by your brain through aural stimulation of hemispheres. 2. check the volume towards the middle of the track. In doubt decrease the volume a tiny bit. Note that after some minutes the perception of sound might get more intense since usually our brains adapt to the environmental noise pollution. 3. try out to lie down and cover yourself with a blanket. Note that after lying still for some minutes your heart-rate and body temperature lowers. 4. make time for yourself to ensure you can complete the whole listening cycle. - enable e.g. flight mode on your phone - make sure nobody will knock on your door before you completed the restorative phase - if applicable use noise cancelling headphones to protect yourself from outside noises 5. put on a blindfold or darken the room. This will enhance your listening experience. 6. enjoy and relax the listening- and trance experience. 7. usually you will gently 'wake up' towards the end since the tracks are especially organised like this. I am very grateful for your feedback and for spreading the word so other can find these tracks as well. You are making the difference. Thank you very much. Nadja Lind.

Stephanie K.: I'm in jungle fever again I'm getting hooked on jungle meditation. Highly addictive. I listened to the jungle experience when I felt really sad and depressed and afterwards I felt relieved and happy again and even caught myself laughing aloud. it calms me down and makes me happy! Christian K. Just listened to your jungle experience meditation this morning. An extremely soft and nice sound carpet. In the first third I even had the feeling i was floating.
