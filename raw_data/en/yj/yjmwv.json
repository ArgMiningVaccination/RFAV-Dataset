The IgG, IgG4, and IgA antibody assessment panels can serve as useful tools in the identification of trigger foods in individuals. US Biotek offers a comprehensive 208 food panel, as well as 144- and 96-food panels to assess IgG, IgG4, and IgA antibody response to common foods. The 96-food panels are offered in five variations, including a General panel and specialized panels to identify allergens found in typical Asian, Japanese, Mexican, or Vegetarian diets.
