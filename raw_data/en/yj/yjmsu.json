Acupuncture is a centuries-old form of medicine used to treat a variety of ailments by inserting needles into the body. Acupuncture is safe and effective. While the majority of research regarding acupuncture has been centered on its efficacy in treating musculoskeletal pain, increasingly, acupuncture is being used to treat much more. What can be treated with Acupuncture? - Muscle and joint pains: back pain, hip pain, knee pain, etc. - Gastrointestinal symptoms: Gas, bloating, constipation, GERD - Sleep problems : difficulty falling and/or staying asleep, poor sleep quality or quantity - Stress and anxiety - Reproductive Health and Fertility: hormonal imbalance, menstrual cycle irregularities, and before or during fertility treatments like IUI and IVF Does Acupuncture hurt? For the most part, no. When needles are inserted into the skin there is a brief pinch that goes away quickly. There are techniques that Dr. McCarter uses to minimize and alleviate any discomfort. ' Tell me more about the needles used. The needles used during an acupuncture treatment are single-use, sterile, and small. They are slightly thicker than a strand of hair. They are thinner than the needles used when your blood is drawn or when you get a shot. Does Acupuncture interfere with treatments that I receive from other providers? No. Acupuncture \"plays well\" with therapies such as chiropractic or osteopathic adjustments, massage, and physical therapy. Receiving acupuncture treatments in conjunction with these therapies is beneficial and can have additive effects. Acupuncture treatments restore balance to the body's many systems, which improves the efficacy of other therapies. How do I prepare for my appointment? There is not much that you need to do, however, based on experience, Dr. McCarter has a few recommendations: - Have something to eat 1-2 hours before your treatment - Wear loose fitting clothing or clothes that are easy to remove - Because acupuncture can be quite relaxing, we recommend scheduling your appointment at a time when you will be able to take it easy afterwards. How long is the treatment? Your first appointment will be approximately 75 minutes. This will give Dr. McCarter enough time to obtain a thorough medical history, complete any necessary physical exam, and administer the first acupuncture treatment. Follow up appointments are approximately 60 minutes. "}
