Rapid Response T eam \u2014 in case of emergency Sometimes it is a family member that first notices a change in a patient's condition. If you notice one or more of the following changes in a patient's condition, please dial 817.922.2900 from the bedside phone to page our Rapid Response T eam: Increase or decrease in the heart or breathing rate Decrease in blood pressure Chest pain Decrease in urine output Confusion or other changes in thinking/mental status When something just does not seem or look right with your loved one Patients also are asked to call, or request that the Rapid Response T eam be called, if they notice one or more of these changes. The Rapid Response T eam card can be found on each patient care floor. Infection prevention \u2014 do the W.A.V .E. The most important thing that you and your family can do to help stop the spread of infection is the W.A.V.E. Wash Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer before meals, after going to the bathroom, and after touching any equipment. Please observe your care team. If they are not following appropriate hand hygiene measures, remind them to wash their hands. Ask questions Do not be afraid to ask caregivers if they cleaned their hands, or about any other infection prevention measures we follow. Speak up if anything concerns you or if you do not understand something. Vaccinate Get your flu and pneumonia shots unless your physician directs you otherwise. Ensure safety Do not touch medical equipment unless necessary. Work with your care team to make sure catheters and other medical devices are clean and removed when they are no longer needed, and please ask friends and family members who are sick not to visit you in the hospital.(continued from page 3) Wash hands to protect against germsAsk questions to improve quality of careVaccinate against flu and pneumoniaEnsure safety by making sure medical devices are clean and used properly ? Courtesy: U.S. Department of Health and Human ServicesBA YLOR SCOTT & WHITE ALL SAINTS MEDICAL CENTER - FORT WORTH | BSWHEAL TH.COM/FORTWORTH5Preventing falls We do not want you to fall during your stay in the hospital, so please follow the simple steps outlined below. You may be at risk of falling down when walking or getting out of bed due to certain factors. If so, you may have fall precautions put in place. If you are at risk for falls, here are some things you and your family can do to help prevent falls: Call for assistance when getting out of bed. NEVER get up by yourself. Make sure at least two side rails on your bed are in place. You may even request four side rails. Your family members should tell staff when they are leaving. Please help us keep you safe by using your nurse call button for assistance. Never turn off your bed alarm. It is on for your protection. Pain Keeping pain under control is important to your well-being and the recovery process. Your care team will ask you about your pain often. Please pay attention to your level of pain and use the 0-10 scale below to report it so your care team can take action to manage your pain as quickly as possible. Please note that even strong pain medications, when given with proper supervision, are safe, effective and rarely addictive. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 No PainMild PainModerate PainSevere PainVery SevereWorst Possible It is important to keep your pain out of the moderate to severe range (4 and above), so please do not wait until your pain gets worse to tell one of your care team members. If your pain is not relieved by your medicine, or if you are having any side effects, please tell your physician or nurse. If you are unable to communicate, we use a different pain intensity scale. Non-verbal pain intensity scale Your family member or friend may be asked to decide your pain level since they know you. 0 2 4 6 8 10 NO PAIN MILD PAIN DISCOMFORT DISTRESSED SEVERE EXCRUCIA TING Relaxed, Calm ExpressionStressed, T ense ExpressionGuarded Movement, Out BehaviorsPA TIENT & FAMIL Y SUPPORT GUIDE6 Patient safety warning Family or visitors, contact the nurse fast if you see that the patient: Cannot wake up Is too drowsy/sleepy Falls asleep while talking Has slurred speech Has slow breathing Has new snoring Is confused Has any change that worries you This patient may be receiving patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or other sedating medications. The PCA pump gives a dose of pain medication when the patient feels pain and pushes the pain pump button. 1. DO NOT push the pain pump button for the patient, as it may cause the patient to be too sleepy and cause breathing problems. 2. DO NOT give the patient any medications. 3. DO NOT take any of your personal medications while you are staying at the hospital. Disclose any of the medication you are currently taking to your physician. 4. Check with the nurse if you have concerns. We have a team that can check rapidly on the patient if needed. Dial 817.922.2900 from any phone in the hospital for the Rapid Response T eam (RRT). Ethical disagreements On rare occasions, there may be ethical disagreements between you, your family and/or healthcare providers. We believe good communication can prevent most ethical disagreements. It is also worth remembering the following: We will make every reasonable attempt to honor your treatment preferences within the mission, philosophy and capabilities of Baylor Scott & White Health hospitals and the accepted standards of medical practice. This includes those expressed by an advance directive or by others on your behalf if you lack an advance directive and are unable to make decisions. We respect your right to reject treatments offered. We do not recognize an unlimited right to receive treatments that are medically inappropriate. T exas law, specifically Chapter 166 of the T exas Health & Safety Code, provides a process for resolving ethical disagreements between you, your family and/or healthcare providers in those rare cases where further communication does not resolve the disagreement. This process relies on ethics consultants and ethics committees available at each hospital to help as needed. Smoking cessation Smoking cigarettes tops the list as the most important preventable major risk factor of the #1 killer of Americans\u2014heart and blood vessel disease. The long list of deaths due to smoking is frightening, and smoking also harms thousands of non-smokers, including infants and children. It is never too late to quit smoking and experience the many health benefits of quitting: Sense of smell and taste returnSmoker's cough improvesDigestive system returns to normalIncreased energy and life expectancy, and easier to breathe and do physical activitiesLess chance of heart disease and cancerBA YLOR SCOTT & WHITE ALL SAINTS MEDICAL CENTER - FORT WORTH | BSWHEAL TH.COM/FORTWORTH7The four steps to stopping smoking Step One List your reasons to quit and read them several times a day. Wrap your cigarette pack with paper and rubber bands. Each time you smoke, write down the time of day, how you feel and how important that cigarette is to you on a scale of 1 to 5. Rewrap the pack. Step Two Keep reading your list of reasons and add to it. Do not carry matches and keep your cigarettes out of easy reach. Each day, try to smoke fewer cigarettes and try not to smoke the ones that are not most important. Step Three Set a target date to quit. Do not buy a new pack until you finish the one you are smoking. Try to stop smoking for 48 hours. Step Four Quit smoking completely and get rid of your cigarettes, lighters and ashtrays. Stay busy by exercising, going to the movies or doing something else you enjoy. Avoid situations and triggers that you identify with smoking. Find healthy substitutes for smoking, like gum, mints, carrots or celery. T ake up a hobby that keeps your hands occupied. Practice deep breathing when you get an urge. You can learn more about quitting by asking your doctor, nurse or other member of your care team. Or call the American Heart Association at 1.800.AHA.USA1 (1.800.242.8721). Patient rights and responsibilities As a patient, you have certain rights and responsibilities. As a hospital, it is our responsibility under federal law and hospital accreditation standards to make sure you are informed about those rights and responsibilities. Patient rights For example, you have the right to: Information about your condition, treatment options and test results Information about outcomes that may be different from what you and your family expected Treatment for pain and suffering Information about hospital ethics policies Participate in the development and implementation of your plan of care Refuse or accept treatment or research that is offered to you. This includes the right to refuse treatments that can potentially help prolong your life, such as mechanical breathing machines, dialysis, artificial nutrition/ hydration or attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) Request a discharge planning evaluation Complete advance directives, such as a living will or medical power of attorney. These forms can be obtained from your chaplain Privacy, confidentiality, security and culturally respectful communication Have a language interpreter to assist you with conversations about your health throughout your visit free of charge Have access to items and/or devices to assist you with conversations about your health throughout your visit free of charge(continued from page 6)PA TIENT & FAMIL Y SUPPORT GUIDE8 Decide who may visit you during your hospital stay Choose a primary support person to stay with you during your hospital stay Be informed if family or guest visitation must be restricted Freedom from abuse, neglect, exploitation or harassment Care that is free from discrimination Delegate your right to make medical decisions on your behalf Patient responsibilities With your rights come certain responsibilities. Your responsibilities, among others, include: The responsibility to give your healthcare team honest and accurate information about your medical history The responsibility to follow treatment directions and cooperate with your healthcare team The responsibility to treat other patients, visitors, your healthcare team and hospital property with respect Goals and types of treatment The most basic goal of medicine is to fix or cure your health problem. If a complete cure is not possible, the goal of the healthcare team is to try to slow down the problem or make it go away for a while (remission). Perhaps the most important goal is to provide you with comfort and relief of suffering at all times. You will receive medically appropriate treatment to meet these goals, and we hope that you will do well. Communicating with your healthcare team Good communication is essential to every part of medical treatment. It is important when things are going well. It may be even more important when things are not going well and the outcome you and your family expected is not being achieved. Either way, it is vital that you, your family and your healthcare team communicate clearly. You should feel free to discuss any topic associated with your care and treatment with members of your healthcare team. For example, you may want to discuss: Your diagnosis Goals of your treatment The types of treatment appropriate to meet those goals The benefits, burdens and risks of treatment as well as the probability of success It is important that you discuss your goals and the types of treatment with your physicians, nurses and your family while you are able to speak for yourself. How do you want to be treated if you have an accident or an illness and become so sick you cannot speak for yourself? Who should speak for you and what should they say? Planning for your discharge You, your family and caregivers play a crucial role in our discharge planning team. We start planning your discharge on the first day of your hospital stay to help you plan and prepare so that you are comfortable in managing your health when you leave. Use this checklist as a guide for yourself, your family members and caregivers. Discussion topics for your discharge planning process: Have you signed up for the MyBSWHealth app? Where will you be going and who will be assisting you after discharge? Do you understand or have any questions about the discharge instructions, including dietary restrictions or physical activity recommendations? Do you have any questions regarding how to take your prescribed medication and understand any potential side effects? Have you scheduled any follow-up doctor's appointments or testing?(continued from page 7)BA YLOR SCOTT & WHITE ALL SAINTS MEDICAL CENTER - FORT WORTH | BSWHEAL TH.COM/FORTWORTH9Some reminders to ensure a smooth discharge process: Be prepared for discharge early! Make sure all your personal items are packed and ready to go early. Ask a family member or friend to take home unneeded items the night before your discharge. Please plan to pick up your prescriptions before your next dose. Discuss with your care team to determine if you need any additional services or resources after you leave the hospital, like home health, rehabilitation or medical equipment. Pick someone who can help you with your discharge plan so your transition home can be successful. Make sure to include any plans for job or family responsibility transitions. Be sure to review your discharge instructions with your nurse to ensure you understand all dietary restrictions, recommended activity recommendations, or potential symptoms to expect or watch for after discharge. Pastoral care and counseling services We welcome people of all faiths and offer full-time chaplain services with access to religious leaders from a variety of faiths. We believe that total patient care demands attention to the spiritual, as well as the physical and emotional, needs of each patient. Chaplains from the Pastoral Care and Counseling Department provide assistance and support with emotional and spiritual issues, medical crisis, family communication, religious rituals and resources, ethics consultations, celebrations, deaths, and more. Our chaplains are available to assist you 24 hours a day, whatever your religious persuasion. T o speak to a chaplain, please contact your nurse or call 817.927.6150. Visitors are welcome to visit the chapels for prayer and quiet reflection. Brighten the day of a patient with an eGreeting \u2014 a personal message hand-delivered to your loved one by a member of our pastoral care team. eGreetings can be sent through BSWHealth.com/FortWorth. Thanks to the donations of generous providers, the Pastoral Care and Counseling Department also provides some religious resources, such as Bibles , New Testaments , Guidepost Magazine and more. Please let us know if you would like to receive any of these. The importance of advance care planning The process of thinking about who should speak for you if you can no longer speak for yourself and consid- ering the goals and intensity of your treatment is called advance care planning. This is easy if you are only temporarily unable to speak for yourself and recovery is expected. But what if you become so sick that you can no longer communicate and a cure is no longer possible? What if you are in constant pain and/or must depend on machines to keep you alive? If you make these decisions in advance, you will be relieving your family and loved ones from making these decisions for you. There are several types of advance care plans that are legally binding in the state of T exas, including Living Will (Directive to Physicians and Family or Surrogates), Medical Power of Attorney, Notice of Declaration and Declaration for Mental Health, and Out-of-Hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate Order. For more information on these advance directives, please ask your nurse to contact the chaplain's office for additional resources or go to BSWHealth.com/Patient T ools. You may also wish to consult your personal or family lawyer if you have questions about advance care planning. Advance care plans have been shown to improve patient care and reduce family stress in the setting of serious illness. Whether or not you choose to complete an advance directive, your care, treatment and services will not be affected, nor will your decision result in any discrimination against you. In addition, you may cancel or change any advance directive at any time.(continued from page 8)PA TIENT & FAMIL Y SUPPORT GUIDE10 If I complete an advance directive, can I change my mind? Yes, you may cancel any advance directive simply by destroying the document, signing and dating a written statement that states your desire to cancel the directive, or telling your doctor or nurse. You may also review and revise your advance directive. If you choose to change an advance directive, you must execute a new one. Frequently asked questions Why can't I take my own medications while I'm in the hospital? While you are a patient at our hospital, it is our job to keep you safe. An orderly and consistent method to giving medication is an important part of our safety guidelines. If we are able to order, store and give all of your medications, we are able to better manage that process. Is it ever OK to use my own supply of medication? Yes, there are times when you may be asked to bring in and use your own supply. This may happen if your medication is not stocked by the pharmacy and the pharmacy cannot get the medication in a timely manner. Your doctor will consult the pharmacy before making that choice. If my medication is approved for hospital use, why can't I bring my pills in my daily pill container? Hospital policy requires that approved home medications be in their original bottle in order to properly label the medication and to make sure they are just what your doctor has prescribed. If my medication is approved for hospital use, why can't I keep it in my room and take it on my own? It is important to keep a careful record in your chart of all medications taken. This step may be missed if the nurse is not the one who gives you your medication and could possibly lead to an overdose. Your medication will be kept in a secure place available only by the nursing staff. Why does the medication have to be in date? Is it dangerous otherwise? Although most medications simply no longer work after they have expired, others can become toxic. Even if the medication does not become toxic, taking medications that no longer work can cause some harm. Why are herbal/homeopathic remedies, alternative medicines and dietary supplements restricted? After all, these are \"natural\" products? Substances that are not approved by the FDA may not be predictable and can interact with prescribed medications. Many of these interactions are not well known or even suspected. In addition, alternative medicines may contain other chemicals that could cause toxic effects. \"Natural\" does not necessarily mean \"safe.\" Why are my own controlled substances not approved for hospital use? Federal and state laws require careful use of controlled substances. Drugs that are not given by the hospital pharmacy are not as secure and have a higher risk of being lost. T o protect your property, we do not allow personal supplies of controlled substances. Additional things you need to know: 1. Fake medications have become increasingly available in the world today. Therefore, we feel it is our duty to provide medications that we know to have been ordered through a secure supply chain. 2. Our computer system checks for allergies and drug interactions. If you use your own medications, you will not benefit from important safety checks built into the system.(continued from page 9)BA YLOR SCOTT & WHITE ALL SAINTS MEDICAL CENTER - FORT WORTH | BSWHEAL TH.COM/FORTWORTH11One final comment: We take patient safety very seriously, and we want your hospital stay to be as safe as possible. Where else can I get help? We have specially trained social workers, patient advocates, nurses and chaplains who can help you with advance care planning concerns. You may also have ethical concerns as you consider potentially serious issues. Our hospital has access to ethics committees and ethics consultants who may offer counsel and assist in resolving ethical issues. These services are provided free of charge. You, your family, or healthcare decision maker, your physician or any member of your healthcare team may request guidance from our hospital ethics committee. For further information, members of your healthcare team can help you reach the ethics committee at your care location. You may also wish to consult your personal or family lawyer if you have questions about advance care planning.(continued from page 10) Complaints and grievance process information We strive to provide you with quality care and welcome your feedback at all times, both positive and negative. If you have any concerns, we hope you will: First report your complaint to the clinical manager for the unit involved. The bedside nurse will help you identify the clinical manager. You may also dial 0 and ask for Patient Relations. We will make every effort to address and resolve your complaint in a timely manner during your stay. In the event we are unable to resolve your complaint while you are still here, it will be referred to the grievance committee for review and resolution. Although we encourage you to bring your concerns directly to us, you always have the right to take any complaint to the T exas Department of State Health Services and/or The Joint Commission by email, fax, letter or phone at the contact numbers and addresses listed below.
