Most vaccines utilized in the elderly contain antigens, with which the target population had previous contact. Therefore, most studies investigating vaccine-induced immune responses in the elderly do not analyze responses to neo-antigen but rather booster responses. It can be hypothesized that age-related differences in the immune response are distinct for primary and recall responses. We therefore aimed to investigate primary and recall responses using the same antigen in young and older adults and chose Hepatitis B vaccine as a model antigen. Young (20-40 years) and elderly (>60 years) healthy volunteers received either a primary series (no prior vaccination) or a single booster shot (documented primary vaccination more than 10 years ago) of the registered vaccine Twinrix. Expression of immunity-related genes was measured before and 1 day after vaccination and antibody titers were determined at several time points with a long-term follow-up 6 months after the last vaccination. Antibody responses were lower and seemed to be delayed in the elderly compared to young adults. Non-responders after the 3-dose primary series were more frequent in the elderly group. Antibody titers after booster vaccination increased in all participants. Associations between early expression-profiles on day 1 and antibody responses were found. "}
