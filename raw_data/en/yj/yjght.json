Many clients have come to me having had health issues after having Covid or after having the vaccines. Post Covid and post vaccine problems have included: - Lingering coughs and breathlessness - Tiredness and fatigue - Hair Loss - Bladder/Kidney issues - Headaches - Hormone Changes - Sinus problems - Autoimmune issues - Circulation problems - Behaviour problems in children suddenly appearing from nowhere - Weight gain - Skin rashes How do I help? I rebalance the client's body using kinesiology. The body through the muscle testing tells me what is out of balance and what is needed to get the body back into balance and healthy again. I look at the body as a whole balancing Mentally ,Chemically ,Physically and Eergetically. MCPE. Which Supplements help? The best way to know what is right for you is to have your own kinesiology session as everyone is different. The main supplements which I have found to help post Covid and post vaccines are one or a combination of the following: PLEASE NOTE IF YOU ARE ON MEDICATION CHECK WITH YOUR PHARMACIST OR DOCTOR BEFORE TAKING ANY OF THESE SUPPLEMENTS High doses of Vitamin C at least 3000mg a day - boosts immune system Vitamin D3 often needed with K2 as well - boosts immune system Zinc - boosts immune system Turmeric - reduces inflammation Quercetin - reduces inflammation NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) OR Glutothionine - Strong antioxidant that helps support liver to detox Milk Thistle - supports liver Resveratrol - antioxidant Solution to the problem It is important to identify exactly which of the above supplements is right for you and you will not need them all. I have found that Covid and the vaccines seems to target whatever problem the client may already have with their health making it a more severe issue, therefore support for this is also needed which is unique to the individual. Regular kinesiology sessions and providing the body with the right supplements to heal is key. Eating a clean diet and having a healthy lifestyle, along with rest to give the body time to repair and recover. There are also homeopathic remedies I test to help those who have had an adverse reaction to the vaccines. From my experience menopausal women seem to struggle more than other after the vaccine with weight gain and tiredness. If a client is struggling to detox after having Covid or the vaccines a course of 6 or 12 Body Ballancer sessions is a great way to complement the above to get the lymphatic system back working effectively once more.
