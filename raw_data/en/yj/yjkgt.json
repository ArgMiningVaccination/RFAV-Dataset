Assistance measures whi ch are not part of a comprehensive package of responses will not break the trafficking cycle effect ively. The sustai nable reintegration of a person w ho has been trafficked requires a holistic approach to meeti ng their wide range of needs. For related examples c oncerning child victims, see Tool 7.10. 382 together in coordinated and participative ways, in the best interests of the victims they are assisting. Wherever possible, victims should be able to access a \"one-stop shop\". This is particularly important for child victims. Strong partnershi ps between Governments and non- governmental organizations and among n on-governmental organi zations provide the most effective means of offering coordinated services . The following are examples of promising practice in offering services in a holistic manner to address various needs of individuals. Promising practice Caritas Migrants and Re fugees Cen tre, Beirut Two projects are currently bein g implemented by Caritas in Lebanon at its Migrants and Refugees Centre, aimed at preventing traffi cking in persons. The first project is for the protection of the human rights of migrant workers i n Lebanon. It includes social counselling, legal aid, public awareness-raising and promotion of behavioural change, and orientation sessions to he lp migrant workers to protect themselves from abuse and offer each other mutual support. The second project is a imed at creatin g a more favourable environment that will reduce the incidence of abuse an d exploitation and may generally reduce situations of trafficki ng. The project is greatly reinforcing capacities for protecti ng and assisting women so they can escape abusive and exploit ative situations a nd find dignified and durable solutions. These projects allow migrants to prote ct themselves from abuse, exploitation and detention by helping them t o understand and use the legal process and rely on social networks. Migrant workers benefit fr om orientation seminars that expl ain their rights and responsibi lities in Lebanon and offer them the opportunity to practise skills that will help them avoid abuse, exploitation and detention. Throu gh these orientation seminars an d other communication channels, migrants are informed of legal and soci al services available to them in Lebanon in cases where they believe that their rights are being violated. Prevention is exercised through n egotiation with concerned embas sies, security agencies and recruiting agents to gain access to newly arrived migrant workers for ori entation sessions. These seminars are also being pu blicized at gathering points for migrants and by word of mouth. Internatio nal Organization for Mi gration, Skopje IOM has supported the authorities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to equip a Government-run u rgent reception and transit shelter for trafficked women and stranded immigrants in distress. Prior to the establishment of this shelter, victims were held in police stations prior to deportation. The facility is kept under police protection and IOM Skopje provides victims with direct medical assistan ce and psychological counselling before they return to their State of origin. Little Rose Shelter, Ho Chi Mi nh City , Viet Nam The Little Rose Shel ter seeks to contribute to the development of an effective and s ustain - able model for the rehabilitation and reintegration of trafficked girls who have returned to Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons 383 Viet Nam from Cambodia. The shelter provides the girls with vocation al training to enable them to find a job after a four-month rehabi litation period. If the g irls need a longer rehabilitation period, this can be provided. Besides vocational training, the girls in the shelter are provided with courses about life skills, child rights training, literacy classes, health-care services an d counselling. Each group of returned victims from Cambodia consists of 15 girls. They have several opportunities to exchange information about their experiences, which is a good method to help them deal with their trauma. All girls w ho complete the four-month residency at the shelter receive a reintegration grant. The Wome n's Union, the main counterpart of IOM in this project, coordinates the reintegration of the children into their communities in cooperation with a local committee for popu lation, family and children. Rescue and Resto re Victims of Hu man Traffickin g campaig n, Unite d States In the United States, u nder the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, the United States Department of Health and Human Services is designated as the agency responsibl e for helping victims of human trafficking to become eligible to receive benefits and s ervices so they may rebuild their lives safely in the United States. As part of this effort, the Department has initiated the Rescue and Restore Victims of Human Trafficking campaign to help identify and assist victims of human trafficking in the United States. The intent of the campaign is to increase the number of identifie d trafficking victims and to help those victims receive the benefits and services needed to live safely in the United States. The first phase of the campai gn focuses on outreach to those indivi duals who are most likely to encounter victims on a daily basis, but may not recognize them as victi ms of human trafficking. By initially educating he alth-care providers, soc ial service organiza - tions and the law enforcement community about the issue of human trafficking, it is hoped to encourage such intermediaries to look ben eath the surface by recognizing clues and asking the right questions, because they may be the only outsiders with the chance to reach out and help victims. chapter 8 Victim assistance Source: United States D epartment of Heal th and Human Services, at: www.acf.hhs. gov/trafficking/rescue_r estore/index.html i group Servizio Migranti Caritas, financed by the Departmen t of Equal Opportunities o f Italy, operates a rehabil itation programme that s pecializes in assisting victims to become independent through work. Victims are given Italian lessons and other assistance to enable them to o btain legal employment. The vocational trai ning given includes training for work in the hospitality indu stry, local manufacturing and the mechanical engi - neering industry, domestic service and car e for the elderly. Victims are sheltered temporar ily before being given lodging in inde Apprentic eship \" Support for victims/witnesses of trafficki ng in human beings in the Philippines\" was aimed at strengthening and expan ding the capacity of selected rehabi lita - tion centres throughout the Philippines to restore the physi cal and mental wel l-being of trafficked victims. In addi tion, the project supported vocational skills training internships for victims and their fa milies. The private sector in the Philippines also joined this initiative, through a corporate apprent iceship programme in which victi ms of trafficking are placed in various companie s to learn skills (such as canning and making cookies). The project supported apprentices with food and transportation al lowances. Acting for Women in Distressin g Situations , Cambodia Acting for Women in Distressing Sit uations (AFESIP) is a non-governmental organization that cares for victims of trafficking and sexual slavery in Cambodia, with the long-term goal of successfully reintegrating them as financial ly independent members of their communities. As part of its reintegration efforts, AFESIP provides general educati on and vocational train - ing to residents of various shelters. Basic ed ucation entails Khmer literacy, basic mathemat - ics and personal hygiene and health. Voc ational training in hairdressi ng is offered to resi - dents of shelters in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, who are also given basic traini ng in business. Agricultural training is given to some younger shelter residents. Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons More information about AFESIP ca n be found at: www.afes ip.org i Internat ional O rganization for Migration, The IOM office in Kyiv open ed a rehabilitati on centre and a s helter to provide protection and support to retu rned victims of traffickin g. Working with the Ukrainian health authori - ties, IOM provides social and psychologic al counselling, psychiatric care , gynaecological and medical examinations an d treatment for the victims in a sensitive and confidential manner. IOM works with a network of some 15 Ukrainian non-governmental organi zations to pro - vide assistance to victims, and with the authorities to facilitate their reintegration. After vic - tims leave the IOM shelter, regular c ontact is maintained to monitor their reintegration and to determine whethe r they or their families have been threatened or harassed. Internat ional O rganization for M igration, Russian Federation As part of a project funded by the European Union with co-financing support from the Governments of Switze rland and the United States, IOM is implementing an anti-traffick - ing project in the Russian Federation, with the aim of (i) providing policy advice to the Government on h ow it can improve its legislative res ponse to trafficking; (i i) preventing traf- ficking by strengthening the capaci ty of law enforcement agencies to combat it and by rai s- ing awareness of the pro blem; and (iii) building the capacity of nat ional authorities and local non-governmental organization networks to pro tect and reintegrate victims of trafficking. The project activities with respect to assisting victims are:385 /L50539Establishing a mechanism for t he referral of victims of trafficki ng to an appropriate agency/organization for assistance in the pilot regions, on the basis of inter-agency oper - ational networks invol ving governmen tal authorities, non-governmental organizations and international organization s /L50539Assistance to victims of trafficking at the Rehabilitation Centre for Victi ms of Trafficking in Moscow /L50539Organization of specialized training and seminars for R ehabilitation Centre personnel (on medical assistance and psychological support for victims) /L50539Enhancing the non-government al organization networks and capacity-bui lding and train - ing activities to enhance the non-governmen tal organizations ' ability to provide effective rehabilitation and reintegration services to victims. chapter 8 Victim assistance More information about this projec t can be found at: http://no2slavery.ru/eng/proj ect/ i Baan Kr edtrakar shelter in Bangkok, Baan Kredtra karn provides protection and assistance to women and children. The shelter can accommodate around 500 girls and women, and a significant number of its population are vi ctims of trafficking. T he shelter offers counselling, prepares residents for testifying in court and provides vocational training with the intention of reintegrating victims back into society. Baan Kre dtrakarn provides services to traffi cking victims while they are staying at the shelter and also assists in the repatriation, reintegra - tion and follow-up of non-Thai nationals. Social workers or caregivers affili ated with the centre accompany vi ctims to their country of origin to ensure their safe return , and co - operate with local governmental and non-govern mental agencies for the con tinued provision of assistance to them. Rescue hom e on the Indo-Nepales e border an d support to victims of trafficking, India Manav Seva Sansth an works to intercept and rescue victims of trafficking along the Indo- Nepalese border of Uttar P radesh. It has establi shed vigilance centres on the border in order to facilitate informed and safe mobility and the rescue of victims. The aim of the project is to: /L50539Counsel victims of trafficking and those i ntercepted during trafficking /L50539Provide a safe and comfortable environment for the victi ms to stay in during the pro cess of reintegration/repatriation /L50539Provide legal and med ical assistance for victims of traffi cking /L50539Enhance self-confidence among victims and bring them back into the mainstream of development386 With support from a glo bal UNODC project entitled \" Building non-governmental s upport structures for victims of violent crime, in cluding victims of traffickin g in persons\", Manav Seva a home at ad jacent to the border- crossing point of Sanauli\u2014the first such home on the Indo-Nepalese border.

In order to prevent the transmission of HIV in the context of trafficking for sexual exploitation, we must proceed on the assump - tion that people tr afficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation are exposed to the ri sk of HIV infection. The key points which lead to this conclusion are that: /L50539Populations involved in risky sexual behaviour are more likely to becom e infected with HIV /L50539People vulnerable to human traffi cking are also at elevated risk of HIV /L50539The purposes of trafficking vary, but all trafficked persons are vulnerable to HIV for similar reasons, which c an include: Unsafe sex with multiple partners Injecting drug use (vol untary or forced) Self-harm, body piercing and /or tattooing For more information ab out this and other UNODC-ass isted victim support projects, visit: www.unodc.org/india/trafficking_human_beings.ht mli Tool 8.11 HIV/AIDS Overview This tool provi des an ov erview of the issue of HIV/AI DS and flags the risk it poses to potential and ac tual victims of trafficking.

In particular, the legal statu s of trafficked persons i n a destination county, usu ally as unlawful or undocumented arrivals, may have adverse consequences for their access to health and social services, finan cial support and legal assistance. The legal system as it is applied to persons vulnerable to human trafficking can play an important role in minimizing these risks and preventing furt her harm, but only where the risks are recognized and properly More information about the UNODC r esponse to HIV/AIDS c an be found at: www.unodc.org/ unodc/en/hiv-aids/index.htmli Tool 8.13 HIV guidelines for law e nforcers, prosecutors and judges Overview This tool provides HIV/AIDS g uidance to law enforcers, pro secutors and judges with respect to people vu lnerable to trafficking in persons. For more information on related issues, see Too l 5.15 and Tools 8.12 to 8.15. 393 managed. For these reasons, it is imperati ve that law enforcement officials, prosecutors and judicial officers are aware of and are able to res pond appropriately to these risk s, while at the same time c arrying out their responsibilities within the justice system. chapter 8 Victim assistance Interviews of victims of trafficking, including thos e conducted by law enforcer s, judges and prosecutors should be guided by the WHO Ethical and Safety Recommendat ions for Int ethical and safe interviewing conduct.iAs soon as the safety of the victim has been sec ured, his or her psy cho - logical and physical health\u2014including HIV/AIDS prevent ion and care\u2014 should take precedence over investigative objectives. ! Law enforcement As soon as the safety of persons vulnerabl e to human trafficking has been secured, atten - tion to their psychosocial and physical health shoul d take precedence. This includes assess- ing needs related to HIV status. They should be offere d\u2014with counselling as required in individual cases\u2014the following: /L50539Rapid voluntary HIV testing /L50539Other sexually transmitted infect ion testing /L50539Post-exposure prophylaxis where indicated Women and female children should additionally be offered pregn ancy testing and/or prena - tal care, where app ropriate in individual cases. It should also be ascertained whether the person is currently lactating and, if s o, breastfeeding. Where infection is indicated: /L50539Appropriate sexually transmitted infecti on and/or HIV management pl ans should be developed cooperatively with the person or persons concerned. For child ren, this may be through their parent or guardian i f they are accompanied, or through appropriately authorized child welfare officials otherwise. Management plans should include access to anti-retroviral medication, where indi- cated, and for pregnant or bre astfeeding women, preventi on of mother-to-child trans- mission measures. HIV prevention education should be offere d.394 Where reflection periods are available, appropriate prevention an d protection means should be provided for the immedi ate duration and beyond. Repeat testing should also be offered at regular interval s to detect possible infection during reflection periods (e.g. through further self-harm, inj ecting drug use, unprotected sexual activity). /L50539Where it is determined t hat a mother is HIV-positive, every effort sho uld be made to determine the HIV status of infant s so their health needs can also be appropriately met. Where appropriate, health pro viders may encourage such testing in the interest of patients, but this should not a mount to compulsory or mand atory HIV testing. From a law enforcement perspective, s uch measures are not only in the interests of the individuals concerned, but may also ass ist in achieving the aim of being able to present competent and cooperative w itnesses in subsequent court proceedings. Prosecutors Prosecutors have particular duties to victims of crime who are called as witness es. Their general responsibilities in this regard are discus sed in Tool 5.13. The well-being and safety of such persons must be assured within the limits allowed by the legal system. P rosecutors should seek appropriate court orders to ensure the protection of suc h persons from further harm arising from their giving evidence, including risks of retribution agai nst either them - selves or third persons. In relation to the HIV status of persons bei ng questioned , protections must be in place to ensure that invasive questioning in relation to health a nd other intimate matters is avoided if irrelevant to the case. In some jurisdictions, there are barriers to asking all eged sexual assault victims questions about their past sexual experience, where it is not directly relevant to the facts of the case. Where matters of an intimate nature\u2014in cluding aspects of sexual and reproductive health\u2014 are not material to the prosecution's case, t hey should not be raised in open court. In general, the HIV, sexual ly transmitted infection and pregnan cy status of a person vulnerable to trafficking in persons should only be revealed during proceedings with the person's consent. Where consent is obtained, or where lack of conse nt is not determinative because of over- whelming evidentiary requ irements, procedures should be adopted that mini mize the dis- tress or embarrassment of the person c oncerned. For example, pre gnancy, HIV, sexuall y transmitted infection and other healt h status can be disclosed to the cou rt through docu - mentary evidence rather than through testimony an d cross-examination, so that the judge and the opposing party's l awyers have su fficient information to perform their duties but this information is not disclosed to other person s who may be pres ent. Procedures should be adopted to prevent subsequen t unauthorized access to sensitive court records, or their unauthorized disclosure. Judges Questioning /L50539Judges are usually empowered to in tervene when questioning of witnesses is unduly aggressive and to prevent irreleva nt questioning. For instance, they may need to Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons 395 intervene to prevent questioning about HIV or other health s tatus where the iss ue is not material to the prosecutor's c ase. /L50539Where judges have discretion to issue orders concerning the manner of questioni ng, this should be done with due sensitivity to the interests of witnesses, to the extent consistent with ensuring a fair t rial for the accus ed. /L50539Judges should familiarize themselves wi th means by which evid ence such as that pertain - ing to HIV status can be disclosed to t he court through documentary evid ence rather than testimony. Support persons /L50539Permission should be grante d for support persons to be presen t in court, unless there are good reasons for not doing so; this may extend to health professional s, including HIV counsellors. Sentencing /L50539In sentencing convicted defendants for people trafficking or re lated offences, judges should take into account any expo sure of the victims to cruel, inhuman or degradin g treatment, or to serious harm, includi ng HIV infection. /L50539In appropriate circumstances, such factors may constitute aggravating factors for the pur - poses of length or type of sentenc e, or conditions of release. For instance, the traffick - ing of a person for sexual exploitation which results in HIV infection may qualify for an increased sentence, where provisio ns allow. In all cases where sent encing discretion exists, judges should be able and required to take into account the harm caused to the victim, including adverse health outcomes such as HIV infection. chapter 8 Victim assistance Tool 8.14 Testing a nd counselling for HIV/AIDS among people vulnerable to trafficking in persons Overview This tool discusses testin g and counselling for HIV/AIDS among people vulnerab le to trafficking. WHO and UNAIDS encourage States to increase their voluntary counselling and testing services and to standardize a nd expand provider-initiated testing and counsell ing so that more people learn their HIV status, particularly where HIV is concentrated, at the country level, among specific populations (e.g. injecting drug users, men who have sex with men). People vulnerable to human trafficking for the purpose of se xual exploitation might, in some circumstances, be considered eligible fo r provider-initiated testing and counselling.396 Provider-initiated HIV testing and cou nselling for people vuln erable to trafficking HIV/AIDS as it relates to people vulnerable to trafficking is a relatively new area of inves- tigation and response. In addition to the informed consent provisions of the WHO gui d - ance on HIV testing and counselling, provider-initiated testing and counselling should only be offered in accordance with the following con siderations. Broaden ing of prov ider-initiated te sting and counselling /L50539People vulnerable to trafficking shou ld be offered volun tary counselling and testing upon being identified by authorities in countries of transit and/or de stination. /L50539Although it is recommended that provid er-initiated HIV testin trafficking unlikely to prese nt themselves to such faci lities.

Informed con sent and p re- and po st-testing counselling /L50539Trauma potentially suffered by people who have been traffi cked should be taken in to consideration when administering provider-initiated HIV tes ting and counselling, and spe - cial care should be taken to ensure that consent is based on true und erstanding of all of the issues. Special attention for childre n and adolescents /L50539Special attention shou ld be given to children an d adolescents. The provision of pre-tes t information should include discussion of trafficking and HIV/AIDS as they relate to each other.

However, HIV testing should be linked, without prejudice, to the provisi on of care and treatment. Relationship of HIV testing to resid ency status /L50539A victim who tests positive for HIV s hould not have his or her res idency permit revoked. /L50539Countries should amend legislat ion that allows for the deportation of n on-citizens on the basis of their HIV statu s. /L50539Legislation should provide for the special nature of HIV statu s resulting from trafficking to be given addit ional favourable con sideration when residency applications are being reviewed.

The model addresses the provision of support services, assistance in accessing rights and entitlements, and measu res for promoti ng restoration and rein tegration within the community. Services are de livered through the Department of Soci al Welfare and Development regional centres, with outreach acti vities promoted through the ass istance of non- governmental organ izations. The first three levels of the mode l are focused on ass essing individual victims, to pl an for their individualized assistance. Level one of the model address es intake and assistance, level two psychosocial assessment and screen ing, and level three psychological assessment for victims with serious trauma. chapter 8 Victim assistance More information is avai lable via t he website of the De partment of Social Welfare and Development of the Philippines : www.dswd. gov.ph i Tool 8.16 Access to information and legal representatio n Overview This tool explai ns the impor tance of providin g victims of traffic king with access to information and, when r equired, legal r epresentation to facilitate their participation in criminal proceedi ngs against traf fickers. F or related info rmation, see Tool 5.15. JUSTICE FOR VICTI MS States need to encourage the participation of victims of trafficking in the criminal proceed - ings against the trafficker. The y are an important source of evidence for the s uccessful prosecution of a trafficking case. Victims should be supported in their efforts to participate i n the judicial process th rough direct and indirect means, timely notification of critical events and decisions, provision in full of information on the proce dures and processes involved, support of the presence of victims at critical events and assistance when there are opportunities to be heard. The 400 structure of the justice system should take into account the obstacles which many victi ms encounter in seeking to obtain such access, owing to factors such as c ulture, race, language, resources, education, age or citizenship. Facilitating the participation of victims in c riminal p roceeding s Trafficked persons need information, in a language that they understand, about the ju dicial process and about their own rights and responsibilities as participants in criminal proceed - ings. Access to information is an important starting point for the participation of victims of trafficking in the criminal process. The most extens ive list of rights is of no practical use to victims if they are not informed o f those rights. In formation helps to prepare and famili ar- ize victims with the criminal proceed ings and to ease their psychological stress and their anxiety. It is also a means of empowerment and enables victims to participate actively in the case and enforce their rights. Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Trafficking in Persons Protocol The Trafficking in Persons Protocol creates an obligation on Stat es parties to provide vic - tims with information and an oppor tunity for their views and concerns to be presented at criminal proceedings agai nst offenders. (The basic obligation to ensu re that victims are per- mitted an opp ortunity to participa te is set out in article 25 of the Transnational Organized Crime Convention.) Such presentati on could be in the form either of written submissions or oral statements and is to be done in a manner not prejudicial to the rights of the defence. The Trafficking in Persons Protocol also requires States to provide victims of trafficking with information on relevant court and administrative proceedings and with counselling and information, in particular about their legal rights, in a language they c an understand. Article 6, paragraph 2 Each State Party shall ensure that its domes tic legal or administrati ve system contains measures that provide to victims of trafficki ng in persons, in appropriate cases: (a) Information on relevant court and administrative proceedings; (b) Assistance to enable their views and concerns to be presented and considered at appropriate s tages of crimina l proceedings against offenders, in a manner not prejudicial to th e rights of the defence . Declaration of Bas ic Principles of J ustice for Victims of Crime and Abuse o f Power The Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power (General Assembly resolutio n 40/34, annex) states that victims of crime s hould be informed Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons Source: Handbook on Justice For Vic tims of Crime and Abuse of Power (chap.II, sect. D), available at : www.uno dc.org/pdf/crime/publi cations/standards_9857854.pdf i401 of their rights to seek redress, of the role of judicial and administrative processes, of the scope, timing and progress of the proceedings and of the d isposition of their cases, es pe - cially where serio us crimes are involved and when they have requ ested such information, and of the availability of health and s ocial services and other relevant assistance. Access to justice and fair treatment 4.Victims should be treat ed with compassion and respect for their dignity. They are entitled to access to the mechanisms of ju stice and to prompt red ress, as provided for by national legislation, for the harm that they have suffered. 5.Judicial and administrative mechani sms should be established and strengthened where necessary to enable victims to obtain red ress through formal or informal pro - cedures that are expeditious, fair, inexpensive and accessible. Victims should be informed of their rights in seeking redres s through such mechanisms. 6.The responsiveness of judicial and administrative process es to the needs of victims should be facilitated by: (a) Informing victims of their role and the scope, timing and progress of the proceedings and of the disposit ion of their cases, especiall y where serious crimes are involved and where the y have requested such information; (b) Allowing the views and concerns of victims to be presented and considered at appropriate stages of the pro ceedings where their personal interests are affected, without prejudice to the accused and consistent with the relevant national criminal justice system; (c) Providing prope r assistance to victims throughout the l egal process; (d) Taking measures to minimize in convenience to victims, protect their privacy, when necessary, and ensure their safety, as well as that of their families and witnesses on their behalf, from intimidation and retaliation; (e) Avoiding unnecessary delay in the disposition of cases and the execution of orders or decrees granting awards to vi ctims. 7.Informal mechanisms for the resolution of disputes, including mediation, arbitra - tion and customary justice or indi genous practic es, should be utilized where appropriate to facilitate conciliation and redress for victims. In some jurisdictions, the l egal right to receive informati on about various proceedings is limited to certain groups of victims. In some cases, onl y those who play a formal role i n criminal proceedings, for example as witnesses or civil clai mants or private pros ecutors, are given basic information. Some States have establishe d the legal duty of authorities i nvolved in criminal proceedings to provide information to victims of crime. On e advantage of s uch an approach is that it raises the officials' awareness of their responsi bility towards victims. The mere existence of a legal o bligation is not sufficient to ensure that victims have acces s to information. Additional measures, such as the provision of translation s ervices and legal assistance, are necessary to ensure victims can effectively use this information. chapter 8 Victim assistance 402 Legal represent ation and assistance Victims are often deterred from partic ipating in legal proceedi ngs because simple, acces sible and timely legal advice is not available to them when they seek assi stance and support. Legal advice should be made available as part of the i ntegrated support offered by the victim as sis- tance programme. Becau se many victims of trafficki ng are fearful of Govern ments and bureaucratic authori ties, the provision of legal as sistance and representati on is especially important. The development of close li nks between non-govern mental organizations provid - ing legal assistance and law enforcement agencies can greatly facilitate the protection of vic - tims and their rights. The development of formal and informal protocols and proced ures between these agencies should be part of any integrated victim assistance strategy. The task of legal counsels i s to inform victims about their rights and role in criminal pro - ceedings and to accompany them throu ghout the process. They assist victims in expressi ng their views and enforcing their procedu ral rights. Legal counselli ng also prepares victims for the criminal proceedings and can reduce the risk of imposing further trauma on the vic - tims. It increases the chan ce of sound and coherent witness statements and contributes to the successful prosecution of the traffickers. There is a clear relationship between the victims' access to legal representation and successful prosecution outcomes. Many jurisdictions allow victims to hire a lawyer to ad vise and accompany them through - out the proceedings, if they pay for these services themselves. Victims of trafficking, how - ever, usually have no financial means to pay for legal cou nselling. Therefore, i t is necessary to make available Stat e-paid legal counselling. Furthermore, the professi onal legal counsels should be familiar with the need s and situations of victims of human trafficking and should have acquired the necessary expertise to re present them effectively during the various legal proceedings. Promising practice Cambodia Action pour les enfants(www.aplecambodi a.org) is a non-governmental o rganization established to combat the sexual exploitation of children. In addition to social workers who provide counselling and re habilitation services to child victims, the organization's lawyers provide pro bono legal advice and representation to children and their famili es. The organi - zation also monitors cases before Cambodian courts, reports on adherence to legal pro - cedures and collaborates with foreign law enforcement and international organizations in education, advocacy and awareness-raising activities. Through the Cambodian Defenders Project(www.cdpcambodia.org), a group of lawyers working in Cambodia assists people through the legal process and to develop the legal system. The Project's Centre Against Traffick ing provides legal assistance to victims of trafficking and conducts traini ng for local police authorities in relation to trafficking investigations. Moldo va The Centre for Prevention of Trafficking in Women (www.antitraffic.md) provides free legal assistance for victims of trafficki ng and offers training to law enforcers, prosecu tors, judges and border guards.Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons 403 The Trafficking in Persons Protocol and th e Organized Crime C onvention Article 6, paragraph 6 of the Trafficking in Persons Protocol states: \"Each State Party shall ensure that its domestic legal system contains measu res that offer vi ctims of trafficking in persons the possibility of obtaining compen sation for damage su ffered\". This means that when the possibility of obtaining compens ation does not exist under national law, legislation may be required to estab lish appropriate schemes. The corresponding provision of the Organized Crime Convention, found in article 25, para - graph 2, requires that at least some \"appropriate procedures\" are establ ished to provide access to compensat ion or restitution. The Protocol does not specify any potential source of compen sation. Consequently any or all of the following general options wou ld probably meet the requ irements of the Protocol: (a) Provisions allowin g victims to sue offenders or others under statutory or common- law torts for civil damages; (b) Provisions allowin g criminal courts to award criminal d amages (i.e. to order that compensation be paid by offenders to victims) or to impose orders for compens ation or restitution against persons convicted of offences; (c) Provisions establishing dedicated funds or schemes whereby vict ims can claim com - pensation from the State for injuries or damages suff ered as the result of a criminal offence. The legislative framework establishing the mechani sms to make compensation claims is an important starting point for providing trafficked persons with access to compensation for harm suffered and wages lost. Howev er, the mere existence of such laws is not sufficient. chapter 8 Victim assistance Tool 8.17 Restitution and compensation for victims Overview This tool r efers to the pr ovisions of the Organized Crime Con vention an d the Trafficking in Person s Protocol that require appropriate pro cedures to be established to provide compensatio n. The tool also discusses the purpos e and source of compensat ion, and p rinciples concerni ng its provision con tained in international and regional instruments. Last ly, some promising examples of domestic systems p ro - viding compensation to victims of trafficking are highlighted and resources for strengthening compen sation m echanisms are recommended.

These guides can be consulted at : www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/ CTOC/legisla tive-guide .htmli404 Victims of human trafficking have a right to receive compensation from the trafficker for the physical or mental harm suffered at the hand s of the trafficker or becaus e they did not receive any payment for their labour or services. Access to compensation i s closely linked to other issues: /L50539Information . Trafficked pe rsons are often prevented from gain ing access to compens a - tion because they do not know about their right to re ceive compens ation and the necessary procedural steps to take. The refore, information provided by law enforce ment officers or private lawyers is an important prerequisi te for such access . For more on this, see Tool 8.4 and Tool 8.15. /L50539Confiscation of assets . Traffickers oft en hide their money or move it abroad, which prevents trafficked persons from enforcing their compensation claims. In order to over - come this obstacle, States s hould confiscate any property and money resulting from trafficking and use it to compen sate victims. States should also strengthen international law enforcement cooperat ion to secure access to the traffickers' assets moved abroad. See Tool 4.6 and Tool 5 .7.Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons Despite the importance to victims of trafficking of receiving compensation, their right to compensa tion is much neglected. ! The purpose of compen sation Receiving compensation is impo rtant for victims of trafficking not only because of the financial component but also because it has a symbolic meaning. /L50539At a societal level, awarding compens ation acknowledges that trafficking is a crime /L50539At an individual level, the victim's pain and suffering are acknowledged and compensa - tion can constitute a first step towards overcoming trauma inflicted and abu ses suffered /L50539At a practical level, compensation can assist victims in rebuilding their lives /L50539At a retributive level, compen sation paid by traffickers can cons titute a form of punishment and deter other traffickers Sources and types of compensation Article 14 of the Organized Crime Convention provi des a legal basis for States parties to cooperate internationa lly in matters of compensation. Article 16 of the Convention requi res States parties to give priority consideration to returning the confi scated proceeds of cri me or property to the requesting State party so that it can gi ve compensation to victims. Article 25 requires States Parties to establish appropriate procedures to pro vide access to compen - sation and restitution for victims of offences covered by the Convention. Their ri ght to such access must be communi cated to victims.405 Within different lega l frameworks, there are three main methods of obtai ning compensation payment: through cri minal proceedings, through civil action (including claims for damages and under labour laws) and through administrative systems (s uch as State compen sation schemes\u2014funds established by Governments) . chapter 8 Victim assistance Source : OSCE, National Referral Mechanisms: Joining Efforts to Protect the Rights of Trafficked Persons; a Practical Handbook , p. 84 Compensation From the State From the perpetrator Civil action Criminal proceedings Victim funds An associati on of a civi l claim with criminal proce eding (civil-law jurisdi ction) Compensation payments as a subsidiary penalty (common-l aw jurisdiction) Civil law procedu res In most countries, victims can pursue a civil claim for compens ation on the basis of a wrong - doing which has caus ed them loss in tort l aw or under contractual rights (fraud, assault, imprisonment, debt). It is also necessary to note that victims of trafficking may have rights in labour law regardless of the existenc e of any form of contract. Alth ough such civil law proceedings may see m more accessible to a trafficking victim than criminal proceedings, as the police are not in volved, they still require a perpetrator to have been identified and , if the victim is to receive compensation , the perpetrator mus t be within the jurisdiction and financially solvent. Damages will b e calculated on the bas is of national civil law and will usually include both moral and material damages. Criminal law procedures Some countries c onnect civil ac tions for compens ation with criminal proceedings against the perpetrator. T his means that a single trial both punishes the perpetrator and compen sates the victim, thus reducin g the stress on victims. This is also achieved in countries where payment of compensat ion is part of the sen tence imposed on the perp etrator. Where civil proceedings are appen ded to a criminal case, there i s the dual advan tage of having two pro - cedures rolled into one, and the prosecutor is responsible for gathering an d presenting 406 evidence on the liability of the perpet rator to pay compensation. In some countries, a court order for compensation to be paid by the perpetrator can be made at the sen tencing. Criminal compensation calculati ons may be mad e on the same basis as in national civil law or on a completely diff erent basis. These types of claim require a v ictim to have been identified by the authorities and for a perpetrator to have been prosecuted and found guil ty in criminal proceedings. Prosecuting traffickin g offences is difficult, however, because often the offend er is unknown or ha s fled the jurisdiction or t here is insufficient evidence of the i nvoluntary nature of the work performed by t he victim, or the victim is unwilling or unable to cooperate with l aw enforcement. Special funds to pro vide compensat ion claims Compensation can also be paid by or t hrough the State. Some c ountries have establis hed State-administered schemes for victims of violent crime. State-fu nded or State-subsid ized compensation s chemes have the grea t advantage of provi ding a guaranteed payment of com - pensation to the victim and it is not necessary for a speci fic perpetrator to be located or identified. A pol ice report, together with a wi llingness on the part of the victim to assist the police with the i nvestigation is usually sufficient. Stat e schemes ma y also be relatively streamlined and un bureaucratic, and qu icker than civil proceedings. Compensation s chemes may be fund ed from several sources, including: fines, confiscated property of th e perpetrators, tax revenues, other means of State funding, donations from private individuals and institutions. In order for such funds to assist victims effectively: /L50539There should be no exclusion on the grounds of \"illegality\" (given that people who are trafficked rarely have lega l status in their destination country) /L50539The process should be simple an d efficient (given that mos t victims are promptly returned to their country of origin) /L50539Victims should be protected from r evictimization by the court process to the greatest extent possible The compensation claim A claim can potentially be made up of several bases on which compensation is requested, including but not limited to: /L50539Pain and suffering due to physical or psychol ogical violence /L50539Medical expenses /L50539Unpaid or underpaid wages /L50539Reimbursement of illegal \"fees\" pai d to a recruit ment or employment agency, or for smuggling or transportati on /L50539\"Fines\" imposed by traffick ers for bad behaviour /L50539Excessive, fraudul ent or illegal \"deductions\" from wages for rent, subsistence, transport, tax or social security \"payments\" Enforcement is far easier where assets have been traced, seize d or frozen and confiscated in the course of civil or criminal proceedings. For more on asset seizure and confiscation, see Tool 4.6 and Tool 5.7.Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons 407 Aggravated, exem plary or punitive damages may be available to trafficking victims in some jurisdictions. They usually serve to punish a wrongdoer for particul arly outrageous conduct, therefore having a deterrent element, and can be related to the wealth of the wrongdoer. These concepts will be novel to other jurisdictions but there is nothi ng to prevent States introducing such concepts where the types of acti on for which compe nsation is being claimed warrant a particularly punitive response as a matter of public policy. The quicker and eas ier a compensation scheme is to navigate, the more accessi ble it will be for victims, both internally and internationally. Specific chal lenges are posed by the transnational nature of trafficking in human beings. Victims who have changed ju risdiction face clear practical difficulties in pursui ng a compens ation claim across borders. They also face difficulties when a trafficker is transferred to another jurisdiction for prosecution or when a criminal or defend ant in a civil/labour lawsuit has assets located mainly outside the territory. Some important things to ensure are: /L50539Access to trans lators to overcome language barriers (see Tool 8.4) /L50539Access to information about laws and procedures in the country where the claim is made (see Tool 8.15) /L50539Efficient and comprehensive evidence gathering (see Chapter 5) /L50539Assistance to cover travel costs and i n obtaining visas for attending hearings chapter 8 Victim assistance Source: National Referral Mechanisms: Joining Efforts to Protect the Rights of Trafficked Persons; a Practical Handbook (Warsaw, OSCE, 2004), available at: www.osce.org/ documents/odihr/2004/05/29 03_en.pdf i Principles of providing compensation to victim s of crime International principles Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power In accordance with principles 8 to 13 of the Declaration of Bas ic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power (General Assembl y resolution 40/34, annex), compensation should include the return of property or payment for harm or loss su ffered, reimbursement of expe nses incurred as a result of the victimization, provision of services and restoration of righ ts. States shou ld encourage the estab lishment, strengthening and expansion of national funds for compensation to victims of crime. Restitution 8.Offenders or t hird parties responsi ble for their behaviour shoul d, where appropriate, make fair restitut ion to victims, their fami lies or dependants. Such restitution should include the return of property o r payment for the harm or loss su ffered, reimbursement of expenses incurred as a result of the victimizati on, the provision of services and the restoration of rights. 408 9.Governments should review their practices, regul ations and laws to consider restitu - tion as an available s entencing option in cri minal cases, in add ition to other crimi nal sanctions. 10.In cases of substantial harm to the en vironment, res titution, if ordered, should include, as far as possible, restoration of the environment, reconstruction of the infra - structure, replacement of community faci lities and reimbu rsement of the expenses of relocation, whenever such harm results i n the dislocation of a community. 11.Where public officials or other agents acting in an official or quasi-official capa city have violated national criminal laws, the victi ms should receive restitution from the State whose officials or agents were responsible for the harm in flicted. In cases where the Government under whose authority the victimizing act or omis sion occurred is no longer in existence, the State or Govern ment successor in title s hould provide restituti on to the victims. Compensation 12.When compensation is not fully available from the offende r or other sources, States should endeavour to provide financial compensation to: (a) Victims who have s ustained significant bodily in jury or impairment of physical or mental health as a result of serious crimes; (b) The family, in particular dependants, of persons who have died or become physically or mentally incapacitated as a result of such victimization. 13.The establishment, strengthening and expansion of national funds for compen sa - tion to victims shou ld be encouraged. Where appropriate, other funds may also be estab - lished for this purpose, inclu ding in those cases where the State of which the victim is a national is not in a position to compensate the victim for the harm.

A background paper on the study, enti tled \"Compensation for trafficked and exploited persons in the OSCE region\" was prepared for a workshop on the issue held in Barcelona, Spa in, from 10 to 12 December 2007. It reported that there were various ways in which compensation can be paid: /L50539State-funded or subsidized compensation s chemes /L50539\"Damages\" paid by the person responsible for loss or injury through criminal or civil proceedings /L50539Compensation through labour court proceedings In assessing the effectiveness of compensation systems, the background paper found, inter alia, that: /L50539Access to other rights, so-called ancillary rights, such as advi ce services, security, legal, social and medi cal assistance as well as resid ence permits, for the duration of a claim procedure, is crucial to ma king compensation scheme s accessible and effective for trafficked persons. /L50539The offence of trafficking may not be the offence prosecuted in a particular case, even though it exists in national law. This i n turn may affect the victim's eligibility for compensation. /L50539The effectiveness of a compensati on system is dependant on its overall legal environ - ment; therefore efforts to improve c ompensation schemes may be fruitless if the rule of law is not adequate in a particular country and unless broader rule of law reforms are undertaken at the same time.Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons The background pa per entitled \"Compe nsation for trafficked and exploited persons in the OSCE region\" will be published in 200 8 and made available at: www.osce.org/odihr/publications.htmli Promisin g practice Assistance and Compe nsation to Crime Victims Act (Bu lgaria) At its plenary sitting on 18 December 20 06, the National Assembly of Bul garia adopted the Assistance and Compensation to Crime Victims Act, which provides for the compen sation of victims of crime, i ncluding persons who have been tra fficked, and for the provisi on to them of support, such as medical assistance and l egal advice. The authorities are given the responsibility of informin g victims of such rights.413 New So uth Wales Victims Compen sation Tribunal (Australia) The New South Wales Victims Compensation Tribunal was established under the Victims Support and Rehabilitatio n Act 1996, and consists of magistrates who determine appeals against rulings and make orders for recovery of mon ey from convicted offenders, compen - sation assessors who make d eterminations in compensation claims and approve counselling applications, and tribunal staff who provide adminis trative support in the proces sing and determination of compensation and counselling claims, appeals an d restitution.

In assessing such damages , courts can take into account the extent of exploit ation, the benefit the perpetrator derived from the exploitation, the extent to which the future prosp ects of the victim were adversely affected by having being trafficked, the culpability of the offender and the relationshi p of the offender with the vi c - tim. Special damages can include all costs incurred as a res ult of the trafficki ng, including the cost of repatriation.

Effective action to prevent and combat trafficking i n persons requires a co mprehensive inter- national approach, including measures to prevent such trafficking, t o protect victims of such trafficking and to prosecute traffick ers. To prevent human trafficking effecti vely, the Trafficking in Persons Protocol re quires States to end eavour to und ertake measures such as social and economic initiatives, research and media campaigns targeting potential victims. This area of trafficki ng response calls for a wide range of actors (from legislators and law enforcers to the media and t he public) to cooperate i n designing and implement- ing creative initiatives. The present chapter discusses principles of prevention (Tool 9 .1) and policies to address them. The root caus es of trafficking (Tool 9.2) are multifaceted. They range from gender- based discrimination and economic disempowerment (Tool 9.3) to corruption (Tool 9.4), issues of citizenship (Tool 9.5) and safe mobility ( Tool 9.6). Checklists are offered to assist in developing strategies to address these issues (Tool 9.7). Raising awareness about trafficking is necessary to empower people to avoid falling prey to traffickers. Measures which can be taken to raise such awaren ess are discussed in Tool 9.8 and checklists to facilitate this process are offered in Tool 9.9. Effective awarenes s-raising requires a communication strategy to determine a cl ear message and ens ure its clear delivery. A succinct guide to designing a commun ication strategy is offered in T ool 9.10. In times of emergency, people are ren dered more vuln erable to exploitati on and rapid response is necessary to protect them from an i nflux of traffickers who are attracted to areas with displaced popula tions; Tool 9 .11 offers examples of effective and efficient responses. Demand is a complicated process whic h must also be addressed to reduce the corres- ponding supply of trafficked persons . The complexities of demand are di scussed in Tool9.12 and the specific demand created by s ex tourism is addressed in Tool 9.13. Efforts which can discourage those who service demand are c onsidered in Tool 9.14 . Tool 9.15 discusses the use and importanc e of standardized data collection instruments in targeting prevention responses, and the special role and responsibility that the media have with respect to proactively preventing and not inadvertently faci litating trafficking is discussed in Tool 9.16. The important role that peacekeepers and other international law enforceme nt personnel play by not being a part o f the trafficking problem and also by contributing to its s olution are discussed in Tool 9.17 and relevant training tools in that context are presented in Tool9.18. The under-addressed issue of trafficki ng in persons for organ removal is flagged in Tool 9.19. 417 PREVENTION OF TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS chapter 9 418 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons The prevention of trafficking in persons requires creative and coordinated responses. E fforts to deter traffickers by addressing the root causes that led them to become traffickers go hand in hand with the deterrent impac t of criminal justice efforts. Victim assistance efforts to break the cycle of trafficking must be directed both at preventing victims from being retrafficked and also at preventing victims from becoming traffic kers.

In short, prevention of trafficking is interlinked with all other responses t o trafficking and therefore must be und ertaken in a concerted, holistic way which acknowledges the complexity of trafficking in persons. Often, efforts to prevent trafficking only address the so-called root causes of trafficking, such as poverty, lack of (equal) opportunity and lack of education. Further to this narrow focus, sometimes these issues are only addressed from the perspective of trafficking victims, rather than also addressing the root causes that contribute to a person becoming a trafficker. To merely address this stage in the process of traffi cking is to neglect the whole pictu re. At one end of the trafficking process are the \"supply\" factors (in the place of origin), which relate to a person's vulnerability to re cruitment or the lu re of criminal activity; at the other are the \"demand\" factors (in the place of des tination), which lead to the exploitation of trafficked persons. Between the se poles are the porous borders (of countries of origin, destination and transit) which allow this illegitimate market to \"trade\" across borders. Article 9 of the Trafficking in Persons Protocol emphas izes the need for States to address these aspects of trafficking in pe rsons. Trafficking in Person s Protocol Article 9 Prevention of trafficking in perso ns 1.States Parties shall establish comprehensive pol icies, programmes and other measures: (a) To prevent and combat traffick ing in persons; and (b) To protect victims of trafficking in persons, especially women a nd children, from revictimization. 2.States Parties shall endeavo ur to undertake measures such as research, infor - mation and mass media campaigns and social and economic i nitiatives to preven t and combat trafficking in persons. 3.Policies, programmes and other measures established in accordance with this article shall, as appropriate, include cooperati on with non-governmental organi zations, other relevant organizations and o ther elements of civil society. 4.States Parties shall take or strengthen me asures, including through bil ateral or multilateral cooperation , to alleviate the factors that make pers ons, especially women and children, vulnerable to t rafficking, such as poverty, u nderdevelopment and lack of equal opportunity. 5.States Parties shall adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such as educational, social or cultural measures, including through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to discourage the demand that fosters all forms of expl oitation of persons , especially women an d children, that lead s to trafficking. 420 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons The Trafficking in Persons Protocol: /L50539Requires States to endeavou r to undertake measures such as social and economi c initia - tives, research and media campaigns targetin g potential victims. Policies, programmes and other measures taken sho uld include cooperation with non-governmental and other relevant organizations. /L50539Reaffirms that effective action to prevent and combat trafficking in persons requ ires a comprehensive internat ional approach, including measures to prevent such trafficking, protect victims of such trafficking and prosecute traffickers. /L50539Indicates that States should take or strengthen these measures, including through bi lat- eral and multilateral cooperation, to allevi ate the factors\u2014lack of equal opportunity an d poverty\u2014that make persons, especially women and children, vulnerable to traffi cking. Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Hu man Rights and Human Trafficking (E/2002/ 68/Add.1) (United Nations High Comm issioner for Human Ri ghts) The Recommended Princi ples and Guidelines on Human Rights and Hu man Trafficking developed by the United Nations High Commi ssioner for Human Rights offer important guidance for anti -trafficking efforts. The guideline of key relevance to preven ting trafficking in persons is provided below. Guideline 7: Preventing trafficking Strategies aimed at preventing trafficking shoul d take into account demand as a root cause. States and intergovernmen tal organizations should also take into account the factors that increase vulnerabi lity to trafficking, including inequali ty, poverty and all forms of d iscrimi- nation and prejudice. Effective prevention s trategies should be based on exis ting experience and accurate information. States, in partnership wit h intergovernmental and non-governmental organi zations and, where appropriate, u sing development cooperation poli cies and programmes, shoul d consider: 1.Analysing the factors that gene rate demand for exploitati ve commercial sexual services and exploitat ive labour and taking strong legislative, policy and other measures to address these issues. 2.Developing programmes that offer livelihood options, including basic education, skills training and literacy, especially for wome n and other traditional ly disadvantaged grou ps. 3.Improving children's access to educational opportunities and increasing the level of school attendance, in particular by girl children. 4.Ensuring that potential migrants, especial ly women, are properly i nformed about the risks of migration (e.g. exploitation, debt bondage and health and security 421 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons issues, including exposu re to HIV/AIDS) as well as avenues available for legal, non- exploitative migrati on. 5.Developing information camp aigns for the general public aimed at promoting awareness of th e dangers associated with trafficking. Such campaigns should be informed by an understandin g of the complexities surround ing trafficking and of the reasons why individuals may make potentially dangerous migration decisions. 6.Reviewing and modifying policies that may compel people to res ort to irregu - lar and vulnerable labour migration. This process should inclu de examining the effect on women o f repressive and/or discriminatory nationality, property, immigration, emigration and migrant labour laws. 7.Examining ways of increasing opportuni ties for legal, gainful and non- exploitative labour migration. The promotion of labour migration by the State s hould be dependent on the existence of regulatory and supervisory mechani sms to protect the rights of migrant workers. 8.Strengthening the capacity of law enforceme nt agencies to arrest and pros ecute those involved in trafficking as a prev entive measure. This includes ensuring that law enforcement agencies comply with thei r legal obligations. 9.Adopting measures to reduce vulnerability by ensuring that appropriate legal documentation for birth, citizenship and marriage is provided and made available to all persons. The Recom mended Princi ples and Gu idelines on at: www.unhcr .bg/other/r_p_g_hr_ht_e n.pdf i Traffickin g in Persons Protocol and the Organized Crime Con vention The Trafficking in Persons Protocol, in conjunction with article 31 of the O rganized Crime Convention, requires States parties to ad opt what amounts to a comprehens ive prevention strategy. Social prevention measures, including addressing the adverse underlyi ng social and economic conditions believed to contribu te to the desire to migrate and hence to the vulnerability of victims to traffickers, as well as prevention afforded by education and awareness-raising, are dealt with in article 31 of the Organized Crime Convention and i n article 9 of the Trafficking in Persons Protocol. These are word ed so as both to encompass campaigns intended to raise awareness of the problem and to mobilize s upport for measures against it in the general population, as well as more targeted efforts directed at warning specific groups or even individuals believed to be at high risk of victimization. In these areas, preventive measures to be taken against trafficking parallel those against organized crime in general, but the Traffi cking in Persons Protocol also contains422 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons requirements that are speci fic to trafficking. Recognizing that trafficking could be dealt with from both the demand and supply sides, article 9 includes measures intended to discour- age the demand for services that fosters the exploitive element of trafficki ng and hence i ts major source of illicit revenue. The Protocol als o takes into consideration that former victims are often even more vu lnerable later on, especiall y if repatriated to pla ces where trafficking is common. In add ition to the basic requirements to protect victims from intimi - dation or retaliation by offenders, article 9 also calls for measures to protect victims from being trafficked again and from other forms of revictimization. The Protocol also seeks to prevent trafficking throu gh measures intended to make it more difficult for traffickers to use conventional means of transport and entry into States: it requires States parties to ensure that border controls are effective and to prevent the misuse of passports and other travel or id entification documents (see Tool 5.11 and Tool 9.6). These provisions, foun d in articles 11, 12 and 13 of the Traffickin g in Persons Protocol, are identical to the corresponding provisions of the Migrants Protocol, which all ows States seeking to ratify both Proto cols to implement these measures jointly.

The root causes of trafficking are various and often differ from one country to another. Trafficking is a complex phenome non that is often driven or infl uenced by social , economic, cultural and other factors. Many of these fac tors are specific to individual trafficking patterns and to the States in which they occur. There are, however, many factors that tend to be common to trafficking in general or foun d in a wide range of different regions, patterns or cases. One such factor is that the desire of potential vi ctims to migrate is exploited by offenders to recruit and gain initial control or cooperation, only to be replaced by more coercive measures once the victims have been moved to another State or region of the country, which may not always be the one to whi ch they had intended to migrate. Tool 9.2 Addressing the root causes of trafficki ng Overview This tool discusses the root causes of trafficki ng in persons and the economic and social policies ident ified in the OSCE Ac tion Plan to Combat Traffickin g in Human Beings aimed at addressing those r oot causes. ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES 424 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons Some of the common factors are local c onditions that make populati ons want to migrate in search of better co nditions: poverty, oppressi on, lack of human rights, lack of s ocial or economic opportun ity, dangers from conflict or instability and similar conditions. Political instability, militarism, civil unrest, internal armed con flict and natural disasters may resul t in an increase in trafficking. The destabilization and di splacement of populations increase their vulnerability to exploitation and abuse through trafficking and forced labour. War an d civil strife may l ead to massive displace ments of populations, leaving orphans and street children extremel y vulnerable to traffickin g. These factors tend to exert pressures on vict ims that \"push\" them into migration and hence into the control of t raffickers, but other factors that tend to \"pull\" potential victims can also be significant. Poverty and wealth are relative concepts which lead to both migration and trafficking patterns in which victims move from condi tions of extreme poverty to con - ditions of less-extreme poverty. In that context, the rapid expansion of broadcast and telecommunication media, in cluding the Internet, across the developing world may have increased the desire t o migrate to developed countries and, with it, the vulnerabili ty of would-be migrants to traffickers. The practice of ent rusting poor children t o more affluent friends or relatives may create vu l- nerability. Som e parents sell their childre n, not just for the money, but als o in the hope that their children will e scape a situation of chronic poverty and move to a place where they will have a better life and more opportunities. In some States, social or cultural practices als o contribute to trafficki ng. For example, the devaluation of women and gi rls in a society makes them disproportionately vulnerable to trafficking. Added to these factors are the issues of porous borders, corru pt Government officials, the involvement of i nternational organized criminal groups or networks and limited capacity of or commitment by immigration and law enforcement officers to con trol borders. Lack of adequate legislation and of political wil l and commitment to enforce exis ting legislation or manda tes are other factors that facili tate trafficking in persons. In response to the above root cause s, most prevention strategies fall within one of the following categories: /L50539Reducing the vulnerability of poten tial victims through soci al and economic developmen t /L50539Discouraging the demand for the services of trafficked persons /L50539Public education /L50539Border control /L50539Preventing the corruptio n of public officials OSCE Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human B eings Recommended preventi ve action at the national level The Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings adopted by OSCE contains a number of measures recommended for adopti on at the national level in order to prevent425 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons trafficking in human beings. They consist of: (a) measures relating to data collection and research; (b) border measures; (c) economic and social policies aimed at addressi ng the root causes of trafficking in human beings; (d) awareness-raising measures; and (e) legislative measures. The follo wing economic and social policies are recommen ded: In countries of origin: /L50539Considering as priority goals the fostering of soci al, economic and political stability, and the reduction both of migration caused by deep poverty and of supply factors of trafficking. Policies followed in pu rsuit of these goals shoul d also promote both economic devel opment and social incl usion. /L50539Improving children's access to educational and vocational opportunities and increas- ing the level of school attendance, in particular by girls and minority groups. /L50539Enhancing job opportunities fo r women by faci litating business opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME s). Organizing SME training cou rses and targeting them in part icular at high-ris k groups. In countries of destination: /L50539Implementing measures t o reduce \"the in visibility of expl oitation\". A multi-agency programme of monitoring, administrative controls and intelligence gathering on the labour markets and, where applicable, on the sex in dustry, will contribute greatly to this objective. /L50539Considering the liberalization by Governments of their labour markets wi th a view to increasing employment opportunities for workers with a wide range of ski lls levels. /L50539Addressing the problem of unprotected, informal and often illegal labour, with a view to seeking a balance between the demand for inexpensive labour and the possibilities of regular migrat ion. /L50539Tackling underground economic activi ties that undermine economies and enhance trafficking.

This incre ases their vulnerabili ty to exploitation by traffick - ers. In addition, gender st ereotypes perpetuate their over-representation in l ower paid, less secure, traditionally female jobs a nd determine the distribution of responsibilities for paid and unpaid work. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discriminat ion against Women Article 10 of the Convention on the Elimination of Al l Forms of Discrimination against Women (General A ssembly resolution 34/180, annex) obliges States p arties to eliminate \"any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education ... in particular by the revis ion of textbooks and school programmes an d the adap - tation of teaching method s\". Article 4 of that Convention specifi es that \"temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination\".

In section 7 of the Declaration, entitled \"Root causes\", under the heading \"Prevention of trafficking in human beings\", it is stated that: /L50539An essential aspect of a human rights based approach to traffic king in human beings is to put emphasis on gender perspe ctives. A European counter-trafficking strategy should include the combating of gender-base d violence and patriarchal stru ctures that foster a favourable environment for traf ficking. /L50539Legislation and policies on equal opportunities must protect and strengthen the legal and social position of women and children and specifically address all forms of gender discrimination. /L50539Support programmes should be established aimi ng at the full participation and empower - ment of women in society, in parti cular in educational facilities and economic life, including support to female entrepreneurship. /L50539Support programmes shou ld aim at the strengthening of efforts to t ackle poverty and further marginalization, particularly among the mos t vulnerable groups of the popu lation, including women and the girl child, in all countries of origin, transit and destination through measures designed to improve govern ance, material support, social protection and employment opportunities and susta inable economic devel opment. National ge nder-equality machinery Many States have set up national gende r-equality machinery. According to general re com - mendation No. 6 of the Commit tee on the Elimination of Discrimination agains t Women and the Beijing Platform for Action, such national gender-equality machinery should: /L50539Be established at a high-level of Government /L50539Have adequate resources /L50539Have a strong political commitment /L50539Have the authority/ability to influence poli cy /L50539Have a well-defi ned mandate to advise on t he impact on women of all Government pol i- cies, to monitor the s ituation of women and to formulate new policies and carry ou t strategies and measures to eliminate gen der discrimination 428 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons The realization of women's huma n rights requires the establishment of such high-level coordinating bodies, responsible for the su pervision of gender-sensitive and effective imple - mentation of national laws and the development and coordination of policies aimed at integrating a gender perspective into national laws, policies and programmes. Promising practice \"Girls be Ambitious\" (C ambodia) Japan Relief for Cambodia and American Assistance for Cambodia The objective of the Girls be Ambitious programme of Japan Relief for Cambodia and American Assistance for Cambodia, t wo non-governmental organizations, is to prevent the trafficking of Cambod ian women and girls by raising awarenes s among those most vulner- able, providing incentives to keep them in school and providi ng vocational training that will improve their employment prospects, gen erate income and socially and politicall y empower them. The progra mme runs off the Rural School Project, a j oint effort of the two organi - zations, which manages more than 300 schools in villages in Cambodia. The Girls be Ambitious program me provides financial assistance to families whose daughters attend school. Each month, home room teache rs e-mail the programme an excel attendan ce sheet for sponsored girls; immedia te payment of US$ 10 is provided where girls have achieved perfect attendance. Where girls do not have perfect attend ance, the paym ent for that month is withheld pendin g the programm e's investigations into the reasons for this lack of attendance.

Such initiatives may in clude: /L50539Microcredit lending programmes, skil ls training and job counselling partic ipation in economic deci sion-making /L50539Programmes to keep children, especially girls, in elementary and secondary school an d to educate former victims of traffickin g /L50539Development of educational curricula regarding the dangers of trafficking /L50539Grants to non-governmental organizati ons to accelerate an d advance the political, economic, social and educational rol es and capacities of women in their countries Tool 9.4 Prevention of corruption Overview This tool introduces the United Nations Convention against Corrup tion and refers the reader t o the United Nations Anti- Corru ption Toolkit and other relevant resources . Corruption is the misus e of public power for private gai n. Corruption includes several ele - ments, such as bribery, embezzlement, abuse of discretion and favouritism. Specifically, bribery involves the promise, offe ring or giving of any undue benefit that improperly affects the actions or decisions of a public offic ial. Corrupt officials often play an important role in human trafficking. At the re cruitment stage, obtaining of fraudulent invitations or forged documents may be facilitated by c orrupt officials. At the transporta tion stage, in exchange for bribes, officials may turn a blind eye and ignore v ictims of trafficking, all owing them to cross borders. At the exploitation phase, extorti on may be exercised. No State has been immune to some level of corrupt practices. The international commu - nity and the wider public in all societies have been constantly deman ding more openness and accountability from the holders of publi c office. Consequently, many national, regional and international initiatives have focused on various aspects of the problem of corruption in recent years. The Organized Crime Convention includes provisions relating to corruption in an organ - ized crime context. However, because of the focus ed nature and scope of the Organized Crime Convention, States agree d that the multifaceted phenomenon of corruption could be dealt with more appropriate ly in a separate in strument. Hence, the United Nations430 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons Convention against Corruption was adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 58/4, opened for signature from 9 to 11 De cember 2003 in M\u00e9rida, Mexico and entered into force on 14 December 2 005. United Nati ons Convention against Corruption The adoption of the United Nations Conve ntion against Corruption provides the opportu - nity for a global response to the problem of corruption. The l evel of support it has received indicates both an ac ute awareness of t he severity of the problem and a remarkable political commitment to tackle it. The Convention requires States par ties to establish criminal and other offences to cover a wide range of acts of corruption, if the se are not already crimes under domestic law. In some cases, States are legally obliged to establish offences; in other cases, in order to take into account differences in domestic law, the y are required to consider doing so. The Convention goes beyond previous instrumen ts of this kind, criminalizing not only basic forms of corrupti on such as bribery an d the embezzlement of publi c funds, but also trad - ing in influence and offences committed in support of corruption, i.e. the con cealment and \"laundering\" of the proceeds of corrupti on as well as obstruction of justice. The Convention also addresses the problematic areas of private-sector corrupti on. In addition, it contains substantial provisions on strengthening international coopera tion in criminal matters, as well as on specific asp ects of international law enforcement cooperation, incl uding joint investi- gations and the use of special in vestigative techniques, such as controlled delivery, electroni c surveillance and undercover operations. Las tly, the Convention in cludes separate chapters on asset recovery and technical assistance and information e xchange. A critical focus of the Co nvention is prevention\u2014provid ing the institutional and regulatory framework to reduce the likelihood of corrupt practices in the fi rst instance. Preventing and combating corruption is intrinsically connected with development and achieving sus tainable livelihoods. If corruptio n permeates the fabric of society, including law enforcemen t, there can be few pro spects for development and prosperity. It is for thes e reasons that assistance in preventing and combati ng corruption must be seen as part of an overall effort to create the foundations for democracy, development, justice and effective governance.

A key problem faced by tho se investigating corru ption is that, unlike many traditional crimes, such as robbery or murder, corruption d oes not have a cl ear victim likely to complain and there is no overt occu rrence likely to be reported by witness es. Indeed, in corruption cases, those with direct knowledge of t he offence generally profit in some way, maki ng them unlikely to report it. Corruption is not a \" victimless\" crime, however; the only victim in many cases is the general public interest. For that reason, an y anti-corruption s trategy should include elements intended to bring to light the presence of corrupti on, such as: /L50539Elements to encourage people who witness o r are aware of corrupt incidents t o report them /L50539Incentives to complain about substandard public services that may be due to corruption /L50539General education about corruption, the harm it causes and basic standards that should be expected in the administration of public affairs /L50539Elements that generate information and evidence of corruption in other ways, such as audit and inspection requireme nts /L50539Strategies to encourage the more \"direct\" vi ctims of corruption, such as the unsuccess- ful participants in a corrupt competition for a public contract or employment position, to be aware of the possibility of corruption and to report it when it is suspected In encouraging thos e aware of corruption to report it, the greatest chall enge is often their vulnerability to intimidation or retaliation by the offenders, u sually because they belong to a vulnerable group or because of the relationship they have with the offenders. Thus, those who deal with of ficials in circumstances of physical or social is olation, such as new immi- grants or residents of rural areas, shou ld be the subject of information campaigns about what standards to expect from officials and be given the means to lodge compl aints if the standards are not met. Government agencies can also set up channels that permit corruption to be reported internally.

People without citizenship have limited or no access to jus tice, health care, travel, educa - tion, employment and political representation. A recent study published by the Vital Voice s434 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons Global Partnership, entitled Stateless and Vulnerable to Hum an Trafficking in Thailand , dis- cusses the particula r vulnerability to trafficking of ethnic minority groups who have no cit - izenship. The obstacles posed to su ch persons by their lack of citizenship makes their employ - ment opportunities li mited, thereby rendering them vulnerable to exploi tation. Furthermore, people who ha ve no citizenship who are ultimately trafficked will receive limited protection and assistance and may be denied re-entry to their State of origin. The report analyses the legal dimensions of obtaining ci tizenship and the challenges faced by tribal peoples. It asserts that improving access to citizen ship would be a signifi cant con - tribution towards reducing vuln erability to human traffic king and recommends that the following measures be implemented: /L50539Birth registration of all children /L50539Improving the transparency of the application process for citizenship /L50539Eliminating fees associated with application for citizenship /L50539Training of local officials on relevant laws /L50539Elimination of restrictions on travel and access to ed ucation, health care an d employment for non -citizens during the application process Stateless and Vulnerable to Hum an Trafficking in T hailand is available at: www.humant rafficking.org/publications/584 i Promising practice Highlan d citizens hip and birth registrat ion project Dedicated efforts are being undertaken in T hailand to reduce the trafficking vulnerability of ethnic minorities. The Government is working with the Culture Unit of UNESCO to address the issue of lack of citizenship of highland girls and women in Thailan d, affirmed as a major risk factor for their vuln erability to being trafficked or otherw ise exploited. Wi status, ethnic min orities are con sidered \"illegal aliens\" and can be subject to arrest, deportation, extort ion and other forms of abuse. Not only does this breach their right to birth registration and nationality, but it also denies them their human rights to vote, own land and travel beyond their home di stricts or provinces (thereby restricting their employ - ment opportunities), obtain certificates after completing schooling and access State welfare services, including health care and medical treatment. In response to these findings, UNESCO is supporting non-govern mental organizations and cooperating with UNIAP and agencies of the Govern ment of Thailand in assisting hill tribespeople to register for citizenship.

The language of the article makes it cl ear that this includ es technical measures to mak e documents more difficult to falsify, forge or al ter and administrative and security measures to protect the production and issuance process against corruption, theft or other diversion of docum ents. Indirectly, supplementary offences to deal with theft, falsification and other misconduct in relation to travel or identity documents can be created if they do not exist in national law or are not covered in the defi nition of more general offences. A number of new and developing technologies offer considerable potenti al for the creati on of new types of docu ment that uniquely identify individuals, can rapidly and accurately be read by machi nes and are difficult to falsify becaus e they rely on in formation stored in a database out of the reach of offenders rather than on the face of the document itself. Trafficking in Persons P rotocol Article 12. Security and control of documents Each State Party shall take such measure s as may be necessary, within available means: (a) To ensure that travel or identity documen ts issued by it are of such qu ality that they cannot easily be misused and cann ot readily be falsified or unlawfully altered, replicated or issued; and (b) To ensure the integrity and securi ty of travel or identity documents issued by or on behalf of the Stat e Party and to prevent their unlawful creation, issuance and u se.

AWARENESS-RAISI NG Efforts should be made to raise public awareness of the problem of human trafficki ng through public information campaigns and other means. In the case of vi ctims, public informati on campaigns should also address basic human rights s tandards and make victims aware that trafficking is a crime, that they are being victimized and that they can seek the protection 438 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons of the law. Campaigns shou ld be formulated in ways that will be understood by victi ms, using materials in appropriate languages adapted for an d relevant to the target audience. OSCE Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human B eings The OSCE Action Plan to Combat Traffic king in Human Beings includes the fol lowing measures to be taken at the national level: /L50539Undertaking, in cooperation with ci vil society and non-governmental orga nizations, infor- mation campaigns to generate public awarenes s about trafficki ng in its various forms, including the methods emplo yed by traffickers and the risks to victims /L50539Increasing awareness about trafficking among immi gration authori ties and consular and diplomatic personnel so t hat they use this knowledge in their daily contacts with potential victims /L50539Encouraging embassies to disseminate information on relev ant national legislation, such as family law, labou r law and immigration law, that is of interest to potential migrants, including through n on-governmental organizations /L50539Increasing the awareness of other relevant target groups, inclu ding policymakers, law enforcement officers and other relevant professionals such as medical, social service and employment offi cials, and the private sector, of trafficking in human beings, to enhance their readiness to address it adequately and to strengthen their in stitutional capacity to counter it /L50539Encouraging the consular and visa s ections of diplomatic missions to use printed and other materials in their work wi th individuals at risk /L50539Raising the awareness of the med ia. The percepti on of the problem of traffi cking in human beings brou ght forward by the media should include a clear explanation of the phenomenon and a realistic portrayal of t he victims. To maximize publi c knowledge and awareness, anti-traffi cking campaigns should be conducted with media professional s /L50539Targeting awareness-raising campaigns also at the most vulnerable groups, i ncluding persons belonging to n ational minori ties, children, migrants and internally displaced persons /L50539Extending awareness-raisin g campaigns to smaller town s and villages whose popul ations may be at particular risk /L50539Working in schools and universities as well as directly with families to reach young people and to raise their awareness about trafficking /L50539Addressing, also through the med ia, the need to reduce the demand for the activities of persons trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced l abour, slavery or other practices similar to slavery and, in thi s connection, promoting zero toleran ce towards all forms of trafficking /L50539Establishing well-publicized telephone \"hotlines\" in the States of origin, transit and destination, which s hould serve three pu rposes: to act as an independent source of advice and guidance to potential victims who may be considerin g job opportunities or other offers to go abroad; to act a s a first point of contact providing access to a referral mechanism for victims o f trafficking in human beings; and to facilitate the anonymous reporting of cases or su spected cases of traffickin g in human beings.439 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons Public education, information and a wareness ca mpaigns Persons who migrate are often disadvantaged by a lack of information, which forces them to turn to third parties for help to find jobs abroad. These third parties often turn out to be traffickers. The purpose of raising publi c awareness is to mobilize popular concern about the risk of falling prey to these criminals a nd about the social and human costs of trafficking in persons. In general, anti-trafficking campaigns shoul d focus on educating people about the true nature of that crime and its consequences. Within the general population, specific groups can be targeted with more spe cific messages or by specifi c means. Awareness-raising campaigns should provide potential victims of traffickin g with sufficient information about the ris ks of human trafficking, the possibilities for migrating legall y in order to work and earning pos- sibilities to enable t hem to make informed decisions about migration, to evalu ate whether job offers are realistic and to seek help in the case of trafficking. Awareness-raising campaigns should also address the health risks, such as un wanted pregnan cies and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, associated with sexual exploitation. Other mes - sages to be conveyed are vi gilance and public accountabil ity (taking action when trafficking is detected), information about anti-traffi cking programmes and criminal penalties for trafficking. Promising pr actice Global television ca mpaign on human traffic king (Unite d Nation s Office on Dru gs and Crime) The UNODC global television campaign is designed to build a diverse and widespread understanding of the issues surround ing trafficking in human beings and to illustrate some of the steps being tak en to address this growing problem. The first video of the campaign focused on trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation, in order to depict one aspect of human trafficking and to project a powerful message about this complex problem. Following the succe ss of that first video spot, UNODC produced a second one, focused on trafficking in men, women and children for bonded and forced labour (e.g. in factories or fields or as domestic servants). With the co - operation of broadcasters worldwide, UNODC arranged for the t ransmission of the spots on national networks, as well as on global and regional networks such as CNN Intern ational, BBC World and MTV Asia. Millions of people worldwide have viewed the video s pots at absolutely no cost to U NODC. The spots have also been distributed among relevant non-governmental organizations to serve as an awareness-creation tool at the local level. Two new video spots launched later took the UN ODC campaign one step further, calli ng on victims and the general public to take action against trafficking. Non-governmental organi - zations and Governments are key partners in this effort to combat human trafficking and play an important role in providing support to victims and in raising awareness about the issue at the lo cal level. UNODC is working clos ely with United Nations entities and local non-governmental organization partners distributing the new public service announcements to add at the end of each spot a telephone hotline\u2014where one is available\u2014where victims will be able to receive assistance and support.440 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons While the first and second video spots chiefly target potential victims in States of origin, the third and fourth s pots target fem ale victims and the general publ ic in destination States. All four spots also target Gov ernment officials involved in developing and implementing anti-trafficking and victim protection legislati on. To view the video spots, visit: www.unodc.org/ unodc/en/multimedia.htm l i These and other video spots can a lso be viewed at: http://ungif t.org/ i \"Open Your Eyes\" poster ca mpaign (Pe ntameter 2, United Kingdom) In the United Kingdom, as part of the police-led Pen tameter 2 operation, an active \"Don 't close your eyes to human trafficking\" campaign has been initiated to raise public awareness about traffickin g and empower peo ple to report concerns to the police. P osters are being distributed by the police and other Pen tameter 2 partners across the United Kingdom. In the first phase of t he operation\u2014Pe ntameter 1\u2014targeted awareness-rais ing measures were also taken. Leaflets were produced and distributed at airports to raise awareness among men travelling to the World Cup in a bid to reduce demand for pai d sex (which could poten - tially involve the use of traffick ed victims) and the official En gland fanzine was also used as a medium to raise awareness of trafficking in persons.

S ave the Children India has harnessed Indian film celebrities as ambas- sadors in the fight against trafficking in persons . Based on actual case studies in Nepal, a two-hour documentary fil m Chameli, directed by Nepali filmmaker Ravi Baral, was produced to inform local communities about the reality of trafficking in girls an d to challenge the Government to confront thi s issue. According to Baral, the film pro vides the international community and many village girls and women, who are vulnerable to being sold into prostitu tion, with insight into the reality of trafficking. The message of the film is clear: prostitution is ugly and trafficking of girls and 441 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons women should be stopped. The first phase of the campai gn culminated in a n ational-level consultation to stren gthen bonds and lay the foundation for a more acti ve network spanning India. \"Human Trafficking i n the 21st Century \" poster competition (IOM Ru ssian Fede ration) As part of an European Union-fund ed information campaign on preven tion of human trafficking in the Russian Federation, a poster contest i s being held to raise awaren ess, parti - cularly among young people, of human tra fficking in the Russian Federation and empha - size its dangers. In each of the three project areas (the Moscow region, the Republi c of Karelia and the Astrakhan region), an official jury will select the three most creati ve entries and the winners will be awa rded monetary prizes. The three winners from each of the three regions will enter into a fi nal round selection. Monetary prizes wil l be awarded to the top three entrants and the winner's poster will be printed an d distributed during IOM i nforma - tional campaigns on prevention of human trafficking in the Russian Federation. Exhibitions of the best contest entries will be organized by the participating regions. Meena Communication Initia tive (Regional Office for South Asia of the United Nation s Children's Fund) UNICEF developed the Meena Communi cation Initiative as a mass commun ication project aimed at chan ging perceptions and behaviour that hamper the survi val, protection and development of girls in South Asi a. Meena is a brave, spirited nine-year-old cartoon character from South As ia. Meena is widely recognized in South Asian countries. Her name i s one that is culturally suitable throughout the region and the characters who su rround her in her quests to tackle issues that affect children have all been researched extensively. Meena's adve ntures take her through issues of education, health, gender equality, freedom from exploitation and abuse. In her adve n - tures, she has tackled issues such as stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS, has helped her cou sin avoid marriage before the legal age, saved a baby from diarrhoea and found a way to stay in school. Among the range of Meena comi c books and films is one aimed at raisi ng aware - ness about trafficking and sexual exploitation of girls, entitled The Girls Came Back . Meena has been incorporated in the school curricu la of Bangladesh and, along with her brother Raju, she is an Ambassador for Child ren's Rights in Pakistan. In India, Meena features on State-owned radio and television channels and Meena Cabinets of school-aged girls are being established throughout the country. In Nepal, Meena is used to initiate dis- cussion on development , health and gender issues. In Bhutan, Meena p ostage stamps and posters have been developed in collaboration with Bhutan Post. Chil d rights education and mine risk educat ion programmes in Sri Lanka use Meena as a role model for children.For further information, see: http://no2slavery.ru/eng/poster_conte st/ i442 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons Television episo des of Meena have also been ai red in Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam, dubbed in to local languages. Awarenes s-raising i n Burk ina Faso (UNOD C Regiona l Office for West a nd Central Africa) As part of the implemen tation of a project entitled \"Measu res to prevent and combat trafficking in human beings in the Western African su bregion\", local -level awareness-rais ing campaigns were carried out in September and October 2006 in 16 provinces of Burkina Faso. Pep-talks, radio spots and theatre forums were used to sensitize local populations to the issue of tra fficking in persons and the methodology of crimi nal networks. The mess ages touched on the issues of the national l egal framework, the impact of human traffickin g on victims and their families, health and psychological issues, and the notion of \"exploitation\". /L50539Pep-talks: 100 pep-talks were organized in the 16 provinces, during which audi ence mem - bers could ask questions of facilitators on trafficki ng issues. The Direction de la prote c - tion de l'enfant et de l'adolescent (DPEA) reported that 6,839 people participated in this activity /L50539Radio spots: fourteen radio shows were organized in 10 provinces in three languages, to disseminate information on trafficking. DPEA estimated that these radio spots reached 800,000 people /L50539Theatre forums: theatre performances c onsisting of a play describing the traffickin g situa - tion, followed by discussions between faci litators and audience members, were organized in 16 provinces. DPEA reported that 4,35 4 persons attended these theatre events. Awarenes s-raising i n Colo mbia (United Nations Offic e on D rugs a nd Crime, Colombia) The UN 21 Awards were established by the then Secretary-Ge neral of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, in 199 6 to provide recognition to staff members for innovati on, efficiency and excellence in the delivery o f the Organization's programmes and services. UNODC Colombia received a UN 21 commendation for its anti-human trafficking activities in 2006, which included helping Colombian t elevision to produce a prime-time televisi on soap opera about human trafficking. The soap opera was seen nightly by millions of viewers and sensitized them to the methods used by traffickers, and where victims cou ld seek help. Awarenes s-raising i n the Up per Mek ong subregio n (United Nations Ed ucational, Scienti fic and Cultural Organizati on, Bangkok) UNESCO has developed the following method ology for producing radio programmes i n minority languages to educate target audi ences on issues of HIV/AIDS, drugs and human trafficking.

Soap operas are generally well known and liked by the audien ce. This form of commu nication tends to be better accepted by teenagers and youths who would rej ect traditional pedagogic methods. 2.The content of the programme is based on actual experience. Real-life stories are collected through participato ry group discussion (focus groups) at the vill age level and integrated into the script so that the listeners can identify with the s oap opera characters. 3.The script is composed directly i n the selected minority language by local minority writers to ensure it is culturally as well as linguistically acceptable to the audience. 4.The script is translated into En glish and into the national language to check its scientific accuracy. 5.Local musicians compose traditional local music and songs in the minority language which und erline the themes of the story. 6.The programme is t ested in order to verify that an appropri ate and efficient message is conveyed. 7.The programme is broadcast. 8.Selective follow-up audience research is conducted in villages to evaluate how appropriate the broadcasting timing is, as well as the understanding of the programme and the impact of the message. 9.The script, tapes and related output of the programmes are pack aged and distributed for further pedagogical and educational use and future rebroadcasting. 10.The programme is prop osed to radio stations in other countries of the regi on where the minority is present. The script and format may be adapted to suit the needs of the radio station or local community. An example of the awareness-raising work of UNESCO using this methodol ogy is the drama \"Life of tragedies\", written in the Jingpo language, which won first prize at the fifth Provincial Literary and Artistic Crea tion Awards held in Yunnan, China. This radio drama was written by a renowned Jingpo author, Yue Jian. Financial support for this programme was provided to UNESCO by the Asian Devel opment Bank. \" Life of tragedies\" was both broad - cast on radio and distributed on cassette and CD. Another radi o drama \"The sight of the snow mountain\", in the Naxi language, addresses the issues of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. In conjunction with its radio programme work, UNESCO (in cooperation with the New Life Centre Fou ndation in Chiang Mai, Thai land) has also produced an album of popular Lahu songs addressing issues of HIV/AIDS and human traffi cking, sung by Lahu singers popular in T hailand and Myan mar.

Various actions are vital to contain the risk of children becoming victims of traffickin g: 1.Conduct a rapid assessment of the s ituation of children. Within the appro - priate mechanisms, monitor, advocate agains t, report and communicate on severe an d systematic abuse , violence and exploitati on. 2.Assist to prevent the separation of children from caregivers and facilitate the identification, registration and medical screening of separated chi ldren, particularly those under five years of age and adolescent girls. Governmen ts should identify officers in charge of child protection in all maj or hospitals admitting child patients and in temporary camps. 3.Ensure that family-tracing systems are i mplemented, with appropriate care and protection facilities. 4.Interim care must be provided to separated children until they are reunited with their families, placed in foster care, or other lon g-term care arrangements have Tool 9.11 Rapid response: prevention during emergencies Overview This tool offers guidance on pr otecting vulnerable people from traffickin g during crises, such as conflic t or natur al disaster. 454 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons been made. Interim care should be c onsistent with the aim of fami ly reunification, balanced with a bes t interests assessment, an d should ensure child ren's protection and well-being. 5.Promote the child's recovery by providing psychosoci al support to strengthen resilience, as well as meeting basic needs. 6.Establish procedures to ensure that children who are travelli ng during emer- gencies are with their parents or other primary caregivers. The Government can put a temporary moratorium on the a doption of children until all children can be properly identified and the process of family tracing is completed. The international standard in a crisis is to k eep children as close to their family members and community as poss ible. Staying with relatives in extend ed family units is generally a better solution than uprooting the child completely. Child trafficking, sexual exploitation and extreme forms of child labour may be nothing n ew in the region affected by disaster and/or con flict. But the breakdown of institutions leaves an opening for unscrupulous and criminal expl oitation of the most vulnerable. A quick response must be made by Govern ments to this threat in order to provide that protection.

Action plans to reduce the likelihood of chil d trafficking need to be immediately implemented. UNICEF recommen ded the following five steps in response to the tsunami crisis: 1.Register all displaced chi ldren . Identify those who are unaccompanied, separated from their parents or caregivers or pos sibly orphaned, and know their exact location. 2.Provide immediate safe care . Children identified as unaccompanied or s eparated must be placed in the temporary care of adults who are accountabl e for the children's welfare. Their care and protection shoul d be carefully monitored so they are not susceptible to further risk. 3.Locate relatives. Trace and reunite family members who have been separated during the chaos. 455 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons 4.Alert police and other authorities . It is essential to educate police, border patrols, teachers, health workers and ot hers to the threat of chi ld exploitation and to enlist their support in protecting children. 5.Take special national measures. Temporary restri ctions on child ren's movement may be necessary to thwart trafficking that could occur under the radar.

In response, it imposed a moratorium on i nternational adop - tion of children from Aceh. Childre n under 16 were not allowed to l eave the country with - out a parent. Surveillance w as increased at airports and seaports in North Sumatra and Aceh until all children were properly identifi ed and family tracing could be u ndertaken. The Government of Indonesia acted quickly to alert non-governmental organization partners in affected countries , warning them of the potential for trafficking of vulnerable children and asking them to diffuse this alert among relief worke rs and other relevant partners in Asia. Counter-traffick ing response of t he Internatio nal Organization for Migration to the tsunami in Aceh, I ndonesia IOM engaged the help of Rafly, Ac eh's best-known musician, to help rais e awareness about the dangers of h uman trafficking as part of a mas s information c ampaign linked to Ramadan. Rafly produced public service announcements that were broadcast i n both Bahasa In donesia and Bahasa Aceh up to 35 times a day over two months , through seven radio stations. Additionally, IOM and Himpunan Ul ama Dayah (Union of the Heads of Islamic Boarding Schools) developed scripts for Koranic monologues, read by religious leaders on rad io, discussing safe migration, the risk of human trafficking and preventive measures from an Islamic perspect ive. Counter-traffick ing response of t he Internatio nal Organization for Migration to the tsunami in Nias, In donesia Nias is a predominantly Christian island off the coast of North Sumatra in Indonesia. IOM,in collaboration with the Centre for Study and Child Protection (PKPA), a non -governmental organization, designed information campaign materials, including stick ers, leaflets, posters and radio public-service announcements, appropriate to the culture of Nias. Furthermore, IOM in collaboration with PKPA organized a workshop on mappin g human trafficking in Nias. The workshop was attended by commun ity and religious leaders as well as Governmen t officials and repre sentatives of civil society orga nizations. The workshop identified trafficking 456 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons issues specific to Nias and selected agen cies to act as the clearing-house for trafficki ng- related information, provide referrals when assi stance was needed and formulate a plan of action to combat trafficking on the island. United Nations Offic e on Dru gs and Crime, Lebanon In Lebanon there are more t han 300,000 domestic workers originating from Asia and Africa, primarily Sri Lanka , Ethiopia and the Philippines. Eve n prior to the conflict in 200 6 there were clear indications t hat many domestic workers were t he victims of exploitation, cri mi- nal networks and human trafficking. As a result of the humanitarian cris is in Lebanon, many domestic workers ran away or we re left behind by their employers, leaving them more vulnerable to trafficking. It is estimated that after the c onflict some 24,000 domestic workers were evacu ated. Through its technical coopera tion project \"Measures to prevent and combat traffickin g in Lebanon\", UNODC supported an aware ness campaign targeting in particular domestic workers from Sri Lanka, Ethiopia and the Philippines to inform them about the ri sks of human trafficking. In close cooperat ion with the Government of Lebanon and the n on- governmental organization Caritas Migrant Center (which operates a helpline for trafficking victims), UNODC prepared awaren ess-raising materials to distribute to shelters, embass ies, churches, shops and markets. The text for the awareness campaign was prepared in coordination with a local focus group and translated into three la nguages. Rathe r than using posters and leaflets, the message and hotline numbers were printed on bloc-not es which targeted beneficiaries were easil y able to take with them. Through the UNODC juvenile justice project, young delinquents in a Beirut prison were involved in the finalization of the material, illustrating a positive example of synergies between proj ects. Tool 9.12 Defining the concept of demand Overview This tool considers what \"dem and\" means with respect to human trafficking. DISCOURAGING DEMAND What do we mean when we talk about dema nd in relation to t rafficking? Trafficking can be d ealt with from both the d emand and supply sides. It is important to prevent trafficking but also to discourage the demand that fos ters all forms of exploitation 457 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons of persons that leads to human trafficki ng. Destination States should examine the factors that make them attractive for human trafficking and address these factors in a multifaceted way. There is no agreed de finition of the term \"d emand\". It usually refers to the desire for a particular commodity, labour or service, but in the context of human trafficking, the deman d is for labour that is exploitative o r services which breach the human rights of the person delivering those services. In practice, it is often difficult to differentiate between demand for labour and services which are legal and acceptable (an d a natural element of producti ve markets) an d those that are not. The employer of labour or t he consumer of services may not be aw are that the labour or services are being provided by a person who has been trafficked. This means that a nalysis of demand for tra fficked persons is best undertaken in the con - text of a wider analysis of certain types of l abour or services, in which trafficked persons could be exploited. Evidence indicates three levels of demand related to human trafficking: /L50539Employer demand (employers, owners, ma nagers or subcontractors) /L50539Consumer demand clients (in the sex industry), corporate buyers (in manufacturing), household members (in domestic work) /L50539Third parties involved in the process (recruiters, agents, transporters and others who participate knowingly in the movement of persons for the purpose s of exploitation) The \"demand side\" of trafficking gene rally refers to the nature and extent of the exploita - tion of the trafficked persons after their arrival at the point of destination, as well as the social, cultural, political, econ omic, legal and developmental factors that shape the demand and facilitate the trafficking process.

Annexed to the Declaration are \"Recommendations, standards and best practices\". In this annex, under the head ing \"Prevention of traffickin g in human beings\", section 7, Root causes, states that: It should be an essent ial and common goal for the fi ght against trafficki ng to address the reduction of the demand for sexual services and cheap labour. This includes459 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons education to equal and respectful relationships between sexes, an d awareness campaigns especially targeting client s. Section 8, Research, states that: A crucial component in the comprehen sive counter-trafficking response will be the further research and analysis of the \"deman d\" side of the traffi cking process and an examination of methods by whic h the demand of clients can be effectively reduced. Section 10, Awareness-raisin g, states that: Awareness-raising campaigns aiming at the \"demand\" si de of the traffickin g process should be developed as part of a comprehensive proces s of reducing trafficking effectively.

After years of campaign - ing by Governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations, a particularly innovative approach to curtail demand emerged in 2005. In light of l egislation banning the use of young boys, camel owners started using remot e-control operated robots of comparable size to the young boys formerly used.

In 2006 , a regulation was issued requiring State financial institutions to bar financial services to enti - ties listed in the Ministry of Labour's \"dirty list\", which con tains the names of persons and companies documented as users of forced l abour. Croatia The Criminal Code of Croatia was amended in October 2004 to criminalize trafficking, the definition of which goes beyond that provid ed in the Trafficking in Persons Protocol to not only penalize traffickers, but also client s of trafficked persons if the cli ents knew the persons had been trafficked. 462 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons Recommended resources It is known tha t thousands of tourists and businessmen who travel i nternationally engage in sex, including with chil dren, or make pornographic material . In general, sex tours are arranged informal ly among friend s or colleagues; however, there have been cases of travel agents being prosecuted for supplying and arranging sex tours. In addition, buyers who travel to other countries to have sex with women or children often feel protected by a sense of anonymity and rationalize their behaviour in various ways to mitigate the sense of respon - sibility they may normally have in their home countries. They often justify their behaviour by claiming th at it is culturally acceptable in that country or that they are helping the person by provi ding some money. S ome of those who s eek sex with a child mis takenly believe that they are less likely to contra ct HIV/AIDS. M uch of the effort to combat child prostitution in developing countries concentrates on abuses committed by foreigners, for two reasons: the economic and social power of the foreign exploiter far exceeds that of the chi ld; and the foreign exploiter can easily leave and avoid prosecution. Tool 9.13 Commercial sexual exploitation of children Overview This tool looks at legislative an d other measures, such as ethic al guidelines an d cam - paigns, that can be im plemented in order to discourage the d emand for trafficked persons by addressing the problem of sexual exploitation. Demand Side of Hum an Trafficking in Asia: E mpirical Findings (ILO, 2006), available at: i The Mekong i463 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons In response to the latter situat ion, many States have resorted to an extraterritorial juris - diction over offences relating to the sexual exploitation of chi ldren committed by their nationals in other countries. For more information visit: www.humantrafficking.org i Promising p ractice Legislati on Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Un ited States) Under the Crime Act it is illegal for United States citizens to travel abroad with intent to engage in any sexual act with a person under 18 years of age. The penalty for doin g so is imprisonment for up to 10 years, a fine, or both. However, inten t is hard to prove and to prosecute in this regard. Sex Offenders Act (United Kingdom) The United Kingdom Sex Offe nders Act was pass ed in 1997 and makes sexual activity with a child, committed in an overseas country by a citizen or resident of the United Kingdom, a criminal offence punishable in the United Kingdom. It is also an offence to plan to travel overseas for sex with children. Crimestoppers hotline (United Kingdom) The United Kingdom Home Office provid es a free \"Crimestoppers\" hotl ine for use by British tourists in Gambia to report child abuse abroad. Awareness-raising information about child prostitution was distributed to tourists by travel companies, informing tourists what to be alert to. House Bill 2020/Act 82 (Hawaii, United States) The Hawaii state legislature passed Hous e Bill 2020 into law as Act 82 in May 200 4, making the promotion of travel for the purpose of prostitution a fel ony and ground s for revoking the licence of an offending travel agent.

This Act criminalizes in Australia any sexual activity with a child under the age of 16 years com - mitted in an overseas country by an Australian citizen or Austral ian resident. This law applies to individuals, companies or corporations and provides for a term of impris onment of up to 17 years and fines of up to 500,000 Australian dollars. The Act also makes it an offence to encourage, benefit or profit from any activi ty that promotes s exual activity with children.

The code originated from an ECPAT project, funded by UNICEF and supported by the Wo rld Tourism Organ ization. The tour operators and their umbrell a organizations, travel agents, hotels, airlines, etc., that endorse the Code commit themselves to implementi ng the following measures: 1.To establish an ethical policy regardi ng commercial sexual exploitation of child ren 2.To train the person nel in the coun try of origin and travel destinations 3.To introduce a clause in contracts with suppliers, sta ting a common repudia tion of commercial sexual expl oitation of children 4.To provide information to travellers by means of catalogues, brochures, in-flight films, ticket-slips, home pages etc. 5.To provide information to local \"key persons\" at the destinations 6.To report annually The Code and furthe r informat ion about it ar e available at: www.thecode.org i465 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons Regional Commitment and Action Pl an of the East Asia and Pacific Reg ion against Commer cial Sexual Exploitation of Children Representatives of 25 Govern ments, in cooperation with United Nations agencies, interna - tional organizations, non-governmental organizations and re presentatives of young people, meeting at the East Asia and Pacific Regional Consultation held from 16 to 18 October 2001 in Bangko k in preparation fo r the Second Worl d Congress against Commerci al Sexual Exploitation of Children, committed the mselves to taking action against the commercial sexual exploitation of child ren, including trafficking of children, in the areas of: children/ young people's participation; co ordination and cooperation; prevention ; protection; and recovery and reintegration.

ECPAT International is a network of organizations and individuals working to elimi - nate the commercial sexu al exploitation of children. L ocal campaigns highlightin g extra - territorial jurisdiction and warning that engagi ng in sex with minors is a criminal offence have been successful in many Western c ountries. In Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Asia, ECPAT has succeeded in gettin g airlines and travel agents to post signs in airports warning people that engagin g in sex with minors is illegal and to distribute fl iers about the brutal nature of the trade. ECPAT Internationa l has special consulta tive status with the Economic and Social Council. Every year, ECPAT Intern ational collaborates with other n on-governmental organ izations, governments and UNICEF to organize a Worl d Congress against the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Ad olescents.

The project has a three-pronged strategy: 1.A deterrent media campaign for wou ld-be child-sex tourists in Cambodia, Costa Rica, Thailand and the United States 2.Law enforcement assistance in order to hel p identify child-sex tourists 3.Prevention programmes through inte rventions such as education, advocacy and creation of other means to make a living More information about the ChildSafe pr ogramme is available at: an non-governmental organization-operated campaign in Cambodia which brings various actors to the fight agai nst sexual exploitation of chil dren. By eliciting the he lp of taxi, tuk-tuk and motorcycle taxi drivers, staff of hotels, guesthouses and restaurants, and tourists in Cambodi a, ChildSafe creates a n etwork of key people who receive on going train - ing in child protection. These persons are able to identify children at risk and suspi cious behaviour of tourists in Cambodia so that appropriate action can be taken.

However, con - sideration is rarely given to who tr affickers were before they became traffickers and the factors that led them there. For instance, the fa ct that some traffickers were former vi ctims themselves may be indica - tive that the factors that make peopl e vulnerable to being traffic ked (see Tool 9.2 and Tool9.3) may also make people vuln erable to becoming traffickers. This, in turn, points to the need for reintegration programme s to take into account that breaking the cycle of trafficking requires not on ly preventing victims from being retraffi cked but also preventing victims from becoming t raffickers themse lves (for more on rein tegration generall y, see Chapter 7). These lacunae in both kn owledge about trafficking and responses to it highl ight the need to prioritize research and da ta collection. Currentl y, information about traffickers\u2014who they are and how they operate\u2014is in adequate to target tai lored responses effectively to prevent them from committing t heir crimes. D etailed data must therefore be collected to strengthen and tailor interventions targeted a t traffickers and potential traffickers. For some promising examples of efforts to profile trafficke rs and collect relevant data, please see Tool 9.15. Identifying and profiling traffickers Crime Re duction Tool kit on traffic king of people (United Kingdom) When available, multi-agency-agree d profiles of traffickers are useful . Immigration and poli ce officers can benefit from acce ss to such profiles for the purpose of entry and exi t point detection. In addition to profiles of victims and potential victims, it is useful for there to be profiles of: /L50539The modus operandi of traffickers /L50539Traffickers and their accomplices In achieving such profiles, local intelligence should be recorded and shared with other agen - cies and, where appropriate, communicated to national agencies. At the point of interception, many potential victims have only been subjected to dec eption rather than any form of co ercion, and may therefore be un aware that they are at risk of being exploited at the poin t of entering another country. However, the fact that they are travelling with a known trafficker may mean that they are able to provi de useful intelligence. Tool 9.14 Proactive prevention strategies: targeting traffickers Overview This tool showcases effort s which have been und ertaken to profi le and deter potential and actual tr affickers from ex ploiting other people. 469 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons There may be opportunities for the police to interc ept traffickers and victims exiting the country, as well as upon their entry. Profiles and databases for identifying traffickers and victims are equally applicable.

This report provides details on the gender and national ity of traffickers to facilitate the formulation of prevention s trategies targeting traffick ers. The Office registered 664 suspects, 77 per cent of whom were male. About 43 per cent of the traffickers were German n ationals; 52 per cent had different nationalities at birth (including Romanian , Polish and Bul garian\u2014countries whi ch are also countries of origin) . Knowing the nationality of traffickers and having information abou t their nationality at birth could assist in the development of preventi on measures targeting potential traffickers.

The Public Enlightenment Departmen t of the Agency, with the s upport of IOM and USAID, has pro - duced posters which displ ay this message ( and another directed at traffi ckers and exploiters of children which reads \"Children are not created to be slaves\u2014don't treat them like slaves\").

The main focus of the Organisation has been to work wit h sex workers and their clients, to prevent the trans - mission of sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV) among high-ris k populations and to prevent the sexual exploitation of children. In 2007, on the International Day again st Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (26 June), the Indian Community Welfare Organisation held an event to en courage pimps and brokers to cease their involvemen t in trafficking in persons . On this occasion, 10 female pi mps and brokers symbolically burned their records of clients, sex workers and people vulnerable to being exploited, as a testament of the ir commitmen t to stop trafficking. The pimps and brokers participating in the programme took an oath to affirm this commitment.

Research, analysis, evaluation and dissemination Effective and realistic anti-trafficking strategi es must be based on accurate and current infor - mation, experience and analysis. It is essential that all parties involved in developing and implementing these strategies have and maintain a clear understanding of the issues. The media has an important role to play in increasing public understanding of the trafficking phenomenon by providing accurate i nformation in accordance with profes sional ethical standards. States and, where appropri ate, intergovernmen tal and non-governmental organi zations, should consider: 1.Adopting and consistently using the internationally agreed definition of trafficking contained in the Palermo Prot ocol. 2.Standardizing the collect ion of statistical information on trafficking and related movements (suc h as migrant smuggli ng) that may include a trafficking element. 3.Ensuring that data concerning indi viduals who are trafficked is disag gregated on the basis of age, gender, ethnicity and other rel evant characteristics. 4.Undertaking, supporting and bringing t ogether research into trafficking. Such research should be firmly grounded in ethical prin ciples, including an understand - ing of the need not to re-traumatize tra fficked persons. Research met hodologies and interpretative techniques should be of the highest qual ity. 5.Monitoring and evaluating the relationship between the intention of anti-traffickin g laws, policies and in terventions, and their real impact. In particular, ensuring that distinctions are made between measures which actu ally reduce trafficki ng and measures which may have the effect of transferring the probl em from one pl ace or group to another. 6.Recognizing the important contribution that survivors of trafficking can, on a strictly voluntary basis, make to deve loping and implementing anti-trafficking interventions and evaluating their impact. 7.Recognizing the central role that non-governmen tal organizations can play in improv - ing the law enforcement response to trafficking by providing relevant authorities with information on trafficking incidents and pattern s taking into account the need to preserve the privacy of trafficked pers ons.

These could be used, with minor modi fi cations based on situational and cultural variables of the S tate under study, i n all anti- trafficking technical cooperation project s. The research in struments are as follows. Victim survey The survey instrument used with victims of trafficking compris ed 49 questions and addressed the following topics: /L50539Personal and demographic profile (gender and age) /L50539Recruitment practices /L50539Costs of being smuggled and debts incurred in the process of recruitment and departure /L50539Routes and exp eriences during travel /L50539Exploitation in the d estination State /L50539Involvement of organized criminal groups and networks /L50539Connivance and corruption of Governmen t officials /L50539Victim reporting practices /L50539Victim assessment o f Government measures to fight trafficking Non-governmental organiz ation survey The non-governmenta l organization s urvey included questions concerning the following issues: /L50539Organizational and operational profile /L50539Clients and/or beneficiaries /L50539Extent of the non-governmental organization's work w ith as well as assistance to tr afficked victims and smugg led persons /L50539Services most needed by trafficked victims /L50539Coordination with Government agencies as well as with other non-governmental organizations Criminal justice experts survey Two variations of this survey were deve loped: one for the State of origi n and one for des - tination States. It was felt that law e nforcement and criminal jus tice experts in the State of origin might have more insight into re cruitment practices, whereas their counterparts in destination States might be able to provide more information on the exploitative practices. Thus, there are minor differences in these two research instruments. However, an attempt was made to have as mu ch overlap as poss ible between the two questionnaires. The criminal jus tice experts su rvey covered the foll owing topics:473 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons /L50539General data on traffickin g cases /L50539Travel routes and experiences /L50539Coercion, deception and /L50539Other criminal practices /L50539Criminal earnings /L50539Involvement of transn ational organized criminal groups /L50539Law enforcement and criminal justice responses /L50539Connivance and corruption of Governmen t officials Checklist for the analysis of case files The checklist mirrors the categories and variables contained in the other res earch instru - ments.

Sample questionnaires used to collect data are also provided in the report. What is data? The report states: \"Data is the basis of information. Informati on is the basis of knowledge\". In assessing the type of data that needs to be collected, the following must be considered: /L50539What knowledge do you need? /L50539What information will help you obtain that knowl edge? /L50539What data will help give you that information? Information objectives of data collection on trafficking In the context of trafficking in ASEAN member States, the report clari fies that member States need data whi ch will help them work out how to prevent traffi cking, prosecute offenders and protect victims, an d measure their efforts in doing so. Data collection principles The report sets out and discusses the following data collection principles: Principle 1 To be useful, data has to be relevant to your objectives It is important to define objectives before undertaking data col lection. Data is relevant if it provides Governments with in formation on how to me et the objecti ves of prevention, protection and prosecution, and if it helps to measure whether anti-traffi cking efforts are having the intended effect (evaluation). Principle 2 Data needs to be regular and reliable Data needs to be collected and reported on a regular basis, to allow for tracking of changes over time. Data needs to be reliable; it must be accura te and precise, and the m ethodology for collection must be clearly explained and defendable. Principle 3 Data must be protect ed Data must be property protected, with clear policies and procedures that bal ance the inter- ests of law enforcement with the need to ensure privacy, confidentiality and the personal safety of individuals. Anonymous, non-personal data is generally sufficient for policymaking purposes. Specific, personal data may be re quired for operational reasons . Access to this data should be subject to strict controls. Principle 4 Data must be turned into information and knowledge This involves implementi ng an appropriat ely designed and maintained information system at the agency level an d/or at the national level. Information systems are not j ust computer- ized databases or spreadsheets; they require hardware, software , people and clearly defined data \"fields\". Information systems involve many steps, from identifying information needs and relevant data, t o turning that data into i nformation that is useful information for managers. Informat ion systems have to be properly designed, implemented and maintained. Information systems must be sustainable. 475 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons Promising pr actice For related promisin g practice concern ing profiling of traffickers, see Tool 9.14. Trafficking in Persons: Global Patt erns (United Nations O ffice on Drugs an d Crime) In April 2006, UNO DC published a report on global trafficking patterns. The methodol - ogy used to collect the data compiled in this report was c ontent analysis, which involves the systematic study, analysis and selective cl assification of the content of open source pub - lications. Content analysis schemes are highly reliable: a different res earch group, using the scoring system and instructi ons assigned for the d ata collected, should be able to come up with the same categorization s, since the results achieved by the methodology are based on objective elements and not on perceptions, opinions or evaluations. The basic procedure i n content analysis consists of: /L50539Selection of categories and subje ct to be analysed /L50539Rigorous establishment of criteria for inclusion, a featu re which ensures that the study can be replicated by others /L50539Carefully followi ng the pre-established clas sification scheme /L50539Statistically analysing the results Prior to publication of the report, the met hodology applied was reviewed and evaluated positively by a panel of independent experts. In 2002, the Global Programme against Trafficking established a trafficking database on flows of trafficking in persons.

A core activity of Frontex is carrying out risk analysis: assessing threats, looking at vulnerabilities and weighing consequences. Among its tailored risk analyses are assessments of migration flows from Africa into Europe, including trafficking in persons. The bene fit of conducting s uch tailored risk analyses is that it will facilitate in designin g joint operation s at European Union borders to disrupt the flow of trafficking into the Union. More information about the work of Front ex is available at: www.frontex. europa.eu i Strategi c Information Res ponse Network The Strategic Information Response Network is an initiative supported by UNIAP that is intended to deliver high quality, responsive and up-to-date data and analysis on cutting edge issues relating to trafficking in persons in the Greater Mekong su bregion. The Network is intended to inform and enco urage action by key govern mental and non-governmental anti-trafficking stakeholders and to convey information to them i n various forms, from brief reports, maps and d ata sheets, to discussion forums and debates. Research, validation and analysis is conducted in the field by communi ty-based organizations, national and international agencies and/or UNIAP itself. As secretariat to COMMIT, UNIAP is mandated by paragraph 29 of the memorandum of understanding on COMMIT, sign ed by the Governments of the subregion to develop \"procedures for the collection a nd analysis of data and information on trafficki ng cases\" and to ensure that \"ant i-trafficking strategies are based on accurate and current research, experience and analysis\" . The Strategic Information Respons e Network is intended to fulfil that mandate.477 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons More information about the work of the Strategic Information Response Network is available at: www.no-trafficking.org i In addition to the key role in aw areness raising that the med ia must play to prevent trafficking (see Tool 9 .8 to Tool 9.11), there are several other special functions that they can perform. The media are indispensable in educating people about the many man ifesta - tions of trafficking in persons. Furthermore, they have a respons ibility to ensure that, by taking a careful and i nformed approach to acceptance of advertisements, their outlets do not inadvertently assist traffickers to exploit people. Awareness-raising role of the media The media have a large role to play in mobilizing public support an d involvement to help prevent and combat trafficking. Owing to their reach and their ability to mould public opin - ion, they are a powerful tool of social change. Investigative journalism on trafficking needs to be promoted. By writing an article or broadcasting an item focusing on trafficking in per- sons, the media not only educate the public but also shine light on an issue typically shrouded in darkness. Res ponsible scrutiny by international med ia can be the difference between a trafficker being released or imprisoned. However, in some parts of the world, journ alists and media outlets are not adequately aware of the trafficking phenomenon or do not have sufficient u nderstanding of the dimensions of the problem. As a result, some media coverage confuses the issue with others, such as migrant smuggling. Media pub licity should take into considerati on the rights-based approach and ensure that there is no violation of the ri ghts of victims and survivors. Tool 9.16 The role of the media in preventing trafficki ng Overview This tool examines the role and respons ibility of the media in prev enting traffickin g both by virtue of the in formation investig ative journalists m ay come across in their work and through a cautious appr oach to accepting advertisements. When printing or broadcasting news on trafficking, loc al anti- trafficking helpline number s and other sources of assistanc e for potential victims and members of the com munity should a lso be provided. !478 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons Media Dos a nd Do n'ts Protection of victims is at the heart of all anti-trafficking measures. Journalists, photo graphers and media outlets must protect potent ial and actual victims (an d third persons) by altering the image, personal story and identity. Tell the truth Don't treat survivors as objects Be accurate, obj ective and fair Don't take photos of victims Use masking t echniques to avoid Don't ask questions that violate the revealing the identities of victims and dignity of survivors (How many times their families were you raped? How many clients did you service each day?) Delve into the rea sons behind Don't distort or blur facts to trafficking sensationalize s tories Visit source areas to understand the Don't use tabloid-like or sensational complexities of the root causes headlines Be investigative.

To ensure that media outlets are not a conduit for the exploitat ion of people, media outlets should: /L50539Provide trafficking hotlines alongsid e adult classified listings /L50539Cooperate with police in investigations where they are able /L50539Accept payments for classified advertisements only by cheque or credit card so that advertisers can be trac ed in the event that inves tigations are mounted The awareness-raisin g role of the media is related to the role that the public can play in reporting trafficking.

Promising p ractice The Newspa per Society (United Kin gdom) The Newspaper Society represents 1 ,300 newspapers, 1,100 websites, 750 magazines, 36 radio stations and two t elevision stations in the United Kingdom. On 1 November 200 7, The Newspaper Society issue d a statement concerning cooperati on with the Minister for Women and Equality of the United Kingdom in combating traff icking in persons. The state - ment is primarily concerned with advertisements which can fuel demand for traffi cked women. The meeting which lead to this joint action agains t trafficking was attended by the Minister for Women and Equality, a Home Office Minister, the Minister for Culture, Creative Industries and Tourism, the Sol icitor General a nd representatives of The Newspaper Society, the Advertising S tandards Authority, the Committee of Advertisi ng Practice and t he Advertising Association.480 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons The Minister for W omen and Equality st ated that small advertisements, such as \"new girls every day\" and \"intern ational ladies 24/7\", placed at the back of loc al papers were believed by police to possibly fuel deman d for trafficked women and gi rls. The Home Offi ce Minister said that the Governmen t was committed to strengtheni ng its guidance to l ocal papers on what advertisements to accept, and to exploring a ran ge of other cooperative initia tives. The Director of The Newspaper Society made a pledge to examine the guid ance the Society issued to publishers to ensure that that guidance reflected concerns about trafficking, and to raise those concerns with region al and local newspaper publishers. The Newspaper So ciety also provides legal advice and gui dance to members in the form of \"Ad points to watch\", an A to Z of ad vertising law and adverti sement control advice serv - ices. Such information includes cautions concerning advertisement s which may be disgu is- ing sexual services. An example of a promising measure is one taken by Archant Regional , the newspaper pub - lishing arm of Archant, which publishes four daily ti tles, around 30 weekly paid-for and around 45 weekly free newspape rs totalling a combined weekly circulation of around three million copies. In Suffolk , after five prostitut es were murdered in 2007, Archant Regional decided, in conjunction with the police, to only accept payments by cheque or bank card for adult classified advertisements in order to facil itate investigations.

UNICR I makes three observati ons about the relationshi p between peace support o perations and trafficking in persons: /L50539In contemporary peace support operations, the international c ommunity is the primary (or only) source of law enforcement, making these operations the primary law enforcement authority for combating trafficking /L50539Because peace support operation staff are pai d a high wage i n the context of the local i - ties they serve in, they may knowingl y or unknowingly serve as a primary source of demand for trafficked persons, for example in brothels and for domestic labour /L50539In some cases, members of pe ace support operations have been implicat ed in trafficking. The United Nations is stepping up efforts to address the issue of trafficking and related prostitution in post-conflict zones and recognizes that it must play a key role in combati ng this crime as it relates to al legations and incidents involvi ng its peacekeeping personnel. /L50539Peacekeepers have a duty t o uphold and respect the rights of all members of the host population, particularly women and children, who may be at greater risk of sexual abuse and exploitation. Sexual activity of peacekeepin g personnel with an yone under the age of 18 is prohibited, regardless of consen t. /L50539Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of local populations, including refugees and bene - ficiaries of assistance, are prohibited. Exchanging mon ey, shelter, food or other goods for sex or sexual favours i s sexual exploi tation. /L50539The use of prostitutes by United Na tions personnel in mission areas constitutes exploita - tion and is prohibited. Even where prostitut ion is not a crime, the purchas e of sexual services by United Nations peacekeeping personnel constitutes an act of s exual exploitation. /L50539All members of peacekeeping operations are prohibited from visiting or purchasing sex at off-limit locations such as bars, nightclubs, brothels or hotels where sexual exploi ta - tion and abuse in the form of prostitut ion are present. The presence of a member of a peacekeeping operation in an off-limit l ocation constitutes support for sexual exploitation and con tributes to the profits of organized crime. The establishment of off-limits loc ations in mission areas is the responsibil ity of the head of mission. Managers at all levels are obliged to create an environment that prevents sexual abuse and have a responsibility to support and d evelop systems that maintain this environment. Non-compliance with direct ions to Combat Trafficking Persons Anti-trafficking policy of the Department of P eacekeeping Operations of the United Nations /L50539The Department of Peacek eeping Operations must ensure that peacekeepers are not part of the problem o f human trafficking /L50539The Department of Peacekeeping Operations must identify ways wi thin its mandate to support national structures to combat human trafficki ng All United Nations peacekeeping personne l (military, civili an police and civilians) are required to maintain the highest stand ard of integrity and uphold the same standard of con - duct. Any involvement of peacekeeping personnel in human trafficking or any other form of sexual abuse or exploitation constitu tes an act of serious miscond uct and grounds for disciplinary measures, such as dismissal or repatriation. The possible consequ ences of peacekeeping personnel involvemen t in human rights abuses such as trafficking, beyond the abuse itself, can include: /L50539The credibility of the entire peacekeeping operation being u ndermined /L50539Personnel being expose d to blackmail /L50539Perpetrators, or the entire contingent or mission, being subject to violent retaliation by family membe rs or communities /L50539Where those implicated are also responsi ble for security, military objectives and operational effectiveness can be compromised The United Nations has a policy of zero tolerance for the commission of acts of sexual explo itation and abus e by personnel emplo yed by or affiliated with the United Nations. ! Secretary-General's Bulletin (ST/SGB/2003/13) Special measure s for prote ction fro m sexual exploitation and sexual abuse Section 3 Prohibition of sexual exploitation and sexual abu se 3.1 Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse violate universally recognized international legal norms and standards and have always been unacceptable behaviour and pro - hibited conduct for United Nations staff. Su ch conduct is prohibited by the United Nations Staff Regulation s and Rules. 3.2 In order to further protect the most vul nerable populations, es pecially women and children, the following specifi c standards, which reiterate existing general obliga - tions under the U nited Nations Staff Regulations and Rules, are promulgated: (a) Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse constitute acts of serious misconduct and are therefore grounds for disciplinary measu res, including summary dismissal;483 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons (b) Sexual activity with children (persons un der the age of 18) i s prohibited regardless of the age of majority or age of con sent locally. Mistaken beli ef in the age of a child is not a defence; (c) Exchange of money, employ ment, goods or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour, is prohibited. This i ncludes any exchange of assistance that is due to benefi ciaries of assistance; (d) Sexual relationships between United Nations staff and beneficiaries of assis- tance, since they are based on inherently unequal power dynamics , undermine the credibility and i ntegrity of the work of the United Nations and are strongly discouraged; (e) Where a United Nations staff member devel ops concerns or suspicions regarding sexual exploitation or sexual abuse by a fellow worker, whether in the same agency or not and wheth er or not within the United Nations system, he or she must report such concerns via establi shed reporting me chanisms; (f) United Nations staff are obliged to create and maintain an environment that prevents sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. Managers at all levels have a particular responsibility to support and develop systems that maintain this environment. 3.3 The standards set out above are not intended to be an exhaustive list. Other types of sexually exploitive or sexually abusi ve behaviour may be grou nds for adminis- trative action or disciplinary measures, inclu ding summary dismissal, pursuant to the United Nations Staff Regulations and Rules.

The report Prince Zeid prepared on the issue, en titled \"A compre hensive strategy to elimin ate future sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping operations\" (A/59/710), was submitted to the Ge neral Assembl y in March 2005. The report provided a comprehensive and i nnovative package of reforms, which were debated in the General Assembly in April 2005. This led to the adoption of a two-year package of reforms for peacekeeping on sexual exploitation and abuse (see A/59/19/Rev.1 , Part two and General Assembly resolution 59/300).484 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons This reform package is currently under implemen tation through the Department of Peacekeeping Operations' comprehensive strategy on sexu al exploitation and abuse. \"A comprehensive strategy to eliminat e future sexual exploita tion and abuse in United Nations peace keeping oper ations\" (A/59/71 0) and the package of reform s for peacekeeping on sexual exploita tion and abuse contained in document A/59/19/Rev.1 and General Assembly res olution 59 /300 are availa at: of Peacekeepin g Operations: C omprehensive strategy on sexual exploitation a nd abuse The Department of Peacekeeping Operations' comprehensive stra tegy to address sexual exploitation and abuse comprises: /L50539Measures aimed at prevention of misconduct /L50539Enforcement of United Nations standards of conduct /L50539Remedial action Measures aimed at preventio n of misconduct /L50539Since mid-2005, trai ning on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse is mandatory for all peacekeeping person nel on arrival at a mission /L50539Missions are also improving welfare and recreati on facilities for all categories of peace - keeping personnel using existing r esources, pending the development of a comprehensive strategy in this area, requ ested by the General Assembly.

The reason for this was the increasing problem posed by i nternational prostitution and the trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes. Demand for sexual services forms part of the basis for such traffic. The ethi cal guidelines should be seen in the light of the work being carried out by the Ministry of Justice of Norway on the action plan to prevent trafficking in women and children.487 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons By introducing ethical guidelines for civil servants, the Govern ment seeks to serve as a good example. In this way, the authorities and the Government as employers seek to assume responsibility in principle for preventing people from bei ng degraded as victims of human trafficking for sexual purposes.

The United States Forces Korea developed a programme t hat focuses on increasing awareness, identifying victims, reducing demand and coope rating with local authorities. Since late 2006, patron izing prostitution is a specific, chargeable offence for service members under article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, of the United States military's statutory criminal law. In response to al legations of labour trafficking in Iraq committed by Department of Defense contractors or subcon tractors employin g third-country national workers, safeguards have been implemented, including the mandate that all contractors stop withhold ing employees' passports, that employees be p rovided with a signed copy of their work contract and that contractors and subcontractors be requi red to use certifie d recruiting firms. New regulations also require that contractors provide anti-trafficking training to all employees to ensure compliance wit h United States law and the law of host nations. Anti-trafficking training is mandatory for all United States service personnel. Department of Defense civilians stationed in the United States or abroad an d military pol ice receive specialized trai ning to help them recognize and identify possible trafficking scenarios.

The commission of this crime c an be distinguished from others in terms of the sec - tors from which traffic kers and organ \"broke rs\" derive: doctors and other health-care prac - titioners, ambulance drivers and mortuary workers are often involved in organ trafficki ng in addition to the actors involved in other crimina l trafficking networks. Furthermore, issues of consent and exploitation related to organ removal are complicated by the fact that often vic - tims will consent to the removal of their organs and will receive the agreed payment for them. However, as is commo n in situations of trafficking in pers ons for any exploitative purpose, the provision of the \" service\" is driven by extreme poverty and abuse of vulnerability. Steps towards preventing trafficking in perso ns for the purpose of organ removal /L50539Thus far, there is inadequate information available about trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ remo val. This hails a need for increas ed data collection and research. /L50539The crime of trafficking i n persons for the purpose of organ removal, intersects with the crime of trafficking of organs. Therefore, there must be greater collaboration and co - operation between actors involved in combating organ-re lated crimes, such as health organi zations and survivor support services, and those involved in combating trafficking in persons, such as criminal justice sectors. /L50539Law enforcers are at th e front line for identifying both trafficking victims an d traffickers. Police officers, and customs and border officials should be provided with training that equips them to identify potential and actual victims, and perpetrators of org an trafficking and trafficking for the purpose of organ removal. /L50539As with all measures which go towards combating trafficking in persons, victim protec - tion and assistance are paramount. Support s ervices for survivors of orga n removal shoul d therefore work cooperatively with support se rvices for victims of trafficki ng. Tool 9.19 Trafficking in persons for or gan removal Overview This tool discusses the trafficking o f organs and the trafficking of persons for the purpose of organ removal. The key challenge in reducing the demand for illicitly trafficked organs an d trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal is balancing the interests of organ recipi ents with those o f organ donors. !495 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons Reducing demand Reducing demand for organs necessitates the involvement of a range of actors. Members of the medical and health-care sector must act to ensure that organs are not procu red through financial transactions. Tourist operators must ensure that they do n ot support \"transpl ant tourism\", which exploits economically-desperate peopl e. Tribal, cultural and community leaders must act to make sure that cu ltural and traditional medical practices are not interpreted in a way that is manifested in interference with people's bodily integrity. Fundamental to the need to reduce demand for organs, whi ch fuels their exploitative procurement, is the n eed to: /L50539Reduce the heal th conditions which lead to organ failure /L50539Increase the sup ply of organs donated through c hannels which guard against exploitation by donors who are willing and able to donate their organs Promising pr actice GLOBAL Resolution WHA57/1 8 adopted by the Fif ty-seventh World Health Assembly In its resolution WHA57/18, entitled \"Human organ and tissue transplantation\", adopted on 22 May 2004, the Fifty-seve nth World Health Assembly express ed its concern at \"the growing insufficiency of available human material for transplantation to meet patient needs\". It urged Member States to ext end \"the use of living kidney donations when possible, in addition to donations from d eceased donors\". Mindful of the ri sk this posed to pushing the trade in organs underground, the World He alth Assembly also urged Member States to \"take measures to protect the po orest and most vulnerable groups from 'transplant tourism' and the sale of tissues and organs, including attention to the wider probl em of international trafficking in human tissues and organs \".

That report provides a preliminary overview of the scope and nature of trafficking in human organs, including global trends and an in itial assessment of the degree to which organized criminal groups are involved. Section V of the report discusses the involvemen t of organ - ized criminal grou ps in trafficking in human organs, stating that a clear distinction needs to be made between selling organ s and trafficking in organs, the latter situation bei ng less common than the former. A method used by organized criminal groups to obtain organs is luring people abroad with false promises and convincing or fo rcing them to s ell their organs in order to repay their \"debts\". Recipients of the organs must pay a much highe r price, part of whi ch benefits brokers, surgeons and hospital directors, who have been reported to be involved in the organized criminal network. Paragraph 81 of the report states that \"the extent of the relationshi p between trafficking in organs and trafficki ng in persons (and other forms of organized cri me) is unclear\". It high - lights the link between unemployment, l ack of education and poverty, and vu lnerability to such crimes, and states that while cases of persons trafficked for the purpose of organ removal are not common, some have been reported. 497 chapter 9 Prevention of traffickin g in persons Paragraph 82 states that there is no conclusive evidence regarding the traffickin g of chil- dren for the purpose of organ removal, but that many abd ucted or missing children have subsequently been found dead, their bodies mutilated and certain organs removed. The report notes here that it is medically possible to transplant a chil d's organ into an adul t's body. In subsequent paragraphs t he use of organs for use in witchcraft practices is flagged.

Chapt er VII prohibits financial gain from disposal of a part of the human body, stating in article 21 that \"The human body and its parts shall not, as such, give rise to financial gain\".

It states that organ and tissue transplan - tation should tak e place under conditions protecting the rights and freedoms of donors, potential donors and recipients of organs and tissues, that institutions must be instrumen - tal in ensuring such conditi ons and that there i s a need to protect individual rights and free - doms and to prevent the commercialization of parts of the human body involved in organ and tissue procurement, exchange an d allocation activities. Chapter VI of the Additional Protocol prohi bits financial gain. Article 21, paragraph 1, states that the human body and its parts shall not, as such, give rise to a financial gain or com - parable advantage. It clarifies, ho wever, that this provision does not prevent payments which do not constitute financial gain, such as compen sation of living donors for loss of earnings498 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons or other justified expen ses, payment for legitimate medical or technical services rend ered and compensation in cases resulting in damage. Article 21, paragraph 2, states that adver- tising the need fo r, or availability of, organs or tissues, with a view to offering or seeking financial gain or comparable a dvantage, shall be prohibited. Article 22 of the Additional Protocol clearly prohibits the trafficking of organs an d tissues.

This proposal was formul ated on the basis of articles 29, 31 (e) and 34 (2) (b) of the Treaty on European Union, emphasizing cooperati on to prevent organized crime. T he Initiative of the Hellen ic Republic with a view to adopti ng a Council Framework Deci sion concerning the prevention and con trol of trafficking in human organs and tissues states at the outset that Trafficking in huma n organs and tissue s is a form of trafficking in human beings, which comprises serious violations of fundamental human rights and, in particular, of human dignity and phys ical integrity. Such trafficking is an area of activity of organized crimi - nal groups who often have recou rse to inadmissible practices such as the abuse of vul- nerable persons and the use of violence and threats. In addition, it gives rise to serious risks to public health and infringes on the right of citizens to equal access to health services. Finally, it undermines citizens' confidence in the legitima te transplantation system. This initiative goes further than the Traffi cking in Persons Protocol, which does not include the removal of tissues, such as skin, bones, cartilage, ligaments and corneas. The in itiative also fills gaps left by the lack of reference to trafficki ng in human organs and tissues in Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA on combating traffi cking in human beings , adopted in 2002. The European Parliament approved the Initiative of the He llenic Republic, with s ome amendments, in a legislative resolution of 23 October 2003.

What is monitoring? Monitoring is a contin uing function that us es systematic collection of data on specific indi- cators to provide the manage ment and the main stakeholders of an ongoing intervention 502 Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons with indications of the extent of a chievement of objectives an d progress in the use of allocated funds. Indicators An indicator is a quantitative or qualitative variable that all ows changes produced by an intervention relative to what was planned to be measured. It provides a reasonably simple and reliable basis for assessing achi evement, change or performance. An indi cator is preferably numerical and can be measured over time to show c hanges. Indicators, which are determined du ring the planning phase of a project, us ually have the following components: 1.What is to be measured? (What is going to change? E.g., participants reporti ng higher school attendance of girls in a village) 2.Unit of measuremen t to be used (to describe the change, e.g., percentage) 3.Pre-programme stat us (sometimes called the \"baseline\", e.g., 40 per cent in 200 7) 4.Size, magnitude or dimension of intended chan ge (e.g., 75 per cent in 2008) 5.Quality or standard of the change to be achie ved (e.g., improvement such that girls obtain higher grades) 6.Target populations(s) ( e.g., girls vulnerable to trafficki ng from villages in southern district) 7.Time frame (e.g., January 2008 to January 2009) What is ev aluation?

Ensure that monitoring and evaluation plans are realistic, us eful and cost-effective. 3.Include plans to c onsult with children and communities in your monitoring and evaluation. 4.Ensure that project planning incorporates lessons learned from other organi zations on child trafficking and be prepared to share learning on chil d trafficking with other agencies and work togethe r to identify good practice. The Handbook on Planning Projects to Prevent Child Trafficking is available at: http://tdh-childpr otection.org/conte nt/view/15 8/1 i projects (Gover nment Accountabi lity Office) In 2007, the Government Accountability Office of the United States conducted a study on the success of anti-trafficking p rojects in various countrie s. The report of the stud y analyses the means by which these projects are monitored and evaluated and makes recommenda - tions for better measuring performa nce by modifying projec t design to clearly identify strate - gies and their expected outcomes. Overall, the report states, few evaluations that determine impact have been completed, leaving the impact of anti-trafficking inte rventions in question. The report notes that ant i-trafficking proje ct documents (from a range of projects i n a range of countries) often lack monitoring elements, such as targets for measuring performance. Other difficulties mentioned in regard to evaluating the impact of a project are: /L50539Questionable data on trafficking (incl uding the number of traffi cking victims) /L50539Short time frames and overly broad object ives To address these concerns, the General Accountabil ity Office makes the followin g recommendatio ns: /L50539Develop a logic framework with clear objectives and narrow focus of interventions Project activities shou ld be clearly linked to intended outcomes, meas urable indica - tors identified and procedures established for s etting and modifying targets517 chapter 10 Monitoring an d evaluation /L50539Determine whether a project is ready to be evaluated. In conducting an \"evaluabili ty assessment\", evaluators should consider w hether: The project is large enough, has sufficient resources and has been implemented long enough to make an impact The project is reaching its target population Project documents specify and clearl y link objectives, goals and activities Sufficient information exists to determine impact /L50539Build monitoring and evaluation into the project design Project officials should co nsider how the project wi ll be evaluated before the proj ect is implemented Organizations should define the intended impact of the project and how that impact will be measured /L50539To do this, project beneficiarie s must be determined, as must the group to which they would be compared , the data to be collected and the method of analys ing that data. Such data must be collected before, during and after implementation. The above i nformation was extrac ted from the report of the Government Accountability Office of the Unit ed States, Human Trafficking: Monitoring and Evaluat ion of International Projects Are Limited, but Experts Suggest I mprovements (GAO-07-1034, July 2007), available at: www.gao.gov/ new.items/d071034.pdf Collateral Damage: the Impact of Anti-T rafficking Measures o n Human Rights a round the World (Global Alliance against Trafficking i n Women) In September 2007, GAATW published a report entitled Collateral Damage: the Impact of Anti-Trafficking Measures on Human R ights around the World .
