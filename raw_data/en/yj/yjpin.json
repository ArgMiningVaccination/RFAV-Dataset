Whether that is hiking, swimming, playing a few rounds of golf, or talking a leisurely stroll around the neighborhood, taking as much time as you can to do things that give you the most joy is a big key to one's well-being. Unfortunately with all physical activities, you can have too much of a good thing, and your body has a few really painful ways of letting you know. Luckily for us, there are many all-natural options to treat the symptoms of these issues. Some of the most common musculoskeletal ailments affecting people include tendonitis and bursitis. While they sound similar, these issues affect different parts of your body: Tendonitis Tendonitis is defined as the inflammation or irritation of your bodies' tendons. Tendons are the thick cords of connective tissue that attach your muscles to bones. When the tendons are subjected to overuse and prolonged stress, micro tears can develop and cause pain and swelling. Common areas of the body prone to developing tendonitis include hips, knees, shoulders and the Achilles tendon. Bursitis Bursitis is characterized as the inflammation of your bursae. These small, fluid filled sacs aim to cushion the bones, tendons and muscles around your joints. If these sacs are subjected to repetitive movements and pressure, they can become swollen, achy and stiff and cause significant pain and discomfort. Bursitis is often experienced in the same areas that tendonitis is seen, like the shoulder, elbow, and hip. Treatment Options Tendonitis and bursitis is common largely because they tend to develop no matter how careful you are and how much time you devote to rest and recovery. That being said, all-natural, non-invasive treatments like acupuncture and chiropractic care are available to effectively treat the underlying symptoms Chiropractic adjustments, when performed with proper care, look to manipulate the spine, hips, and other joints back into proper alignment. With a musculoskeletal system properly aligned, stress and pressure can be evenly distributed around the body and no longer concentrated on certain areas where tendons and burse can become inflamed. In order to aid in treatment, a chiropractor might suggest utilizing tactics like trigger point massage prior to early adjustments to help make the muscles surrounding the joints more pliable. Acupuncture is another incredibly effective option to help treat the pain associated with tendonitis and bursitis. Acupuncture helps stimulate your central nervous system, subsequently activating and releasing neurotransmitters like endorphins to act as natural painkillers. The treatment will also help promote increased blood flow, allowing for better distribution of white blood cells and other nutrients to inflamed tissue. When it comes to dealing with tendonitis and bursitis, its important to explore as many options as you can in order to choose those the plan that will work best for you and that you are most comfortable with. Both Acupuncture and chiropractic care offer tremendous pain relief for those looking for safe, all natural, minimally invasive treatments. "}
