But here are 5 situations you might not expect that acupuncture can help you with: Grief, loss, break ups Loss, whether it is the end of a relationship or death of a loved one, can hugely impact your spiritual, mental and emotional health. Acupuncture can help reduce stress during tough times and can help your mind, body and spirit find quiet and space for healing and grieving. When you feel lost Sometimes we get so caught up in the roles we play in our daily lives that we lose track of our true self. Acupuncture reminds you to be more in your body and be present. It strengthens your ability to thrive as you were meant to. When you need a change Feeling stuck is a common theme I see in New Yorkers. Acupuncture has the ability to create movement and circulation in your channels in order to re-inspire or just get you up out of a funk. It might be a good idea to seek some regular visits when you notice you have trouble getting out of bed, you're running into creative blocks and/or if you're just feeling down. To Strengthen your empathic abilities One of my favorite things that acupuncture does, if we pay attention, is to be more sensitive and notice how you feel. It reminds you to observe yourself. If you're a healer, acupuncture can help you strengthen your energetic boundaries as well as enhance your empathic abilities. Spiritual connection Much of the theory of East Asian Medicine is based on the nature of the universe \u2014seasonal, solar, lunar or astrological shifts and connections. It asks us to contemplate and understand how we connect to ourselves, those around us and our environment. Acupuncture treatments can help you better align to different aspects of nature and your surroundings.
