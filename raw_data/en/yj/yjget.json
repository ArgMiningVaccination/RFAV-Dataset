Infertility in general is defined as not being able to conceive, even after carefully planned unprotected sex for at least a year. But what is male fertility? Well, it is when a man is not able to get his partner pregnant. In most cases, it is due to the quality of the sperm cells that he produces. However, sometimes infertility is related to sexual function as well as sperm quality. Here are some instances of each: - Erectile Dysfunction: [Erectile dysfunction](https://drvaidyas.com/blogs/all/erectile-dysfunction-causes-and-treatment), which is also called impotence, is when a man can't get or keep an erection. - Sperm Count: A significant percentage of the quality of the sperm is determined by the number of sperm cells or their concentration in a particular quantity of semen. - Sperm Motility: How to know your sperm is healthy? The capacity to swim is a crucial characteristic of healthy sperm cells. The number of moving sperm cells in a sample of semen is used to measure sperm motility. - Testosterone Levels: [Low testosterone levels](https://drvaidyas.com/blogs/all/low-testosterone-in-men), the male sex hormone, may cause infertility in certain males. It's essential to [better understand infertility](https://drvaidyas.com/blogs/all/understand-infertility-for-improving-your-reproductive-health) to more effectively take steps in combating it. To do this, let's first take a look at how to know your sperm is healthy before jumping to answering how to increase sperm count naturally. How Is Sperm Count Calculated? According to the guidelines and reports of the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of healthy sperm per millilitre of semen ranges from 15 million to more than 200 million. Anyone with a sperm count of less than 15 million per ml is said to have a low sperm count, which could cause future fertility problems. Can you become a parent, If your sperm count is low?

Some possible causes of having a low sperm count include: - Hormonal disparities - Traumatic testicular injury (e.g., sporting injuries) - Unfallen testicles (even those that were repaired early) - Orchitis (inflammation of one or both testicles most typically related to infection) - Some sexually transmitted diseases - Ejaculation difficulties - Taking some medicines - Prior surgeries - Environmental factors, such as hazardous chemical or radiation exposure - Factors of lifestyle, such as smoking, consuming alcohol, drug usage, and obesity Signs And Symptoms of Low Sperm Count A low sperm count in a man may not cause any other symptoms besides infertility.

Infertility has been shown to [cause marital problems and stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8279062/), which can lead to erectile dysfunction and make men feel even more insecure. It's essential to know the difference between not being able to have kids and not being able to make love. Infertility is the inability to conceive. Men who can't have children usually think they can't perform sexually, which makes them question their masculinity. This stereotype needs to be changed. Impotence is when a man can't keep an erection going for a long time. Sterile men don't have to be impotent. Even though it's normal for the couple to feel like they've lost their identity, have low self-esteem, and lack confidence, they need counselling, therapy, and reassurance to help them through the process.

If wearing boxers makes you feel uncomfortable, choose cotton briefs instead of synthetic ones. Still, that will help control the flow of air and the temperature.

Get Moving: Physical activity, even moderate exercise, can increase levels of strong antioxidant enzymes, which can shield sperm. What's Off-limits If You Want To Increase Sperm Count Naturally?
