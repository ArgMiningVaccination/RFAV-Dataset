Thank you. I began developing my non-toxic health protocol in May May 2016. It has not yet achieved the results I had hoped for on my lab work. But my feelings of health, wellness, strength, stamina and happiness have improved remarkably. And my lymphoma symptoms (B symptoms), which had me bed-ridden, disappeared entirely in just one month, and have stayed gone. This is the list of daily \"minimums\" I aim for. But I don't beat myself up if I don't achieve all in one day. Rather, I am thankful for what I have accomplished in self-care each day. My list is changing all the time. A month from now, it will look a little different. I am in a relationship/dialogue with my body. Some things on my list are specific to my anemia (the iron, B12 & daily meat) so may not be appropriate for other people whose ferritin levels are ok. I source all foods from organic, non-GMO sources. My meat is all local, free-range, grass-fed, antibiotic & hormone-free. I try to roast an organic chicken or duck weekly, then make bone broth with carcass & bones as base for soup. Bone broth is dense with healthy bone minerals, marrow, gelatin. The final category (Mental & Emotional) is actually the linchpin to my \"program\". The rest is useful but not effective without the final category. VITAMINS & SUPPLEMENTS B12 D3 Floravit Iron Molasses B-complex (if no insomnia) Lecithin (if no insomnia) FOODS & DRINKS 1 Juice from juicer (carrot/beet/apple) 1 Smoothie in blender Golden Milk (1 tsp Golden Paste) Meat Reduce/eliminate sugar Reduce/eliminate white flour Eat 50% raw Bone broth (make weekly) Kefir & Yogurt (for gut health) Water (8 cps) 1 Sardine ACTIVITIES & PRACTICES Danyus & strength training 30-60 min. brisk walk Microcosmic breath work & meditation while walking Exercise bike Dry-brush body & bathe Healing Sounds Qigong Bone Breathing/Bone Marrow NeiGong Magnesium Chloride Detox Foot Bath MENTAL & EMOTIONAL Stay positive & confident Smile Occupy Epic Joy Send Love within & without Be thankful \"3 things I'm grateful for\" Cultivate Self-love Cultivate Gratitude "}
