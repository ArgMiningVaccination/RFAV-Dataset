I would like to thank all my colleagues for their dedication to caring for our patients, supporting each other and rising to the financial, operational and weather related challenges which the past yea r has thrown at us. We were one of the first hospitals to be inspected under the new CQC inspection regime and were rated 'Outstanding' for caring and 'Good' overall. More information can be found on page 14. It has also been an extraordinarily succes sful year for our hospital in being recognised in prestigious awards for innovative and patient centred care, including the HSJ Awards, HSJ Patient Safety Awards and HSJ Value awards covering fantastic improvements in services from maternity to catering a s well as the implementation of various apps including the HANDi paediatric app. These achievements are a credit to the talent, resourcefulness and sheer hard work of our colleagues. Their commitment, above all to great patient care, shone through in our latest staff survey results which once again put us in the top 20% for colleague engagement, and the Trust is in the top five trusts in the south of England for the number of colleagues who said they would recommend the hospital as a place to work or have treatment. More information about this can be found from page 66. I would lik e also to thank our many friends throughout Somerset for their huge support. It is impossible to list everything in this summary but a few highlights include the \u00a3650k raised by our terrific League of Friends for our new interventional X-Ray Facility; the \u00a3800k raised so far, again with help from League of Friends and the S omerset Unit for Radiotherapy Equipment (SURE), towards our \u00a31m target for a new MRI scanner campaign, for which we are privileged and delighted to have HRH The Countess of Wessex as our Royal Patron; and the fleet of four by four vehicles which emerged from volunteers in the local community which kept our hospital transport working when Taunton was under 'red alert' for snow. The warmth of local support is truly humbling and an inspiration to all at the Trust to try still harder to maintain the highest standards of patient care. I am sure the combination of dedicated staff and warm support from our local community were key factors in our being awarded \u00a379.5m by the Secretary of State for Health to upgrade our theatres and critical care. This underscores your hospital's position as a key part of the Somerset health economy. I have suggested previously that the structures of health care in Somerset need to develop to ensure we pr ovide seamless integrated patient centred care. As part of this drive to improve our services and our patients' experience of our care, the Trust Board agreed in May 2017 to work more closely with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. Subsequently, in early 2018, both boards agreed to explore a potential merger and development of the strategic case has commenced. In support of this collaborative working, a joint executive team was appointed during the autumn of 2017. 7 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 We also appointed Peter Lewis a s joint Chief Executive of both organisations having bid a fond farewell to our previous Chief Executive, Sam Barrell, who took up a new opportunity at the Francis Crick Institute in September. I would like to thank Sam for all of her hard work during her time here as Chief Executive and again to congratulate Peter on his appointment and to thank him for his ongoing commitment and progress so far on developing the alliance. The aim of the alliance is to improve patient care and promote seamless services across the two trusts. Some of the projects being developed include joining -up stroke services and therapy services, improving community rapid response services, and enhancing psychiatric liaison at the two acute hospital emergency departments in Somerse t. I commend our respective boards and councils of governors for their vision in supporting this development at the heart of which lies a determination to provide the best care for patients and prevent organisational barriers getting in the way. Our new arrangements have already shown great benefit not least during the winter period by helping us to make best use of our collective resources. Strong collaborative working involving our partners at Yeovil District Hospital and Somerset County Council has also brought improvements for patients. For example, Somerset's Home First Service has helped reduce delays in discharge from Somerset's acute hospitals and get patients home sooner, with appropriate support. After last year's small surplus we ended thi s year with a deficit of \u00a33.5m (before asset impairments and the net effect of capital donations) which was heavily impacted by the very adverse weather conditions in the last quarter of the year resulting in additional costs and loss of revenue on planned elective surgery. Operationally, the hospital has been very busy and we deeply regret the impact on patients when we have been unable to see them as quickly as we would like or when we have unfortunately been forced to cancel operations, sometimes at short notice, as a result of the hospital being so full. This deficit is part of a much larger total for the Somerset health system as a whole which again reinforces the need for greater integration. For the coming year we have agreed with our health and ca re partners in Somerset to focus on the system as a whole rather than on individual organisations. We want more investment to go towards treating patients closer to home, with consequent benefits for patient, and to reduce excess demand for acute care. At the same time increased resource as a national priority is to be allocated to mental health care. Whilst these factors may have an impact on the financial performance of the Trust in isolation, we believe they are in the best interests of patients and th e long term financial sustainability of the total Somerset health system. 8 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 We are so proud of the highly committed and caring people working across our services, those on the front line and those in support. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all my colleagues for their remarkable commitment to our patients, their carers and families. We remain extremely grateful for the continued support we continue to receive from our patients, our carers, our volunteers and governors, and the wonderfu l contribution made by the charities that support us, including our League of Friends and SURE who continue to generously provide donations that make a real difference to patients. We look forward to progressing our alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in the year ahead and working in an integrated manner with our other partners in the Somerset health and social care system to provide the best possible to all who use our services across Somerset and the wider region. ................................. Colin Drummond, OBE, DL, Trust Chairman, 24 May 2018 9 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Performance Report Overview of performance The purpose of the overview is to provide a short summary about Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust ( \"the Trust \" or \"Musgrove Park Hospital\" ), its purpose, strategic objectives (and any key risks to the achievement of those objectives) as well as details of how we have performed over the year. Brief history and structure of Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trus t Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust was established in 2008 when we were awarded foundation trust status. The Trust is considered as a medium -sized provider of acute hospital services and serves a l ocal population of over 340,000, as well as pro viding some specialist and tertiary services for Somerset's whole population of around 544,000. In addition to inpatient, outpatient and emergency care services, the Trust operates a high dependency and intensive care unit, 16 operating theatres, and nu merous medical and surgical wards to provide care , meeting the full range of patient need. Musgrove Park Hospital has a fully equipped diagnostic imaging department operating 7 days per week, and a purpose -built cancer treatment centre which includes chemo therapy and radiotherapy facilities for both inpatients and outpatients. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust is registered without conditions as a healthcare provider with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Details of the Trust's governance and reporting arrangements are set out within the annual governance statement. In summary: 10 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Purpose, activities/business model and strategic objectives for Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust We are a values -driven organisation, conscious that \"together, we make the difference.\" Our values are at the heart of service planning, recruitment and the operational running of services for patients. These are: \"one team \", \"putting our patients first \", \"leading and listening \", and \"striving for the best \". The Trust's mission is \"working together for a healthy Somerset\", recognising the role that we play in the health of the whole population, working in partnership with other health and social care services in the county. These values underpin the Trust's strategic objectives and prio rities, which for 2017/18 were: During 2017 /18, the Trust continued to provide the full range of the services expected of a district general hospital, primarily from Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton. We also provided clinics for various specialties at numerous community hospitals (e.g. endoscopy and orthopaedic services from Bridgwate r Community Hospital) and from other community venues across Somerset. The Trust continues to develop links with GPs and other primary care professionals so that care can be delivered in a way which reduces unnecessary hospital admissions. The Trust's bu siness model remains focused on the delivery of high quality and safe services . The T rust's largest source of income is NHS services paid for by the Somerset CCG, the local commiss ioners of NHS health services. The Trust had a turnover of \u00a3 308.9 m in 201 7/18 (\u00a3299.9m in 2016/17 ). Strategic Objectives Care Performance and Improvement Deliver improved outcomes and satisfaction for patients through a person -centred approach to service provision. Implement the improvement and innovation strategy to improve services and achieve the triple aim of improved health, better care and lower cost Deliver and maintain the highest standards of clinical care, 7 days per week. Ensure that the trust maximises funds for capital investment, including charitable funds, to help deliver capital plans for new developments which actively manage and mitigate risks with buildings and equipment. Deliver levels of performance that are in line with plans, including waiting times for A&E, RTT, cancer and diagnostics Transform care processes through digital working to improve safety, outcomes and efficiency. Ensure delivery of short term financial plans and financial sustainability for the medium and long term. Colleagues Community Implement the organisational development plan, creating an environment where colleagues feel confident, supported and empowered to deliver quality services. Understand the Trust's contribution to the Somerset sustainability and transformation programme and ensure that contribution is delivered in order to improve the health of the population, quality and sustainability of services. As the Trust and Somerset Partnership work more closely together, ensure that a shared, collaborative and positive culture is created which leads to unified services and satisfied colleagues. Through the alliance with Somerset Partnership, work with primary care, soci al care, public health and voluntary sector partners to improve the health of the population and integrate services in order to deliver high quality care. Work with partners to deliver a joined up workforce resourcing and skills strategy, to increase sustainability, reduce reliance on temporary staffing, and ensure that we recruit and retain the right staff. 11 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The Trust also provides a substantial number of specialist services, often at a sub - regional or regional level. These include radiotherapy and some dental services, as well as some specialist surgical areas. These are paid for by other commissioners including NHS England. The Trust has a private patient unit which operates all year round and delivers significant additional income, as well as expanding choice for local people. The environment in which the Tr ust operates continues to be operationally and financially challenging. Like all hospitals in England, Musgrove Park Hospital has been busier than ever in 2017/18, with record numbers of patients attending A&E, and increasing demand in almost all services. The Trust continues to explore innovative ways to address these challenges. This year has seen expansion of the JETT t herapies team to facilitate faster discharge and more timely therapy input to aid recovery. The \"Home First\" service has commenced, al lowing patients to return to the ir place of residence more quickly and formulating onward care packages tailored more specifically for their need. And the integrated front d oor (IFD) service has started, providing dedicated pathways for specific types of presentation at A&E. The IFD service has been shortlisted for a Health Service Journal (HSJ) Value Award due to the positive impact it has had on patients experiencing A&E, and all the service innovations this year have helped to create additional capacity and make sure that patients are treated in the right place at the right time. As part of this drive to improve clinical services and our patients' experiences of our care in Somerset, the Trust Board has agreed to work more closely with Somerset Partnersh ip NHS Foundation Trust and explore a potential merger. This a lliance is being developed in support of Somerset's Strategic Transformation Plan (STP) and subsequent development by the commissioners of a Health and Social Care Strategy to better integrate services across the county. Key to this will be the alignment in 2018/19 of already -similar objectives and values, and as an alliance we are taking a dual approach to developing our strategy and service provision . The overarching strategy will follow these principles for the approach to delivery of services across Somerset: Focused on the needs of the Somerset population. Supporting people to maintain their own health. Providing safe, high quality and accessible care consistently. Worki ng with other stakeholders/providers to ensure that services are sustainable. Statement from the Chief Executiv e on the Trust's performance/achievements and key risks / issues This has been a difficult year for the NHS as a whole and t he Trust continues to face profound operational and financial challenges. 12 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Demand for services continues to rise, and is at unprecedented levels. The population served by the Trust is growing and becoming proportionately older. The Somerset population i s already older than the average for England, and is becoming more so. The ageing population is one of the reasons why demand for services continues to grow . The rural nature of much of Somerset presents a further challenge. There also remain significan t shortages of doctors and nurses in some specialty areas. The Trust maintains a corporate risk register outlining what it perceives as its key challenges. This is supplemented by risk registers within directorates, to identify, manage and mitigate risk. The most significant risks identified in the corporate risk register are as follows: Financial challenges and f ailure to achieve control total . Operational pressures having an impact on the quality of care provision and the delivery of the Trust's operational performance standards (RTT, 62 day cancer, diagnostic waiting times and A&E). Management of demand across the system, particularly in emer gency care. Age of the estate. Key clinical staffing vacancies, particularly in nursing. Recruit ment, training and retention of key clinical staff. The Trust continues to work with partners as part of the STP and the alliance with Somerset Partnersh ip NHS Foundation Trust to develop strategic plans to address these risks and strategic challenges (see below). Key developments / achievements in 2017/18 Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) In November 2016 the leaders of Somerset's health and social care system published their Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP). The plan was a blueprint for delivering the national 'Five Year Forward View' strategy locally. Since then the operational and financial pressures have continued to wors en and subsequently the health and care leaders in Somerset have come together to develop a new Somerset Health and Care Strategy. The strategy builds upon the learning from the former STP but with a renewed focus upon five key service areas: 1. urgent and emergency care 2. proactive care for frail and elderly people 3. planned care such as hip replacements 4. children and maternity care 5. care for people living with mental health and learning disabilities 13 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The strategy will address the clinical needs of local people, tackle the health inequalities that exist in our communities and ensure any proposals developed to improve services will be affordable and sustainable. More information can be found about the development of Somerset's Health and Care Strategy at www.fitforourfuture.org.uk Alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust At a joint meeting of the Somerset Partnership and Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust boards on 25 May 2017, a Memorandu m of Understanding (MoU) was signed formalising the trusts' respective commitments to closer collaborative working for the benefit of patients and the public in Somerset. In support of this aim a joint executive leadership team was appointed during the autumn of 2017 , led by a newly appointed Chief Executive, Peter Lewis . Secondment arrangements have been set up for their roles to the non - employing trust. This is not an end in itself; it's very much a means to allow clear leadership and simplified decisi on-making for improving healthcare for people in Somerset. A single team bridging both organisations will help ease the way for service pathways to be redesigned and for services to be built around the people using them. It also gives the trusts a chance to set joint priorities, both in the very short term and in the medium term. Some of the projects already being progressed as a result of this collaboration include discussions about joining -up stroke services and therapy services, improving rapid response, providing medical cover for community hospitals, developing a communication strategy between the trusts and primary care and engaging with the Symphony project. During 2017 an options appraisal was commissioned in relation to the joint working arrangements and the potential for further progression. One of the recommendations was to develop a clear vision, strategy and collective understanding of the intended benefits from the closer working arrangements. The four elements which will form the bas is of the alliance vision are: Focused on the nee ds of the Somerset population. Supporting people to maintain their own health. Providing safe, high quality and accessible care consistently. Working with other stakeholders/providers to ensure that services are sustainable. In terms of next steps, both boards have agreed that the alliance arrangements will need to progress to the next stage and the development of a strategic case for merger has commenced. To support this work a clear colleague and stakeholder communications and engagement plan will be implemented. The development of a strategic case for merger will be undertaken in line with the broader objectives of the Somerset STP and the county -wide commissioning review of health and social car e services. 14 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Care Quality Commission (CQC) i nspection Inspectors from the CQC visited the hospital at the end of August 2017 to review four core services - end of life care, urgent and emergency services, surgery and outpatients. In their report, they praised the hospital for the 'outstanding practice' shown in these four areas, resulting in a stronger 'good' rating for the Trust . This is testimony to the efforts of our very hard working, talented staff. The CQC also recognised that since the Trust's last inspection in 2016 we have made a number of improvements across the hospital, which has resulted in higher ratings for our emergency department (A&E), surgery and end of life care. As part of the CQC's new inspection arrangement s the CQC inspectors also rated the leadership of the hospital as \"good\". They observed a strong culture for delivering high-quality care and highlighted our focus on improvement. Across all domains, t he report rated Musgrove as 'outstanding' for caring, and 'good' for its services being effective, respons ive and well led, with a 'requires improvement' for safety. However, inspectors said that they are confident that the trust has taken the right action to improve safety of services, which will be inspec ted at a later date. Primary care strategy A key component of the Trust's corporate strategy is to work more closely with primary c are to explore a more integrated approach to providing services, centred on the needs of patients. As closer working relationships have developed, the Trust has established a new more integrated form of relationship with Warwick House Medical Practice in Taunton. From 1 April 2017, the Trust has held the contract to provide primary care services at Warwick House Medical Practice, which involves directly employing and managing all staff at the practice, including the GPs, who will continue to provide primary care services as salaried GPs. This development has presented a really exciting opportunity to ensure patients moving between hospital GP care can do so appropriately and seamlessly. Digital and i mprovement programmes As part of the global digital e xemplar (GDE) programme, we strive to be open about our use of data and to involve patients/public and colleagues in the design and adoption of new technology. Over the past 12 months we have held a number of public events to raise awareness of the programme and to gain the input required; patients/public and colleagues have attended open events in the hospital concourse and the town centre, as well as focused workshops to share ideas and discuss how new technology could make a real difference to the care provided at Mus grove. The GD E programme is led by senior clin ical colleagues, including two chief clinical information officers (CCIOs), a chief nursing information o fficer (CNIO) and their deputies, support ed by the information management and t echnology (IM&T) team, in collaboration w ith the i mprovement team. 15 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Over the last 12 month s we ha ve introduced paper -light working within the outpatient department at Musgrove and some clinics in community hospitals (reducing the administrative burden and ensuring clinicians are always seeing the m ost up to date information ). Looking ahead, there are some exciting changes planned, with the introduction of mobile working on the wards to support the care and flow of patients, as well as our critical care unit going digital over th e summer. We will also be introducing electronic prescribing over the next 12 months, with a real focus on improving patient safety. Musgrove is also working with partners from health and social care across Somerset to look at how information can be shar ed to support the direct care of patients/ public as part of the Somerset i ntegrated digital eRecord (SIDeR) p rogramme. In addition to ongoing work with partners to address the Trust's key corporate risks and strategic challenges, we have invested in our i mprovement team to support colleagues to find innovative solutions to improve the quality of care provision. Some key headlines from the programme are contained in the graphic below: 16 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 New surgical centre We are absolutely delighted that our hospital has national support to develop a new surgical centre, which will include new theatres and a critical care unit. For our patients and the people of Somerset, it means they will have access to modern, state of the art facilities, that are fit for the future. The \u00a379.5 million new surgical centre will replace much of Musgrove's ageing 1940s buildings that currently provide care for some of the most critically ill patients in Somerset. It will include: Six endoscopy rooms, patient recovery and clinical support areas . Eight operating theatres (including two interventional radiology theatres), recovery areas and clinical support. 22 critical care beds, all specified for level 2 and 3 critical care patients The new building will be in a central location on the hospital site, close to other clinical services. MRI charitable appeal and Royal Patron Love Musgrove, the Trust's official charity, was delighted in-year to announce HRH the Countess of Wessex GCVO as the new Royal Patron of its campaign to raise \u00a31m for a new MRI scanner . This essential piece of diagnostic equipment benefits a huge number of patients who may have cancers, cardiac or joint, tendon and muscle problems. Good progress is being made toward achieving the \u00a31m target and the new scanner will help to ensure shorter waiting times for people in Somerset and beyond, as well as providing the hospital with greater overall scanning capacity and allowing us to take part in ground breaking research programmes. We are very grateful to all those who have supported the appeal. Clinical activit y over the four years to 2017/18 was as follows: NHS pre-operative assessment clinic appointments , which were not previously included. 17 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Operational performance and infection control metrics Target/ threshold Performance April 2017 - March 2018 Maximum time of 18 weeks from point of referral to treatment (RTT) in aggregate - patients on an incomplete pathway ** 92% 83.6% A&E maximum waiting time of 4 hours from arrival to admission/transfer/discharge * 95% 90.8% Cancer 62 Day Waits for first treatment: urgent GP referral for suspected cancer NHS cancer screening referral 85% 90% (Trust apportioned cases) 0 3 *A&E maximum waiting times - the indicator is expressed as a percentage of all A&E attendances where the patient spends four hours or less in A&E from arrival to transfer, admission or discharge ** RTT incomplete pathways - the indicator is expressed as the percentage of patients on an incomplete pathway (i.e. those still awaiting first consultant led treatment) who have waited less than 18 weeks from referral. The Trust's p erformance against the 18 week referral to t reatment (R TT) standard has been under the national level all year due to levels of demand being higher than available service capacity. Guided by the Very Intensive Support Team (VIST) the Trust has used the interim management and support (IMAS) capacity and demand modelling tools to understand what level of ca pacity needs to be provided to meet the levels of demand the Trust is experiencing. This puts the Trust in a stronger position going into 2018/19 to meet demand and in line with the national planning guidance, stop its waiting list increasing in size. Meeting the A&E 4-hour waiting time standard continued to be challenging during 2017/18. The 95% standard was achieved in April 2017, but like most trusts performance was below the national standard for the year as a whole. Significant growth in demand was seen in b oth attendances at the Trust's emergency department, but also patients needing to be admitted as an emergency. Part of this growth came from patients needing to attend the emergency department from the Weston Hospital catchment area, following t he decision supported by the Trust to close the Weston Area Health Trust emergency department overnight from July 2017. The overall high levels of growth in emergency demand experienced in 2017/18 resulted in higher levels of cancellations of patients nee ding elective surgery which also impacted on the achievement of the RTT waiting times standard. 18 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The Trust continued to implement a programme of improvement work during 2017/18 to support patient flow through the emergency department . This included the piloting of the Home First model of care which facilitates the discharge of medically fit patients out of the hospital . Patients receive an intensive period of reablement in three settings to promote independence and keep patients (for as long as possible) in their usual place of residence. Through Home First and ongoing system -wide work with partner organisations the Trust has been able to keep the number of delayed transfers of c are low this year. The Trust also invested during 2017 /18 in a new \"integrated front door\" which has meant a number of patients with minor illnesses or injury have been able to receive treatment more promptly in a GP - led service, fully supported by the wider range of diagnostic services and facilities availab le in the emergency department . Performance against the 31 -day decision to treatment cancer standards has been strong throughout the year, for both first and subsequent cancer treatments. But like many trusts, Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has struggled to meet the 62 -day referral to treatment standard for patients referred by their GP with a suspected cancer. The reasons for the failure to meet the 62 -day GP cancer standard have been varied and include the complexity of pa tients being referred, patient choice to defer diagnostic tests or treatment, patients requiring periods of medical deferral to manage other conditions un -related to their cancer, and longer than planned waiting times for diagnostic tests. A multi -profess ional cancer s ummit was held by the Trust in July 2017 to identify further opportunities to reduce 62 -day pathway waits from which an improvement plan was developed. This improvement plan will continue to be implemented and added to during 2018/19. The T rust's performance against the 6 -week diagnostic waiting times was below the 99% national standard in 2017/18. Demand for diagnostic tests continues to be high and, like a number of trusts in the South West, the Trust currently has a shortfall in capacity to meet demand. However, plans are in place to install additional CT and MRI scanners during 2018/19, which will help to increase the number of scans we can undertake in the future. Additional gastroenterologists have also been appointed which will help to increase the endoscopy service capacity later in the year. Unfortunately, the Trust had three cases of MRSA bloodstream infections in 2017/18. Multi -disciplinary reviews were completed to identify the source of the infection and any areas of sub -optim al practice that may have contributed to the case. Opportunities to improve a) MRSA screening and b) checking patient histories for any previous history of MRSA were identified and this learning was shared and improvement actions put in place. In 201 7/18, the Trust had a total of 18 trust -attributed Clostridium difficile cases (defined as specimen with a positive toxin test result taken on or after the fourth day of admission). This was a sharp increase from the previous year when there were only 8 cases identified. However, there has been a general increase across Somers et this year compared to last year, and this may have had an impact on the number of hospital cases. Further information about this is contained within the quality report . 19 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 All Trust -apportioned cases are thoroughly investigated to assess whether ther e was any lapse in care that may have contributed. These assessments are subsequently peer reviewed and validated with the Trust's commissioners. Learning has included ensuring appropriate antimicrobial prescribing and compliance with hand hygiene, and le arning was shared with the appropriate clinical staff and improvement actions taken. Further information about this is contained within the quality report. Going concern As part of the accounts preparation process, International Acco unting Standards (IAS1) require the directors to assess the foundation trust's ability to continue as a going concern. In accordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual paragraph 2.13, the directors are mindful of table 6.2 of the FReM, w hich emphasises that: \"the anticipated continuation of the provision of a service in the future as evidenced by inclusion of financial provision for that service in published documents, is normally evidence of going concern\". The Trust has reported a deficit for 2017/18 and is forecasting a deficit for 2018/19. The forecast deficit is based on a number of assumptions including the delivery of cost improvement programmes. The Trust has assumed it will receive financial support from the Department of Hea lth and Social Care during the course of 2018/19 in order to meet its liabilities and continue to provide healthcare services. The extent and nature of the financial support from the Department of Health and Social Care, including whether such support will be forthcoming or sufficient, is currently uncertain, as are any terms and conditions associated with the funding. The existence of such material uncertainty may cast doubt about the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. The Trust will apply for cash support in line with current NHS funding policy. After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continu e to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. The expectation is informed by the anticipated continuation of the provision of service in the future, as evidenced by inclusion of financial provision for that service in the published document s. Contracts for Service, being the NHS Standard Contract 2018/19 has been signed with the Trust's main commissioners. These are the two lines th at we changed yesterday in the a ccount accounts, I assume the other two lines below you don't want These acco unts have been prepared on a going concern basis. The accounts do not include any adjustments that would result if the Foundation Trust was unable to continue as a going concern. 20 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Performance analysis The purpose of this section is to provide a deta iled performance analysis and explain how the Trust measures performance. How the foundation trust measures performance The Trust has a robust process for the measurement of performance, which triangulates quality, workforce and financial indicators. The Trust's approach is known as the performance assurance framework (PAF) process. Each directorate has its own PAF, split into four areas: patients, people, operational delivery and finance / improvement. This is similar to a balanced scorecard approach , in line with the recommendations of Lord Carter's recent review of NHS services. The PAF is reviewed monthly. The process involves the directorate manager, directorate clinical director, representatives from HR, finance, the operational performance and information teams and others. Each directorate reports on numerous indicators across the four PAF domains. These include all key clinical, operational and financial targets to ensure that the NHS mandate, NHS constitution, local quality and financial targe ts are met. Further information about the PAF process and how the Trust measures performance is included from page 80. Environmental sustainability The Sustainable Development Unit (SDU) reports to NHS England and Public Health England on the progress all health care providers have made towards sustainability goals. This section of the annual report outlines the action taken during 2017/18 in developing the Trust's Sustainability Strategy (Carbon Reduction Management Plan) which takes its priorities f rom the Sustainable Development Assessment Tool (SDAT). The SDAT has replaced the Good Corporate Citizen (GCC) and will provide more in depth detail on areas where focus needs to be directed to comply with the carbon emissions reduction required by the Cli mate Change Act 2008. Our total energy performance during last year was hampered by the fact our combined heat and power unit is not operating. The Trust continues to consider options for recommissioning the unit with the supplier to have it back in serv ice next year. The Trust has successfully recruited an Energy Manager to support the estates team to further refine engineering controls and develop further innovation. Funding is currently being sort for replacing light fittings to LED. Solar film has been installed to all wards and corridors on level 1 and 2 in both the Queens and Duchess buildings at the Musgrove Park Hospital site, as well as endoscopy. The solar film deflects heat and UV rays during the summer and in winter helps to keep heat. It a lso offers more privacy for our patients. This year has seen an increase of 1.25 % in degree day heating due to the colder weather from the last financial year but an overall reduction in energy usage of 6% per patient contact. 21 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Efficiency savings since baseline year 2007 based on usage of services per patient contacts 2007/8 from renewable sources and CHP) 18.06 (5.42 was produced from renewable sources and CHP) 19.44 (4.31 was produced from renewable sources and CHP ) 20.06 (2.17 was produced from renewable sources and CHP ) 21.34 (CHP not operational during 0.23 0.24 0.23 0.23 Clinical waste generated per patient contact kg 1.29 2.03 2.11 1.98 0.71 0.72 The table below provides actual consumption data with regard to energy and waste.

The reduction in CRC is due to the input of green renewable technologies into the national grid which has been reflected in the conversion factor applied per kWh of both electricity and gas. Carbon emission costs have now risen to \u00a318.30 per tonne. 2010/11 Base Year % from 2015/16to 2016/17 % change from base year CRC 19,723 17,092 23,871 +40% +13% Comparison with other similar acute hospitals suggests that the Trust performs well for energy and water consumption and carbon emissions. For energy consumption and carbon emissions the Trust is in the lower quartile, and only just above for water resources. The k ey objectives for the Trust are ambitious to further reduce our footprint to meet the mandatory targets of the Climate Change Act 2008. A Sustainable Development Management Plan (SDMP) is in the process of preparation which will set key objectives for the next 3 years to enable the Trust to progress towards meeting the mandatory targets of the Climate Change Act 2008. The plan reflects ambitious targets to reduce energy consumption, water consumption and waste produced by 10% over the next 3 years. In orde r to achieve these targets SALIX funding will both standardise and modernise the electrical lighting and plant machinery on a \"Save to spend basis\". For reduction in waste Government initiatives including the deposit scheme for beverage glass, plastic and metal containers, the inventory management roll out and better segregation will be essential in reaching our target. Emergency preparedness, resilience and response (EPRR) The NHS needs to be able to plan for and respond to a wide range of emergencies and business continuity incidents that could affect health or patient safety. These could be anything from severe weather to an infectious disease outbreak or major transport i ncident. Under the Civil Contingencies Act (2004), and the Health and Social Care Act as amended (2012), NHS organisations and providers of NHS funded care must demonstrate they can effectively respond to emergencies and business continuity incidents while maintaining services to patients. Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust is audited against the EPRR core standards annually. The 2017 audit reported that the Trust is considered to be substantially compliant with the EPRR core standards and has formally report ed the same to NHS England and the Somerset CCG. 23 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Throughout 2017, the risk of emergencies has been assessed and emergency and business continuity plans have been improved to ensure that patient safety is maintained. The Trust has been represented at mul ti-agency meetings and exercises to facilitate information sharing. A number of mass casualty exercises have been undertaken internally and externally to strengthen the multi -agency response to a mass casualty incident. The Trust has a rolling programme o f live, table -top and communications exercises that are designed to test and develop our plans. The Trust is required to hold a live test every three years, a table -top test every year, and a communications cascade every six months. Whenever possible, th e Trust strives to ensure that our testing is held in a multi -agency context. This is to provide familiarisation with other organisations and to assist with benchmarking our response with our partners. Exercises provide invaluable insight into the operati onal implementation of our plans and highlighted the areas of the plans that require further development. The Trust works in collaboration with a range of partner agencies through formal standing meetings and ad hoc arrangements. The Trust is a member of the Avon and Somerset Local Health Resilience Partnership, the purpose of which is to ensure that effective and coordinated arrangements are in place for multi -agency emergency preparedness and response in accordance with national policy and direction fro m NHS England. The Trust also has an internal Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Group to oversee its plans, key risks and mitigations and to develop staff training. Social, co mmunity and equality, diversity, anti-bribery and human rights We believe in equality and value diversity, both as a provider of health services and as an employer. The Trust is committed to eliminating discrimination and protecting the nine protected equality characteristics. To improve the patient experience we have a highly skilled, motivated and diverse workforce. This means that we are fair and unbiased, and accept differences between individuals and value the benefits of diversity. This is demonstrated by the everyday practices, policies and procedures to which we adhere . We aim to be pro - active in meeting the changing needs of our diverse communities, and to provide fair access for all in an environment where dignity and individuality are respected. As a provider of health services and as an employer, th e Trust is committed to: Eliminating unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation across all the protected characteristics. Advancing equality of opportunity between different groups. Fostering good relations between different groups. 24 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Building on the work undertaken in the previous years to ensure momentum in this area, the Trust has made progress against many equality and diversity issues this year. The equality and diversity steering group has representation from across many clinical and corporate areas. Its purpose is to review, rate evidenced activity and set priorities against the equality delivery system. The priorities cover areas such as \"better health outcomes\", \"improved patient access and s upported workforce\" and \"inclusive leadership\". The Trust has good evidence that its services are commissioned, procured, and delivered to meet the health needs of its local communities. Service provision is responsive both to community need and patient f eedback. Where services are procured by the Trust, suppliers are selected as per clear rules, and are required to adhere to strict standards including those related to equality and diversity. People's health needs are assessed and met in appropriate and effective ways. Care and risk documentation includes individual patient plans. There are specific plans available for patients with dementia and learning disabilities, and for vulnerable adults. There is a multi -faith patient chaplaincy service, and the T rust's care after death policy includes meeting the needs of diverse patients. Transitions from one service to the other, for people on care pathways, are made smoothly, with everyone properly informed. When people use the Trust's services, their safety i s prioritised and efforts are made to ensure that they are free from mistakes, mistreatment and abuse. The sign up to safety work programme in particular helps to ensure this. At Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust we value our reputation for top quality care and financial probity, and we conduct our business in an ethical manner. The Board carries out i ts business in an open and transparent way and members of the public are able to attend portions of our Board meetings. The Trust is committed to the prevention of bribery, fraud and corruption. We expect all organisations / contractors instructed by our organisation to demonstrate a comparable commitment in order to do business with us. This enables us to reassure our patients, members and stakeholder s that public funds are protected and safeguarded. The Bribery Act 2010 makes it easier to tackle the issue of bribery which is a damaging practice. Bribery can be defined as 'giving someone a financial gain or other advantage to encourage them to perfor m their duties improperly or reward them for having done so'. To limit our exposure to bribery we have an anti-fraud, bribery and corruption policy and a whistleblowing policy and we are currently implementing a new managing conflicts of interest policy . These policies apply to all staff and individuals who act on behalf of our organisation. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust employs a counter fraud manager who investigates, as appropriate, any allegations of fraud, bribery or corruption. The succe ss of our anti -bribery approach depends on our colleagues playing their part and we therefore encourage colleagues, service users, patients, visitors and others associated with the Trust to report any suspicions to the c ounter fraud manager or to the NHS C ounter Fraud Authority. 25 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Details of overseas operations The Trust has no direct overseas operations. However, for any operations carried out on behalf of overseas visitors, the costs are recovered via a reciprocal agreement with the Somerset CCG. The Trust has no overseas operations and has no branches outside of the UK. Key post -year developments None identified. Statement of comprehensive i ncome (SoCI) The financial year ending 31 March 201 8 has been challenging for the Trust due to a range of financial and operational pressures , particularly over the winter period. As a result of these pressures, the Trust ended the year with an overall deficit of (\u00a33.5m) (on the financial reporting basis e mployed by NHS Improvement) before asset impairments of (\u00a32.0 m) and the net effect of capital donations of \u00a30.4m , reflec ting a statutory deficit of (\u00a35.0 m). Income The Trust's total income from acti vities has increased from \u00a3299.9 m in the p revious financial year to \u00a3308.9m in 2017/18, an increase of \u00a39.0m (3.0 %). The principal reason is that income from patient care a ctivities has increased by \u00a38.9m (3.4%). Within this, \u00a312.0 m was from i ncreased levels of non -elective activity offset by a \u00a33.2m reduction in elective activity . In a ddition, the Trust received \u00a36.7m of sustainability and transformation fund ing (STF) income fro m the Department of Health and Social Care (\u00a38.8m in previous year). The greatest proportion of the Trust's income is derive d from the provision of health care for patients in Somerset. Income generation from p rivate patient activity remained at \u00a32.4m . Expenditure and cost improvement plans Total operati ng expenditure increased in 2017/18 by \u00a39.8m (3.3%) to \u00a3308.2 m. In order to offset the impact of inflation and other cost pressures, the Trust set a savings target of c 4.3% of operational expenditure. The Trust set itself a stretch target of \u00a3 13.4m savi ngs and achieved a total of \u00a313.2 m. Total pay costs were \u00a3186.2 m in the ye ar, an increase against the 2016/17 spend figure of \u00a3177.6 m (4.8%) . The expenditure increases were mainly the result of the 1% pay increase awarded nationally to NHS staff along with additional staffing costs associated with workforce transformat ion and skill mix changes, dealing with increased demand particularly for non -elective activity and the TUPE transfer of staff from Warwick House (a GP practice now run by the Trust). 26 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Operating non -pay expenditure increased by \u00a31.2m (1.0 %) on th e previo us year figure of \u00a3120.8 m. Expenditure on rechargeable high cost drugs prescr ibed to patients went up in 2017/18 and increa sed drug usage accounts for \u00a31.9 m of the overall increase in total operating expenditure. These costs are associated, in particular , with increased use of a number of approved high cost drugs in an increasing range of conditions, which are reclaimable through the specialised services commissioners and the cancer drugs fund. There have been one-off impairment costs of \u00a32.0 m (\u00a35.0m in 2016/17) incurred within the financial year relating to the revaluation of buildi ng, equipment and land. Statement of financial p osition (SOFP) Non-current assets (land, buildings and equipment) comprise the most significant elements, by value, of the SOFP and amount in total to \u00a3182.8m as at 31 March 2018 (\u00a3172.0 m as at 31 Mar ch 2017 ). Included within the net book value movements for the year were impairments of \u00a3 2.0m and revaluations of \u00a39.4 m. These changes were made following the annual independent revaluations of land and buildings . The Tr ust's borrowing at 31 March 2018 amounted to \u00a328.8m (down from \u00a330.6m at 31 March 2017 ). In previous years the Trust has been able to fu nd capital expenditure through loans and the remaining are the balances of a loan taken to fund a portion of the cost of the Jubilee Building, the Trust's PFI initi ative for the Beacon Centre and a finance lease for an energy project . A radiology managed facility service was entered into by the Trust which has added \u00a30.4m to borrowing . Other significant investments in the hospital's infrastructure reflected in the SOFP include: Improvements to the Trust 's estate and infrastructure (\u00a32.4 m). Primary care streaming in the emergency department (\u00a31.0m) Continuing development of the new electronic patient records (EPR) system and global digital exemplar programme (\u00a33.3 m). IT upgrades (\u00a30.9 m). Major medical equipment replacement (\u00a31.8m). Radiology equipment and installation works (\u00a31.6m) Total capital investments in 2017/18 amounted to \u00a313.3m (\u00a38.3m in 2016/17). Capital investment in 2018/19 is expected to be \u00a316.6m including the planned development work on the theatres and critical care redevelopment. Other features of the SOFP The level of cash deposits decreased from \u00a38.0 m at 31 March 20 17 to \u00a34.9m at 31 March 2018. 27 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Other a ccounting matters Note 3 3 of the accounts outlines any related party transactions. This shows that none of the Board members, or key management staff, or parties related to them, has undertaken any material transactions with the Trust. In line with the requirements for foundation trusts to prepare accounts in compliance with International Reporting Standards, the Trust has reviewed all of its accounting policies for the year ended 31 March 2018 . No material changes have been made to those used in 2016 /17. The Trust Board acts as the corporate Trustee for the Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust General Charitable Funds, registered with the Charities Commission. This charity also administers charitable funds on behalf of Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The charity continues to receive donations from benefactors and uses these funds for the benefit of b oth patients and staff. The charitable fund ann ual report and accounts for 2017/18 are published separately and are available from the Trust on request. Future plans The financial position of the Trust continues to be challenging. The Trust plan for the 2018/19 financial year has a forecast deficit of \u00a311.2 m after taking i nto account savings plans of 3.4 % of turnover . Interim revenue support will be required to support operational delivery. The Trust continues to work closely with system partners to address the significant financial challenges in Somerset. .................................

The Board has resolved that certain powers and decisions may only be exercised by the Board in formal session. Guidance is available in the Trust's standing financial instructions to determine the Board or Committee from which approval of decisions is required. The Council of Governors is made up of elected and nominated governors who provide an important link between the hospital, local people and key organisations, sharing information and views that can be used to develop and improve services. It is chaired by the Trust Chairman. The Lead Governor is Mike Bickersteth. The Council cons ists of 29 governors: 15 publicly elected governors from four constituencies (Taunton, West Somerset, East Somerset and Rest of England).

The Council of Governors has three sub -committees which meet outside the formal meetings of the full Council. The committees a re chaired by public governors and focus on specific issues in relation to strategy, patient care and membership and communications. The committees provide reports and recommendations, as appropriate, for consideration by the Council of Governors. The Tr ust's non - executive and executive directors regularly attend the Council of Governors and the sub-committee meetings on a regular basis, to develop an understanding of the views of governors and members. Governors are also encouraged to attend and obser ve meetings of the Board as part of their role. In addition, the Council of Governors has an Appointments Committee which is responsible for considering the remuneration, terms of employment and performance of the non -executive directors of the Trust Boar d (including the Chairman).

A copy is available on the Trust's website at www.tsft.nhs.uk (as part of the Council of Governors' meeting papers) or by emailing governors@tst.nhs.uk It is not considered that there are any significant interests held by governors which may confl ict with their responsibilit ies, but it should be noted that Judith Goodchild is also Chair of Healthwatch and as such does not comment on the Trust's quality report in this capacity. Engagement with members We recognis e the importance of having a strong and engaged membership. With circa 16,900 members (public and staff combined), the Trust has access to the local population, interaction with which helps to improve hospital services. The focus of the Trust's membership strategy, which is set and monitored by the Board, is on improving meaningful engagement with its members. In support of this aim, the Trust engages with its members via email, through the publication of Musgrove Matters (which is a popular communication tool) and through events and meetings such as the annual members' meeting held in September each year. The Trust's membership (which is reviewed by the Communication and Engagement Working Group on behalf of the Council of Governors and the Board), is br oadly representative of the population it serves. According to 2011 census data, the majority of Somerset residents are 'white British'. Somerset also has an increasingly older population, and the Trust's membership reflects this trend. Contact informat ion for members Members may contact governors via a dedicated e -mail address at governors@tst.nhs.uk or through the website at www.tsft.nhs.uk Membership as at 31 March 2018 Public membership *Based on 2001 Census data Constituency Number of Members 31.3.18 Number of Members 31.3.17 increase/ decrease Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Staff membership* *In 2017/18, the Trust undertook a quality assurance assessment of the membership database (for staff) to ensure that the data aligns with that Trust's internal electronic staff record. As part of this process we no longer include bank staff in the staff category and the lower figure for staff in 2018 reflects this adjustment. In 2018/19 further data cleansing will be undertaken to ensure the Trust's database is compliant with the requirements of GDPR coming into force in May 2018. Directors ' report The directors are required to prepare an annual report and accounts for each financial year. The directors consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for patients, regulators and stakeholders to assess the Trust's performance, business model and strategy. The Trust has complied with the cost allocation and charging guidance issued by HM Treasury. Statement of disclosure to the auditors So far as the director s are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Trust's auditor is unaware. The directors have taken all the steps th at they ought to have taken as director s in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the NHS foundation trust's auditor is aware of that information . Income disclosures The Trust has met the requirement set out in Section 43(2A) of the NHS Act 200 6 (as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2012) that income for the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England has been greater than its income from the provision of goods and services for any other purposes. The Trust has made no political or charitable donations. Better payment practice code The Trust is obliged to comply with the public sector's better payment p ractice code (BPPC), which targets the payment of all undisputed invoices by the later of the due date or 30 days following the receipt of goods or valid invoice. Constituency Number of Members 31.3.18 Number of Members year 4,240 5,128* (888)* 35 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Details of the Trust's compliance with this code are: 2017/18 2016/17 No invoices paid within target 653 4.938 990 7.103 Percentage of invoices paid 88,817 164.731 paid within target 42,077 2017/18 2016/17 paid 90,301 175.388 invoices paid within target 42,730 of invoices paid within target 47.3% 65.3% 64.4% 69.3% The Trust did not incur any interest liability for late payment of invoices. Internal audit function, appointment/reappointment and removal of external auditor and audit committee role The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board. A s part of its role , the Audit Committee seeks assurance on the adequacy of internal control processes within the Trust . To achieve the required levels of assurance, the Committee utilises the various audit functions of management, internal auditors (BDO) and external auditors (PwC) and counter fraud . This meets mandatory NHS audit standards. The Audit Committee also takes assurance from the views of other external agencies about the Trust's procedures and f rom the Governance and Quality Committee and Finance Committee . The Audit Committee has the right to enquire into any area of the Trust's w orkings without hindrance. The Audit Committee agrees the internal audit work plan each year and receives the reports and follow -ups on the issues raised. The internal audit plan is based on the Trust's assurance framework and corporate risk register and is reviewed by the Trust's committee of the Board. Where audits of major issues or risks are identified, managers who are responsible for the areas reviewed are asked to attend the Audit Committee meeting and report on the steps taken to rectify the s ituation. As for 2016/17 , the internal auditors, BDO, have provided a moderate assurance opinion for 2017/18 that the Trust has a sound system of internal control. 36 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The Audit Committee reviews and monitors the external auditor's independence, objectiv ity and effectiveness at least once per year. The Audit Committee also reviews any non -audit work carried out by the external auditor to ensure that the objectivity and indep endence of the external auditor is not impaired. The Audit Committee discusses the audit of the Trust's annual report and accounts with the external auditor prior to the Board's approval, in particular any areas of concern arising from work during the year. The Trust's external a udit services are cur rently supplied by PwC and the current contract was initially awarded for a 3 year period commencing on 1 April 2014 and expires on 30 September 2018 having been extended. Given the alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust it seemed sensibl e to align the external audit contract provider across the two trusts and a procurement exercise has been undertaken with the aim to award separate contracts but to the same provider for the two t rusts with a commencement date of 1 July 2018. The cost of other non -audit work undertaken during 2017/18 was \u00a32k. Other non - audit assurance services amounted to \u00a30k. The Audit Committee approved the external audit plan 2017 -18 which outlined how PwC planned to discharge its audit duties for the financial year. The Audit Committee considered the risks which were thought to be either significant in relation to PwC's audit for the year ended 31 March 2018: Risk of management override of controls. Risk of fraud in revenue and expenditure recognition. Valuation of the Trust's land and buildings. Going concern. Throughout the year, the Audit C ommittee has received and reviewed progress reports from PwC in deliveri ng its responsibilities as the T rust's external auditor, together with other matters of interest such as key technical areas and sector updates. The Audit C ommittee has confirmed throughout the year that the risks identified in the external audit plan have remained valid. The Audit Committee receives and monitors the policies and procedures associated with c ounter fraud . The Trust's counter fraud manager produces a regular counter fraud progress report, giving updates on both reactive and pro -active work and assists the Trust in ensuring it has policies that are compliant with the NHS Counter Fraud Authority and all standards for NHS providers. NHS Improvement's well -led framework The Trust has a governance policy that describes the arrangements in place for quality governance, including committee structures, accountabilities and reporting requirements. These governance arrangements are discussed in detail in the annual governance statement and quality report . 37 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 No material inconsistencies have been identified between the annual governance statement and the report from the Trust's Care Quality Commission ( CQC) inspection in 2017. Following receipt of the report in November 2017, an action plan has been developed to address the issues raised. This is monitored by the Trust's executive CQC steering group which reports to the Governance and Quality Committee . Overall the Trust was rated as \"good\" in its inspection. The quality report in appendix 1 details the range of work in which the Trust is involved aimed at improving patient care and stakeholder engagement. Details about the Trust's implementation of NHS Improvement's well-led framework can be found in the annual governance statement. There is a system for internal control that includes the assurance framework and the Trust has an ongoing process for providing assurance on, and improving, the governance of quality, overseen by the Trust's Governance and Quality Committee.

Peter Lewis, Chief Executive, 24 May 2018 Remuneration Report Non-audited information The Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises the non - executive directors and determines the level of remuneration, terms of service for the Chief Executive and other executive directors. It supports the work of the Chairman in assessing the size, structure and skill requirements of the Board. The remuneration elemen t of the Committee is chaired by the Senior Independent Director, Kate Fallon, and the nomination element of the Committee is chaired by the Trust's Chairman, Colin Drummond. At present, the Trust employs colleagues under a number of pay and conditions of service (medical and dental contracts, agenda for change and spot salaries). Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust is amongst one of the very few trusts to have taken advantage of freedoms to implement local terms and conditions for some senior le aders (all executive directors and circa 24 other senior managers) who would ordinarily be subject to nationally agreed agenda for change or very senior manager (VSM ) terms. For this group, performance is directly linked to annual pay progression. This includes both objectives and also leadership behaviours. The process of calibration has been introduced to enable reviewers to compare performance in a more objective way. Uplifts are determined by taking a % of the current salary value across this group. Annual pay uplifts are then determined on performance, typically this is in the order of 0% for individuals rated as a 1, 1% for individuals rated as a 2, 1.7% for i ndividuals rated as a 3 and 2% for individuals rated as a 4. In determining pay, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee seeks to strike a balance between setting pay at a level sufficient to recruit, retain and reward individuals of a high calibre and ensuring best value in the use of public finances. Although staff are not formally consulted on pay rates, increases are set in line with those staff on agenda for change national terms and conditions. For senior staff on spot salaries, performance relat ed pay rises have been made available to ensure that the spot salaries keep pace with pay rises elsewhere in the workforce. 49 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The Trust's very senior managers' pay policy (for those on spot salaries) provides arrangements that are designed to: Recruit, ret ain and motivate high calibre staff recognising that roles and individuals covered by this policy will be crucial to the success of the Trust. Provide a framework that allows local flexibility and responsiveness to competitive conditions for roles but that is fair and equitable. Be consistent with the principles of other pay reforms, such as agenda for change and the consultant contract. Rewa rd performance in an objective and consistent way. Ensure salary levels represent value for money and within the context of the market situation. Take account of the salary benchmark in equivalent roles nationally, within the region and within neighbouri ng trusts, in the public sector (and private sector where appropriate). In some cases, an additional responsibility payment may be paid where individual senior managers are required to take on significant responsibilities outside of their core role for an extended period. The allowance should be linked to the proportion of time spent on the additional responsibilities and would not normally exceed 10% of basic salary. Executive members of the Board are employed on contracts with no fixed or specified term , save for the Chief Medical Officer , who is subject to a three year fixed term in respect of his executive role. Notice periods for executive members of the Board are set at six months. No provision is made for a dditional termination payments. One director was paid \u00a352,000 in lieu of notice during the year. The costs were shared equally between Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The Remuneration Committee is the body charged with determining pa yments for loss of office. There is no policy for such payments. Instead, the Committee makes individual decisions on the rare occasions where such payments may be warranted. These decisions relate to both the award of a loss of office payment and on the value of any such payment. The Committee is free to exercise its discretion, and bases its decisions on the circumstances of the loss of office, the performance of the office - holder, and any other factors deemed relevant. See page 52 onwards for salary and pension entitlements for senior managers. See page 37 onwards for details of the membership and attendance of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. 50 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The Trust is required to disclose the steps it has taken to satisfy itself that the remunera tion is reasonable in cases where senior managers are paid more than \u00a3150,000 p.a. There are two senior managers currently employed by the Trust who were paid more than \u00a3150,000p .a. (the Chief Executive and the Chief Medical Officer). The salaries for these posts have been benchmarked and are commensurate with national, regional and local comparator roles within the NHS, reflecting the very high levels of responsibility associated with t he posts , particularly as these individuals have also been appointed to these roles within Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust . Fair Pay - audited information The mid-point banded remuneration of the highest -paid director in Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust in the financial year 2017/18 was \u00a3195,000 to \u00a3200,000 (2016/17: \u00a3190,000 to \u00a3195,000). Reporting bodies are required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration of the highest paid director in the ir organisation and the median remuneration of the organisation's workforce. This was 7.8 times (201 7/18: 7.8) the median remuneration of the workforce, which was \u00a3 25,197 (2016/17 : \u00a325,074). In 201 7/18, one employee received remuneration in excess of the highest -paid director (2016/17: 1 ). Total remuneration includes salary, non -consolidated performance -related pay, benefits -in-kind of which there were none in 2017/18 . It does not include severance payments, employer pension contributions and the ca sh equivalent transfer value of pensions. The calculation is based on full -time equivalent staff of the reporting entity at the reporting period end date on an annualised basis . Where there is a sharing arrangement, it is the cost to the entity of an i ndividual that identifies them as \"highest paid\" and not the total of that individual's remuneration. Termination benefits are excluded from the calculation of the highest -paid director's salary to avoid disturbing the ratio. During 2017/18 the Tru st appointed a joint executive team with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. This increased the composition and the responsibilities of the executive team, who now operate across both trusts as part of an alliance to deliver more joined -up health s ervices for the population of Somerset. This is reflected in their remuneration ( see page 52 onwards ). There was no pay freeze for staff in 2017/18. 51 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Expenses of the governors and directors - non-audited information Expenses of the governors There were a total of 32 governors in office during the reporting period and there were 14 governors who claimed expenses in that time (reflecting the elections in year). See p age 30 onwards for more information. The aggregate sum of expenses paid to governors in the 2017/18 reporting period is \u00a32,627 (2016/17 reporting period is \u00a35,375 ).

The CETV is the actuarially assessed capitalised value of the pension scheme benefits accumulated by a member at a particular point in time. The benefits valued are the member's accumulated benefits and any contingent spouse's pension payable from the scheme. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. 59 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The real increase in CETV ref lects the increase in CETV effectively funded by the employer. It takes account of the increase in accrued pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee (including the value of any benefits transferred from another scheme or arrangement) and uses common market valuation factors for the start and end of the period. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership o f the pension scheme, not just their service in a senio r capacity to which the disclosure applies. The CETV figures, and from 2004 -05 the other pension details, include the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to the NHS pe nsion scheme. They also i nclude any additional pension benefit accrued to the member as a result of their purchasing additional years of pension service in t he scheme at their own cost.

This is a good opportunity to understand and address the root causes of gender inequality in our society, and we are looking at how we can best do this in the local NHS. At Musgrove men and women are paid equally for the same jobs, but we do have a greater number of men in higher paid jobs and a greater percentage of women in lower banded and part time roles, which has created a gender pay gap. We will be examining more closely the drivers behind the pay gap and looking at what actions we can take to improve the position. There is a national challenge to attract more women into medicine and other higher paying roles and more men into care roles so that talent guides career choices, not gender stereotypes, and we will continue to do what we can to address this. The Trust plans to take further analysis in the coming months in order to understand the potential cause s for the pay gap seen for 2016/17 and the ways of mitigating these causes. This will include looking at other acute t rusts' gender pay g ap submissions and analysis of how we have changed when looking at the period for 2017/ 18. In line with national guidance, the data for 2017/18 will be published on our website by April 2019.

The Trust's Health and Safety Committee and the Safety Environment and Advisors Group (SEAG) are effective meetings that ensure structures and processes are in place to successfully manage health and safety. Safety topic leads report to SEAG either directly or via specialist safety meetings such as the Fire Safety Committee. SEAG is chaired by the health and safety advisor who is responsible for ensuring that a structure is in place to mana ge the health and safety functions for the 24 topic leads that report into it. This includes policy consultation, development and approval, monitoring of policy implementation plans, policy monitoring and action plan updates. This work schedule aligns wi th the Quality Assurance Committee (QAC). Policies are in place for health and safety related topics along with a robust system for policy monitoring. This reports in to the SEAG work schedule. Incidents reported to the HSE under RIDDOR The Reporting o f Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulation (RIDDOR) requires the Trust to report deaths, certain types of injury, some occupational diseases and dangerous occurrences that 'arise out of or in connection with work'. An annual RIDDOR report h as been prepared and considered in the relevant fora. All RIDDORs are fully investigated and monitored. An overview of all RIDDORs is a standing agenda item on the safety committees. During 2017/18, the Trust reported 24 incidents to the Health and Safe ty Executive as detailed in the table below. This is a slight decrease from the 26 incidents during 2016/17. Of the 24 incidents, six were classified in the major incident category due to the nature of injuries that were sustained. 64 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The following two tables are an extract from the annual report and give an indication of the total number of RIDDORs year on year and breakdown by cause. Number of RIDDOR reports made to the Health and Safety Executive 2013/14 - 2017/18 Comparison of RIDDORs by cause 2015/16 - Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Counter fraud Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust supports the NHS Counter Fraud Authority strategy that aims to reduce fraud within the NHS. We are committed to the prevention, detection and investigation of any such allegations and will seek to apply criminal, disciplinary, regulatory and civil sanctions where allegations are upheld. This includes the recovery of identified losses to ensure that NHS resources are used for their intended purpo se - the delivery of patient care. The Trust employs a counter fraud manager who conducts both proactive and reactive work to ensure that resources are not wrongfully diverted from patient care and there is a robust anti-fraud, bribery and corruption policy in place. All colleagues, contractors, vendors and patients are encouraged to report concerns to the Trust's local counter fraud manager or NHS Counter Fraud Authority. Support for colleague health and wellbeing The Trust works hard to look after its people and to keep them well. There is an employee assistance programme provided by Right Management Workplace Wellness which offers around the clock access to free and confidential advice and support for all staff. The workplace wellness team helps colleagues to proactively identify, plan and manage life events and helps them to stay in control, happy, healthy and fully focused on life and work. The Trust actively participated in Wellbeing Month in March to suppor t colleagues in taking care of themselves, which in turn helps them to take better care of our patients. Staff policies and actions applied during the financial year The Trust's recruitment and selection policy ensures that full and fair consideration i s given to applications for employment made by disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. This is further enhanced by the Trust's special leave policy and probationary period policy , which have specific provisions to ensur e that the needs of disabled persons are taken into account. Such policies apply to those who become disabled persons during the year, and the Trust is also compliant with the Equalities Act, which requires the provision of tailored measures to ensure that the needs of disabled employees are met. Many of the Trust's policies in regard to training, career development and promotion make no specific provisions for employees with disabilities. However, all employees are treated equally, and provisions are made for reasonable adjustments where required. We work hard to engage our people in all that we do. Our executive and non - executive directors, as well as our governors, visit areas across the hospital to hear feedback from staff directly. Also, the Trust's Chief Executive encourages colleagues to share their feedback honestly and easily and there are regular drop -in sessions for colleagues to meet with the executive director team. A variety of direct and confidential communication channels are provided thr ough the intranet, email and paper forms. Employees are provided with information on matters of concern to them. There are a range of communication and engagement tools that are utilised: 66 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 A weekly staff bulletin, managers ' briefing, Board briefing and g overnors' briefing. Executive director drop -in sessions. A team brief (with key strategic messages and operational performance) published on a monthly basis, key points from which are presented to colleagues (all of whom are invited) by the executive directors and dialogue encouraged. Urgent and important notices are sent by email to all colleagues. The use of social media as a form of interaction and communication (including Facebook and Twitter). Sharing information on the intranet, on which there is a comprehensive combination of organisational news, publications, database of policies and patient information, departmental information and information about colleague benefits. Some questionnaires ar e also hosted in this way. The Trust takes concerns raised by colleagues and patients very seriously and has processes in place to enable staff to raise concerns without fear of reprisal, further information about this is available on the Trust's intranet pages. We aim to create a culture where colleagues, patients and carers are able to speak out when concerned about safety, quality or how we are demonstrating our values. We know there will be occasions when we don' t get things right; which is why encouraging colleagues and patients to raise concerns openly as part of normal day - to-day practice is an important part of improving the quality of the service we provide, patient safety and experience. In 2016/17, the Tru st appointed freedom to speak up guardians and they play a key role in helping to raise the profile of raising concerns. Colleagues can confidentially speak to them for advice and support in relation to concerns they have about patient safety and/or the w ay their concern has been handled. They help to foster an environment that is open and honest and to support a culture where colleagues feel comfortable about raising concerns and issues, no matter how big or small. During 2017/18 the freedom to speak up guardians have been raising awareness of their role across the Trust. Staff survey Colleague engagement continues to be a key priority for the Trust. Engagement is measured through the internal pulse check survey, which asks 13 questions to identify how colleagues feel about their line manager and key areas of engagement. The pulse check survey includes the two staff friends and family questions, asking staff if they would recommend to their friends and family the Trust as a place to work and as a pla ce to have care or treatment. In addition, the annual NHS staff survey is used to measure engagement. The Trust's top and bottom performing staff survey results are as follows, with comparator information against last year and against the national aver age: 67 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Response Rate 2016/17 2017/18 Trust improvement / deterioration (%) Trust Trust Benchmarking group (trust type) average Rate 48% 40% 44% Deterioration (8%) Top 5 ranking scores Question 2016/17 2017/18 Trust improvement / deterioration (%) Trust Trust Benchmarki ng group (trust type) average KF10.

Percentage of staff reporting errors, near misses or incidents witnessed in the last month. 92% 91% 90% Deterioration (1%) In 2017/18, the Trust invited all colleagues to participate in the survey and responses were received from 1746 (40%). This is below the average response rate of 44% for 2017 and lower than the Trust's 2016 response rate of 48%. The completed responses are representative of the makeup of the organisation, making the results statistically valid. The NHS staff survey measures overall en gagement by looking at three areas: The willingness to recommend the Trust as a place to work and to receive care. The level of motivation at work. The ability to contribute to improvements at work. The scoring methodology uses a weighted average where if every colleague answered \"strongly agree\" to all questions, the overall score for the Trust would = 5. If every colleague answered \"strongly disagree\" to all questions, the overall score for the Trust would = 1. The overall score for our Trust in 201 7 was 3.91, which is an increase compared to 2016, and sees the Trust being ranked the highest (best) 20% of all acute trusts. Future priorities and targets The Trust's overall colleague engagement score has improved on last year and was ranked within the top 20% of acute trusts in 2017, and we are very pleased that colleagues have reported that their motivation at work has significantly improved. 69 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The Trus t is in the top five trusts in the south of England for the number of colleagues who said they would recommend the hospital as a place to work or have treatment. The Trust is also in the top 20% in England for support being available to colleagues from im mediate managers, effective team working and recognition when they do a good job. Of the bottom five scores, three are benchmarked as being within the national average for acute trusts, only two are ranked as below average, with one of these having shown improvement. Some of the areas where we have done less well include the reporting and experiencing of bullying, harassment, physical violence and reporting of near misses or incidents. We will be developing an action plan to specifically target these is sues, but in the meantime we have already put training in place to ensure colleagues are equipped to support patients with mental health issues. We are training acute colleagues to de -escalate challenging situations and where this may not work how to keep themselves and the patient safe. Focus groups were run last summer at the hospital to look in depth at some of the issues underlying the responses last year and we are now beginning to implement our plans - such as specialist training sessions for colleag ues, which help our acute colleagues to draw on the expertise within the alliance to deal with situations that are becoming more frequent. The Trust is currently developing a people strategy jointly with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and will ensure that the key themes and actions arising from the staff survey are addressed as part of its implementation. Expenditure on consultancy The Trust spent \u00a3 0.2m on consultancy during the financial year. This expenditure was mainly on well led and workforce reviews (\u00a30.06m), business development for the Somerset Cancer Register (\u00a30.04m) and estate valuation (\u00a30.04m). Off-payroll arrangements - audited informati on The Trust has a robust policy in place in respect of any off -payroll arrangements.

The framework looks at five themes: Quality of care . Finance and use of resources . Operational performance . Strategic change . Leadership and improvement capabili ty (well -led). Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A Trust will only be in segments 3 or 4 where it has bee n found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. 72 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The single oversight framework applied from quarter 3 of 2016/17. Prior to this, Monitor's risk assessment framework (RAF) was in place. Information for the prior year and first two quarters of 2016/17 relating to the RAF has not been presented as the basis of accountability was different. This is in line with NHS Improvement's guidance for annual reports. Segmentation The Trust has been placed in segment 3 under the new single oversight framework . This s egmentation information is the T rust's position as at 31 March 2018 . Current segmentation information for NHS trusts and foundation trusts is published on NHS Improvement's website. Finance and use of resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4', where '1' reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding into the single oversight framework , the segmentation of the Trust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score here.

The relevant responsibilities of the accounting officer, including their responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which they are answerable, and for the keeping of proper accounts, are set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accou nting Officer Memorandum issued by NHS Improvement. NHS Improvement, in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor by the NHS Act 2006, has given Accounts Directions which require Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust to prepare for each financial y ear a statement of accounts in the form and on the basis required by those Directions. The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Taunton and Somerset NHS foundation trust and of its income and expenditure, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the accounts, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care's Group Accounting Manual and in particular to: Observe the Accounts Direction issued by NHS Improvement, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis . Make judgements and estimates on a reasonable b asis. State whether applicable accounting standards as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual (and the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual ) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures i n the financial statements . Ensure that the use of public funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities and guidance and Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The accounting officer is responsible for keeping pr oper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS foundation trust and to enable him/her to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned Act. The Accounting Of ficer is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the NHS foundation trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . Peter Lewis, Chief Executive, 24 May 2018 74 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Annual Governance Statement Scope of responsibility As Accountable Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am per sonally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Trust Accountable Officer Memorandum . The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to a chieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of th e policies, aims and objectives of Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of inter nal control has been in place in Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2018 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. Capacity to handle risk The Trust has identified an executive director with re sponsibility for progressing risk management in the organisation. The Chief Nurse has clearly defined risk management responsibilities and is supported by the Head of Integrated Governance. As from 1 April 2018, executive responsibility for risk manageme nt will transfer to the Director of Governance and Corporate Development. The Chief Operating Officer has overall accountability for the day to day delivery of risk management activity within the clinical directorates. Responsibilities for risk managemen t are clearly defined within job descriptions for all of these roles. The Trust's governance support unit is responsible for providing appropriate training, support and guidance to enable all managers to carry out their risk management responsibilities. Specific training courses on risk management for managers, risk assessment, incident management and investigation are supported by a corporate induction and mandatory update programme covering all regulatory requirements. The Chief Nurse and Chief Operat ing Officer are key members of the Trust's Executive Committee, where the risk register is reviewed monthly to ensure operational risks are being adequately controlled. 75 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The Chief Nurse chairs the Trust's key operational management group for governance, t he Quality Assurance Committee (QAC), and the Head of Integrated Governance is a member of this committee. The QAC meets monthly to monitor progress with corporate and operational plans and receive assurance reports and improvement plans from nominated le ads on all regulatory requirements in accordance with its reporting schedule. The Trust's Serious Incident Review Group meets regularly to share issues raised following incidents, complaints, concerns and claims, along with information from other key sour ces, such as morbidity and mortality reviews. This enables sharing of good practice and lessons learned via directorate governance structures and allows for direct input into the Trust's improvement programme. The Audit Committee has responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of the Trust's risk management systems and for reviewing and challenging the organisation's risk appetite and maturity. The risk and control framework The Trust's governance polic y details how risk will be identified, evaluated and managed. It gives details of the monitoring arrangements and the authority for decision -making through identified posts or committees. The main methods for the identification of risk are: Review of comp liance with key standards, for example the Care Quality Commission (CQC) registration requirements, and legislation such as the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974). Executive review of annual and strategic objectives to identify potential risks to meetin g those objectives. Local risk assessment at departmental level, feeding up to divisional risk registers. Facilitated risk identification sessions at various levels in the organisation. Incident reporting and complaints information. Information from ex ternal sources such as the Care Quality Commission's (CQC) inspection, audits and patient and staff surveys. 76 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 All risks are assessed and evaluated using a standard form and scoring system, allowing direct comparison. From this evaluation, risks are categorised into one of three accountability levels, and responsibility for the control and monitoring of the risk is allocated to the departmen t, the directorate or the Trust's executive team, depending on the level identified. Responsibility for comple ting actions is allocated to an individual manager, with monitoring carried out by the relevant directorate committee or Trust executive director. The three accountability levels are set based on the Trust's risk appetite, which is regularly reviewed by t he Board. Risk identification is linked to the setting of organisational objectives, as detailed in the Trust's board assurance framework. Capital planning includes an assessment of risk issues, and spending is prioritised on a risk basis. All papers c onsidered by the Board are referenced to the risks they are aimed at addressing. The board assurance framework links to the significant risks that may affect the Trust achieving its objectives, how they are currently controlled and what sources of assuran ce the Board has that the risks are being managed appropriately. It also details action that is necessary to reduce the risks or improve sources of assurance, with prioritisation based on the standard Trust risk evaluation process. Information and data s ecurity risks are identified and managed through the Trust's risk assessment and incident reporting processes. The Trust has established an Information Governance Steering Group to monitor this process and provide assurance on the systems in place for mana ging information risks. As part of its ongoing commitment to risk management, the governance support unit develops an annual plan, monitored by the Governance and Quality Committee that includes key risk management objectives. The Trust's internal work p lan is linked to key risks. Assurance on compliance with Care Quality Commission (CQC) registration requirements, along with other key regulatory requirements, is provided to the Governance and Quality Committee via the work of the Quality Assurance Commi ttee (QAC). The QAC reviews the assurances in place for all requirements in line with an annual plan, providing regular updates to the Governance and Quality Committee. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the CQC. The Trust involves its key stakeholders in managing risks which impact on them in a variety of ways and the Council of Governors has a key role in supporting and challenging the Board. The Trust's key risks for 2017/18 were : Financial challenges and f ailure to achieve control total . Operational pressures having an impact on the quality of care provision and the delivery of the Trust's operational performance standards (RTT, 62 day cancer, diagnostic waiting times and A&E). 77 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Management of demand across the system, particularly in emergency care . Age of the estate . Key clinical staffing vacancies, particularly in nursing. Recruitment, training and retention of key clinical staff. In 2018/19 and into the longer -term, there are a number of similar, key strategic risks facing by Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust relating to financial, operational and staffing challenges across the Somerset health and care system , including cash flow and the ageing estate . The Tr ust will continue to look at how these risks can be mitigated through the alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and by working more closely with other partners in Somerset and in neighbouring counties and as part of the sustainability and transformation plan (STP). There are no significant risks relating to compliance with the NHS foundation trust condition four relating to corporate governance. As part of its internal audit plan, the Trust undertakes reviews of its governance and risk management arrangements. Also, in 2017 the Trust commissioned Deloitte LLP jointly with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to undertake an independent review of its governance arrangements using NHS Improvement's well -led framework. In preparation for the review, which commenced in September 2017, the Trust completed a self - assessment aligned to Monitor's 2015 well -led framework. NHS Improvement's revised 2017 well -led framework was, however, subsequently published and the review has therefore bee n aligned to take account of the new key lines of enquiry. Deloitte used the following methodology in their assessment: Reviewing the Trust's self -assessment . Undertaking 1.5 hour interviews with Board members during September and October 2017 . Undertaking 1 hour interviews with senior members of staff during September and October 2017 . Observing a range of Board, committee and directorate meetings during September and October 2017 . Undertaking visits to a range of frontline and support service areas in October 2017 . Distributing and analysing online surveys to Board members, colleagues and governors. Carrying out 30 minute interviews with a range of external stakeholders . 78 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Following discussion with the Trust, Deloitte did not undertake any st aff or Governor focus groups. Some discussion with staff and governors did take place as part of 1:1 interviews, service visits and meeting attendance . The recommendations from the review have been captured into an action plan agreed by the Board with tim escales for completion. An update on progress will be presented to the Board in September 2018. The Trust has further developed its risk management processes to ensure that relevant and up to date risk information is available at all key meetings, ensuring that decisions are based on robust assessments of risk. The Trust has an open and fair culture , encouraging incident reporting to enable the hospital to learn and improve as part of its core business. As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contai ned within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately up dated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The trust has undertaken risk ass essments and Carbon Reduction Delivery Plans are in place in accordance with emergency preparedness and civil contingency requirements, as based on UKCIP 2009 weather projects, to ensure that this organisation's obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with. Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation 's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The Trust has undertaken risk assessments, and carbon delivery plans are in place, in accordance with emergency preparedness and civil contingency requirements, as based on UKCIP 2009 weather projects, to ensure that the Trust's obligations under the Climate Change Act and the adaptation reporting requirements are complied with. Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources An important part of the Trust's responsibility is that the Trust assesses and reviews the financial sustainability of the organisation. As such the Trust has considered the scale of the financial challenges it is facing over the next 12 month period. As a consequence it is clear there is material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. T his specifically relates to the impact on the cash position of the Trust in 2018/19. However, after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has adequate resources to continue in operatio nal existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Trust continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. 79 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 Throughout the year the Finance Committee and the Board have closely monitored the financial position and the impact of the significant operational pressures on the delivery of the Trust's financial plan. The Trust ensures economy, efficiency and effectiveness through a variety of means, including: A robust pay and non -pay budgetary control system. A suite of effecti ve and consistently applied financial controls. Effective tendering procedures. Continuous service and cost improvement. The Trust benchmarks efficiency in a variety of ways, including the national reference costs index and by comparison with the annual s urpluses generated by all foundation trusts. Information governance The Trust had one serious information governance incident that was reported to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Survey data which was being processed by a 3rd party was not anonymised when sent to another 3rd party processor. Appropriate action was taken and the data was deleted and a review undertaken. The ICO confirmed that no action would be taken as appropriate technical and organisational measures were taken agains t the unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data. The incident appeared to have been contained , and remains contained, so it is unlikely any significant detriment will re sult from it. Annual Quality Account The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare quality reports for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise o f those powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual quality reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual . The Chief Nurse leads the development of the annual quality report . Key stakeholders are involved in the development of the report. The development of the priorities and indicators was based on all types of patient feedback over the year, with the Council of Governors approving the final list of priorities. The Head of Integrated Governance, supported by the governance support unit, clinical information analysts, clinical audit facilitators and other specialists, has coordinated the preparation of the quality report . Controls are in place to ensure that all the Trust's employees have the appropriate skills and expertise to perform their duties. This includes the provision of relevant training and helps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data collected and prepa red by employees and which is used to assess the quality of the Trust's performance. 80 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The quality metrics included in the report have been regularly reported through Trust governance structures, including the G overnance and Quality Committee, Trust Board and Council of Governors where appropriate. Data quality issues are addressed through the Trust's information governance systems in line with its information and data quality policy. The metrics include key measures developed with the Trust's principal commissioners, the Somerset CCG, to provide them with assurance that the Trust is providing high quality care. Additional measures relating to patient experience are provided by the monthly assessments that the Trust has established, overseen by the Trust's Patient Experience Committee. The quality report presents a fair and balanced view of the activities of the Trust, based on data which is subject to rigorous quality control as well as internal and external audit. The data used to inform the quality report is overseen by the Trust's Information team and the governance support unit, in compliance with the policies and procedures in place to ensure the quality of data. The Trust has a robust process for the measurement of performance, which triangulates quality, workforce and financial indicators. The Trust's approach is known as the PAF (performance assurance framework) process. Each directorate has its own PAF, split into four areas: patients, people, operational delivery and finance / improvement. Th is is similar to a balanced scorecard approach, in line with the recommendations of Lord Carter's recent review of NHS services. The PAF is reviewed monthly. The process involves the directorate manager, directorate clinical director, representatives from HR, finance, the operational performance and information teams and others. Each directorate reports on numerous indicators across the four PAF domains. These include all key clinical, operational and financial targets to ensure that the NHS mandate, NHS c onstitution, local quality and financial targets are met. PAF meetings (and indeed Trust Board meetings) begin with a patient story to put the work of the directorate into a patient context and bring the indicators \"to life\" in relation to patient care. W here indicators are red, these are specifically discussed, as are areas of good practice. Selected early warning indicators are also analysed with a view to prevent them deteriorating. The PAF meetings also include a review of all high scoring risks (i.e. risks scoring 12 or above) to ensure the Trust is appropriately sighted upon the risks to service delivery, including access times, quality, workforce and finance. The Trust faces risks to its performance in a number of key areas, especially in relation to high levels of demand, but continues to take action to mitigate these risks wherever possible. Along with its regularly reviewed business continuity plans, this allows the Trust, as far as possible, to respond appropriately to uncertainty. 81 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 The purpose of the PAF process is to enable effective triangulation of performance, finance and quality issues and to take the necessary remedial action to improve them all. An aggregated PAF is presented to the Board on a monthly basis, highlighting key areas of goo d and poor performance. The Board uses the information presented at the PAF to direct work and resources to the remediation of issues and the continuing improvements in those areas of quality and productivity where performance is good. The Trust monitors performance against numerous local and national targets through the PAF process as described above. One of the areas included on the PAF is elective waiting times. Elective waiting lists are validated by a dedicated data quality team on a daily basis to ensure the correct patients are being booked (i.e. in priority and chronological order) and that reported performance is accurate. Booking teams and admin staff also contribute to the validation of waiting lists. Performance against RTT and pending list targets is reviewed in weekly meetings with each specialty team where any data anomalies are identified and fed back to the data quality team for further investigation. Review of effectiveness As Accountable Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS trust who ha ve responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the information provided in this annual report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board and the Audit C ommittee and a plan to address weaknesses an d ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The board assurance framework provides me with evidence that the effectiveness of controls that manage the risks to the organisation achieving its principal objectives have been reviewed. The most significant assurance on delivery of quality that informs my review is the ongoing assurance programme overseen by the Governance and Quality Committee. My review is also informed by: Feedback from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection in 2017 and the Trust's assurance process for monitoring levels of compliance with CQC standards of quality and safety. A review of compliance with NHS Improvement's single oversight framework . Programme of work undertaken by the Trust's internal auditors. Clinical audit annual programme, including relevant national audits. Deanery and college inspections. 82 Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017-18 National reporting and learning system incident report. In assessing and managing risk, the Board and its sub -committees have a substantial role to pla y in reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control as follows: Trust Board: Through the review of the Trust's corporate risk register, board assurance framework and key performance indicators. Audit Committee: Through the review of the in ternal audit programme of work, receipt of reports from external audit, and assurances gained through management reviews requested by the Audit Committee. Governance and Quality Committee: Through the review of the Care Quality Commission (CQC) registrat ion process, confirming the process by which the standards have been assessed, through the review and management of the Trust's risk register and quality assurance processes and the development of the governance policy and through oversight of the governan ce support unit's annual plan of improvement work. Conclusion No significant control issues have been identified. ..................... ....................

Putting together the Quality Account gives the Trust the opportunity to look at the successes and improvements we have made as well as the areas where we need greater focus in the future. We were pleased that the Care Quality Commission (CQC) gave us an overall rating of 'Good' when they inspected us in August 2017. The review focuse d on four core service areas - end of life care, urgent and emergency services, surgery and outpatients . The CQC found a number of examples of outstanding practice in these areas. This is well -deserved recognition for our staff , who, on a daily basis , go above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that patients are treated with compassion, kindness and respect. The complete ratings are detailed in the table below: Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 2 The CQC reported that since the hospital's previous inspectio n in 2016, significant improvements had been made. The CQC recognised the trust's commitment to high quality care, and highlighted our focus on improvement. The Trust identifies a series of quality priorities each year. These are selected with input from staff, governors, members and patient representatives before being signed off by the Board of Directors. We made substantial progress against our quality priorities for 2017/18 as described within our report . Our quality priorities for 2018/19 are: Learni ng from deaths Safer care Mental health and holistic care Patient experience Right care, right time, right place Staff retention and wellbeing Further information on achievements and progress made in relation to these priorities is found later on in this Q uality Account. There have been numerous quality improvements over the last year. Many of these have been led or supported by the Trust's dedicated improvement team, which spearheads improvement initiatives across all aspects of the Trust's work. Led by a clinical director, the improvement team comprises experts in project management, thus ensuring that benefits can be realised and sustained. All of these colleagues have been trained in improvement science and are able to use their skills to equip clinicia ns and managers to make significant improvements to services. This year, the improvement team launched a series of improvement boards, which are coordinating quality improvement projects across the Trust. Of the numerous successful improvements over the la st year, one notable example concerns the introduction of the Trust's new \"Integrated Front Door\" (IFD) service. This new approach to improving the experien ce of patients arriving at the Emergency D epartment has helped us control waiting times and patient flow throughout the rest of the hospital by reducing admissions. The IFD is a good example of how the Trust is increasingly working with partners from outside the hospital. The IFD service employs 18 GPs, who can use their expertise to ensure that patients presenting at the hospital are seen in the most appropriate way. This allows for the hospital's emergency doctors to focus their time on those patients who are more seriously ill . The Emergency Department has also been refurbished this year, with quality improvements including more paediatric assessment rooms and a new Mental Health assessment facility. The T rust continues to explore a closer alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, the provider of community and mental health services in Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 3 Somerset . One example has been the creation of a liaison psychiatry service, which began in January 2018. This new service will assess and treat patients who arrive at the hospital with mental health needs, many of whom have previously had to wait in inappr opriate settings to receive good care. The service is a significant expansion of what existed before, and operates across the whole of Somerset. There have been concerted efforts this year to improve the way we discharge patients, and to make sure that we help people return home earlier and more safely. The \"Home First\" initiative helps to achieve this. Average hospital stays have been reduced by half a day per peson , allowing people to return home , or go to a community hospital , for their assessment and r ehabilitation planning, rather than waiting in hospital. The Trust has been recognised in a number of awards for quality this year. The paediatric team won the Acute, Community and/or Primary Care Services Redesign Award at the HSJ (Health Service Journal ) Awards in London for their programme to take their clinics to local GP surgeries so that children and their parents can benefit from a more convenient and less daunting environment. The international Surgical Review Corporation declared Musgrove Park Hospital an international centre of excellence for bariatric surgery, making it the only hospital in the UK to have been reaccredited with this prestigious status. The Maternity service won an HSJ Patient Safety Award, and was nominated for a prestigious nati onal Butterfly Award for compassionate maternity care. Around the same time, the trust's Mary Stanley birthing unit became operational 24/7 for the first time in ten years, a significant improvement , giving greater choice for parents - to-be in Somerset. I hope you find the Quality Accounts interesting and informative. I would welcome any thoughts or feedback you would like to share. The Trust has a mechanism in place to identify any guidance issued by the Secretary of State and act upon it appropriately. T o the best of my knowledge and belief, the information in the Quality Account is accurate. Signed........................................................................

Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 5 PART TWO PRIORITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT AND STATEMENTS OF ASSURANCE FROM THE BOARD UPDATE ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES (QIP) 2017/18 In March 2017 the Trust Board agreed the following Key Quality Improvement Priorities (QIP) for 2017/18 : 1. Care of frail elderly patients and those patients with dementia 2. Partnership w orking linked to the Sustainability and Transformation Programme work relating to new models of care 3. Safer Care 4. Improving processes for discharging patients from hospital 5. Improving the experience of acute services for people with mental health needs 6. End of Life Care 7. Impro ving Patient Experience for Inpatient and Outpatient Care, Linked to the Priorities for the Trust's Improvement Work Producing a Quality Account is an opportunity for organisations to collect, review and analyse information relating to quality so that they can decide where improvement is needed , in such a way that it becomes part of core business . It can also help with benchmarking , or comparing ourselves, against other organisations. At Musgrove these processes are fundamental to our quarterly clinical qu ality review meetings with the commissioners and the development of agreed Commissioning Quality for Innovation targets (CQUINS) each year. Based on the wide ranging evidence already available in the Trust about patient safety and care , and looking at our progress with last year's CQUIN targets, several quality topics were identified as having room for improvement or focus. These topics were developed with the help of the Patient Care Group. QIP 2017/18 - Priority 1 - Care of fra il elderly patients and th ose patients with dementia Why this is important Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 6 The challenge of how the frail elderly are managed is one of the biggest clinical issues that acute hospitals face in the next decade. Over a third of all admissions are very frail, and they have increasingl y complex medical, social and psychological issues. This makes managing length of stay and the consequent availability of beds particularly challenging. What did we achieve? Escalation The 5 -day Older Persons Assessment and Liaison (OPAL) practitioner in Emergency Department was extended to 7 -day in October 2017. There was an increase from two to four practitioners to expand the service - they have now seen a total of 2,718 patients since the service started and 1,484 patients in 2017/18, which is a 58% in crease from the previous year. 53% of these patients have received a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. In total 35% discharged home directly from the Emergency Department by the OPAL practitioners. The OPAL unit has seen a total of 5,303 patients since opening and in 2017/18 saw 29% more patients than in the previous year, in part due to an increase in the OPAL bed base due to winter pressures. The length of stay in Medicine has been reduced for people aged 75 and over by 0.9 days. The Red Cross dischar ge service assisted 387 patients home in their first six months of operation. We are now reaching 80% of emergency admissions aged over 65 being screened for delirium on AMU and 90% of all patients with emergency admissions aged over 75 screened for demen tia. De-escalation The 5 -day week Orthopaedic Liaison Service now has cross cover of medical staff resulting in a far more consistent service. A 5-day week Surgical Liaison Service has been initiated - this has resulted in a reduced length of stay by 0.5 5 days. The percentage of frail older patients having a geriatrician review following an emergency laparotomy has increased from 17% to 90%. A 'Proactive care of the Older People undergoing Surgery' (POPS) nurse practitioner started December 2017, with al l patients aged over 70 with upper gastro -intestinal or colorectal surgery being assessed, if needed. Transition Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 7 A Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) taking a patient's current medical issues, co -morbidities, social and psychological factors into account is now available in the Emergency Department via the OPAL practitioners and JETT (Joint emergency Therapy Team), the OPAL unit through the Geriatricians and JETT, and on the surgical (Upper GI and Colorectal) wards through a combination of medical s taff and OPAL practitioners. Orthopaedic CGA are completed by medical staff and therapies. These assessments are a starting point in providing the same high level of care across all departments. QIP 2017/18 - Priority 2 - Partnership working, linked to t he Sustainability and Transformation Programme work relating to new models of care The Somerset Transformation Programme ( STP) sets out a number of priorities relating to new models of care, including the following that are directly relevant to Musgrove Park Hospital : Develop a consistent new model of urgent care across Somerset that focusses on integrating acute services, primary care and community urgent care. Redesign our acute front door to ensure a consistent, single access point for patients - integrating acute, mental health, primary / community services and social care and providing seamless access both in and out of hours. Focus on consistent implementation of Ambulatory Emergency Care pathways across the county. Use technology to replace tr aditional 'face to face' urgent care models. Developments in these areas during 2017/18 are outlined below: Develop a consistent new model of urgent care across Somerset that focusses on integrating acute services, primary care and community urgent care During 2017/18 three different ways of supporting patients that need urgent care services have been developed. These are the Community Development and Liaison Practitioner role, Home First and the Supporting Care Homes project. A Community Developm ent and Liaison (CDL) Practitioner is currently being piloted, with an initial focus on the West Somerset area. The role helps link patients with local services and acts as a liaison with p rimary care for patients admitted as an emergency to Musgrove Park Hospital as well as patients being Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 8 admitted to community hospitals run by Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust . The plan is for the CDL Practitioner to be involved at the start of the patient's admission to ensure continuity throughout the patient's period of recovery. The role is a conduit for community development, and a facilitator for sharing information between the various projects that are ongoing in this area . It will also help to identify any gaps in current services for future service development. Home First is a Collabo ration service between Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust , Somerset County Council and home care providers. Home First facilitates the dis charge of Medically Fit for Discharge patients out of the acute trust. Patients receive an intensive period of reablement in three settings to promote independence and keep patients (for as long as possible) in their usual place of residence. Patients are identified by the Practice Development Forum / Multi -Disciplinary Team to either receive their assessment and reablement at: Home (Pathway 1) - the therapist will meet the patient at their home and carry out an assessment of reablement needs which a pathwa y provider will deliver (currently one of three Home Care Providers taking part in the pilot) . Reablement Unit (Pathway 2) - for the West this is Bridgwater Community Hospital and for the East, Cookson Court and West Mendip Community Hospital. This is to enable the patient to receive an intensive period of reablement to allow them to safely go home. Patients can step down from Pathway 2 to Pathway 1. Residential / Nursing Home Reablement Facility (Pathway 3) - In the West this is Hamilton Park and in the E ast Sherborne Care Home. This is for more complex patients and the aim is provide a period of reablement that will allow the patient to return to their usual place of residence (home / care home). Patients can be stepped down to Pathway 2 and/or Pathway 1 . So far 764 patients have used the Home First service. Of the 694 patients discharged, 59% required no additional needs after reablement. The average age of patients using Home First is 81 years. Supporting Care Homes is collaboration between care homes, primary care, palliative care, SWAST (South West Ambulance Service Trust) and community pharmacy. 20 care homes have been identified within the Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group area following review of the total number of contacts with SWAST and numb er of patients conveyed to an acute hospital. Visits are being set-up to care homes starting with those with high volume admissions, and those who are already working with us . Study days are currently being considered for Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 9 residential homes on Treatment Es calation Plan (End of Life care planning) and other pertinent clinical topics. The Integrated Front Door (IFD): Like many other Emergency Departments (ED) in England, Musgrove Park Hospital is facing the 'perfect storm ' of rising numbers of patients and increasing difficulty of recruiting permanent emergency medicine doctors. Faced with this challenge, Musgrove has chosen an innovative design to meet the needs of patients by delivering a modern solution for Somerset. The minors part of ED has been conver ted to an integrated front door , staffed by general practitioners and emergency nurse practitioners. Patients are able to be streamed between urgent and emergency care and to other services, such as the Psychiatric Liaison Team, using defined pathways for each stream . This ensures a targeting of resources to maximise value and patient experience. There has been an increase in consultation and treatment rooms and the staffing model has changed markedly, with 18 GPs working as part of the service, ensuring GP presence 16 hours per day. There was significant investment in allied health professionals, including 11 emergency nurse practitioners to enable 24hr cover , an emergency care practitioner , two physiotherapists and a significant number of health care as sistants. These changes have allowed ED doctors and other ED staff to concentrate on those patients who require care in the majors or resuscitation area of the department. Prior to 'go-live', and using quality improvement methodology, a number of pilots were arranged to safely test the new model and measure the impact of the changes. Patient and staff feedback was used to inform the design of the model. Since 'go-live', performance has continued to improve, as has patient satisfaction. 152 patients comple ted a satisfaction questionnaire, of whom around half had used the ED before. Of those, 46% said they were seen and treated more quickly through the IFD than their previous service experience, 36% said both times they experienced very good service, and 15% said they received the same level of service with the IFD as before. For children, the POPS (Paediatric Observation Priority Score) system has been introduced. This is a bespoke tool to assign acuity of illness to children and young people, and the versio n 2.0 app was developed in partnership with the original developers and the ED team at the Trust, specifically for the unique Taunton IFD. Overall ED 4 hour wait compliance for the integrated front door has been consistently above 95% and supports overall department performance above 91% for the year to date, despite an 11% increase in attendances relative to the same period last year. Use technology to replace traditional 'face to face' urgent care models Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 10 Changes to the model of information for care delive ry are overseen by the Somerset Integrated Digital Record project. This is a nationally funded piece of work being developed by Black Pear with all the public care organisations in Somerset. The technology has provided direct and seamless access to releva nt patient information without recourse to other systems. Furthermore, it helps to eliminate the need for patients to fill in gaps in their care and medication history. Implementation of the EMIS Viewer, enabling read only access to patient records (subj ect to patient consent at the point of care) in Somerset care settings, has demonstrated significant clinical benefits, improved patient care, support for Urgent Care and enabled clinical and administrative time to be recovered for other tasks. This has c reated the appetite for more, to access other clinical / care information from other care provider sources to further improve person / patient care. There is the ambition and need to share wider health and social c are provider records on people / patients across Somerset, subject to affordability, information governance and compliance with NHS Clinical Safety requirements. Once established, Somerset aims to link to other similar solutions in the region and to recognise Digital Roadmap and Sustainability a nd Transformation Programme footprints. This would also contribute to the national move to have a single (virtual) health and social c are record, plus each patient to be able to view their record online. Everything that we do now need s to contribute to the follow ing objectives: Records largely paperless by 2020 Records accessible to health and social c are Records accessible in real time People / patients able to view and annotate a version of their health record online. Once core health and social c are providers are able to share information more effectively, it is aimed to open up services and care record interaction for patients . In line with this , the model will be extended by inviting other care providers to share their information and systems, incl uding voluntary, third and private sector providers in Somerset and over the borde rs, which may include other GP p ractice systems , such as SystmOne by TPP. The aspiration is to link to national target architecture services in order to send structured do cuments elsewhere, as well as to utilise national services. This will help deliver on the Somerset Sustainability and Transformation Programme (STP) Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 11 shared care record digital theme as well as improve the digital maturity status across the Somerset Digital Roadmap (SDR), allow ing the Trust to better interact with regional and national services and solutions being developed. Other models for supporting Urgent Care, such as Telehealth and Remote Assistance are being considered in the strategy review with Som erset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust . These will be detailed in next year's update. QIP 2017/18 - Priority 3 - Safer care ( Patient Safety Improvement Board ) Why is this important? For the last few years the Trust has been focusing on a safety programme through the national Sign up to Safety programme. What has been clear from experience and learning is that it has facilitated bringing all the various safety work streams into one place in a multi -disciplinary forum. The work streams that were being overse en under this programme have mostly become well embedded in ongoing service monitoring and improvement with governance structures to support ongoing improvement initiatives. A new oversight and improvement group has been set up, the Patient Safety Improve ment Board. This group will aim to have oversight of a select group of patient safety initiatives that are highlighted as needing support from the senior team and service improvement What do we want to achieve? Now that previous work streams are embedded as 'business as usual ', the Patient Safety Improvement Board is reviewing the safety programme work streams to identify new priorities linked into the wider improvement work in the Trust. The plan will be to use the first few months of the year to analyse all the information we have from incidents, complaints, patient feedback and other sources to identify areas where further work is required , based on a review of themes. These themes will then be used to develop project plans which include clear aims for improvement and detailed action plans using some resource from the improvement teams to support using a standard improvement methodology to support improving practice. How this will be measured and monitored? As part of the preparation for each project, a set of measures will be developed to enable the work to be closely monitored. The exact nature of these measures will depend on the areas identified, but will include process measures focussing on quality control and outcome measures to ensure that the work we are doing is making the improvements we want. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 12 How will this be reported? The Patient Safety Improvement Board will form the basis of one of the work streams for improvement in the Trust. There will be five improvement boards overseeing the proj ects, of which patient safety will be one. The improvement boards will report on progress to the Trust's Executive Committee. QIP 2017/18 - Priority 4 - Improving processes for discharging patients from hospital Why is this important? With the increasing demands placed on Musgrove Park Hospital, the need to improve the efficiency of the hospital, and, at the same time, enhance care for patients has never been more important. During the year 2017/18, the Trust has worked to improve the discharge of patient s. This work will not only reduce the amount of time that patients have to wait for discharge in an acute hospital, but will also make the best use of the scarce resource of acute beds . We also know that patients who are delayed in hospital are increasin gly vulnerable to decom - pensation, deterioration in their physical and mental health and more likely to fall or contract a hospital acquired infection. For all these reasons, we have worked to reduce any delays to patients who are cared for in our hospita l. What have we achieved? During the year we have consistently reduced the length of stay in the hospita l from 4.64 days to 4. 5 days ( 0.14 days ) Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 13 In particular, we have reduced the length of stay on the medical wards from 4.57 days to 4. 33 days (0.24 days ). Medical wards are the area where patients are most vulnerable to harm from long lengths of stay. During the year the number of patients fit for discharge who have been delayed has fallen significantly (37.9 patients per week reduction on average for delayed transfers of care) . This success has only been possible because the whole system has worked together. Somerset County Council, Somerset Partnership Trust and Taunton and Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 14 Somerset Trust have all worked together to agree priorities, share staff and decision making and ens ure pathways of care are frictionless. A recent peer review by NHSI found good partnership working to deliver results. They commented: \" The combination of Sustainability and Transformation Programme leadership and system leadership has worked well, possib ly because of the shared geography, to focus on the delayed transfer of care challenge and be determined to resolve it in the interests of patients. Realism about the current Better Care Fund funding was clear in understanding the temporary nature of it and the need to deploy it wisely to achieve the shift towards home based care was evident.\" (NHS Improvement (NHSI) and NHS Executive (NHSE) Peer Review, July 2017). They recommended that we share our structure for daily Panel decision making nationally. Robust improvement methodology has been used to implement these changes, based strongly on the SAFER Bundle promoted by NHSI (for further information about the SAFER Bundle, please click here ). This has been coordinated through the Improvement Board for inpatient care. This board, chaired by the chief operating officer and the medical director, has overseen the changes, using a clear project management approach to ensur e success. Increasing demand has meant that as capacity has been released, additional patients have been able to be admitted and discharged. Increasing demand has meant that as capacity has been released, additional patients have been able to be admitted and discharged. Change projects to deliver improvement in In Patient Care Board r ounds : All in -patient wards undertake daily board rounds attended by the full multidisciplinary team. Led by either the consultant or nurse coordinator, they include thera pies, discharge facilitators and social care representatives. Each patient is assigned an estimated day of discharge, and outstanding barriers to discharge are identified with actions . Managerial support for these b oard rounds is focussed on supporting sustainable clinical team leadership. Dischar ge coordination and integration : Discharge facilitators have been increased to cover 5-day working. Each ward has designated discharge facilitators, who track actions to ensure delayed transfers of care are minim ised. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 15 During 2017/18, an integrated, co -located discharge care team has been formed with clear operating standards from all team members. This includes social care, discharge facilitators, Discharge to Assess team members (Home First) and community hospit al liaison nurses. Discharge to a ssess The Home First programme supports frail, vulnerable people post discharge. This test and learn programme, which has been implemented using Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) steps, now covers almost all medical wards in the hospital. It provides three pathways of care - home with assessment and support (yellow on graph), community hospital enablement (green) and care home enablement (red). It has reduce d waiting for enablement and, from early results, has reduced length of s tay on average by five days. The scheme also incorporates a Trusted Assessor model, with staff from both agencies being authorised to start the health and social care packages. Decision making onward care (packages of care/ pathways/ placements): This year we have stepped up swift multidisciplinary decision making for patients to avoid delays. Daily Panels ( Professional Development Forums ) are held. Work has also been done to improve the quality of assessment to ensure patients are only presented once to the forum. Criteria led discharge: For selected wards and pathways of care, nurses or therap ist discharge patients against c riteria. Using PDSA improvements, criteria led discharge has been refined and particularly supports discharge at weekends. Relucta nt discharge policy: A reviewed, simplified and ratified policy has been published, enabling swifter discharge in cases of dispute. Executive directors of the Trust are involved at key moments to ensure a successful outcome. Early supported discharge: The Red Cross has worked as partners with the hospital to support patients with discharge. They ensure that the patient is settled at home with care, food and warmth, designed to reduce readmissions. Reducing repeated attenders : Musgrove Park's Emergency Depa rtment team has worked with the police, social care, mental health practitioners and the ambulance service to support patients who repeatedly attend the ED. In selected individuals, this has reduced attendances by nearly 50%. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 16 QIP 2017/18 - Priority 5 - Improving the experience of acute services for people with mental health needs Why is this important? As identified in the recent National Confidential Enquiry in Patient Outcome and Death report ( NCEPOD) , \"Mental Health in General Hospitals: Treat as One \", the benefits of integrating care across boundaries (e.g. health, social care, employment and housing) are understood. However, good integrated care for people with mental health conditions often appear s to remain the exception rather than the rule, wit h physical healthcare and mental healthcare largely disconnected. This can lead to poor patient experience and reduced quality of care. What did we want to achieve? The Trust aimed to identify all relevant learning from the NCEPOD report and develop action plans to address any gaps it finds. It was noted that this may take several years, so the initial focus for 2017/18 was on ensuring that staff, particularly those working in high risk areas, have appropriate training, information and support to care for people with mental health conditions. How was this measured and monitored? The initial priority is to deliver training for staff in high risk areas, with plans in place to prioritise staff in acute admissions areas ( Emergency D epartment and Acute Medical Unit) and six wards with the highest incidence of patients with challenging behaviours (including mental health issues, brain injury, substance misuse and dementia). Over the year we have trained over 250 frontline staff to support an enhanced level of u nderstanding of mental health care and how to offer support in challenging care situations. We initially targeted our very acute admission areas , where it has been well received by the staff involved . It was subsequently offered across all medical wards and some additional sessions were also put on for staff working in other areas. The plan is to continue to offer this training over 2018/19. This work continues to be developed and monitored via an executive oversight group . This was established followin g receipt of the most recent annual staff survey results , to ensure a number of key actions are taken to support staff facing verbal or physical aggression from patients and relatives. Progress and impact has been reviewed by feedback from staff involved i n training and it is hoped a positive impact will be seen in the 2017/18 staff survey results. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 17 What difference did this make for patients? Feedback from patients has generally been positive . In conversations with users about what makes their care better , the feedback has been positive about staff having an understanding of mental health issues and them taking the time to listen. Caring for patients with mental health distress requires an enhanced skill set. The training and development that has been offe red has greatly improved the staff confidence in undertaking this care. As a result of this training there have been fewer requests for specialist staff to be booked and a lower level of clinical incidence generated. What else did we achieve and what are w e doing next? As part of the development work, links have been formed between three of the medical wards and the paediatric unit with local mental health services to support cross learning and development opportunities. This work is in its infancy but war d leaders have spent time in each other 's areas and competencies and learning plans are being developed so that learning can be demonstrated and consolidated. This work is aimed at further developing the knowledge of caring for patients with mental health needs in the acute Trust. A closer working relationship with the mental health service is bringing many enhanced opportunities for learning and improving care. This will be continued over the coming year. QIP 2017/18 - Priority 6 - End of life care Why i s this important? End of life care remains a core part of the Trust's responsibility to the community. Musgrove will often identify the life limiting illness or be the place of admission in the context of acute admission on a background of increasing frail ty as well as caring for more than 1,200 people who die in the hospital each year. It is uniquely placed to initiate and coordinate the individual's care in the latter stage of their life in the context of what is important for the individual. What have w e achieved ? We have continued to build the culture that good end of life care is fundamental to what we do. Examples of how we are achieving this include the inclusion of end of life metrics in the Trust's Quality Assurance Framework and Art for Life's sup port in our Dying Matter's week \"Big Conversation\". Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 18 The Care Quality Commission raised their overall rating from 'requires improvement ' to 'good '. This was positive but left much work to do in pursuit of an outstanding rating. The life limit ing illness/end of life discharge summary is now part of the Electronic Patient -Reported Outcome (EPRO) system. This tool, has allowed the Quality Improvement Nurse Practitioner to work with medical staff to improve the quality of information shared with p rimary care. The project has built on our relationship with Marie Curie. It has allowed a much clearer understanding of when and how to undertake advance care planning in the context of those factors which are important to the patients and their families. We have learnt that often by the time an older person has had an acute admission to hospital they have less energy to express what is important to them. Nonetheless by identifying those who we think are likely to die in the next year, even if it is not possible to complete an advance care plan , a change in outcome against what would traditionally be expected has been observed. Since starting 151 patients have been seen of whom 58 have subsequently died: The expected numbers based on nationally pu blished area specific data for Somerset are for 46% of people to die at home or in a care home. Of those who were seen as part of this pilot and subsequently died, 67% died at home and 9% died in a care home (4), hospice (1) or community hospital. Of the 24% who died in hospital, four of eleven patients, died on the index admission before a meaningful advance care process could take place. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 19 Place of Death of those seen : It is recognised that patients in their last year of life use healthcare system s more frequently. They would be expected to be admitted on average three to four times. Within the pilot cohort there have been five single unplanned and entirely appropriate admissions (urosepsis), three planned admissions (e .g. ureteric stent placement for symptom control) and three patients who have had multiple admissions - a total of 10 bet ween them. This is a total of 23 admissions in 1 51 patients. These data suggest that this process of initiating a conversation with a family and communicating i t effectively to primary care can change the subsequent pattern of care use. In 2018 /19 the challenge s will be to consolidate the work of the pilot where two wards contributed the majority of patients throughout the hospital and to create Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 20 meaningful expect ation around life limiting illness discharge numbers for different directorates. Wards patients were r eferred from : How this will be measured and monitored? We are looking to formalise the measurement of the life limiting illness discharge summary as par t of the Quality Assurance Framework ( QAF). The discharge summary was formally ratified by the Trust's IT governance procedures in December 2017 . We are working with Informatics to incorporate these data into the QAF. In 2018 /19 we plan to measure days sp ent out of the hospital by people in their last year of life. We believe this will give a better measure of person -centred care. How has this information been reported ? The data presented on this report has been shared with the Charitable Funds Committee w ho have sponsored the specialist nurse from her appointment. The outcomes have been shared with the In patient Improvement Board, who have supported the project. We are currently working with the Informatics team to create a report for the directorate QAF with regards use of the life limiting discharge summary . This will be added to the other end of life metrics ; namely , use of the Treatment Escalation Plan and the use of the individualised End of Life Plan. This will allow a broader view of an individual' s care in the latter stage of their life. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 21 Future challenges and opportunities There is the opportunity to use Marie Curie trained volunteers to support advance care planning in the community. This would allow earlier planning and provide a person - centr ed care priority which could inform medical advance care plans, treatment escalation plans, special notices and the electronic palliative care coordination system. The Somerset Integrated Digital Electronic Record offers the promise of linking common data points. End of life care is ideally placed to be an early area for development. The palliative care team has seen changes in consultant and nursing members, neither of which are back up to full staffing numbers . This is challenging when the establishment h as been previously recognised as being small in relation to other organisations of a similar size. There is an opportunity to collaborate with Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to add new funding to a 0.6 whole time equivalent vacancy to create an enhanced supportive care service for lung cancer. These services have been shown to improve the experience of the illness , which has enhanced the quality and prolonged the length of life. In 2018 /19, a Somerset Treatment Escalation Plan (STEP) will be introduced. It is envisaged that as with the Treatment Escalation Plan , introduc ed in the hospital in 2014 , this will be a lever that catalyses a positive improvement in end of life care across the community. The spiritual care team are essential to hol istic care of the most vulnerable in the hospital. They have also seen change in staffing and remain in need of further volunteer and Trust supported team members. They have a newly appointed lead who is working to produce a policy for spiritual care. How this team can grow and thrive to support those dying and those around them is a key challenge. The bereavement service is another important facet of care for relatives. A new lead nurse has recently been appointed to the team. A handover period will make it possible to maintain the excellent work which will link with mortality and quality review processes to enable learn ing from good practice , alongside any improvements which could be made. QIP 2017/18 - Priority 7 - Improving patient experience for inpatient and outpatient care, linked to the priorities for the Trust's improvement work What have we achieved in the last 12 months? The roles and responsibilities of the improvement team are now established and seven boards are in place: Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 22 i) Theatres : Enhanced recovery has successfully been rolled out to Hestercombe ward. SCORE is a safety culture survey which was completed by theatres, the pre -operative assessment clinic and surgical staff in March 2017. Results regarding the learning environment, local leader ship, burnout climate, personal burnout, team work, safety climate and work life balance are being fed back to teams to help identify areas of good practice and where improvements can be made. There will be a focus on change ideas in January 2018. ii) Inpatien ts: The Emergency D epartment has continued to improve. The number and skill mix of staff has increased with GPs and physios seeing patients in the department. Half the department has undergone a complete rebuild, offering better consultation rooms, increas ing patient confidentiality and improving the rooms for the care of children and those in mental health crisis. Concentrated work on discharge planning has resulted in inpatients being discharged home sooner. This has included work on improving the reach o f rehabilitation for patients in their own home and in community hospitals and specific care homes . Joint working between health and social care teams has improve d decision making and streamlining discharge processes to increase efficiency. Piloting of th e national Red Bag scheme was initiated this year. This scheme aims to reduce delays for patients admitted from care homes by ensuring availability of key information that is critical to delivering timely care and good patient experience. In addition, the Trust has joined a national collaboration to test real -time feedback across six areas to understand if this methodology supports improvement in patient experience. iii) Outpatients: Introduction of self -service kiosks to outpatient areas to support patients b ooking themselves into appointments and ensuring they are signposted to the right place. New room scheduling system is being introduced to improve the efficiency of clinic booking. The Advice and Guidance service has been enhanced and spread to new specia lties. The Trust has r eviewed and extended the use of third party printing to reduce costs and improve the qu ality of patient correspondence. iv) Collaborative Patient Care: Discharge summaries are being reviewed. Home First has had a focus on discharge from hospital , and a cross -organisational group has worked together to pilot this scheme. In its first four months it has supported over 300 people. A programme of work is being prioritised for 2018 and will include a series of projects with primary care, Somer set Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and social care. v) Patient Safety: This board has been established in January 2018 and its first project will be to support the ambitions for sepsis screening and action. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 23 vi) Colleague Development: The board has now priorit ised five projects - recruitment, apprentices, retention, temporary staffing and prevention agenda. The prevention agenda has worked to introduce the national programme 'Make Every Contact Count (MECC)'. This is about recognising the opportunity to encoura ge change in people by talking about their health and wellbeing in every day interactions. Making Every Contact Count seeks to improve the individual, community and the population's health and wellbeing. There is a further project focused on improving the recruitment process. vii) Digital programme: The digital team is working towards the implementation of a digital system in critical care in July 2018. Since IMS MAXIMS went live in September 2015, varying types of change requests have been logged and while the re are plans in place to digitalise the Trust, an emphasis needs to be given to review and optimise MAXIMS in theatres. In January there will be observational activities to follow the patient journey through theatre. Day Surgery is due to go live with the inventory system in January 2018 and currently 82% of Day Surgery staff has been trained in the use of the system. Patient and family -centred c are As part of our commitment to improving patient experience, Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has comm itted to becoming an exemplar for the Patient and Family Centred Care (PFCC) approach. PFCC advocates that we enable patients and their defined family to be partners in their own care and decision -making at a clinical level and at an organisational level i n designing, developing and evaluating services. Over the last 12 months we have achieved the following: The role description and framework for the Musgrove Partners (patient voice volunteers) has been re -designed collaboratively. This has facilitated the Musgrove Partners to be the patient voice within multiple improvement projects and as part of regular activities such as recruitment of staff. Together we have co -designed the tool that will measure our baseline position as a patient and family centred Trust. The testing phase is complete. We are currently working together to evaluate the test of the tool and move into the implementation phase. The test phase has allowed for conversations between Musgrove Partners and select staff about the elements that make an organisation patient and family centred. It has allowed staff to celebrate the excellent care approaches in their area and stimulated ideas about what further steps could be taken to further develop this approach. This will also allow for learning from each other as the project develops. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 24 Activities to inspire staff about engagement with patient partners for improvement of services , and how to best hear the patient voice about experiences of our services have been completed over the year. Raisi ng awareness about the Trust 's ambition for patient and family centred care has furthered the conversations about what we already do well , and areas where we have progress to make. In the coming year as the baseline is completed we will prioritise projects supporting the patient and family centred approach. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES 20 18/19 The Trust has continued to develop the system for agreeing the quality priorities. Based on the wide ranging evidence already available in the Trust about patien t safety and care, and on our progress with last year's CQUIN targets, several quality topics were identified as having room for improvement or focus. These topics were developed in consultation with the Trust's Governor Patient Care Group. The prioritie s for this year are firmly aligned to the Somerset STP and are shared priorities with Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Progress on achievement of the quality priorities will be overseen by the Trust's Governance and Quality Committee via rep orts from the Governance Support Unit, at least quarterly. In addition, individual priorities will be monitored via a number of groups and committees in the Trust, as detailed in each of the sections below. In March 2018, the Trust's Council of Governor s agreed the following key quality improvement priorities for 2018/19, building on performance in 2017/18, as reported above: Priority 1: Learning from deaths Embed processes where investigation and learning occurs if care concerns have been identified and may have led to the outcome for the patient (measured by HSMR, SHMI, Serious incidents, Mortality reviews). Priority 2: Safer c are Continuous reduction in avoidable harm - (measured by incidence of infections, pressure ulcers, falls, medication incidents , maternity safety metrics, implementation National Early Warning Score 2 and Streams, compliance with sepsis CQUIN (Commissioning for Quality and Innovation) , serious incidents and never events). Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 25 Priority 3: Mental health and holistic care Increase staff capability to recognise and respond to those with mental health needs (children, adults in crisis and older people) . This will be measured by training compliance in conflict resolution, eating disorders, adolescent mental health e -learning, number of me ntal health first aiders, establishment of psychiatric liaison pathways. Priority 4: Patient e xperience Improve patient experience using co -design, personalised care planning and family centred care to inform service improvements and care pathways (measur ed by complaints, PALS concerns, public engagement events and user engagement in identified work streams). Priority 5: Right care, r ight time, r ight place Strengthen collaborative working across the health and social care system to deliver sustainable im provements in care, and in line with the Somerset Clinical Strategy, (measured by involvement and progress with seven day services compliance, end of life care measures, improving discharge, Health and Care Strategy work streams and improvement programmes ). Priority 6 Staff retention and w ellbeing Develop a robust approach to staff retention across all staff groups with a focus on celebrating excellence in practice, promotion of wellbeing support and activities, opportunities for development and career prog ression within Somerset and across providers (measured by recruitment and retention numbers, staff survey results, delivery of strategies and workplans). QIP 2018/19 - Priority 1 - Learning from deaths Why is this important? The review of mortality info rmation is important to help improve care and ensure patient safety within Musgrove Park Hospital. Mortality data from both qualitative review (at directorate/departmental level) as well as higher level quantitative data needs to be used to aid 'learning f rom mortality' within the Trust , as well as provide oversight and governance around inpatient deaths. Mortality review and specifically 'learning from deaths' cannot be taken in isolation and is intricately linked to the Trust review of serious incidents v ia the Serious Incident Review Group (SIRG) and departmental/directorate governance. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 26 What do we want to achieve? The mortality surveillance group aim to achieve: Deaths within priority patient criteria are identified and included for both standard and gro up-specific review. Mortality reviews are completed using the Trust proforma and with clear judgement on quality and avoidability . Speci alty mortality and m orbidity meetings are held and discussion of outputs and learning documented . Cases with significa nt concerns are referred for investigation via the serious incident review process . Established directorate and topic -based review to identify learning . Examples of action taken Specific examples of action taken include , teaching on end of life care within general surgery/vascular patients and the involvement of the learning disabilities team wit hin respiratory medicine. These can be cases that are identified through the mortality process and are referred through to the serious incident review group . Performance to -date During April 2017 March 2018 , 1,352 patients died in Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust. By 6 April 2018, 595 case record reviews and three investigation has been carried out in relation to 532 of the deaths . 19 (3.6%) of the patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. How this will be measured and monitored? The Mortality Surveillance Group (MSG) is formed to support the Trust in delivering its obligations to monitor patient outcomes and ensure clinically effective care. It's objectives include to develop and oversee the systems relied upon to review deaths within the hospital, including specialty mortality and morbidity meetings and to ensure an effective response to signals of quality concerns within the relevant sources of intelligence about outcomes. MSG's responsibilities include to review the benchmarked standardised mortality rates of the Trust and specialty -based mortality and morbidity activity with a view to identify potential areas for investigation and gain assurance on the operation of effective review processes at service level. This will be achieved via structured Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 27 reporting to address specialty level mortality and morbid ity resources, structures, process and outputs. Duties also include consideration of the mortality data in conjunction with other qualitative clinical data and to identify areas for investigation , ie. to consider the outputs of local case note review , mortality and morbidity activity alongside statistical ( Standardised Mortality Rate Ratio ) data and other contextual information about the service and the data and to investigate alerts and other outlier notifications received from the Care Quality Commission or identified systems (e.g. HED, national databases, national audits). The mortality review policy is monitored at the MSG via the monthly mortality review report. MSG report s key metrics to the board on a quarterly basis. QIP 2018/19 - Priority 2 - Safe r care Sepsis - compliance with CQUIN (Commission for Quality and Innovation) Why is this important? Sepsis claims more lives than lung cancer, the second biggest cause of death after cardiovascular disease, and is the cause of more than double the annual deaths from breast and bowel cancer combined. There is on average a 10% risk of mortality associated with sepsis which rises to 40% in the case of septic shock . What do we want to achieve? 90% of patients who need to be screened for sepsis are screened ; 90% of patients who have been screened and require antibiotics receive them within one hour; 90% of patients who have antibiotics are reviewed at three days . Examples of action taken These include initiating ward level audits of performance in order to direc t feedback on a local level, using the Outreach T eam to ensure that a screening form is done for all referrals, placing prompting posters on all notes trolleys and implementing a communication strategy. This involved the sepsis lead presenting recent data to clinical directors asking for improved engagement, including updates in Trust bulletins for staff awareness and expanding the sepsis steering Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 28 group membership to include members of the senior nursing team. This is to provide further support and to chall enge inpatient wards to meet the required standard. More recently, a Trus t-wide survey (completed by more than 150 staff) together with face to face interviews and feedback from sepsis champions , has given the Trust a more in depth understanding of why scr eening and delivering antibiotics within one hour is not always achieved. Small teams around the Trust are due to start implementing change ideas, supported by the sepsis leads and improvement team. The driver diagram below shows the key strategy and tacti cs for improvement. Key Strategy and Tactics for Improvement Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 29 Performance to -date The recent results demonstrate improvement in sepsis screening for both admission units and inpatients : - The Q4 admission unit screening rate is 92.0% (vs 86.7% in Q3, 76 .0% in Q2 and 28.6% in Q1). As part of the National CQUIN the Trust audits cases to see whether they have been screened for sepsis, given timely antibiotics and that th e prescription for antibiotics were reviewed. The Trust is aiming to achieve 90% and above. The results of the CQUIN indicators are as follows (higher is better) . Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 30 The rates for timely antibiotics are variable which is partly due to the small numbe rs of red flag sepsis patients identified in the audit. The percentage of patients treated with antibiotics within an hour is less compared to previous quarters but is still higher than the minimum requirement of 50%. - The Q4 admission unit timely antibioti c rate is 76.9% (vs in Q3, in Q2 and 87.5% in Q1). - The Q4 admission unit antibiotic review rate is 84.6% (vs 63.6% in Q3, 45.0% in Q2 Q1). Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 31 How this will be measured and monitored? The sample for the admission units includes patients triaged with a National Early Warning Score ( NEWS ) of three or more in the Emergency D epartment ( five or more from January 2018). The sample for inpatients includes patients on the outreach register with NEWS of five or more. The case note review is conducted by a registered nurse within the Governance Supp ort Unit and practice is assessed in accordance with the CQUIN requirements. The results are monitored by the Sepsis steering group and the Quality Assurance Committee. The Patient Safety Improvement Board has oversight of the sepsis steering group. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 32 Sepsis CQUIN data is also report ed and monitored as part of the Performance Assurance Framework. Maternity Safety Metrics Saving babies lives care bundle Why is this important? The Saving Babies' Lives Care Bundle brings together four key elements of care based on best available evidence and practice in order to help reduce stillbirth rates. What do we want to achieve? By using the care bundle we want to continue to reduce and sustain our number of stillbirths. Examples of action taken 1. Reducing smoking in pregna ncy - 85% reduction in SATOD (Smoking Status at Time of Delivery) - Carbon monoxide monitoring at booking and referral to smoking team . 2. Risk assessment and surveillance for fetal growth restriction - introduction of GAP and GROW and the use of customised g rowth charts and serial growth scans . 3. Raising awareness of reduced fetal movement - fetal movement leaflets given out and discussed at every antenatal appointment . 4. Effective fetal monitoring during labour - all staff working on labour ward is competent to interpret CTG. K2 package for all trained staff. Performance to -date Since the care bundle was introduced in 2015 are target of > 50% reduction has been achieved and sustained. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 33 In 2017 we reached 1000 babies born smoke -free supported by our Specialist Smoking Cessation Midwife team . How this will be measured and monitored? This will be monitored t hrough a patient notes audit. Sepsis Why is this important? In many case s, delayed recognition of sepsis enables the unrestrained progression to septic shock and multi -system organ failure. Once this happens there is little hope of successful treatment, with mortality rates rising as high as 60%. Rapid recognition and treatmen t of sepsis is essential to reduce preventable deaths. What do we want to achieve? A sustained improvement in sepsis management - with blood cultures and antibiotic management given within the first hour. Examples of action taken Implementation of the mate rnity Sepsis action tool. Sepsis champions who attend the trusts study days and then give feedback to the teams - they also audit notes and distribute sepsis stars to all staff that use the screening tool and give the antibiotics within the golden hour. Performance to -date Our 2017 aim of 90% of women with suspected sepsis receiving Sepsis Six intervention within the 'golden hour' was achieved. In the fourth quarter of Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 34 2017/18, 91.8% (n=49) of women who triggered for sepsis had a screening proforma starte d. 70% of patients identified as having red flag sepsis and needed antibiotics received them within one hour of trigger time. How this will be measured and monitored? This will be monitored through a patient notes audit. All patients who don't receive antibiotics within the hour will be reviewed. Perinatal Mental Health Why is this important? Perinatal mental health refers to a woman's mental health during pregnancy and the first year after birth. This includes mental illness existing before pregnancy, as well as illnesses that develop for the first time, or are greatly exacerbated in the perinatal period. What do we want to achieve? To provide a service so that the mental health of all women is monitored, discussed and treated in the same way as her physic al health during this crucial time. Examples of action taken and performance to -date Our specialist multidisciplinary perinatal mental health team was launched in October 2016 . Since then 242 women have been supported by the team . How this will be measu red and monitored? This will be monitored through audit. Incidence of infections Why is this important? A reduction in the incidence of hospital acquired infection will improve health outcomes for patients, provide better care and have a financial impact f or the Trust through a reduction in length of stay and potential complaints. Noroviruses are a group of viruses which are the most common cause of infective gastroenteritis in the UK. They are highly infectious and cause regular outbreaks of diarrhoea in the community and hospitals. Norovirus outbreaks can occur at any time of the year, but are more common in the winter months with hospital outbreaks often leading to ward closure and major disruption in hospital activity. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 35 Methicillin resistant staphylococc us aureus (MRSA) is an organism which is resistant to the antibiotics usually used to treat infections caused by the staphylococcus aureus bacterium. Infections caused by the bacterium can range from mild to life threatening and can be particularly hard t o treat as special antibiotics have to be used. Clostridium difficile (CDI) is a bacterium that is present in the gut of up to 3% of healthy adults and does not normally cause any harm. CDI can occur when the normal bacteria in the gut are disturbed, usua lly by taking antibiotics. This allows the bacterium to multiply rapidly in the gut and produce toxins which cause diarrhoea, and in some cases severe inflammation of the bowel. What do we want to achieve? We want to achieve the handwashing local target of 90% compliance . Regarding MRSA, the Trust's aim for 2017/18 was to have no MRSA Trust - apportioned bloodstream infections (specimen taken on or after the third day of admission , in line with the standard national definition) as agreed with the Trust's commissioners . Examples of action taken Hand washing A key component in the reduction of infection is thorough hand hygiene by all clinical staff. This is an important issue for the Trust and all our patients. Monthly hand hygiene compliance audits are carri ed out in all areas. The Infection Prevention and Control team also undertakes hand hygiene validation audits to check the reliability of the data collected and identify areas for improvement. Results are fed back to directorate managers, senior nurses an d the ward sisters and teams. Environmental cleaning A high standard of environmental cleaning is a key infection control measure for CDI and MRSA. A new centrally managed cleaning arrangement was introduced in the Trust in November 2017, which will help ensure a high standard of cleaning in all areas of the hospital and ensure that any gaps in the cleaning service are readily covered in high risk areas. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) The Trust continues to implement a number of actions to hel p reduce the risk to patients, which includes: Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 36 Robust antibiotic stewardship to help reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics; Prompt Isolation of patients with diarrhoea and / or a confirmed CDI; Isolation of patients with a history CDI, if they are a t an increased risk of developing symptoms; Scrupulous hand washing with soap and water following contact with patients with CDI; Regular review of patients with CDI by a microbiologist and the Infection Prevention and Control team, to support medical management and isolation practice; Enhanced cleaning of rooms with hydrogen peroxide based technology to help eradicate CDI spores; Enhanced cleaning of equipment with a sporicidal agent; Working closely with the Trust's partners in the community to help reduce the risk of CDI in primary care. Norovirus Outbreaks were managed in line with the Trust's 'Management of Norovirus' policy and the Guidelines for the management of norovirus outbreaks in acute and community and social care settings' (DH Noroviru s Working Party December 2011). Performance to -date Hand washing Local Target: 90% compliance Actual 2017/18 - 94% Norovirus In 2017/18 there were 23 confirmed norovirus outbreaks in the Trust, resulting in restrictions being put in place on wards. MRS A Unfortunately, the Trust had three cases of MRSA bloodstream infections in 2017/18. Multi -disciplinary reviews were completed to identify the source of the infection and any areas of sub -optimal practice that may have contributed to the case. Opportuniti es to improve a) MRSA screening and b) checking patient histories for any previous history of MRS A were identified and this learning was shared and improvement actions put in place . Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 37 Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) In 2017/18, the Trust had a total of 18 Trust -attributed cases (defined as specimen with a positive toxin test result taken on or after the fourth day of admission). This was a sharp increase from the previous year when there were only eight cases identified. However, there has be en a general increase in CDI across Somerset this year compared to last year, and this may have had an impact on the number of hospital cases. All cases of Trust -apportioned CDI are thoroughly investigated to assess whether the case was linked to any lap se in care, and therefore potentially avoidable. These assessments are subsequently peer reviewed and validated with the Trust's commissioners. In five of the 18 cases a lapse of care that could have contributed towards the case was identified. Learning i ncluded ensuring appropriate antimicrobial prescribing and compliance with hand hygiene, and this was shared with the appropriate clinical staff and improvement actions taken. In the remaining 13 cases no lapses of care that could have contributed to the case was identified. A high standard of environmental cleaning is a key infection control measure for CDI. A new centrally managed cleaning arrangement was introduced in the Trust in November 2017, which will help ensure a high standard of cleaning in all areas of the hospital and ensure that any gaps in the cleaning service are readily covered in high risk areas. To ensure the optimal use of antibiotics , antimicrobial stewardship remains a high priority in the Trus t, with regular review of broad spectrum antimicrobi al prescribing on both medical and su rgical wards by a consultant microbiologist and antim icrobial pharmacist. The use of high risk broad -spectrum antibiotic prescribing has significantly reduced in favour of lower risk combination therapy wi th narrow spectrums agents, and the Trust remains amongst the lowest users of these a gents in the region. How this will be measured and monitored? Handwashing Monthly hand hygiene compliance audits Monthly environmental audits Monthly antimicrobial stewar dship audits. MRSA, CDI and Norovirus All Trust -apportioned cases are investigated to identify learning . Learning is then shared within the organisation in order to drive further improvements . Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 38 Falls Why is this important? For the hospital Financial impa ct - additional bed days Clinical Quality Commission / Health Service Executive interest / follow up Potential for prosecution or fines and associated costs Reputation of the hospital . For the patient Poor outcome - Fracture neck of femur, which is associ ated with a 30% mortality within one year Increased length of hospital stay Patient may not be able to go back to own home Loss of confidence Decreased mobility Reliance on family or friends . What do we want to achieve Reviewing all the falls and the Royal College of Physicians data indicated , two distinct issues were identified where improvements need to be made: Getting it right at the front door : On admission acutely unwell confused patients in a new environment , or moving rapidly between environments , need actions in place to keep them safe. Discharge: P atients are at particular risk when they are medically fit but are unable to be discharged due to functional or social issues. Prolonged hospital stays are associated with deconditioning. People over 8 0 have a 50% chance of falling at home if they furniture hop. The Trust is working with the enablement lead and the Home First teams to coordinate the best approach for these patients . Examples of action taken Following a spike in falls with significant h arm in 2015 the Falls group refocussed its attention on this area. The refocus gained senior management leadership and Sign up to Safety involvement. The Trust has a well -functioning group with good multidisciplinary representation and engagement. There is good assurance that policies and procedures are in place. We are working on a change culture so that every fall matters. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 39 How ? Building relationships with key staff who deliver care on the wards ; Ensuring all staff understand the implications to patients confidence and wellbeing even if no serious physical harm has occurred ; Working with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and other agencies towards a Somerset Pathway ; Change in paperwork to meet the new Royal College of Physicians and NICE Guidelin es; Royal College of Physicians audit ; Robust data for all falls identifying trends and feedback to the wards ; There is a specific piece of work on the Acute Medical Unit being carried out with the improvement team. From work undertaken on Wordsworth ward the Trust has learned that a significant difference is made when the senior leadership ward team are passionate and engaged about preventing falls and the senior nursing lead is engaged and supportive. Performance to -date Between April 2017 and March 2018, there were 1,1 47 falls incidents reported (4.96 per 1,000 bed days and day cases) compared to 1,019 (4.46 per 1,000 bed days and day cases) in 2016/17. Of these, 22 incidents were scored as moderate or worse between April 2017 and March 2018 whereas 30 we re scored moderate or worse in 2016/17. How this will be measured and monitored? The Falls group receives and reviews incident data for all falls for learning and recommendations for change. It also reviews regulatory and national data . Streams Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust are collaboratively working with DeepMind health to develop their Streams application which will enable us to achieve our Global Digital Exemplar Milestone of the Management of the Deteriorating Patient; this will be completed over a phased approach of development and user design workshops. In its current state of development the Streams application can be accessed via a mobile device which allows multiple clinical staff to view a patient's observation capture and National Early Warn ing Score at any one time and within any location within the Trust. This gives clinical context in relation to observations to any referral/handover of care received within the Trust to support decision making and Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 40 oversight of the unwell patient. The app w ill drive clear and accurate observation capture and the correct calculation of a NEWS score, providing the Trust with guidance with regards to the appropriate escalation route for patients. How this will be measured and monitored? A pilot is planned on M ontacute ward with a plan to remove the current paper process and roll -out the app across adult wards within the Trust. Baseline measures are being captured which include: Timeliness of observation rounds Timeliness of finding clinical documentation Legib ility of observation capture Observations captured according to Trust policy Correct calculation of National Early Warning Score . Data will then be captured to measure the performance and benefits provided by capturing digital observations within Streams. Pressure Ulcers Why is this important? A reduction in the incidence of hospital acquired pressure ulcers will improve health outcomes for patients, provide better care and have a financial impact for the Trust through a reduction in length of stay and pot ential complaints. Examples of action taken The management of patients at risk of pressure ulcers has been one of the key patient safety priorities at the Trust for a number of years. It is a key component of the South West Patient Safety and Improvement Programme, Patient Safety First campaign, Safer Patient Network, Safer Patient Initiative and the Trust's own Improvement Network. As a result of involvement in these collaborates the Pressure Ulcer Steering Group has developed a strong background of improvement science and measurement for improvement. Over the last five years the Trust has seen significant reductions in the number of hospital acquired pressure ulcers , which is a direct result of the improvement work undertaken. Over the coming year we pla n to build on this improvement by: Maintain or reduce current levels of newly developed hospital acquired and deteriorating pressure ulcers ; Working collaboratively wi th our partners as part of the Sustainability and Transformation Programme and the commun ity; Expand the area of expertise to reduce the number of hospital acquired moisture lesions . Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 41 What do we want to achieve? Following several years where the number of hospital acquired pressure ulcers had reduced, it was agreed that the local target for 201 7/18 would be to maintain the levels of hospital acquired pressure ulcers reported in 2016/17. This was still considered an ambitious target in the context of the increasing demand and sicker patients. Performance to -date Achievements and successes Some of the key and more recent achievements and successes are: Development of a measurement strategy to track and communicate progress against goals from ward level to board level. Monthly review of pressure ulcer data, enabling education and feedback to target any issues promptly. Also established was a measurement of mucosal lesions which are reported separately from other incidents of pressure damage. Providing a dedicated tissue viability service to ward staff offering training and advice in the identificatio n and management of pressure ulcers and wound care. Development of a protocol for non -compliance in adult patients , which has been incorporated into the Trust policy . Ensured root cause analysis is completed and is of quality on all grade three and above h ospital acquired pressure ulcers , and that the duty of candour is completed. Providing regular pressure ulcer training and education to ward teams , as well as agreeing that all doctors and ward based physiotherapists should undertake e -learning to raise aw areness across disciplines . Beginning collaborative working with Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to align pressure ulcer root cause analysis and standardise investigations into pressure ulcer inci dents. Collaborative development of a pressure ulcer leaflet for patients with learning disabilities . Established links between the tissue viability service at Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and the community tissue viability service , which allo ws for improved discharge planning providing a more effective service and better outcome for patients. Participating in the Somerset Tissue Viability Collaborative which aims to share learning and best practice across the county and to develop a standardis ed approach to care. The group also provided a study day and training for nursing home and care agency staff.

This will be measured by training compliance in conflict resolution, eating d isorders, adolescen t mental h ealth e -learning and establishment of p sychiatric liaison pathways . Why is this importa nt? As identified in the recent National Confidential Enquiry in Patient Outcome and Death report (NCEPOD, 2017), \"Mental Health in General Hospitals: Treat as One\" , the benefits of integrating care across boundaries (e.g. health, social care, employment a nd housing) are understood. However, good integrated care for people with mental health conditions often appears to remain the exception rather than the rule, with physical healthcare and mental healthcare largely disconnected. This can lead to poor patien t experience and reduced quality of care. What do we want to achieve? There is a limited amount of mental health training provision for staff at MPH. The NCEPOD report \"Treat as One\" (2017) explored the care given to mentally unwell patients in acute hosp itals. The report highlighted many issues with the quality of care given to mentally unwell patients in this setting, and identified staff training as key to addressing some of them. The report found that: a. Fewer than half of hospitals have mandatory traini ng in the management of patients with mental health conditions . b. No hospitals offer training covering all aspects of management of patients with mental health conditions. c. Staff reported significant training gaps. The action plan checklist arising from the NCEPOD report makes clear that enhanced training for staff is a key driver for obtaining improved care for patients. The NHS Five Year Forward View for Mental Health also makes significant recommendations regarding mental health training for acute hospita l staff. It says that \"staff across the NHS need to have training that equips them to understand mental health problems and to treat people with mental health problems with dignity and respect.\" It recommends that core training be provided in: - Basic mental health awareness and knowledge - Understanding of mental health law - Public mental health - Compassion and communication skills . Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 44 The Trust's developing partnership with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (the local provider of NHS mental health service s) will mean closer working between physical and mental health care services. This will mean both a greater need and a greater opportunity for better mental health training for hospital staff. Examples of action taken The T rust has self -assessed against th e NCEPOD action plan checklist. Although it is compliant against a number of the targets, there is a lack of compliance against others. Many improvements could be made were staff to have better skills in relation to the management of mental ill health. There is a specific target in the action plan dealing with the need for all staff to be trained in mental health issues. However, in addition to this, better training of staff would help address other weaknesses in the service provided to those patients who a re mentally unwell. For example: a. There is only partial compliance in relation to the documentation of mental illness for patients presenting at the hospital (NCEPOD standard number 1). Improved education and training will help with this. b. Better training w ill also reduce the reliance on expensive specialist s taff to provide the necessary one -to-one nursing support for mentally ill patients (standard 10) by equipping our own staff with the ability to provide it instead. c. Better training for staff will also h elp improve discharge planning and improve the ability of Musgrove Park Hospital's staff to contribute more fully to multi -disciplinary working (standard 15). Performance to -date Over the last year we have trained over 250 frontline care staff with enhanc ed knowledge and skills in supporting people with mental health conditions or distress. Clinical links have also been built between the adult and children's wards in mental health and the acute Trust. Until recently the T rust had a small liaison psychiatr y service which provided input into the care of mentally unwell patients in the hospital but this was only offered for limited hours across the week. This service is provided by Somerset Partnership, and recently the service has been expanded as part of a targeted county -wide approach to improving care. The new enhanced servi ce will be offered across the 24/7 period once all posts are fully recruited into. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 45 What do we plan to do this year? Over the coming year we plan to continue with a work plan to enhance knowledge and skills of the acute care workforce in caring for patients with mental health conditions or distress. Care collaborative - a national programme run by NHS Improvement aimed at enhancing the care of patients who are suffering from delirium, dem entia or are distressed in the acute care environment. As part of this work we plan to introduce a trial of activity co -ordinators (to three elderly care wards) to facilitate increased mental and physical stimulation with the aim of reducing agitation. St aff, working in pilot areas , will be developed to encourage increased levels of activity and self -care. Integrating physical and mental health network - a national programme being run by the Kings Fund . The Trust is participating in this national programm e alongside partners from mental health and local service users. This programme is aimed at developing and enhancing a seamless pathway from primary care across all care settings for those with mental health issues. Full roll -out of the psychiatric liaison service - as this team is fully recruited the enhanced service will offer greater care and experience for service users . The team will offer learning opportunities for current acute staff to better help them meet patients ' needs. A programme of short wor k experience placements is being developed for staff working with acute adult s and children in mental health settings , and return placements for mental health staff in the acute setting . This will be trialled during the year using a set of core competencie s to enable staff to demonstrate their enhanced learning and skills. Training in knowledge and skills for caring for people with mental health conditions or distress will continue to be offered to an extended group of front line staff. How this will be me asured and monitored? Progress on this work and the NCEPOD 'Treat as One' action plan will be monitored through an oversight group who will meet during the year to review progress and consider emerging opportunities or need. Training numbers for formal co urses will be monitored and feedback from exchange programmes will be sought to ensure a diverse qualitative narrative is built to evaluate staff experience. Where we are participating in National programmes ('care collaborative' and 'integrating physical and mental health network') these will be formally evaluated as part of that programme and future practice developments planned from this evaluation. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 46 QIP 2018/19 - Priority 4 - Patient experience Why is this important? It has been evidenced that co -desig n between staff and service users results in services that better meet patient expectations and are more cost effective and sustainable. Co -design is a key component of our ambitions to be an exemplar Trust for patient and family centred care and as such w e want to support improvement projects to bring staff and users together and grow our confidence and skills in the co -design approach. What do we want to achieve? Patient partners to be at each of the improvement boards supporting the prioritisation and de cision making on which projects are supported. For each new improvement project to use co -design methodology bringing staff and patient users/representatives together from the outset. To complete the Patient and Family Centred care baseline measure with th e Musgrove Partners using the co -design approach. Examples of action taken Over the past year the patient experience team and improvement team have been working together to set the need for , and expectation of , partnership working with patient partners. T he boards have been recruiting their partners and developing relationships and understanding. The Musgrove Partners have co -designed their role outline and framework with the patient experience team and have initiated the co -design of the Patient and Famil y Centred care baseline measure tool(s) How this will be measured and monitored? 1) Measure the patient involvement, influence and contribution to the improvement boards. 2) Measure the number of new improvement projects that use co -design methods. 3) Completion of the Patient and Family Centred Care Audit. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 47 QIP 2018/19 - Priority 5 - Right care, right time, right place Why is this important? Co-ordination of care across Somerset is important to ensure that we can deliver sustainable care and continue to make improvements in the way we deliver that care in line with the joint Health and Social Care Strategy being developed by the Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group and Somerset County Council. What do we want to achieve? Much of the work around the five core se rvice areas (urgent and emergency services, proactive care/elderly frail, planned care, children's and maternity services, and mental health and learning disability) is in the early stages of development, with consultation just beginning, but it builds on a number of key work streams that are already underway. One of the key elements to make sure patients receive the right care, at the right time, in the right place is to continue our improvement work on discharge. In 2018/19, we will consolidate the work a chieved in 2017/18, including: Business case to sustainably fund Home First, Red Cross d ischarge scheme and 7/7 discharge facilitators ; Continued work to support the effectiveness of board r ounds ; Professional support to embed Home First , and the culture of enablement in community hospitals and the care home selected ; Launch of enablement programmes into acute wards in the hospital ; Engagement in the Enhanced Care Collaborative to improve the quality of supervision of behaviourally challenged patients ; Extension of criteria led d ischarge to a larger number of wards ; Support for wards to apply the reluctant d ischarge policy when all other options are exhausted ; Implementation of the red bag s cheme to improve transfers between acute trusts and care homes ; Improve the timeliness and quality of discharge s ummaries (Note - the requirement for all patients to have a timely and comprehensive discharge summary is monitored as part of our commissioners' contract ); Support honest conversations with patients at the e nd of life , and record these in Discharge Summaries ; Pilot and roll out electronic white b oards and admission/ discharge/t ransfer apps as part of the Digital Global Exemplar work . Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 48 How this will be measured and monitored? This will be monitored via a num ber of audits and measures, building on the work done in 2017/18 (see report Priority 2 for 2017/18 earlier in the report), overseen by the Trust's discharge group . QIP 2018/19 - Priority 6 - Staff retention and well being Why is this important? Staff r etent ion continues to be a key issue. W ith workforce supply an ongoing challenge it is vital that both new and existing colleagues are supported and encouraged to remain within the health services in Somerset. Significant evidence demonstrates that retain ing skills and competent colleagues improves patient experience, the overall quality of patient care and colleague satisfaction. There is no single solution to improve retention . Ho wever , crucial to retaining our colleagues is by supporting them as indivi duals through the provision of health and wellbeing activities. Health and wellbeing is now recognised as more than just a matter for individual attention . Successful organisations recognise that good health is a key enabler to good business. The health, safety and wellbeing of colleagues directly contributes to organisational success and poor workforce health has a high cost. We are committed to being an employer that promotes and supports the physical and psychological health and wellbeing and safety of our entire workforce. What do we want to achieve? The aim is to have an effective retention plan which balances the needs of our people wherever they are in their career and personal lives, which is based on a good understanding of what is happening and what needs to be done to maintain our colleagues working effectively to provide future focused healthcare in Somerset. Colleagues need to work in an environment where they are well managed, valued for their contribution and are developed. Examples of actio n taken The greatest impact on both retention and wellbeing will be t hrough our managers and leaders. Key to this will be ensuring they are equipped to support and develop colleagues and create a positive environment where colleagues feel safe, valued, su pported and empowered . This will be delivered through sustained leadership development, clear learning opportunities, succession planning, effective performance review processes, joint values and behaviours across the alliance, and actively promoting healt h and wellbeing. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 49 Performance to -date The health and wellbeing strategy has been developed and launched in March 2018, this strategy sets out how health, wellbeing and safety will be promoted and measured. The joint P eople Strategy for the alliance with So merset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, sets out how the people objectives will be delivered. How this will be measured and monitored? Measurement will be through a mixture of hard and soft measures, including regular monitoring of sickness absence, turno ver, temporary staffing costs and usage, vacancy fill rates, national staff survey, pulse check, exit interviews and informal and formal feedback. NATIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS All data in this section is provided by the Health and Social Care Information Centre and is governed by standard national definitions. Summary Hospital -Level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) Related domain: (1) Preventing People from dying prematurely The Summary Hospital -Level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) is a standardised mortality indica tor. It expresses actual deaths compared to an expected value. In this case, 'average' is represented by a value of 1. SHMI has been designed to overcome certain shortcomings inherent in other standardised mortality indicators such as the HSMR. This includ es the influence of coding of palliative care patients. SHMI also includes patients who died within 30 days of discharge whereas HSMR looks only at in hospital deaths. The Trust's overall SHMI over the past three years is represented in the table below: Reporting Period Ratio (Banding) England Lowest Trust Highest Trust April 2017 to March 2018 Data due to be published September 2018 January 2017 to December 2017 Data due to be published June 2018 October 2016 to September 2017 0.9208 1.0000 0.7270 1.247 3 1.0000 0.7261 1.2277 0.7075 1.2123 Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 50 January 2016 to December 2016 0.9844 (as expected) 1.0000 0.6907 1.1894 October 1.0000 0.6897 1.1638 (as expected) 1.000 0.694 1.171 April 2015 to March 2016 1.002 (as expected) 1.000 0.678 1.178 January 2015 to December 2015 1.000 (as expected) 1.000 0.669 1.173 October 2014 to September 2015 0.983 (as expected) 1.000 0.652 1.177 July 2014 to June 2015 0.984 (as expected) 1.000 0.661 1.209 April 2014 to March 2015 0.970 (as expected) 1.000 0.670 1.210 January 2014 to December 2014 0.967 (as expected) 1.000 0.655 1.240 October 2013 2014 0.982 (as expected) 1.000 0.597 1.198 July to June 2014 0.984 (as expected) 1.000 0.541 1.198 April 2013 0.539 1.197 NB: 1.00 is the SHMI average, values lower than 1.00 indicated better than average. The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: There has been continued focus on initiatives related to safety that have reduced the number of avoidable deaths in a range of specialities. Routine review of Healthcare Evaluation Data (HED) by speciality, procedure and diagnosis groups has provided early warning of problems in patient care. The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve on this rate, and so the quality of its services : By regularly monitoring outcomes through tools such as Healthcare Evaluation Data. By identifying where outcomes appear to be deviating . This allows the Trust to investigate and verify the result and give an ear ly opportunity to make improvements to patient treatment pathways.

From November 2016 we have included th e palliative care code for admissions where the patient has an assessment completed and is on a pathway , as these have been specifically designed by the palliative care team to support clinicians in delivering high quality palliative care. The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve on this rate, and the quality of its services by: monitoring palliative care rates at the mortality surveillance group meeting ; auditing palliative care coding to ensure all a dmissions with assessment completed is coded ; and continuously auditing the use of the end of life care pathway for patients who die. PROMS: PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES Related Domain (3) Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury PROMs measure a patient's health status or health -related quality of life from their perspective .

Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 56 READMISSIONS Patients readmitted to a hospital within 28 days of being discharged Related Domain (3) Helping people to recover from episodes of il l health or following injury Whilst some emergency readmissions following discharge from hospital are an unavoidable consequence of the original treatment, others could potentially be avoided through ensuring the delivery of optimal treatment according to each patient's needs, careful planning and support for self -care. Because of the complexities in collating data, national and local rates are significantly in arrears. It should also be noted that a readmission is counted for a patient within the 28 day period, even if it is for an entirely different problem, eg a discharge following a hip replacement and readmission due to a stroke. This report includes information about children re -admitted to the Trust which show that they are broadly in line with the na tional average. Our adult readmission results for 2011/12 indicate that we were significantly better than average. Our 28 day readmission index is 105% which is well within the confidence limits. There are five diagnoses that are significantly above the ex pected range but these are small samples and none has reached significance, but we will continue to monitor and evaluate the data.

Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 57 The Trust operates an open admission list system - there are approximately 100 children on the open admission list who have a chronic condition, e.g. epilepsy, chronic heart c onditions and haematological conditions. These children have had consultant approval to attend the children's unit in accordance with condition requirements. Open admission can be an ongoing process throughout the child's life. Children with life limiting conditions, such as oncology related disorders and immune compromising disorders, have repeated admissions due to medical management of their condition. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has taken the following actions to improve this rate, and so the quality of its services, by: Reducing the number of ward reviews where appropriate. Implementation of the new community midwifery -led feeding protocol and assessment to prevent admissions for 'poor feeding', initially reduced inpatient admissions with a period of only two admissions per month for the first six months. Subsequent months have shown a slight rise with on average four a month being managed as an inpatient. It is noted that these admissions are the more complex cases with additional compli cations in addition to poor feeding. Regular assessment of the reasons for admission to ensure that, within specialities and conditions, there are no trends apparent or evidence of readmissions indicating a problem in clinical treatment or processes.

Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust i ntends to continue to try to improve readmission rates, and so the quality of its services, by: Continuing to monitor readmission rates for various procedures and conditions, as this can provide information about clinical teams in greater detail. This woul d allow improvements to be directed at the areas that most require them. Increased use of ambulatory care and urgent clinics to manage emergency care pathways. Management of groups of patients as ward attenders through MAU and SAU as an alternative to admi ssion where appropriate. Working with other health and care providers in Somerset to ensure alternatives to admission are accessed where appropriate. NOTE - although this indicator remains one of the indicators that the Trust is required to report on, r ecent data beyond 2012 is not available from the Health and Social Care Information Centre. In line with the change in national focus on readmission rates, the Trust is currently undertaking analysis to understand the differences in readmission rates within s even days of discharge, by day of week of discharge from hospital. The graphs below show the overall rate of readmission for patients during 2017/18.

Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 61 Patients admitted to hospital who were risk assess ed for venous thromboembolism (VTE) The Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: Medical staff receive training as part of the induction programme in the protocol for risk assessment. This applies when patients are admitted as emergencies as well as for planned procedures. The data correlates with other sources of information such as the NHS Safety Thermometer and the root cau se analysis completed for cases of hospital acquired VTE.

Rate of Clostridium difficile infection Related Domains (5) Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can cause diarrhoea and sometimes severe inflammation of the bowel. It can occur when the normal bacteria in the gut are disturbed, usually by taking antibiotics. Although not all cases are preventable, CDI Trust -attributed rates (measured per 100,000 bed days) are an important indicator of improvement in protecting patients from avoidable harm and provide a useful tool for making comparisons between organisations and tracking improvements over time.

This is the result of sustaining the bundle of improvements implemented in 2011, which included prompt isolation of patients, high standards of cleaning, reductions in the use of high -risk antibiotics and Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 63 regular review of patients w ith CDI by a microbiologist and the Infection Prevention and Control Team. The CDI rate for 2017/18 is not yet known. Although there has been an increase in the number of cases compared to last year, rates are still expected to be below the national aver age rate. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this rate, and so the quality of its services, by: Continuing to investigate all Trust -apportioned cases to identify learning, sharing this learning in the organisation and driving further improvements. Continuing to reduce the CDI risk associated with antibiotic treatment through robust antibiotic stewardships and further review of antimicrobial guidance, where appropriate. Prompt isolation of all symp tomatic patients and also previous CDI cases, where there is an increased risk of reoccurrence Giving scrupulous attention to hand hygiene, decontamination and cleaning practices. Patient safety incidents reported to the National Reporting and Learning System The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) collects and collates information from the incident databases of health service providers to provide thematic review and share wider learning about patient safety through a system of safety alert s sent to every organisation. The Trust's Safeguard Incident software has an automatic process for uploading its incidents to the National Learning and Reporting System (NRLS). There is evidence of increasing numbers of reports being uploaded to the NRLS d atabase , as indicated in the table below: Reporting Period Number of Incidents Reported Rate per 1000 Bed Days Taunton and Somerset Median for Acute (Non - Specialist) Trusts Lowest Trust Highest Trust Apr 2017 - Sep 2017 2,985 39.9 3,334 44.4 40.1 23.1 69.0 Apr 2016 - 3,251 44.9 40.0 21.2 71.8 Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 64 Reporting Period Number of Incidents Reported Rate per 1000 Bed Days Taunton and Somerset Median for Acute (Non - Specialist) Trusts Lowest Trust Highest Trust Oct 2015 - Mar 2016 3,156 41.7 39.3 14.8 75.9 Apr 2015 - Sep 2015 2,987 40.3 38.3 18.01 74.67 Oct 2014 - Mar 2015 3,171 36.0 35.3 3.6 82.2 Apr 2014 - Sep 2014 3292 38.2 35.1 0.2 74.96 Oct 2013 - Mar 2014 3116 35.9 32.4 5.8 74.9 Apr 2013 - Sep 2013 3004 6.95 7.2 3.5 14.5 Oct 2012 - Mar 2013 3010 7.0 7.0 1.7 16.7 Apr 2012 - Sep 2012 2342 5.48 6.7 3.1 14.4 The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust considers t hat this data is as described for the following reasons: We actively encourage reporting of incidents to enable learning to be obtained; The Trust has been involved in a range of work -streams led by our in -house Improvement Network to improve specific aspe cts of patient safety and to reduce incidents; We have continually reviewed and improved our systems for reviewing and uploading incidents to the NRLS to ensure that they meet the data quality requirements, resulting in a higher proportion of incidents bei ng successfully uploaded to the NRLS. The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this rate, and so the quality of its services, by: Continuing to improve direct feedback to individuals and demonstrating clear learning outcomes from incidents reported the Trust hopes to further encourage staff to report. simplifying all processes relating to reporting incidents and concerns as part of the response to the \"Freedom to Speak Up\" report. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 65 Number of patient saf ety incidents that resulted in severe harm or death The NHS National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) provided the following definitions for severe harm or death: Severe - Any unexpected or unintended incident which caused permanent or long -term harm, to one or more persons.

Patient safety work -streams have focused successfully on reducing serious incidents related to delays in escalation for treatment and patient falls. The Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has taken the following actions to im prove this rate, and so the quality of its services, by Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 66 A range of work -streams to improve specific aspects of patient safety and to reduce incidents. Improvements have also been made in the quality and general approach to investigation, giving more credib ility to the recommendations which means better clinician engagement with the improvement agenda. Encouraging reporting of incidents and near misses and greater consistency in the rating of incidents. STAFF, FRIENDS AND F AMILY The Staff, Friends and Fami ly test has been carried out since April 2014. The test comprises two questions, 'How likely are you to recommend this organisation to friends and family if they needed care or treatment?' and, 'How likely are you to recommend this organisation to friends and family as a place to work?'. Colleagues are asked whether they know'. The extremely likely and likely responses are added together and compar ed with the extremely unlikely and unlikely in calculating the results which are then benchmarked against other providers of this test nationally.

Amongst these are the following responsive actions, selected as an illustration of the service -specific improvement work initiated via audit during the 2017/18 period.) Royal College of Emergency Medicine Severe Sepsis 2016 /17 Whilst the benchmarked findings for the timeliness of sepsis interventions placed the Trust above average overall, improvements are planned. These are linked to the overall intent t o make interventions for sepsis available at the optimal time. Key actions include: Clear assignment of medical and nursing leaders for sepsis for every shift will ensure a continuous focus within the clinical team. Use of short 'bite -sized' teaching plus more in depth teaching as part of fuller team training days. Review of past cases to establish the cause of delay with interventions where this occurs . Trial of a sepsis trolley, replicating the same model as for resuscitation equipment . Rapid Assessment Triage: Patients who have been identified as having suspected severe sepsis , either by alerts from paramedics pre -arrival or at handover , will be seen by a senior doctor in order to initiate sepsis care pathways. Royal College of Emergency Medicine Consult ant Sign -off Audit 2016/17 Patients falling within certain high -risk groups attending the Emergency Department (ED) must be signed -off by a Consultant before discharge. The audit highlighted that this could be documented with greater reliability. It is ass essed by the team that senior medical review and discussion takes place more frequently than the present documentation suggests. Key actions include developments to the electronic patient record to enable a prompt for sign -off to be displayed. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 77 RCEM Natio nal Audit on Moderate and Acute Severe Asthma report 2016/17 Review of the findings by the ED team has led to development of new management standards for asthma in conjunction with the respiratory team. These are now incorporated into the ED suite of clini cal procedures. Work is being undertaken to join -up services for unscheduled hospital attendances and ensure the care pathway is robustly defined. New inhalers are to be introduced as well as vital signs monitoring. These developments will be addressed as part of training programmes, using the resources available from Asthma UK. Development of a safety checklist for asthma patients in emergency department bays will improve recording of abnormal vital signs and ensure completion of re - assessment within an ho ur. Asthma UK patient information is also to be adopted, providing clear information for patients on discharge. National Inpatient Diabetes A udit (NADIA) 2016 report The audit reports on the rate of patients being seen by a specialist diabetes team member, amongst other key elements of care. The T rust recently rece ived NHS England funding for a two year project to improve inpatient diabetes care - enabling recruitment to an inpatient diabetes nurse post. This will support the improvements evident from the a udit in the overall proportion of patients seen by the specialist team and will permit further training to be provided to ward teams. British Thoracic Soci ety Paediatric Pneumonia audit 2016 Changes in practice arising from the audit include restricting ch est x -ray to use in severe or complicated pneumonia only. Likewise, blood testing should be reserved for the more severe cases. Oral antibiotics are to be used except if the case is severe or complicated. A departmental teaching session is in place to brie f the junior medical team. National Asthma Audit The measures for a range of care processes have been incorporated into the respiratory team's action plan. These include: Educational sessions for the Acute Medical Unit team to addr ess documentation requir ements; Timely administration of steroids and other monitoring requirements will also be ensured by improved documentation ; Implementation of a care bundle (a clear set of care processes) for asthma care. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 78 National Fracture Liaison Service Database (par t of the falls and fragility fracture audit programme) Actions have focussed on the recruitment of an additional fracture liaison nurse to support assessment of patients according to best practice. The findings suggested that significant savings could be m ade through avoidance of hip fracture, spanning both acute health and social care services. Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (Royal College of Physicians) Aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of stroke such as screening, timely thrombolysis trea tment (especially out of hours), swallowing assessment and direct admission to the hyper -acute stroke unit have been considered as part of the action plan, with actions focussing on training and education for relevant clinical teams. National Audit of Inpa tient Falls (Royal College of Physicians) Actions have been formed to address ten priority issues leading from review of the findings; these include: To ensure timely assessment, promoting better use of the above -bed information boards, making the importan t information about the patient and falls risk clear to all. Review and implementation of the documentation supporting early identification of risks and early introduction of measures to reduce falls risk . Develop an education programme to support embeddin g practice for visual impairment assessment, access to appropriate walking aids and use of continence care plans. Improved joint -working with the dementia and delirium lead and linking to the actions addressing the national audit of dementia. National aud it of the management of psoriasis (British Association of Dermatologists) The findings formed the basis to drive a standardisation in the recording of disease activity and patient wellbeing. National Epistaxis A udit This multi -centre audit assessed the va rious management options available in different trusts across the country and led to the Taunton ENT department using a new product in the management of epistaxis. A prospective audit will now be undertaken to assess the outcomes. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 79 MBRRACE -UK Perinatal Mor tality Surveillance Report - UK Perinatal Deaths from January to December 2015 The Trust's rate for perinatal death is lower than average, a fact that has been communicated widely amongst the maternity team as a celebration of success. An aim arising fro m the report was to lower the number of women being admitted for induction of labour at 42 weeks (excluding maternal choice). The report found 5.3% were born post -term (42 weeks or greater), a higher percentage than the UK average of 2.5%. The % of women i nduced at or greater than 42 week s has fallen since 2014 (7.3%). Actions include: Consultant review of working practices for booking women for induction and the timing of induction. Reporting to the m aternity department's governance meeting, to oversee progress. Additional work is being undertaken to improve the recording of babies' ethnicity. National Maternity and Perinatal Audit Amongst a broad range of measures, this new audit report highlighted a need for review of Apgar scores at five minutes after birth; a concern being that the unit has a higher than average rate of babies scored as 7 (of 10) or below on the Apgar scale. This has been reviewed at T rust level and the maternity team have responded with action including: Completion of local audit, to understand the issues more fully Introduction of second -checker validation of Apgar scores Case review of records for b abies with Apgar 7 or below at five minutes Monitoring of neonatal life support training completion . RCR Audit of Prevention and Detecti on of Acute K idney Injury in A dult Patients This audit was u ndertaken to determine radiology departmental compliance with current UK guidance on contrast -induced acute kidney injury (CI -AKI). The department (and all departments nationally) are actioned to review their CI -AKI protocol and have established arrangements with the acute care physicians/renal team for the management of patients identified with CI -AKI. Local clinical audit The reports of 68 local clinical audits were reviewed by the provider in 2 017/18 and Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve the quality of healthcare provided : Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 80 The following are examples of projects conducted by clinical teams across the hospital and the changes proposed as a result of them: Acute Medical Unit Safe prescribing of IV fluids - This was an assessment of documentation to indicate whether practice was in line with NICE guidance (Clinical Guideline 174). The findings identified a need for improvement in the completi on of the IV fluid chart by the junior medical team. Steps were taken to ensure adequate time is given to teaching IV fluids prescription during the doctor's induction and to emphasise completion of a 24 hour plan for fluids. Cardiology Inpatient Surgical Transfer times (re -audit) - The timely transfer of patients requiring heart surgery to other hospitals in the region is critical to ensure a good outcome and standards are set out within policy. Transfer should take place within seven working days. This r ound of auditing assessed the impact of the policy, introduced as a response to a prior audit. The policy has brought improvements, with over 80% of patient transfers meeting the 7 -day target. For cases where transfer time was longer, there were justified clinical reasons for delays. Endocrinology Diabetic Ketoacidosis - An audit of admissions with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in 2016, looking at patient character istics and compliance with the T rust protocol for DKA management. The findings have formed the basis for review of the protocol, bringing it fully in line with national guidance recommendations. Respiratory Discharge documentation for patients admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD - This re -audit assessed practice in line with NICE Quality Stand ards further to implementation of a COPD discharge care bundle and modifications to the discharge care electronic record. Eight key standards were measured with findings highlighting constraints to effective delivery of the care bundle. A plan is proposed to involve a specialist respiratory nurse to more directly supervise and monitor the implementation of the discharge process. Care of the elderly Gentamicin administration and monitoring - Identified safety issues with dose calculations, the way the genta micin levels were reported and monitored. Following the audit, the Trust prescribing guidelines were changed to a height - based dose calculation and the way the gentamicin levels were reported were revised. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 81 Teriparatide in osteoporotic fracture prevention - the audit was carried out to assess compliance with NICE guidance (TA161) in preventing osteoporotic fractures and also to assess the use given the high cost of the medication. The audit confirmed about 90% compliance with the NICE TA161 and demonstrated that the exceptions were clinically justifiable. Breast Care Reporting of lobular carcinomas - A previous (2016) Breast Screening Programme Quality Assurance inspection had identified that the unit had a greater than expected number of lobular carcinomas d iagnosed. Following the audit action points agreed included routine ordering of a specific test (E - cadherin) on any case thought to be lobular carcinoma and amending practice so that test -positive lobular carcinoma is double reported by two clinicians. Critical Care Tracheostomy Care - The Unit had introduced various changes to practice based on the NCEPOD publication addressing tracheostomy c are, \"On the right Trach\". The audit assessed compliance with the NCEPOD recommendations over the last year and over all confirmed good practice. In particular, compliance with consenting, checklists and documentation is good (significantly better than before the NCEPOD publication). The audit highlighted specific areas where practice could be improved, including minimis ing tracheostomy tube changes, ensuring a minimum of two senior intensivists are present, and checking with a bronchoscope on placement. Surgical A dmissions Completion of Treatment Escalation Plans - These record the 'ceiling of care' decision for each pat ient, including the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The Trust has in place a requirement for all inpatients to have a documented resuscitation status. Audit findings have led to actions to ensure the Treatment Escalation form is appropriately counter signed, to educate the surgical team and to improve the visibility of the form by locating it with the surgical clerking documentation. Dermatology Tele-dermatology audit - The audit is being used to assess provision of tele - dermatology support for acute inpatient care. Initial audit led to changes to allow consultants with responsibility for the patient being referred to tele - dermatology being included in the feedback. The audit is continuing to monitor this new model of service. Skin cancer nurse -led follow up service - Has provided evidence that care is of a high standard and complies with NICE guidelines. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 82 Urology Audit of management and follow -up of non -muscle invasive bladder cancer - This was an assessment of compliance with NICE Guidelines (NG62). The findings led to actions linked to the patient record, improving the clarity of in terms of the size and number of lesions and the interval of follow -up checks. Development of a follow -up flow chart and improvements to pathology record -keeping were als o addressed. Ophthalmology Management of macular oedema in Retinal Vein Occlusion - The findings have led to a wide -ranging set of service developments for consideration, including blood testing, review of risk factors, communication with the GP regarding treatment, defining a treatment pathway, ensuring early treatment, and use of laser treatment. The audit also linked to development of virtual clinics to help the department deliver the clinics needed to meet demand. Trauma and Orthopaedics Management of s urgical chest drains in the trauma and orthopaedics department - The audit was undertaken to assess practice against local and national standards of care and to minimise radiation exposure . Although there was overall good compliance with guidelines, the u se of chest x -ray was found to be high and there was some practice variation. Actions focussed on holding departmental chest drain insertion training sessions. Ear, Nose and Throat S urgery The use of antibiotics in post -tonsillectomy haemorrhage - Since t he completion of this audit a protocol has been implemented for the management of post -tonsillectomy haemorrhage and patients are no longer being routinely prescribed antibiotics unless clinically indicated. This has reduced the unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics and its potential adverse side effects. A repeat audit has shown no significant changes in complication rates associated with tonsillectomy. Paediatric post -tonsillectomy analgesia - The implementation of a standardised paediatric post -tonsille ctomy pain relief has significantly reduced the re -admission rates of patients with post -tonsillectomy pain. This has therefore improved patient safety and post -operative experience and also reduces the number of bed stays for post -tonsillectomy complicati ons. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 83 Gynaecology Consultant review of emergency gynaecology patients - The audit is supporting a b usiness case for an additional gynaecology c onsultant within the service and the co -location of emergency gynaecology with other related services. Use of me thotrexate - There is clear guidance regarding the use of methotrexate in ectopic pregnancy and the audit provided assurance that guidance is followed and practice is robust. The management of hyperemesis - The audit established that national guidance was not fully implemented for managing patients with hyperemesis. The guidance was highlighted to all staff and used as a basis for local guidance review. Radiology WHO safety check list use for surgical and interventional procedures - As a key part of the te am's work to implement Local Safety Standards for Invasive Procedures (LocSSIPs) in radiology, the use of the Interventional Radiology WHO checklist has been monitored. This appears to be embedded in the processes for the large majority of cases. This appl ies primarily to the more significant interventional r adiology procedures. Oncology Audit of electronic chemotherapy referral forms - the completion of forms was found to be reliable, whilst improvements can be made to the completion of all relevant detai l. The quality of completion is being addressed via education. Order of administration - multiple intravenous systemic anti -cancer therapy - Good practice is defined with the team's guideline for Prevention and Management of Chemotherapy Extravasation. A wide range of chemotherapy types received by 50 patients were assessed. All were found to be administrated in the correct order, therefore the only action was to monitor that this is sustained. Dietetics Audit of nasogastric tube insertion documentation a nd nasogastric tube nursing competency assessments - Initial audit has helped with the refinement of the tube insertion documentation. It has also informed what needs to be communicated to staff about the documentation requirements of a National Patient Sa fety Agency alert on this topic. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 84 Physiotherapy Physiotherapy record -keeping audit - The audit will help identify areas requiring a change in documentation and also allow the implementation of training needs for therapists to ensure that nationally define d standards are maintained. Therapies Falls Audit - One area that has greatly improved is the documentation of patients being involved in the development of their treatment planning. This demonstrates that as clinicians we are considering/identifying patient-centred goals and therefore making their rehabilitation more functional to the individual. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists have also been educating ward staff to highlight patients to therapies in the event of an inpatient fall. Trust -Wide Audits Audit and patient experience survey of Consent - This rolling programme assesses the documentation and processes relating to consent for surgical and other types of invasive procedures, in line with Trust policy. The survey component provides the p atient perspective on the conduct of the process of consent, focussing on the quality of information provided and opportunities for discussion of the risks, options and likely outcomes. Overall, practice was shown to be good, in line with the key policy re quirements. An area for development is the low numbers of patients receiving a copy of the consent form; addressed via feedback to all relevant teams. Food and drink availability at ward level - The availability of food and drink for inpatients is a fundam ental of care which is reviewed annually via this audit, drawing on national guidance and underpinned by the Health and Social Care Act Regulations. Overall, good availability was evident, with improvements required to ensure low sugar options are consiste ntly on offer. The recommended core items to be available on all war ds have been highlighted to ward m angers. Procurement arrangements have been reviewed. Enteral feeding systems and administration of oral liquid medicines - This audit, led by the m edicine s management n urse, assessed practice in over 50 clinical locations across the Trust against National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) recommendations (Alert 19). Findings were used as a basis for awareness -raising, developments to training content and improve ments in use of effective methods for dose measurement. Safety of Peripheral Venous Cannulas - An audit assessing the success of a newly introduced cannula chart in ensuring guideline compliance. The findings demonstrated that the chart helped ensure good practice and guideline implementation. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 85 CLINICAL RESEARCH Four key documents have been published in the last 12 months that reinforce the Government's ambitions for research both to grow and be completely embedded in NHS services these are: NHS England Re search Plan (4 April 2017); The Life Sciences Industrial Plan (30 August 2017); Twelve actions to support and apply research in the NHS (NHS England & National Institute for Health Research, November 2017; Government's Industrial Strategy (27 November 2017) . The overarching theme of all of these developments is an increase in collaborative working at all levels; encouraging collaboration between agencies in the wider health community, trusts, academia and industry. Key points that are beneficial to the Trust are: that NHS England has a legal duty to promote research and the use of research evidence in the NHS. the Government's Life Sciences Industrial Plan aims to support a 50% increase in the number of clinical trials being ru n in the UK in the next five years. the Industrial Strategy Sector Deal will help ensure new pioneering treatments and medical technologies are produced in the UK, improving patient lives and driving economic growth. The deal involves substantial investment from private and char itable sectors and significant commitments in research and development from the government. that to deliver this agenda, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and NHS England are jointly driving system -wide changes to speed up the process of co nducting research, disseminating and adopting the results of research for the benefit to the NHS and its patients , whilst capitalising on fiscal savings to support long -term sustainability. All of this is done so that the NHS supports and harnesses the be st research and innovations in medicines, devices, diagnostics, and digital products. The overall aim is to improve patient outcomes, transform services, ensure value for money and grow the UK economy; and to do so in a way that helps ensure a sustainable NHS for tax payers. Commercial collaborations The Trust's first commercial research collaboration led by a Trust chief investigator - Dr Fred Mayall, is recruiting well with 78% of participants recruited. The Trust has already signed up to an agreement w ith TrinetX, a commercial data warehouse to provide anonymised data to research partners, so that patients with Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 86 rarer conditions that are eligible for trials may be identified more readily and researchers don't waste resources setting up trials in location s without the relevant patient population . The Trust has also been invited to join a prime site collaboration with IQVIA , which will mean that the Trust will be in a position to influence commercial trial development at an early stage to enhance the deliv erability of the research within the NHS and will also be able to join new trials sooner. Academic grants The Trust has been notified of a successful application for a 'Research for Patient Benefit Grant' awarded to Dr Justin Pepperell to collaborate with the University of Oxford to develop his trial for patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea. Mr Nick Burns -Cox, a c onsultant urologist at the Trust, has been invited to collaborate with the Karolinska Institute in Sweden to develop research to help develop a more accurate diagnostic test for men at risk of developing prostate cancer. The Trust has agreed to sponsor the research and the project is currently in development. Professor Rob Andrews' trial, EXTOD education, has recruited well and developmen ts for a second phase with a larger grant are underway. The Trust has continued to work with its local health community partners in Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to develop the Somerset Research Collaborative; now supporting an active and highly successful portfolio of studies across organisational boundaries and a range of clinical specialities. Further collaboration with Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust in respiratory research is a lso planned for the future. The impact of this to the Trust is that the Department of Clinical Research continues to increase the number of patients recruited to research and also the number of specialities that offer research as a treatment option. Heal th systems and the delivery of services is also a subject for research to ensure that innovation, transformation and the provision of services is evidence based. In 2017/18, the Trust was allocated \u00a31,004,440 to support research staffing and infrastructure via the NIHR Clinical Research Network: South West Peninsula, with a further \u00a334,310.71 directly from the Department of Health and Social Care . Revenue from the conduct of research of \u00a3431,719.66 has been invoiced for, as at 9th April 2018. The departme nt projected total recruitment of 1,360 participants at the start of the financial year for the National Institute for Health Research Portfolio of studies. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 87 The number of patients receiving relevant health services provided or sub - contracted by Taunton & S omerset NHS Foundation Trust in 2017/18 that were recruited during that period to participate in research approved by a research ethics committee was 1900 . This recruitment figure relates to 111 active studies. Trust employees have demonstrated the vibra ncy and innovative practice of a research active organisation in the last twelve months by producing an extremely high volume of successes, conference abstracts and publications in high quality academic journals. Dr Emma Wesley, a new Trust principal inve stigator has begun developing the portfolio of research in gastroenterology, achieving the first two global participants recruited at the T rust in her first commercial clinical trial. Ninety four articles and abstracts were produced. The topics were wide r anging across specialities and also across the whole range of professions. Analysis of data provided by the Library Service demonstrates that the most prolific specialities for successful publications are bariatric medicine and respiratory medicine.

COMMISSIONING FOR QU ALITY AND INNOVATION FRAME - WORK (CQUIN) 2.5% (c. \u00a35 million) of Taunton and Somerset NHS F oundation Trust's income in 2017/18 was conditional on achieving quality improvement and innova tion goals agreed between Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and any person or body they entered into a contract, agreement or arrangement with for the provision of relevant health services, through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation payme nt framework . 2.5% of income for 2016/17 was also conditional on achieving quality and innovation goals. Further details of the agreed goals for 2017/18 and for the following 12 month period are available electronically at http://www.musgroveparkhospital.nhs.uk/about -your -hospital/our -quality Taunton and Somerset NHS F oundation Trust is required to register with the Care Quality Commission and its current registration status is unconditional. The Care Q uality Commission carried out an inspection of the Trust between the 30th August and 28th September 2017 , with unannoun ced inspections of four core services and a review of the well -led key question at trust -level. The Trust continues to be rated as \"Good\" overall, with a number of recommendations to further improve care . Please see the Chief Executive Officer's comments in the Foreword on page 1. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust has not participated in any special reviews or investigations by the Care Quality Commission during the reporting period. The Care Quality Commission has not taken enforcement action agai nst Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust during 2017/18 . INFORMATION ON QUALI TY OF DATA The Trust agreed a new Data Quality Strategy with three clear aims: Creating the right culture Timely Resolution of Data Quality Issues Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 89 Maintaining high Quality Data Work is underway to deliver the strategy's aims with a revised governance structure, the development of a supporting data quality policy and the production of a dashboard to give visibility of data quality issues and the progress made in their reduc tion. In the absence of Spine connectivity improvements the quality of core demographic data has been made through the use of technologies within the Trust 's interface engine . In particular , the completion of NHS number as a unique identifier . There are p lans to explore further potential developments in this area. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust submitted records during 2017/18 to the Secondary Uses service for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics, which are included in the latest publish ed data. The percentage of records in published data with valid NHS numbers and GP practitioner code were as follows: Indicator Accident and Emergency care Admitted Patient Care Outpatient Care Number of records which included the patient's valid NHS Num ber % of valid NHS Numbers received from EPR 95.7 99.4 99.7 % of valid NHS Numbers sent to SUS 98.4 99.8 99.9 Number of records which included the patient's valid General Medical Practice Code % of valid GP Practice Codes received from EPR 99.5 99.9 99.8 % of valid GP Practice Codes sent to SUS 99.7 100 100 There has been an improvement across the board in the completeness of data submitted to SUS with a high correlation in most areas between the data contained within the core Electronic Patient Recor d (EPR). In particular the percentage of valid NHS numbers submitted to SUS through the work on the Interface Engine has increased by 4% for Emergency Department attendances this year. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust was not subject to the Paym ent by Results clinical coding audit during 2017/18 by the Audit Commission. Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust will be taking the following actions to improve data quality: Extending the use of Spine Mini Services through the Trusts Integration engine to im prove completeness of data. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 90 Extending current data quality dashboard reporting on data quality issues. Working with Electronic Patient Record Supplier to make system improvements such as standardised format and mandatory fields Implementing new data qualit y policy Identifying and training data quality champions throughout the Trust . INFORMATION GOVERNAN CE Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust's Information Governance Assessment Report overall score for 2017/18 was 71%, and was graded green with a rat ing of satisfactory . CLINICAL CODING ERRO R RATE The Clinical Coding Audit, for information governance purposes, was performed internally on a sample of 200 records across all specialties. The results for the clinical coding audit showed good overal l figures. The diagnoses coding, with both the primary diagnosis (90.95%) and the secondary diagnosis (88.34%), are exceeding the 90% and 80% respective recommendations given for the Information Governance Toolkit (IGT) Requirement 505 attainment level 2. The procedure coding also exceeded the recommended target, with the primary procedure correct at 94.85% and the secondary procedures at 90.20%.

This recommendation was actioned immediately by the clinical coding managers. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 91 The clinical coding managers are to remind the coders t o check all systems and documentation when coding in order to code capture all appropriate radiology activity and to provide clarification to the coders regarding how to interpret the plan to admit and the coding of radiology scans. This recommendation was actioned immediately by the clinical coding managers. The clinical coding managers are to re -audit the coders with the overall lowest depth of coding to ensure that the learning from this audit has been effective, and if there has been no improvement to p rovide action plans for these coders. This audit and possible action plans to be undertaken within the financial year of 2017/18 by the clinical coding managers. The audits are now underway with effect from January 201 8 and action plans will be written if required. The clinical coding managers are to remind the coders that the primary diagnosis rule applies to individual episodes within multiple finished consultant episode spells. This recommendation was actioned immediately by the clinical coding managers . The clinical coding managers are to remind the coders of the national standards regarding the coding of oncology conditions . This recommendation was actioned immediately by the clinical coding managers. The clinical coding managers are to continue to p rovide support to coders coding complex cases . This is an ongoing commitment by the clinical coding managers. In addition to the yearly IG 505 audit the coding managers undertake validation of coded data on a monthly basis. About 400 episodes are checked a nd any coding corrections needed are made within the same calendar month. LEARNING FROM DEATHS 1. The number of patients who have died during the reporting period, including a quarterly breakdown of the annual figure. During April 2017 to March 2018 , 1,342 patients at Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust died (including inpatients and patients in ED) . This comprised the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 92 Quarter Number of Deaths Quarter 1: April - June 2017 293 Quarter 2: July - September 2017 272 Quarter 3: October - December 2017 331 Quarter 4: January - March 2018 446 Note - These include deaths of patients whilst an inpatient or in the Emergency Department only. 2. The number of deaths included in section 1 which the provider has subjected to a case record review or an investigation to determine what problems (if any) there were in the care provided to the patient, including a quarterly breakdown of the annual figure . By 6th April 2018, 640 cas e record reviews and four investigations have been carried out in relation to 585 of the deaths included above. In two cases a death was subjected to both a case record review and an investigation. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case rec ord or an investigation was carried out was: Quarter Number of Deaths Quarter 1: April - June 2017 191 Quarter 2: July - September 2017 197 Quarter 3: October - December 2017 143 Quarter 4: January - March 2018 54 A single death may be reviewed by more than one clinical team. There is often a delay between the death occurring, the case reviewed and reported to the mortality surveillance group, hence the total of reviews conducted toward the end of the reporting period will not be the final total. 3. An estimate of the number of deaths during the reporting period included in section 2 for which a case record review or investigation has been carried out which the provider judges as a result of the review or investigation were more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient (including a quarterly breakdown), with an explanation of the methods used to assess this. 19, representing 3.3% of the patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than no t to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. In relation to each quarter this consisted of: Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 93 Quarter Number of Deaths Quarter 1: April - June 2017 9 (4.7%) Quarter 2: July - September 2017 7 (3.6%) Quarter 3: October - December 2 017 3 (2.1%) Quarter 4: January - March 2018 0 (0.0%) These numbers have been estimated using a locally designed tool to assess quality of care developed in line with the principles of Structure Judgement Review Methodology as the method or review advoc ated nationally. The reviewer records the key aspects of care for which concerns are judged to have occurred and rates the quality of care at Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust using the below scale: A. No significant care issues identified and care c onsidered to be excellent despite the outcome B. No significant care issues identified C. Some care issues identified but not related to death D. Care issues identified which may have contributed to death E. Serious issues identified (failure to follow procedures/ una cceptable standards of care) . Deaths with at least one review with a score of D or E are included in the percentage above. 4. A summary of what the provider has learnt from case record reviews and investigations conducted in relation to the deaths identified in section 3. The numbers of mortality case note reviews that have demonstrated significant care concerns that may have been related to death have been low. The mortality steering group use this information (in run chart format) to track the number of care concerns on a monthly basis. This gives the Mortality Steering Group ( MSG ) oversight into significant changes within 'care concerns' throu ghout the T rust over time. This information can be used to further investigate potential changes related to global d eterioration (or indeed improvement) in care for mortality cases. At the present time the run chart (see below) has shown no significant variation from the Trust average. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 94 The T rust has (and continues to) refine the process around learning from cases wher e there is thought to be a care concern contributing to death. In cases where there are se rious care issues identified (E on care scale - see section 3 ) the mortality review case is automatically referred through to the Serious Incident Review Group (S IRG) and, as appropriate, and Serious Incident investigation is undertaken. In mortality cases where there are significant care concerns , but the impact on the contri bution to death is not known (D/C on care scale) then these cases are referred back to the loc al directorates for review. The T rust is currently working on the governance of these cases and ensuring the learning process through directorates is robust. The mortality case review process is used to identify any potential causes for sub - excellent car e at any stage in the patient's final admission. This is performed for all mortality cases; regardless of whether there have deemed to be care concerns contributing towards death. This breakdown of issues helps with thematic analysis and is provided to the improvement team to help guide focus for further improvement work. A summary of these themes is displayed below: The MSG has recently reviewed data (collected by the MSG's clinical quality and patient safety analyst) on pre -admission care concerns ident ified using the above Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 95 methodology. During this analysis missed opportunities for advanced care planning and inappropriate admissions to acute care were the overarching themes identified. 5. A description of the actions which the provider has taken in the reporting period, and proposes to take following the reporting period, in consequence of what the provider has learnt during the reporting period (see section 4). The T rust actively promotes the use of Mortality and Morbidity meetings to begin the learning p rocess when discussing mortality review cases. These are a combi nation of single speciality General surgery) meetings and are part of the consultant core supporting professional a ctivities . They are well attended by the consultant body and the junior medical teams , and cases are discussed with appropriate learning for clinical teams distributed at this time. Specific examples included teaching on end of life care within general surgery/vascular patients and involvement of the learning disabilities team wit hin respiratory medicine. Cases that have been identified through the mortality process that have been referred through to the serious incident review group , involve cases in whic h sepsis care (in ED) w ere inadequate and care concerns regarding the end of life care (in an unavoidable death). The information from these cases has tied into ongoing work in the T rust around these themes. The mortality case review process ha s allowed th e MSG to accumulate data regarding mortality within the T rust. The MSG reviews this data on a monthly basis and disseminates learning/themes around mortality via a network of directorate mortality (clinical) leads. The mortality review process has taken ti me to become established and the first stage (to mid -2017/18) has focused on identification and mortality process. The MSG had identified issues regarding the co -morbidity and palliative care coding of final acute hospital episodes and have worked with the coding department to see an improved reporting of both of these. The work described above regarding pre -admission concerns identified through the thematic analysis , will be used to shape work via the collaborative improvement board and with the end of lif e team. 6. An assessment of the impact of the actions described in section 5 which were taken by the provider during the reporting period. Considera ble input has been made by the T rust in establishing the process for morality reviews. This has been a signific ant undertaking by the clinicians performing the reviews and the governance infrastructure needed to support this. The MSG is still in its relative infancy. It is very difficult to assess impact resulting directly from mortality reviews at this stage due t o a number of different factors; Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 96 the process (with respect to learning) is still in developmen t, there is a considerable over lap with emerging themes to work already being undertaken within the trust (eg e nd of life, palliative care) as well the difficulty in tying in local (directorate) governance a nd learning with |Trust -wide processes. With respect to work within the MSG , the change of approach , listed above, with respect to co -morbidity and palliative care coding has been successful with an increase in both. The increase in comorbid ity coding has br ought the T rust up to the national average SHMI comorbidity per spell and above the national average HSMR comorbid per spell, and although palliative care coding per discharge is still below the national avera ge (1.2% compared to around 2.2%) there has been significant improvement towards this figure. 7. The number of case record reviews or investigations finished in the reporting period which related to deaths during the previous reporting period but were not in cluded in section 2 in the relevant document for that previous reporting period. We have not consistently recorded the date reviews are completed. We acknowledge that there is often a delay in the death occurring and the review being notified centrally. Th erefore, for section 7 and section 8 we have provided figures relating to all reviews conducted for deaths occurring during the fourth quarter of 2016/17, regardless of when these were notified. This approach assumes that all review for Q4 deat hs were cond ucted within the2017/ 18 period. As an estimate, 263 case record reviews and 0 investigations completed after 1st April 2017 which related to deaths which took place before the start of the reporting period 8. An estimate of the number of deaths included in se ction 7 which the provider judges as a result of the review or investigation were more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient, with an explanation of the methods used to assess this. 8 representing 3.3% of the patient deaths before the reporting period, are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in care provided to the patient. This number has been estimated using the locally designed tool and methodology described above. 9. A revised estimate o f the number of deaths during the previous reporting period stated in section 3 of the relevant document for that previous reporting period, taking account of the deaths referred to in section 8. 43 representing 5.0% of the patient deaths during 2016/17 ar e judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 97 PART THREE - OTHER INFORMATION Part Three of the Quality Account provides an overview of the Trust's achievements and progress within quality indicators that have been selected by the board in consultation with stakeholders, including CQUINs. The data reviewed covers the three dimensions of quality - patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience . This demonstrates that the Trust has provid ed high quality of care, but with room for further improvement as highlighted below. Many of the indicators are the same as for previous years, with a small change to the infection control indicators within the patient safety area to include additional i ndicators that focus on the outcome for patients alongside process indicators relating to hand - washing and managing norovirus. In addition, Part Three also includes further information on a number of key work - streams that the Trust is currently focussing o n to improve quality and a review of performance against national targets and regulatory requirements. PATIENT SAFETY Hand washing A key component in the reduction of infection is thorough hand hygiene by all clinical staff. This is an important issue for the Trust and all our patients. Monthly hand hygiene compliance audits are carried out in all areas. The infection prevention and control team also undertake hand hygiene validation audits to check the reliability of the data collected and identify ar eas for improvement. Results are fed back to directorate managers, senior nurses and the ward sisters and teams. Local Target: 90% compliance Actual 2017/18 - 94% Norovirus Norovirus is one of the most common cause s of infective gastroenteritis in th e UK. It is highly infectious and cause s regular outbreaks of diarrhoea in the community and hospitals. Norovirus outbreaks can occur at any time of the year, but are more common in the winter months , with hospital outbreaks often l eading to ward closure a nd disruption in hospital activity. In 2017/18 there were 23 confirmed norovirus outbreaks in the Trust, resulting in restrictions being put in place on wards. Outbreaks were managed in line with the Trust's 'Management of Norovirus' policy and the Guide lines for the management Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 98 of norovirus outbreaks in acute and community and social care settings' (DH Norovirus Working Party December 2011). Sustaining reductions in healthcare associated infections Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) blood stream infections Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus is an organism which is resistant to the antibiotics usually used to treat infections caused by the staphylococcus aureus bacterium. Infections caused by the bacterium can range from mild to l ife threatening and can be particularly hard to treat as special antibiotics have to be used. The Trust's aim for 2017/18 was to have no MRSA Trust -apportioned bloodstream infections (specimen taken on or after the third day of admission in line with the s tandard national definition), as agreed with the Trust's commissioners. Unfortunately, the Trust had three cases of MRSA bloodstream infections in 2017/18. Multi -disciplinary reviews were completed to identify the source of the infection and any areas of sub-optimal practice that may have contributed to the case. Opportunities to improve a) MRSA screening and b) checking patient histories for any previous history of MRS A were identified and this learning was shared and improvement actions put in place . Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) Clostridium difficile is a bacterium that is present in the gut of up to 3% of healthy adults and does not normally cause any harm. CDI can occur when the normal bacteria in the gut are disturbed, usually by ta king antibiotics. This allows the bacterium to multiply rapidly in the gut and produce toxins which cause diarrhoea, and in some cases severe inflammation of the bowel. The Trust continues to implement a number of actions to help reduce the risk to patie nts, which includes: Robust antibiotic stewardship to help reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics; Prompt Isolation of patients with diarrhoea and / or a confirmed CDI; Isolation of patients with a history CDI, if they are at an increased risk of developing symptoms; Scrupulous hand washing with soap and water following contact with patients with CDI; Regular review of patients with CDI by a microbiologist and the Infection; Prevention and control team to support medical management and isolation practice; Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 99 Enhanced cleaning of rooms with hydrogen peroxide based technology to help eradicate CDI spores; Enhanced cleaning of equipment with a sporicidal agent; Working closely with the Trust's partners in the community to help reduce the risk of CDI in primary care. In 2017/18, the Trust had a total of 18 trust-attributed cases (defined as specimen with a positive toxin test result taken on or after the fourt h day of admission). This was a sharp increase from the previous year when there were only eight cases identified. However, this had coincided with a general increase in CDI cases in Somerset this year compared to last year, and this may have impacted on the number of hospital cases. All cases of Trust -apportioned CDI are thoroughly investigated t o ass ess whether there was any lapse in care that may have contributed to the case. These assessments are subsequently peer reviewed and validated with the Trust's commissioners. To date, i n five of the 18 cases a lapse of care that could have contributed towards the case was identified. Learning included ensuring appropriate antimicrobial prescribing and compliance with hand hygiene, and learning was shared with the appropriate clinical staff and improvement actions taken. A high standard of environmen tal cleaning is a key infection control measure for CDI. A new centrally managed cleaning arrangement was introduced in the Trust in November 2017, which will help ensure a high standard of cleaning in all areas of the hospital and ensure that any gaps in the cleaning service are readily covered in high risk areas. To ensure the optimal use of antibiotics , antimicrobial stewardship remains a high priority in the trus t, with regular review of broad spectrum antimicrobi al prescribing on both medical and su rgical wards by a consultant microbiologist and antim icrobial pharmacist. The use of high risk broad -spectrum antibiotic prescribing has significantly reduced in favour of lower risk combination therapy with narrow spectrums agents, and the Trust remains amongst the lowest users of these a gents in the region. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 100 PATIENT EXPERIENCE DIETETICS - ENSURING PATIENTS RE CEIVE ADEQUATE AND NOURISHING FOOD Nourishment is a key element in recovery from illness or surgery and maintenance of good health. Food and nutrition is a priority for high quality care and the Trust knows that it needs to maintain the programme for continual improvement of food services, food availability, staff education and practice. The Trust provides patients with a range of nourishing fo ods, as needed, and aims to ensure that they are given the assistance as required. Food availability Availability of food, including hot meals and snacks, 24 hours a day enables patients to have flexible access to nutrition in order to meet their needs. I n addition to the wide menu of both hot and cold food served at the usual mealtimes, the Trust has the facilities required to provide hot meals 'out of hours' for patients who are unable to eat at the usual mealtimes or would prefer a hot meal at a differe nt time, whether this is day or night. To provide this flexibility, the Trust has microwaves on every ward and freezers which are stocked with balanced nutritious meals. These meals can cater for a range of diets, including gluten free, vegetarian, modifie d textures, milk free etc. An iPad system for food ordering is in use. This has a number of benefits, including a safer system for ordering special diets and immediate electronic delivery of patient meal choices from wards to the kitchen. The iPad has bee n Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 101 further refined with the addition of nutritional information for each menu item. The aim is also to add pictorial menus so that this is available at the patient's bedside over the course of the next financial year. Staff knowledge Staff education on nut rition and food provision continues to be a priority with the requirement that a minimum of 80% of the ward staff have the knowledge they need about food availability in order that patients receive what they need. A ward food folder, detailing information on food provision and special diets is available on each ward. This is supplemented by menus and special diet information available on the ward iPads and is for use by both staff and patients to ensure that patients are able to receive the food they need a nd would like. With the change in December 2017 of staff roles and responsibilities for patient food ordering and service, the priority has been to provide Food Safety Awareness and Food Hygiene training for relevant staff. A continuing programme of cours e dates is enabling the key staff to receive this important training. Help with eating The aim for patients receiving sufficient food within or outside mealtimes focused on ensuring those who needed assistance with eating reported that they had been helpe d. The Trust aims for 95% (good) achievement for this. The target was set in the context of improving assistance to patients, between and at mealtimes, by: ensuring they could reach their food and drinks opening packaging offering finger foods providin g prompting, or fully helping them to eat where this was needed. With the Trust -wide change from the inpatient survey to the 'Two minutes of your time' survey, the patient feedback for 'Help with Eating' changed to a separate, bespoke survey in 2017/18. T hree surveys have taken place since June 2017 covering 1 8 wards. In June 2017, 94.7% of the patients reported receiving the help they needed. In Sep tember 2017, the figure was 66% however this improved to 86.6% in February 2018. The Trust continues to com pare well from the 2016 National Inpatient Survey with the question patients are asked, 'Did you get enough help from staff to eat your meals?' The results when benchmarked show that the Trust is similar compared to other trusts on this question. Nationa l Recognition for Improvements in Catering The Trust received positive publicity in January 2018 when it was named as the second best hospital in England for its healthy food and drink by the Health Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 102 Business magazine. It follows many improvements made by t he Trust over the last few years. Improvements achieved in the last year Introduction of new attractive blue crockery on all adult wards. This has been undertaken as there is evidence that suggests coloured crockery aids food intake in the elderly, particu larly people with Dementia, by helping them to distinguish the food on the plate. In December 2017, the hospital undertook the Droplet\u00ae trial with the aim of promoting and improving patient's hydration. This is a dementia -friendly mug and plastic tumbler t hat plays a series of pre -set messages to patients if they are not drinking regularly enough. Following the successful trial, where those patients using the Droplet\u00ae drank 63% more than those who didn't, the plan is to introduce the mugs a nd tumblers acros s the hospital by May 2018. Special new menus have been developed and introduced on the Children's wards in September 2017. These include a wide range of popular choices along with healthier dishes, containing less salt and sugar. The change of menus has b een accompanied by a Ward Food Folder designed specifically for the Children's wards. Introduction of 'Bags of Kindness' for those patients who are being discharged home with no one to organise food supplies in their houses in preparation of their arrival. These food bags provide basic provisions to tide the patients over until they are able to get groceries in to their homes. An audit of food and drink availability on drinks rounds and food stocked in ward freezers was undertaken in May 2017. This showed g ood compliance against the expected standard, with the exception of three of the 33 items checked, where stocks were inconsistent. Recommendations for improved availability of these have been made to the relevant ward managers. New and improved nursing ca re plans have been introduced for patients at risk of malnutrition. Close working with all food and drink outlets on site to make sure we continue to promote healthy nutritional choices, including strongly encouraging the sale of non -sugary drinks and not allowing advertisements and promotion of sugary drinks. Once again the Trust has actively participated in the international Nutrition and Hydration week, held in March 2018 . This year, activities in the main hospital concourse focused on trialling new dis hes which will be introduced in the updated patient menus being developed and also on promotion of Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 103 hydration through demonstration of the Droplet\u00ae mugs. In addition, cakes were supplied to the wards for the 'Big Tea Party' and there were s pecial event days run by ward staff on their wards. Over the course of 2017/18 some wards have shown excellent initiative in running other special events including a Jubilee Garden Party, and Harvest and Easter themed days, which all help to promote the importance of nutri tion for patient health and wellbeing. The Trust continues to have a group of highly committed 'Nutrition Champions'. These are ward staff who work to improve nutrition in their ward areas with support from the Dietitians and Dietetic Assistants. Work co ntinues to ensure that the Trust meets the requirements of national patient safety alerts and an international improvement programme for patients requiring tube feeding. Further improvement identified Menus are being updated and will include a choice of h ot finger foods and special small, but energy dense, meals to support patients on our Care of Older People wards. Also, to support those patients for whom healthier (lower fat and sugar) food choices are appropriate during their hospital stay, menus will a lso include a wider range of options. Modified texture menus and support materials will be revised, in preparation for new coding of food and drink for patients with swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) being implemented by April 2019. Work with ward teams to ensure that food services and mealtime systems continue to improve to meet our patients' needs. This will include a programme called 'Mealtimes Matter' , which will be introduced to ensure that focus on mealtimes is maintained, particularly ensuring that all patients needing help with eating always receive it. The Dietitians will be working with their colleagues in Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to develop new nutritional care plans for patients on discharge, so that there is clearer communicat ion to support patients to be in control of their own care wherever appropriate. Further auditing of compliance and accuracy of nutritional screening with a plan for regular education and training for ward staff , including an e -learning programme. Further work will be undertaken in collaboration with our on -site food and drink outlets to ensure that healthier choices are available ahead of the national recommendations. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 104 SEEKING AND LEARNING FROM FEEDBACK With an ambition to provide high quality patient an d family centred care, it is fundamental in planning and delivering service s to gather people's views and experiences and act upon these to shape and improve the service and culture. As part of this it is vitally important to seek out and actively engage w ith a diverse group of people who have experience of the services delivered by Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust. In 2017 the following feedback was gathered: CQC inspection 2017 : Overall rating: Good. Well -led rating: Good. 'The Trust had engage ment with the public, its staff, people who used services, and stakeholders, in order to take their views into account when planning services'. 'Engagement with the patients and public was important to staff who acted on complaints or incidents to improve care' . For urgent and e mergency services it noted : 'The unit valued feedback from patients'. For Surgery it was recognised that 'there were positive Friends and Family test results'. NHS Choices for 2015/16 : NHS Choices for October 2016 - December 2017: Overall rating 3 out of 5 stars (based on 11 ratings). The Trust has continued its subscription to Care Opinion. There are responders trained and in place at a local level allowing local responses and thus visibility and actions to stories posted.

Patient Experience Collaborat ion In September 2017, the Trust committed to collaboration with 1 0 other t rusts , led by Northumbria NHS Foundation Trust , to implement 'real -time measurement'. This collaboration intends to test if real -time measurement is feasible in different organisat ions and to understand if it can support improvement in those patient experience measures over the year. There are six wards participating at Musgrove Park Hospital and two within Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, as part of a joint venture within the wider collaboration. The wards participating have a survey based on the national in -patient survey questions asked of 50% of the patients on the ward on a fortnightly basis. The first phase of collecting and establishing the baseline data for the ward s was completed in December 2017. Throughout the collaboration the results will be published to the wards on the same day for sharing and where needed for action. Specialist services seeking feedback Cancer Services Patient Surveys There is a rolling progr amme of patient feedback from the cancer services: Head and Neck - reported September 2017: Overall patients were happy with staff attitude A few issues were highlighted regarding the comfort of some of the waiting areas . Not all patients felt it had been suggested they bring a companion to the diagnosis consultation . In the main , patients stated that they were well informed throughout their pathway and the majority felt able to ask questions . Patients felt supported by the Clinical Nurse Specialist ( CNS ), although a few indicated they did not always find it easy to contact her. Urology - reported June 2017 and action Sept ember 2017: Waiting room facilities , particularly Surgical Investigation Unit and north - west reception in the Duchess building need upgr ading .

Highly evaluated service by the melanoma patients . North reception facilities reported as needing upgrading . Radiotherapy reported January 2017 and action May 2017: Treatment machine delays to be verbally communicated to patient s in the waiting area . Option to designate a quiet area for patients waiting . Where possible appointments to be scheduled at similar times each day . Doctors to not guarantee specific appointments where this is not achievable. Friends and family (F&F) test - Two Minutes of Your Time survey and One Quick Question surveys The Friends and Family test is one of the ways that we listen to our patients. It is a national measure that gives patients an opportunity to provide feedback. The results give wards/depart ments feedback on their care, but are also reviewed nationally to understand the Trust 's performance alongside other t rusts. At Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, the F&F question is now a part of the two minutes of your time survey for all in -patients , and the one quick question survey for all other areas. This allows the potential for all patients to provide feedback on their experience. Although the Trust is a positive outlier for the results, the response rates are below the national average an d have been a focus since September 2017. The following tables illustrate the Trust 's overall rating from patients over time: Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 109 NATIONAL SURVEYS The National Survey Programme provides assurance of broad service coverage within national programmes.

PATIENT AND PUBLIC I NVOLVEMENT (PPI) Contribution from g overnors, Musgrove partners and Healthwatch The Trust's g overnors support the continued patient engagement and feedback agenda , particularly learning from fe edba ck. The governors Patient Care Group regularly reviews feedback from patients/relatives from the local community, which is included in \"The Good to Know\" log report at their meeting. The Trust has established links with Healthwatch and at regular mee tings listens to feedback from this route and engages with Healthwatch to support engagement activities particularly with the groups that may be seldom heard. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 113 The Musgrove Partners are a group of Patient Voice Volunteers who support engagement and partici pate in activities from recruitment of staff to focus groups, reviewing serious incidents, and within the improvement boards and projects. The patient experience team also support observations, shadowing, emotional mapping, focus groups and other engagemen t events for specific topics. PRIVACY AND DIGNITY We recognise that dignity, respect and privacy in care is an important issue for patients who come to us for care and treatment. We are committed to maintaining patient privacy, and treating individuals wi th dignity and respect. To monitor this we survey our patients and set ourselves the target of 90% positive response. The results are reviewed monthly by the directorates and board. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 114 LEARNING FROM CONCER NS AND COMPLAINTS The Trust takes concerns and com plaints seriously. They are an important opportunity for the Trust to learn and improve. Concerns and complaints can surface and the quality of the investigation, response and actions allow improvements in the safety and quality of care delivery. We strive to create an open culture where complaints are welcomed and learnt from. In 2017 the following feedback was gathered about complaint handling at the Trust: Care Quality Commission F eedback - December 2017 Summary The T rust had systems to identify learn ing from complaints and make improvements. The T rust had a team responsible for receiving, investigating and acting on complaints. The T rust had a low level of complaints. The number had fallen in recent years, and this was felt by senior staff to be as a result of taking quick action, and attempting to resolve issues before they escalated. The reduction in complaints was also against a background of the Trust making it easier for people to complain using multimedia options, such as a simple form on the website. There was a developing culture where meetings were held with complainants at an early stage. It was recognised for some people that this was a significantly better approach than a letter or series of correspondence. The Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) had moved to be more central within the hospital, and ran stalls around the hospital to bring awareness of its role and offering support and guidance. Learning from complaints was addressed where it was relevant. Therefore, some learning might be at ward level, some for the est ates team, some for departments - such as operating the atres, and others for the whole T rust. Complaints were reviewed and shared amongst all directorates. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 115 Complaint reports were produced every month by t he complaints teams and shared at directorate and specialty team meetings. Where lessons had been learnt from concerns and complaints it was shared with the complainant. Four complaint records were reviewed , and it was found that they were responded to in the correct period. Complainants were provided with the action plans developed to address the concerns raised. We saw evidence that a compassionate and honest response had been provided and a clear written record had been kept of the process. We also s aw that an action plan had been written, which included the learning that was to be disseminated to staff. When complainants were still unhappy after a complain t had been closed by the team, they were signposted to the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsm an (PHSO). The complaints team contributed to the preceptor nurse -training programme, to educate new nurses about complaints and learning from them. Feedback for Jowett ward Complaints were discussed at the daily safety brief. When things went wrong, st aff apologised and gave patients honest information and suitable support. Feedback for Emergency Department The department treated concerns and complaints seriously, investigated them and learned lessons from the results. These were shared with all staff in the Emergency D epartment and acr oss the wider T rust, if relevant. In the departmental meetings some subjects , such as complaints , were discussed each month. There were discussions about learning from complaints, although this was not always easy to se e clearly in the minutes. Feedback for Surgery People we spoke with knew how to make a complaint. Information regarding how to make a c omplaint could be found on the Trust's website, patient information leaflets and posters directing patients to the hos pital's Patient Advice Liaison Service (PALS). Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 116 Leaflets were available in easy -read format and were ava ilable in non -English languages . Complaints were managed in an appropriate manner. Lessons were learned from complaints. Minutes of meetings held f or surgical and critical board meetings were reviewed and items discussed included complaints and concerns. Feedback for end of life care The hospital held weekly palliative care multidisciplinary meetings. Staff from the complaints service attended these meeting s once a month. The service treated concerns and complaints seriously, investigated them and learned lessons from the results, which were shared with all staff. Complaint reports were shared at directorate and specialty team meetings. This included the detail from a complaint -tracking document, which mapped the progress any complaint process was making. Outpatients The service treated concerns and complaints seriously, investigated them and learned lessons from the results, which were shared w ith all staff. Patients and visitors we spoke with knew how to complain. We saw that action plans were monitored at outpatient department governance meetings. There were Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) leaflets in the outpatient departments , detailing how to make a complaint. Managers told us they preferred to speak with patients about complaints and resolve them as soon as possible. In outpatients, the complaints and PALS officers set up a table for two hours per week for patients and s taff to discuss any issues. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 117 THE PARLIAMENTARY AN D HEALTH SERVICE OMB UDSMAN (PHSO ) In 2017/18, 160 complaints investigated: 35 not upheld, 16 upheld and 93 partially upheld (16 still under investigation) During the year the 692 concerns were raised th rough the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALs). All of these concerns are investigated and feedback given to the person who raised the issue. This includes setting out what staff have learnt and any changes made as a result of the questions raised. The Trust aims to avoid cause for concerns or complaints in the first instance, and where concerns and complaints are raised to address them thoroughly and in a timely way. Every complaint is reviewed to identify the issues raised. This is to ensure that we can learn and continuously improve. The categorisation of issues identified for all complaints is recorded and reviewed to allow wider learning and identification of trends. This is considered alongside other patient information such as incidents and f eedback gained from monthly patient surveys. The monthly integrated performance report includes a range of quality indicators which includes response times to complaints. During the year, learning from complaints has been shared across the hospital in a n umber of ways, including the use of patient stories and hearing directly from patients and their relatives about their experience. The following are examples of the learning and improvements that have been made: A patient was admitted for surgery to remov e an ectopic pregnancy; she was very unhappy that she was discharged from hospital without any advice or detailed instructions. As a result of the complaint investigation the senior sister and consultant involved agreed to produce a patient information l eaflet for patients discharged from hospital, specifically for women who have experienced an ectopic pregnancy and subsequent surgery. Sister worked with staff and patients from the Early Pregnancy Assessment Clinic and the gynaecology team to design the l eaflet. The leaflet will include practical advice regarding bleeding post -surgery and information on where women can seek further emotional support if required. It is important that any themes are identified and action taken. A patient was due a six -month follow up appointment but was removed from the department's list citing that the patient no longer wished to have Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 118 the operation. However, neither the patient nor the consultant had made this request. As a result of the investigation, procedures have be en taken to prevent patients being removed from surgical waiting lists without checking that this is the correct action and that the patient is aware of our actions. In future, the admissions team agreed that they need to speak directly to the patient and the consultant's secretary to ensure that the correct information is communicated. The PHSO provides an independent complaints handling service for a range of public bodies. Should any of our complainants be dissatisfied with the handling and outcome of t heir complaint , they have the right to request the Ombudsman to undertake an independent review. We ensure that every complainant is given information about the role of the Ombudsman. The Trust has seen a decrease in the number of cases referred to the Ombudsman this year, with seven new cases referred, compared to 14 last year. Of the seven that have been referred this year, two have not been upheld and five remain under investigation. CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS LENGTH OF STAY The Trust strives to ensur e that patients do not stay in hospital for any longer than is clinically necessary. This ensures patients receive the best care in the right setting, whilst also ensuring the Trust uses its resources effectively. Reports on average length of stay are mon itored in regular Trust Board reports and at a more detailed level by each directorate in their monthly Performance Assurance Framework (PAF) reviews. The following charts show the average length of stay for elective a nd non -elective patients in 2017/18 and the previous year. The Trust would typically expect average elective length of stay to be below non -elective as elective activity is more predictable and planned. Emergency cases are often more complex and so need longer treatment and recovery periods . Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 119 Elective Average Length of Stay The average length of stay for patients admitted for elective operations during 2017/18 was below the level reported in 2016/17 over the summer months, and at similar levels to the previous year for most other months . The average length of stay of patients discharged in January 2018 may have been higher than in January 2017 because of the very high levels of emergency admissions in the month which resulted in a high proportion of routine surgery being cancelled. Those operations which did go ahead were the more clinically urgent and hence more complex operations, for which patients would usually stay longer in hospital. Non-Elective Average Length of Stay The average length of stay for patients admitted non-elect ively during 2017/18 was also below that reported in 2016/17. The reduction in length of stays between years was most significant in October and November, when the seasonal rise in Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 120 stays is usually seen. This reduction in the length of stay in hospital for e mergency patients is likely due to the implementation of the Home First model of care, which commenced in October 2017. Home First facilitates the discharge of Medically Fit for Discharge patients out of the acute trust. Patients receive an intensive perio d of reablement in three settings to promote independence and keep patients (for as long as possible) in their usual place of residence. The length of stay of non - elective patients discharged from January 2018 increased to the levels seen in the same perio d in the previous year. The length of stays across the last quarter of the year were likely affected by the closures of wards affected by norovirus, with some patients' stays needing to be extended until they were well enough to leave hospital. CANCER WAIT ING TIMES During 2017/18 the Trust performed well against the four 31 -day decision to treat to treatment waiting time standards, achieving the target for the year as a whole and in most months of the year . These standards cover the waiting time from decision to treat through to the time when treatment commences, for patients with a first cancer and those needing subsequent treatment. The 62 -day wait from referral to treatment, for patients referred by one of the three national screening programmes (breast , cervical and bowel) was also achieved for the year as a whole and in most months of the year. However, the Trust under -performed against the two -week wait target s for 'symptomatic ' breast patients (where cancer is not suspected) and for patients referre d by the GP with a suspected cancer, and for the 62 -day wait from referral by a GP with a suspected cancer, to treatment. The under -performance against the two -week wait standard for symptomatic breast patients was mainly due to staffing challenges, with a shortfall in certain months of specialist radiologists to support outpatient clinics, and also patients refusing to accept appointments offered within the first two weeks of referral . The breast service is the only one where the national standard is that all patients referred have to be seen within two weeks of referral, regardless of whether or not cancer is suspected. Where cancer is not suspected, these are referred to as symptomatic breast patients. We are c ontinuing to work with our commissioners and GP colleagues to try to ensure that patients are only referred in when they are willing to accept appointments within two weeks, even when cancer is not suspected. Performance against the two -week wait standard for patients referred by their GP with a susp ected cancer has been variable during 2017/18. During January and February 2018 performance was significantly above the 93% national standard. However, performance for the remainder of the year has been below the national standard. The two main reasons for patients not being seen within two weeks of Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 121 referral has been, a shortfall in capacity within the CT (computerised tomography) scanning service and patients choosing to delay appointments. There has been a marked increase during 2017/18 in the number of r eferrals made by GPs for patients with a possible lung or colorectal cancer, and it is these patients who are most likely to need a CT scan as their first diagnostic test. Additional CT capacity was established from December 2017, which helped to bring wai ts down to consistently less than 14 days. Plans are in place to establish an additional on -site CT scanner during 2018/19, which will help to ensure waiting times remain within the target 14 days. The growth in two -week wait referrals has also resulted in further challenges in achieving the 62 -day GP referrals to treatment standard, because this is the first step in the 62 -day GP pathway. The 62 -day wait for treatment is an important measure of clinical effectiveness for the Trust. The 62 -day target is de fined as follows: The indicator is expressed as a percentage of patients receiving first definitive treatment for cancer within 62 days of an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer or a referral from one of the screening programmes (bowel, cervical or breast); The above standards are counted separately; An urgent GP referral is one which requires a two -week wait from the date that the referral is received to first being seen by a consultant; The clock start date is defined as the date that the referral is received by the Trust. The clock stop date is the date of first definitive cancer treatment as defined in the NHS Dataset Set Change Notice. In summary, this is the date of the first definitive cancer treatment given to a patient who is receiving care for a cancer condition; or it is the date that cancer was discounted when the patient was first seen; or it is the date that the patient made the decision to decline all treatment. Like many trusts across the country, Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust did not achieve the 85% target for the 62 -day GP standard during 2017/18. The reasons for the failure to achieve the standard included the complexity of patients being referred, the high levels of referrals not being able to be matched by service capac ity, especially for diagnostic tests such as CT, MRI and endoscopy; patients choosing to delay diagnostic tests or treatment, and delays for patients being seen for specialist treatment at other providers. The Trust held a Cancer Summit early in the year, getting together a range of clinical, managerial and administrative staff to understand the reasons behind potential delays in cancer pathways. This generated a range of new ideas, from which a Cancer Improvement Plan was developed with work -streams includ ing ways to reduce Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 122 diagnostic delays and the redesign of a number of cancer pathways. This plan will continue to be implemented and added to in 2018/19. Compliance with all cancer targets continues to be closely monitored by the Trust Board . HOSPITAL ST ANDARDISED MORTALITY RATIO (HSMR) The hospital standardised mortality ratio (HSMR) is a method of comparing mortality against the predicted national average but taking into account a range of factors such as the case -mix of patients, palliative care case s and differences in populations. It is calculated on 56 diagnosis groups that account for around 80% of in-hospital deaths. The ratio is of actual deaths to expected deaths, multiplied by 100. If the number of deaths is higher than would be expected, the HSMR will be greater than 100. Mortality rates show considerable variation over the short - term which means that observing them over longer periods of time (12 months) provides a better perspective on genuine trends. It is important to highlight that there is no statistically significant association between hospital -wide mortality rates and avoidable deaths, nor with the quality of hospital care. Whilst the methodology for HSMR may take into account factors such as palliative care, there are differences i n the way trusts code this data which may make comparisons less reliable. The following graph illustrates the Trust's quarterly overall rolling 12 -month HSMR over the last three years. The HSMR is currently in the 'as expected banding', suggesting the Tru st's in -hospital mortality rate is not significantly different than the national average. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 123 HSMR is presented alongside the 95% confidence intervals. Where the lower confidence interval exceeds 100, the HSMR is said to be significantly higher than expect ed. Where the confidence interval spans 100, the HSMR is within the expected range. In order to explore the root causes for this position, the Trust reviews individual diagnostic groups and conducts investigations to identify the causes when these are diff erent from those expected. It should be noted that small variations are not necessarily accurate reflections of changes in the standard of care as these are statistical representations with certain inherent errors. It is most valuable in detecting major de viations or trends. During 2017/18 the Trust has conducted a number of reviews into its high standardised mortality ratios within certain diagnostic groups that contribute to the overall high HSMR. These diagnosis groups include pleurisy, pneumothorax, pulmonary collapse, acute myocardial infarction, and hip fracture. The investigations consist of a review of coding practices, case mix and the structure of our services. It also includes a review of the quality of the care the Trust was delivering. The revie ws found no significant causes for concern relating to the quality of care being delivered. During the year, some Improvements to co - morbidity coding and changes to palliative care coding have been made. ORGAN DONATION The Trust continues to implement nat ional and regional best practice and remains compliant with NICE guidance (CG 135). An outstanding referral rate of potential organ donors has been achieved (96.5%) and our collaborative approach rate of 80% remains in line with the national average. The o verall consent rate for organ donation within the Trust is 64%; reflecting the national average of 63%. As a result, the Trust continues to perform well in terms Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 124 of organ donation with a total of nine transplants enabled over the year. Of note, is the numb er of organs donated per donor which has increased from the previous figure 2.8 up to 5.3 organs per donor. This indicates good clinical management of our potential organ donors and is well above the national average of 3.4 organs per donor. Key work for 2 017/18 will be a continued focus on the NHS Blood and Transplant national strategy concerning the end of life care and organ donation management of patients from the Emergency D epartment following devastating brain injury. NHS STAFF SURVEY 201 7 / PULSE C HECK Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust strongly believes that whilst our core value is 'putting the patient first', our culture and significant organisational development programme is founded on a belief that person -centred care can only be delive red through a person -centred culture. Therefore, the Trust places significant value on the insight provided by both the NHS staff survey and the internal engagement measure, 'Pulse Check'. 2017 NHS staff survey The 2017 NHS staff survey results show overal l staff engagement. A score based on a number of key questions which can be used as a benchmark against other acute hospitals is 3.92 for 2017, which shows the Trust having an increase over the score in 2016 which was 3.89. The key findings which make up the overall engagement score relate to: staff members' perceived ability to contribute to improvements at work; their willingness to recommend the Trust as a place to work or receive treatment; and the extent to which they feel motivated and engaged with t heir work. The table below sets out the specific questions which make the key findings with the results for 2014 -17. Question 2017 2016 2015 2014 Acute hospitals (2017) Difference against national benchmark +/- I look forward to going to work 61% 60% 67% 55% 58% 78% 71% 74% +3% 71% 77% +2% Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 125 Question 2017 2016 2015 2014 Acute hospitals (2017) Difference against national benchmark +/- There are frequent opportunities for me to show initiative in my role 75% 75% 78% 69% 73% +2% I am able to make suggestions to improve the work of my team / department 78% 79% 78% 79% 74% +4% I am able to make improvements happen in my area of work 58% 57% 60% 55% 56% +2% Care of patients top priority 84% 84% 85% 74% 76% +8% I would recommend to work 72% 71% 74% 63% 61% +11% If a friend or relative needed treatment, I would be happy with the standard of care provided by this organisation 84% 84% 82% 78% 71% +13% Harassment, bullying or abuse from staff in last 12 months and equal opportunities for career progression Key finding 26 of the 2016 NHS Staff Survey sets out the percentage of sta ff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from staff in the last 12 months as 23%. This is a reduction since the 2015 survey of 7% and below the average for acute trusts of 25%. The NHS Staff Survey report recognises this as a statistically significant movement in the right direction. This key finding is made up of two questions : Question 2017 2016 Acute hospitals (2017) % never experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse at work from managers in the last 12 months 91% 90% 87% % never exper 81% Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 126 Question 2017 2016 Acute hospitals (2017) abuse at work from other colleagues in the last 12 months Following on from the work undertaken in 2 016 further work was done Trust -wide. This involved running focus groups throughout the early part of 2017 and providing opportunities for all colleagues to attend a session and have a discussion around some specific questions. These questions centred on trying to further understand the reality of some of the issues colleagues are facing and how best we can su pport them and reduce the experiences of harassment, bullying or abuse they are feeling from other colleagues, patients and managers. The output of the focus group has now seen a small working group in place with representation from across the Trust to tu rn the feedback that we have heard and collated into positive action. Some of the things that are in place already includ e training around how to have a meaningful conversation with people and resilience training. We are also working in partnership with our alliance colleagues and have started to provide traini ng to front line colleagues on mental health a wareness and de-escalation techniques . The score for the percentage of staff believing that the organisation provides equal opportunities for career pro gression or promotion, remains at 88%. This key finding is based on one question: '% saying the organisation acts fairly with regard to career progression / promotion, regardless of ethnic background, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability or a ge. Staff conversations / listening to staff The People Partner team have continued to take forward interventions and build on the previous years' work , which has now been expanded across to Somerset Partnership. These interventions have included mini -conversations where teams have been given the opportunity to facilitate conversations around team dynamics, behaviours and culture , and enabled them to come up with some actions that they can commit to , in order to improve in these areas . The group has als o been involved with team building sessions, supporting new teams that are coming together , and facilitating them to build relationships that will enable strong group support foundations for taking the future of their services forward. Pulse Check Launch ed in 2014 Pulse Check is the key people metric, with a strong focus on discerning how colleagues feel about how they are being led by their line manager at a local level . Pulse Check runs twice per year for each directorate, asking the Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 127 same 14 questions s o that the results can be compared. Each directorate receives a report showing a breakdown of their results for every department which has over eight responses. This enables managers at a local level to understand how colleagues are feeling compared with t he wider directorate and the hospital overall. The view provided by Pulse Check across the whole Trust enables celebration of areas that are doing well and identifies areas which need further support. As part of the people metrics for the Trust, five of the 14 questions are amalgamated into the leadership capability index, which is the key measurement used to identify how well managers are leading their teams in line with the Trust's leadership behaviours. The five questions used to make up this index a re: I think that it is safe to speak up and challenge the way things are done; My immediate manager motivates and inspires me to do a great job; My immediate manager recognises and acknowledges when I have done my job well; My immediate manager makes t ime to see me when I need support or direction; I receive regular and constructive feedback on my performance. The following table shows the percentage of respondents responding positively to the questions during 2017/18 for the Trust as a Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1:Q4 +/- How likely are you to recommend this organisation to friends and family if they needed care or treatment? 94% 96.5% 88.9% 96.2% +2.2% How likely are you to recommend this organisation to friends and family as a place to work? 76.4% 83.5% 68.9% 82.9% +6.5% Leadership questions) 70.5% 78.9% 67.1% 79% +8.5% I think that it is safe to speak up and challenge the way things are done 70.1% 74.7% 61.7% 75.1% +5% My immediate manager mo tivates and inspires me to do a great job 69.2% Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 128 and acknowledges when I have done my job well My immediate manager makes time to see me when I need support or directi on 80.4% 87.8% 77.4% 85.9% +5.5% I receive my performance 62.5% 73.2% 58.6% 74% +11.5% I believe that we are providing high quality services to our patients/service users 91.8% 92.2% 85.1% 92.2% +0.4% I feel that qua lity and safety of our patient care is our hospital's top priority 86.6% 86.5% 80.5% 90.1% +3.5% I have the tools and equipment I need to do my job well 73.5% 74.3% 63% 75.9% +2.4% When we get things wrong I feel that we learn and make changes to improve 78.5% 84.7% 69.2% 82.9% +4.4% I feel respected and valued member of my team immediate manager places a strong emphasis on promoting safety and wellbeing of colleagues 72.7% 82.9% 75.6% 80.9% +8.2% The senior leaders of this organisation are doing the right things in line with our values, for Musgrove Park to be successful. 56.5% 69.7% 44.1% 70.4% +13.9% Preceptees / Assistant Practitioners and Band 5 I ntensive Care Unit Quality I mprovement continues to be supported in the Trust's preceptorship programme. New preceptees come into the hospital with fresh eyes, energy and new ideas that encourage staff to think differently and challenge the way they work. The preceptees may not fee l that they have the skills to challenge or to suggest new innovations, yet they see problems and w ant to work on solutions. The precepte es have structured time around q uality improvement during their programme which allows the m to develop their ideas in a structured and supported environment. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 129 The preceptees present their projects to invited guests from the improvement network, senior nurses, line managers and to those staff helping with the transition and sustainability of the work. Examples of some of th e Improvement projects to be presented in the next month from the last two courses are: Standardised safety brief Names on theatre hats Pain management post laparoscopic gall bladder removal Patient information leaflet for vac dressing Redesign of daily we ight chart . The Leadership Talent Programme 2017/18 Lead has continued to be the main in -house leadership development programme and has been extended to Band 4 and Band 3 colleagues. This is in line with our leadership ethos that leadership is for everyo ne and the programme continues to focus around leadership behaviours, impact, choices and coaching. The impact of the in -house leadership programme for colleagues and for the Trust continues to be monitored by Pulse Check and at the end of 2017 (quarter 3 ) the leadership capability measure was 73.9%. The provision of a leadership development programme is currently being reviewed along with the values and behaviours. The revised leadership development programme will continue to build on the work of previou s years and will strive to ensure we continue to enable colleagues to be the best they can be now and in the future.

Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 133 ANNEXES Annex 1: Statements from Stakeholders NHS S omerset Clinical Commissioning Group Report As Lead Commissioner, NHS Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) has monitored the safety, effectiveness and patient experience of health services at Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust 2017/18. The Trust has engaged with the CCG in t he quality contract monitoring process to provide the basis for the CCG to comment on the Quality Account including the Trust performance against Quality Improvement priorities and the quality of data included. From the data supplied the CCG can confirm t he Quality Account appears materially correct. The CCG congratulates the Trust on its Care Quality Commission (CQC) overall rating of \"Good\" when it was inspected in August 2017 with outstanding in the Caring domain. The CCG notes the Trust is undertakin g improvements to improve their performance on the safe domain. The old buildings at Musgrove Park has been an ongoing challenge so it was good news that in March 018 the Trust was given the go ahead from the Department of Health and Social Care for the de velopment of state -of-the-art theatres, a Critical Care Unit and Endoscopy Suite. It will replace most of the ageing 1940s buildings that currently provide care for some of the most critically ill patients. It is expected that patients could be operated on and cared for in a new \u00a379.5 million surgical centre by the end of 2023. In 2017 Musgrove Park Hospital and Somerset Partnership - the NHS provider for mental health and community services - joined forces to provide more seamless care for local people. The Boards at Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (Musgrove Park) and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust have agreed a formal collaboration and have created one joint executive management team with a single Chief Executive to oversee the coll aborative working and provide seamless care for patients. The collaboration has enabled a wider review of the workforce challenges in Somerset with significant registered staff vacancies and wider opportunities for staff retention. Quality Improvements 20 17/18 The Trust welcomes assurance visits from the CCG and encourages attendance at their meetings including the Trust internal Quality Assurance Committee meeting. During 2017/18 the CCG visited the Accident and Emergency Department (ED) and found the de partment to be effectively managed with good links and escalation processes linked to the wider hospital including a well -run and Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 134 GP lead minor illness service, with good links to the out of hour's service. We have in addition visited the Intensive Care Un it and reviewed care of patients who have had long waits for treatment. The Trust has launched numerous quality improvements which have improved patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient's experience. The CCG in particular notes the Integrated F ront Door (IFD) approach which is performing well and through its practice is encouraging collaborative working across the Health and Social Care Community across Somerset. The Trust was ranked 38 out of 137 trusts for December's 2017 4 -hour A&E performanc e (patients seen, treated, and admitted or discharged in under four hours from arrival at the ED front door) with the Trust seeing a 15.1% increase in emergency admissions via the Emergency Department, relative to the same month in 2016 before the IFD was implemented. In continuance of its collaborative working the Trust has worked well with commissioners and other stakeholders at implementing the National Home First discharge project which in Somerset is funded through the Joint Commissioning Board (Somer set Local Authority and the CCG). The Trust has reported 429 patients have used the Home First service from their hospital site with the average age of the service user having the benefit of this extra support on discharge, being 86 years. The Trust is a one of 16 NHS national Digital Exemplar sites delivering exceptional care, efficiently, through the use of world -class digital technology and information. Exemplars are sharing their learning and experiences to enable other trusts to follow in their foots teps as quickly and effectively as possible. All Acute Digital Exemplars are now partnered with fast followers - trusts who will support the spread of best practice and innovation. Patient Safety The Trust continues to work closely with the CCG and other stakeholders in Somerset to improve infection control and prevention with shared learning. The Trust aim was to have no Methicillin -Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA - bacteria) Trust -apportioned bloodstream infections but unfortunately had three cases in 2017/18. Multi -disciplinary reviews identified improvements for MRSA screening and checking for any previous history of MRSA on admission. Musgrove Park Hospital continues to drive quality improvements to reduce the number of Clostridium difficile cas es by completing Post Infection Reviews to determine whether there were any lapses in care that could have contributed and to identify learning. The reviews are then validated by the CCG and used for learning across the County. In 2017/18 there were 15 Tru st attributed cases with 3 Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 135 of the cases suggesting a lapse in care which the Trust addressed by implementing a change in the environmental cleaning system. The Trust is to be congratulated on achieving above the National standard for assessing patients on admission for the risk of blood clots performing a fundamental principle in keeping our patient safe. There have been 8 Serious Incidents reported in the year by Musgrove Park Hospital. Two of the incidents are to be requested to be downgraded because following investigation one incident does not meet the criteria for a Serious Incident. The second incident to be removed was a suicide of a staff member, this has been reported by another Trust and it has been agreed the reports will be amalgamated and lea rning shared across both Trusts. There have been two Never Events recorded during the period, a Retained guidewire and Cross -matching error - this Serious incident was attributable to the Laboratory and was recorded by Musgrove but the incident is not at tributable to the Trust. There have been no reoccurring themes identified during the period. Clinical Effectiveness The Trust performed well against the cancer target 31 -day decision to treat to treatment waiting time standards, achieving the target for the year as a whole and in most months of the year. The 62 -day wait from referral to treatment, for patients referred by one of the three national screening programmes (breast, cervical and bowel) was also achieved for the year as a whole and in most month s of the year. It underperformed against three of the cancer performance targets; 2 -week wait targets for 'symptomatic' breast patients (where cancer is not suspected) and for patients referred by the GP with a suspected cancer, and for the 62 -day wait fro m referral by a GP with a suspected cancer, to treatment. The Trust has put in place a Cancer Improvement Plan to improve its performance and is working with the Cancer Alliance across the South West to help drive improvement in performance for its cancer patients. The Mortality Surveillance Group (MSG) now meets monthly following national guidance to review deaths, establish if avoidable, identify learning, initiate investigation if significant concerns and cascade learning to Trust staff. The MSG have r eviewed 532 deaths 2017/18 with 3 full investigations for lapses in care completed and learning identified. Patient Experience The CCG congratulates the Trust on their CQC (Care Quality Commission) Inspection 2017 feedback which noted the Trust had enga gement with the Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 136 patients, carers, public, staff and stakeholders. In particular, noting the urgent and emergency department which valued feedback from patients and also surgery with positive Friends and Family test results. This reinforced the Trust Qualit y Improvement venture of the Integrated Front Door (IFD); following a Trust survey on patients experience the results: 46% said they were seen and treated more quickly through the IFD than their previous service experience 36% said both times they exper ienced very good service 15% said they received the same level of service with the IFD as before The Trust received positive publicity in January 2018 when it was named as the second best hospital in England for its healthy food and drink by the Health Business magazine. A Trust inpatient survey June 2017 showed 94.7% of the patients received the help they needed with eating which is a good performance although did decline to 66% in September 2017. The Trust has improved its performance on its Patient Led Assessments on the care environment (PLACE) which is a system for assessing the quality of the hospital environment with exception to the lower than national score for facilities. Best performing areas included cleanliness which scored 99% and also imp roved scores from 79% to 86% for Dementia and 79% to 88% for disability. The Trust is to be credited for its collaboration with ten other Trusts to implement real time measurement of patient experience which will bring an added patient voice to patient e xperience using its services and from this lead improvements and innovation across its services.

Sandra Corry, director of quality, safe ty and engagement Healthwatch Somerset's Response to Taunton & Somerset NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account 2017 /18 Introduction Healthwatch Somerset welcomes the opportunity to comment on the draft Taunton & Somerset NHS Founda tion Trust Quality Accou nt 2017/ 18. Somerset Healthwatch exists to promote the voice of patients and the wider public with respect to health and social care s ervices. As of 1st October 2017 , Healthwatch Somerset came under new management and are therefore are unable to comment on the previous year's activity as it relates to work carried out under the previous Healthwatch Somerset contract. Although Healthwatch Somerset has not been directly involved in the development of quality priorities this year, we note that the topics we re developed through wide consultation with staff, governors and patient representative groups. This included quarterly meetings with Healthwatch Somerset to review progress against the individual quality improvement priorities. As in previous years the pr iorities were based on the Trust's review of quality performance and the identification of areas for improvement. Priority Areas Our comments on the six quality improvement priorities for 2018/ 19 are: Learning from deaths We support action by the Trust to reduce the number of preventable patient deaths whilst in hospital. Learning from deaths is a key priority to help improve care and ensure patient safety within Musgrove Park Hospital. We note that mortality data is used to aid learning within the Trust and to identify those areas where care has been inadequate. We commend proposed action by the Mortality Surveillance Group to monitor patient outcomes and ensure clinically effective care, and to ensure that the systems to review deaths are fit for purpo se. We also commend any action taken to ensure that the outcomes of any investigation, including action to improve procedures, are shared with patients and their relatives. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 138 Safer care Patient safety has to be a key priority in any hospital and we full y support action to reduce avoidable harm across Musgrove Park Hospital. This includes a sustained improvement in sepsis management, a reduction in the incidence of hospital acquired infection, a reduction in the number of falls, and a reduction in the incidence hospital acquired pressure ulcers which we know has been one of the key safety priorities at the Trust for several years. Mental health and holistic care We know that the benefits of integrated care across boundaries (health, social care, employme nt and housing) are understood. However, integrated care for people mental health conditions is often the exception rather than the rule. This can lead to poor patient experience and reduced quality of care. We note that a priority for the Trust is to inc rease the capability of staff to recognise and respond to those patients with mental health needs (children, adults in crisis and older people). The Trust's developing partnership with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust should mean closer working be tween physical and mental health care services and a greater opportunity for better mental health training for hospital staff. Patient experience We note that the Trust is committed to providing the best possible patient experience and is always looking f or ways to improve that experience for both inpatients and outpatients. This area has always been a priority and it is essential that patients, carers and members of the public are treated as equal partners and have confidence that their feedback is listen ed to and has led to improved services. We commend action by the Trust to form partnership working initiatives to bring staff and users together and to monitor the effectiveness of these initiatives. Right care, right time, right place This captures on e of the Trust's key initiatives that focuses on ensuring patients receive the best possible care, in the most appropriate place and at the right time. This alongside a drive to improve discharge arrangements, end of life care measures, and in personalised care planning. We commend action to strengthen collaborative working across the health and social care system to deliver sustainable improvements in care. Key to these improvements is to equip staff with the necessary skills and experience to cope with t he heavy demands and pressures placed upon them. Staff Retention and Wellbeing We commend proposed action by the Trust to support, encourage and develop staff - whether new or existing staff. With workforce supply an ongoing challenge, Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Qua lity Account 2017 -18 139 it is important th at the health, safety and wellbeing of staff is given a high priority and that all is done to encourage their retention. Summary Overall, we feel that this is a balanced report covering both past performance and proposals for future priorities. We look fo rward to working with the Trust over the coming year to ensure that the experiences of patients, their families and carers are heard and taken seriously. Governors Report A large organisation depends entirely on its people. How every individual member is motivated to do their job even better than before is crucial, and the performance of the staff at MPH during a year of increasing demand has been quite exceptional. At every level staff have gone above and beyond what is normally expected of them and this level of performance and commitment has been widely commented on by patients, carers and visitors. Having said this , of course governors are acutely aware of the difficulty of recruiting and retaining high calibre staff in all areas of the hospital. Quite rightly the report emphasises the challenge of overcoming retention problems which are national and departmental. The reputation of the hospital, both nationally and locally, will be a huge benefit in this area. Governors have been emphasising the import ance of staff training for mental health patients in all departments and it is therefore excellent to see the importance placed on this over the coming year. Although this training would normally be expected to concentrate on adults and the elderly, it is absolutely vital that the mental health of the under 18 group of patients should be included at every level. The closer cooperation between Musgrove Park Hospital (Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust) and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust will definitely help with this and governors look forward to seei ng how the Psychiatric Liaison T eam begin their important work. The alliance with Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has also facilitated joint working to improve the patient journey in key areas, particularly the excellent work to reduce delayed transfers of care such as the Home First initiative. The Governors' Patient Care Group continues to monitor a number of projects relating to improving discharge, promoting independence of patien ts and tackling complex end of life care issues. The Group has had regular updates from the Older Persons Assessment and Liaison OPAL service, the Joint Emergency Therapy Team (JETT) and the End of Life Care team, all of which are rightly highlighted in the Quality Account. Quality Account Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Report and Accounts and Quality Account 2017/18 140 The Integrated Front Door is another excellent example of the way in which the hospital is working to make the patient pathway much smoother, starting from the Emergency Department and then filtering through into other departments. Governors are keen to watch how this progresses throughout the year and anticipate considerable improvement in the experience of many patients. In addition to these exciting developments, the Patient Care Group also monitors key metrics that demonstrate the safety of care. As detailed in the Quality Accounts, safety priorities include falls, pressure ulcers, infection control and sepsis; these are all areas that the Group has discussed in detail, offering supportive challenge and trying to get a greater unde rstanding of the issues where we can.
