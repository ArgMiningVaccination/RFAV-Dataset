Through Applied Kinesiology, Adolf can test for muscle imbalance, food allergies, infections, chemical toxicities, and nutritional deficiencies. This holistic method can identify muscles which aren't firing and why, enabling a rebalance the musculoskeletal system by \"turning on\" the muscles that aren't firing.

Craniosacral Therapy is a gentle, but powerful hands-on healing system based on the subtle movement of the cranial bones and sacrum in response to the pumping of cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid, considered \"liquid light\", is the first recipient of Divine Intelligence in the body. Potentization of cerebrospinal fluid by Divine Intelligence generates an electromagnetic matrix that organizes the body structure. Craniosacral Therapy facilitates the flow of potentization to every cell in the body. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system and allows the client to go into a deep, body-centered meditation where profound healing can occur. Activated through gentle touch, it facilitates the unwinding of deep facial structures. Fascia is a whole body integrated tissue that holds the memory of trauma, conditioning, and stress. By releasing fascia patterns, the movement is restored, pain is relieved, emotions are cleared, the nervous system is rebalanced and Spiritual energies are reintegrated. Craniosacral Therapy can be effective in alleviating: chronic musculoskeletal pain unresponsive to other therapies; whiplash; heart injuries; birth trauma; emotional dysfunction; stress related symptoms; adrenal depletion/imbalance; chronic fatigue and chemical sensitivity. In craniosacral therapy sessions, people experience deep relaxation, the release of pain patterns, postural realignment, greater ease of movement, profound emotional and spiritual healing.This email address is being protected from spambots.

When you are in good health the flow of Qi is smooth and uninterrupted, but when illness strikes this flow is disturbed. The practitioner will ask the patient a series of questions to establish patterns of health. The tongue will be examined and the pulse will be taken. Traditional Chinese Medicine requires a full picture of the person in order for a diagnosis to be made, so each treatment is completely tailored to the individual, and the information gathered from the questions, tongue, and pulse will then be used to develop a treatment plan. Acupuncture is carried out by the insertion of sterile needles into points all over the body; in fact there over 360 points which the acupuncturist can use to tap into the meridians which flow around the body. By doing this, the acupuncturist encourages the Qi to flow more smoothly and the body's healing mechanism returns the body to a more balanced state of health and well- being. In addition to needling, a technique called Moxibustion may also be used.Moxibustion therapy involves burning dried Mugwort on particular points on the body. It plays an important role in traditional Chinese medicine, and is used to apply heat to the acupuncture points on the body. This is usually done by placing moxa on the needles once they have been inserted or by burning cigar- shaped moxa sticks over the skin.This email address is being protected from spambots.

Born in the deep jungle of Lampung in 1981, he came from a traditional healer lineage connected to the nature and wildlife of Sumatra island. Being chosen as a healer from a young age, he dedicated himself to be in the service of his village's people. Everything he learned was passed on to him from his grandfather, the legendary elderly healer Datuk Raja Jaksa. In his late teens, he made a big decision - he wanted to be a painter. So, he paused his journey to become a healer to focus on finding himself and fulfilling his dream of becoming an artist. He started the path of teaching himself through exploring a wide variety of artistic expressions such as drawing, painting, sculpture and music. Along the way he found his voice and became successful in international art scenes for his musical talents. Over a 20 year journey of self-development, Agustin claimed back his legacy as a healer and began using sound to heal others.

Using this combination, he can draw an overall picture of your health, taking in the various factors which combine to impact your present condition. By listening to your symptoms, reading your face and energy in general, and tuning into your auric field, all the needed information can be gathered to give a very good picture of your present condition. The health assessment can reveal whether your body carries any of the common parasites, bacteria, viruses, fungi and yeasts that may adversely affect your health; it can also reveal the health condition of your internal organs and hormonal glands, the level of heavy metal in your body, the acidity and many other factors. We can also focus on specific health issues that you would like to address.This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. The goal of these sessions is to move qi in the body. For this to be possible your breath has to be somewhat open. This means that when you inhale you can connect with your body, and when you exhale you can release the built-up tension. As simple as this may sound, many people are not connected to their bodies. The main reason is past trauma that never got properly released from the system. Getting Qi to move and flow can be very physical, demanding, and delicate at the same time, or the work could be based upon using a gentler approach like pranic healing to move the energy within your system. Your body will show how that energy could be moved. The sessions are deeply experiential and difficult to express in words. They can have a much greater impact on you than what you would normally experience. Releasing old stagnant energy and opening up the system may bring about profound changes within you and in your reflection that is your external reality.This email address is being protected from spambots.

Originally invented by Dr. Royal Raymond Rife, a Rife machine is a device that delivers a low energy electromagnetic frequency into the body, usually through the hands or feet. In his research period, Dr. Rife discovered that every virus, bacteria, parasite, or other pathogen is particularly sensitive to specific frequencies of sound and that they can be destroyed by intensifying a specific frequency. \"Bacteria, viruses, and other organisms living in your body have their unique resonant frequency. You can tackle them by using the same vibration.\" A Rife machine works by finding the frequency of a specific condition. An impulse of the same frequency is then used to kill or disable the diseased cells with the goal of healing the condition. Important: Like many alternative healing modalities, The FDA has not approved the Rife machine for any use. There is no proof that the device can treat cancer or other diseases. Let it be known that there are no documented health risks associated with the Rife machine. This is because the energy waves they use have a very low frequency. The frequency is lower than that of waves emitted by cell phones. However, opting for alternative therapy with the Rife machine in lieu of regular medical care may be harmful to your health and you should always explore both channels of care Esoteric Acupuncture is a unique synthesis of sacred geometry and power acupuncture points into a grids system for the purpose of expanding consciousness as founded by Dr. Mikio Sankey. It combines several systems of energy medicine. Ayurvedic Medicine from India, the oldest documented system of medicine in the world, describes a system of energy centers in the body called Chakras. Encoding Patterns or the Chakra Balancing Patterns, are created by using an acupuncture needle in the exact sequence that is given for each pattern. The biggest distinction between Esoteric Acupuncture and other types of Acupuncture is while other acupuncture practices are mostly for therapeutic and treatment purposes, Esoteric Acupuncture is more prevention and wellness-oriented. It aims to prevent the need for any treatment by taking care of the overall health and wellbeing of the body in advance. This is done by clearing the Chakras to keep them open, balanced, and energetically aligned.This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. Growing up in Vienna, Hubert was studying architecture when injuries and life signals awakened his spiritual calling to find healing. He began to study complementary medicine, became a yoga teacher, nuad-practitioner, got the reiki master but still felt the desire to dive deeper. He went to South America to live with shamans for a year and started to travel more and more to places of old knowledge in order to learn what all these different teaching have in common. Believing that once we let go, everything falls back into its natural place, our cells in the body, the flow in life, the people we meet and the happiness we experience, he thinks its good to get aware when we hold on and practice letting go. His today's work is inspired by tools he learnt and spiritual practices he uses. In single sessions he loves to work with the inversion therapy \"Hangab\", were letting go can be experiences in the old medicine of hanging upside down. He also works with forgiveness and singing, as both are wonderful tools of letting go. The old knowledge of forgiving is very powerful to clear our present and past. Studying Hawaiian Ho\u00b4oponopono and the Indian Pratikraman, Hubert presents both tools for a deeper understanding. Singing is good to open ourselves, accept who we are and allow to be new in every moment.This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. In an Inversion Bodywork session a client is slowly, in stages, lifted upside-down. This gives the body time to adjust to the inversion process, preventing any uncomfortable pressure in the head, resulting in a feeling of floating, flying and well-being. The benefits are many: letting go, deep relaxation, regenerating of the discs and joints, alignment, releasing of pain, trauma and emotions, activating the power of self-healing, a reset of the body and energy system. Hanging upside down is an ancient yoga practice. In fact many civilisations around the world have used upside down hanging because of its powerful body-mind benefits. In an Inversion Bodywork session, the key is to go up as slow as possible, so from a lying position, at first only the legs are lifted, we give a brief introduction and help to tune in. Then we lift the pelvis off the ground and go further up in stages. The time it takes to ascend can range from 20 to 25 minutes, which is the ideal pace for the body to adjust to each stage of the inversion process. You receive hands on bodywork, a treatment which allows you to release, let go and enter a deep relaxation with the sensation of flying and well-being. The spinal traction and the benefits of the inversion lead the body into a renewing process, while the mind clears out and drops into a deep meditative state, called the still-point (a pause in the cranial rhythm). With lifts, swings, and energy work, we support as we flow into various body positions. In the first Session option we go up until shoulderstand (shoulders and head still on the ground). In the second option we go all the way into Flying-Savansana (of course you can always say stop and we descend). In both session scenarios, emotions and tensions can be released. You will land in a centered and peaceful place within. The only contra-indication is high eye pressure (people who have it know it) and for women during menstruation. Please bring warm socks (if you have), comfortable clothes and an intention (maybe something you wish to let go of).This email address is being protected from spambots.

In its essence, Ho\u00b4opononpono means to correct things, whether it is the relationship to others or to oneself. In India, you can find a similar practice of forgiveness called \"Pratikraman''. Any hurts from the past or present can be cleaned with the appropriate viewpoint and the use of a few simple words. This technique can release blocked emotions, solve conflicts and heal relations. It can even help us let go of our judgments and become more at peace with ourselves and the world around us. In a coaching session, we will bring awareness to your individual story, assess the present situation and engage in what many consider the most impactful self-improvement work available.This email address is being protected from spambots.

Born in Toronto, Lawrence now calls Bali home after extensive travels and studies in China, Russia, Hong Kong, Europe, and North America. Lawrence's healing journey has taken him through a range of disciplines. He completed craniosacral work levels 1-6 (twice) under Hugh Milne, immersed himself in the teachings of Leonid Sobolev and Ellen Heed, and accomplished a 200-hour somatics training with Tara Judelle and Dr. Scott Lyons. His path has also led him through advanced teacher trainings with Ana Forrest, and he is a certified Anusara yoga teacher. Lawrence's varied experiences culminated in the completion of the Landmark Introduction Leaders Program, solidifying his holistic approach to healing. His healing philosophy is built on creating a safe environment where clients can allow their bodies to heal in a parasympathetic state. He believes in paying attention to the intuitive messages of the body, giving a voice to the subconscious, and understanding the heart's poetic language of metaphor and spirituality. His practices are as much about anatomical landmarks as they are about poetic and spiritual dialogue. For over 17 years, Lawrence has specialized as a coach and yoga teacher. He is a facilitator of emotional release, helping people to overcome fears, move forward, and manifest their goals. His techniques incorporate breathing exercises, hands-on adjustments, and communication strategies, all aimed at establishing deep connections with his clients. Lawrence has been practicing craniosacral therapy for 12 years, integrating this gentle technique into his yoga practice and teaching. One of his most memorable healing experiences involved a student suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, who, after working with Lawrence, was able to conceive. This success story epitomizes Lawrence's belief in the transformative power of holistic healing practices. Lawrence is affiliated with various professional organizations, including the Yoga Alliance, Anusara, and Prana Yoga. These affiliations affirm his commitment to professional development and maintaining high standards in his practice. Craniosacral therapy, Lawrence believes, is not just a healing technique, but a way of life. It allows him to set aside his ego and bring his complete focus to his clients, fostering a sense of groundedness and contentment that pervades all aspects of his life. Outside of his healing work, Lawrence is a poet, a writer, and a performer. He is passionate about somatics and the body's ability to hold invaluable information. Lawrence's vision for his healing practice is to share the power of the parasympathetic nervous system in both healing and learning. He sees it as a bridge from the body to the mind and vice versa\u2014a bridge we often overlook, which he refers to as energy, or spirit. Through his work, Lawrence hopes to help others understand this bridge and tap into their own healing potential.This email address is being protected from spambots.

The primary aim of this therapeutic approach is to relieve tension in the central nervous system and promote a feeling of well-being by improving the body's ability to self-care. CST was developed from the principles of osteopathy and is based on the concept that our bodies have a natural, rhythmic tide-like motion, known as the \"craniosacral rhythm,\" fundamental to our health. This rhythm is created by the production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid within the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. During a CST session, the practitioner uses a light touch - often no heavier than the weight of a nickel - to palpate the body and sense disturbances in the craniosacral rhythm. A practitioner can identify areas of restriction or tension in key areas such as the hips, psoas muscles, lower back, shoulders, diaphragm, heart region, jaw, and neck. CST specifically targets these areas to alleviate and release tension, helping to restore the natural rhythm and improve overall health. CST also involves unwinding the tension in the muscle tissue - often referred to as the \"webbing\" of the body. This gentle release can have a profound impact on the body's overall tension and functioning, allowing for greater freedom of movement and fluidity. The release of physical tension can facilitate a more efficient flow of electricity and energy throughout the body, promoting overall well-being and vitality. A key component of CST is verbal therapy, which involves the practitioner guiding the client through dialogues or inquiries designed to surface and address underlying emotional, psychological, and spiritual issues. This approach helps facilitate the release of subconscious blockages, further supporting the body's innate healing capabilities. This element of CST therapy makes it a holistic therapy, targeting not just the physical, but also the emotional and mental well-being of the client. Conditions that may benefit from CST include migraines, chronic neck and back pain, stress and tension-related disorders, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, chronic fatigue, and many others.This email address is being protected from spambots.

He worked as an activity leader in a retirement home, where he introduced residents to meditation using tools such as Tibetan bowls and essential oils. After a temporary return to his former job as an electrician, Luca made a decisive decision: he followed his heart and gave up everything to devote himself entirely to his new vocation in healthcare.

Coming from two different cultures, Serbian and French, I was fortunate to have access to different ways of treating the diseases with magnetism and natural remedies. This allowed me to be awake to the natural way of healing at a very young age. In 2011, I decided to study osteopathy which allowed me to learn the art of manual therapies and the mysteries of the human body to adjust the physiological system of him. During my studies, I discovered that body and mind were totally connected and manual therapy could work on different plans (bio mechanic, organic and visceral, cranial/sacral therapy, psychosomatique, energetic, fascial..). During my graduate school, I have learned occidental medicine notions but also oriental ones, like reflexology, iridology, massage and fascia therapy or Chinese medicine. Thanks to that knowledge, I am able to easily diagnose the origin of unbalanced people's bodies. After my certification, I learned a lot about psycho-somatique and the power of mind on the body. For me, everything is connected, so we need to work on different levels to improve the healing process. Not only physically, but also psychologically and emotionally. With my experience and my many travels, I was able to develop my own way of healing that's an body harmonization, based on the bio mechanical and bio dynamic principles of osteopathy, psycho somatique knowledge, the energy notion of oriental medicine and my own intuition. In 2022, I was looking for a place with high energy frequencies to improve my treatments and give the best result to my patients. Coming to Bali, I found a Yoga Barn and I fell in love with the power of that place I have been looking for.This email address is being protected from spambots.

It's a manual therapy that aims to improve the health across all body systems by manipulating and strengthening the musculoskeletal framework focusing on joints, muscles, fascias, spine, visceral/ organic system, cranial-sacral axes.. There are a lot of possibilities to do an osteopathic treatment. Generally, during a treatment, we look for what causes the pain or the organic disorder. It's the fundamental Principle of osteopathy. So, because of that body research, we can diagnose with our hands and with a medical test what is the postural topography of the body. By observing the muscle and fascia chains, the connection between organs/viscera and spine, the neural transmission which connects all the body; we can understand that everything is linked and the pain is the manifestation of a surcharging of information by the body.This email address is being protected from spambots.

Healing relationships with parents, current partner or ex-partner(s), child/children, inner child, ancestors is a transformational experience. Among all these relationships, the most important one is your relationship with your parents. It doesn't matter whether they are alive or not, whether you are living with them or you are maintaining a distance from them, the relationship with your parents determines your relationship with everybody else. If someone has an unsettled relationship with the mother, they might go through needless obstacles or have health issues. If someone has an unsettled relationship with the father, they might go through financial problems. If any one of these relationships is not alright, then the whole experience of life itself is not alright and life becomes divisive and perceptions begin to get distorted. Many people believe that the best way to deal with a relationship or heal a relationship is to cut that relationship off. But being physically separate doesn't heal the relationship or its impact on you. Your parents don't live outside of you, they live inside you and you live inside of them. There is a powerful and effective way to heal any relationship and to allow for forgiveness to fully take place.This email address is being protected from spambots.

Theta is not about spiritual bypassing, or seeking fleeting, transcendent, peak experiences - it is about embodied presence, grounded spirituality and lasting, practical change - whether you seek to change habits, lose weight, change your life's direction or find a new relationship. We are unknowingly run by our traumas and familial patterns - Theta works by connecting dots between events, moments, people and behaviours, and then freeing us to to create new and healthy stories. Our old stories are often fused with our identity, and we feel defined by our history. Theta Healing works with feelings, not stories, for a different outcome.

At first, unsure about how to manage his ability he started working with local friends to practice and understand his healing powers. Healing runs through his family lineage so he knew he had the ability to help others but it wasn't until a Balinese High Priest saw his potential that Wayan began his own true journey. Throwing himself into education, he met his guru whilst studying the Education of Hindu Religion in Lombok. Under his guidance Wayan learnt how to channel his energy into a healing capacity. Deepening his knowledge of metaphysical, ancestral, and natural energy, as well as energy channels known in Bali as Sapta loka (from earth up) and Sapta patala (from the ground down). He is experienced in scanning the physical body, reading the body's energy and chakra balancing through the use of his intuition and his super sensitive touch. After his studies took him to India to dive deeper into Ayurveda, yoga, energy work and philosophy, Wayan returned home to Bali where he graduated from a Masters in Philosophy and Science of Hindu Religion from Denpasar State Hindu Dharma Institute. His healings combine his passion and education across Yoga, Chakra Reading, and Hypnotherapy. Wayan is a true healer who is driven from his heart to help and heal others.This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. This is an intuitive, traditional Balinese approach to chakra healing to identify and heal blockages in the Chakras. Wayan uses his sensitivity to read and diagnose this energetic system of the subtle body, identifying whether there is underactive, overactive, balanced or blocked energy. Working through a three-step model, Wayan systemically opens communication with each chakra. At first, through the use of body scanning he can feel, scan and read the energy of the body to engage in dialogue and downloads from each chakra to understand what is needed. In this step ancestral, spiritual, and external energies are called in, if needed, to understand any issues that need to be healed. Then, his intuitive nature helps to discover the root of blockages. Lastly, he works with the birth name to allow trust and open communication to flow between healer and client. Wayan is able to connect deeply with the unique needs of everyone he works with. After these three steps have been completed, Wayan will fully explain the reading, identifying which chakras are blocked and how to encourage more balance throughout the system. A 60-minute session will involve a full chakra reading and, dependent on your unique reading, bespoke healing through crystals, psychic mediumship, sound healing and reflexology. The aim of all sessions is to achieve chakra balance. This treatment is great for gaining a deeper clarity and understanding in your relationship to Self, to help unlock your true potential, to heal deep-rooted emotions, and to relieve stress, anxiety, worry, and negative mindsets.This email address is being protected from spambots.

Please see our prices below: The Far-Infrared Sauna does not heat the air inside the sauna, instead, it warms the body from the inside out, using Far-Infrared Rays. The rays deeply penetrate the skin and dissolve harmful environmental toxins deep within the fat cells of the body. Raising the core temperature in the body causes sweating and a rise in heart rate and metabolism while the body works to cool itself down - resulting in calories being burnt. The sweat glands are one of the few mechanisms in the body to eliminate toxins and as the skin is the largest organ in the human body, sweating through the skin eliminates toxins in the cells fast. The Far-Infrared sauna is perfect for people who cannot tolerate the high temperatures of standard humid hot-air saunas.This email address is being protected from spambots.
