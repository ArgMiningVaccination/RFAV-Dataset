Now, drug companies have voluntarily decided to advise parents not to give these medicines to children under age 4. Science writer Erin Digitale asked Alan Greene, MD, clinical professor of pediatrics, to explain the changes. 1. Why did drug companies decide to advise parents against giving over-the-counter cold and cough medicines to children under 4? Greene: Perhaps they hope that this will prevent the FDA from taking stronger action. Whatever their reasons, I don't see this as a positive step for children's health. Instead, I agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics, many medical experts and many consumer advocates who support a complete ban on cold medicines for kids under age 6. These products have not been proven to be better than a placebo at treating cold symptoms at that age. In the absence of proven benefit, concern over their uncommon severe side effects becomes more important. 2. How can parents manage without these medicines? Greene: None of the over-the-counter decongestants, antihistamines or cough suppressants claims to shorten colds or make them milder; they just attack the symptoms. It's worth remembering that what we think of as cold symptoms are mostly tools the body uses to get rid of the virus. A low-grade fever is inhospitable to many viruses and activates our immune system. Congestion is the dilation of blood vessels, bringing needed supplies to the scene of the battle. Mucus traps virus particles and starts moving them away. Coughing and sneezing forcefully eject the virus from the body. Fatigue helps you get the rest you need to heal. 3. What can parents do to lessen cold symptoms without these medications? Greene: The goal is to gently do what it takes to make a child comfortable while the body does its healing work. For a cough, one option is a spoonful of dark honey for children older than 1 year. Unlike over-the-counter cough suppressants, recent research suggests it works better than placebo. I'm also a fan of cough drops for kids who are old enough where choking is not an issue. They stimulate more saliva production, which could reduce cough and sore throat and bring more antibodies to the scene. Heated humidified air (steam from a shower, vaporizer, or humidifier) could be a good option. Of six controlled studies, three showed benefit and none showed worse symptoms. The key is to make sure, though, the source of the heat is not something the child could get into and get burned. Spraying saline into the nose has been shown to relieve pain and congestion in a number of studies. You can find saline sprays in the drugstore. All of these remedies have better risk-benefit ratios than the OTC remedies being questioned. 4. What do you think about using cough or cold medicines or antihistamines to help a sick child sleep? Greene: Evidence is scarce that the drowsy preparations help children with colds sleep better. I favor chamomile tea, warm milk, a warm bath and perhaps giving extract of valerian root to help children sleep. Valerian is a gentle, time-tested herbal remedy. There have been 11 clinical trials showing it to be safe and effective, but only one of these was in children. The kids taking valerian fell asleep faster, slept better, slept longer and woke less often. There were no adverse effects reported. 5. The FDA may be reluctant to completely ban children's cold medicines because parents might use adult cold medicines for their kids. What's your perspective? Greene: I understand their concern, but I think that leaving these products on the shelves communicates the wrong idea that the FDA thinks they are good solutions for children under 6. I'd rather see the ban take effect, and warning labels on adult products.
